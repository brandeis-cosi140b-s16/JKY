First time to the place & it is an Awesome place for breakfast.  We ordered machca & eggs.  The corn tortillas were soft & warm, the rice was a little dry, the beans were flavorful & the machaca was full of veggies, beef & flavor. It wasn't soggy or greasy & the veggies were cooked just right.  

Only giving 4 stars since this is our first visit but we will certainly be back.
