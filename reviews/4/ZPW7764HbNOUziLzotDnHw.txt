I have had Doce Taqueria bookmarked for some time now, but how often do you go out of your way for street tacos?  However, after attending a 9 PM show at City Theater, I wanted a light snack and discussion time with friends.

This place is simple and good.  There are five kinds of tacos (flour or corn), nachos, and maybe taco salad?  Seating is counter-style, and there are only about nine seats. However, we snagged the last three seats on a Saturday night at 10:45 PM.

I ordered a Carnitas taco on a flour tortilla ($3).  While not my favorite taco of all time, the pork was tender and good, albeit very mild.  However, they have plenty of hot sauce on the counters to spice things up.  

If this place is on your way somewhere, it is worth a stop.
