Outstanding "fast food" mexican restaurant. Two words, beef tacos. The tortillas are like something out of a story book. Their sauces are delicious. Good amount of meat and cheese and soooo mouthwatering. Grew up right down the street from this place so I have many friends that have been there and they all absolutely love it. Get a breakfast burro in the morning and taco's for lunch and be happy to go back for dinner. If you're not eating at senor taco or la fonda's in scottsdale you're missing out on very good cheap mexican food.
