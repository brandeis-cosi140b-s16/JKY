The El Sonora Snack Shack is delicious! I used to live on the west side and could find a place to get a tosti-loco or a tosti-cuedito pretty much anywhere. Here in the east valley though, nope. That is until this wonderful little gem opened up and now I can get them right here in the QC. Not only that but they have food. Bomb food! Try a sonoran hot dog made right and you're welcome! My daughter had tacos and my wife had the fruit "pico de gallo". We scarffed it all up!  The aguas are real and fresh. Not the filibertos powdered kind. I've had the melon and jamaica. Both delicious. They have shaved ice and I've cream too. I could go on and on about the food and snacks. The owners are wonderful and super attentive. They will literally go through the whole menu for you. So if you don't know what something is, ask, they're very friendly. I really can't say enough good things about this place. It's a great snack shop!
