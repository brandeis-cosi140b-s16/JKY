My sister had a Vegas destination wedding last summer and we had a big group dinner here on a Friday night. We were a group of about 35-40 in the back half of the restaurant with three long tables. It was amazing. The food, service and atmosphere were incredible.  The guacamole was absolutely incredible. The steak in the tacos was seasoned perfectly. I can't remember what I had for dessert but I'm sure it was equally amazing. 

They had salsa music blasting and my crazy Cuban family of course had to get up and salsa dance. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good affordable Mexican food on the strip. 

Who knows when or if I will be back to Vegas but if I do, I will be returning here!
