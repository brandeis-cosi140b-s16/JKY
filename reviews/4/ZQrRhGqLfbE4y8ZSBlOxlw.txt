This must be our 25th visit here. My wife and I love this place. The food is good and reasonably priced. They do have a few unusual items on the menu ( cerviche and grilled cactus plus a few more). The service overall is good. Having been here so many times we have had a couple of visits where the service has been less than good, but that is not the norm. Come try it,  you will be glad you did
