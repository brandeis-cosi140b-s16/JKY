The best place to get out of a bind when you're on the road and want to eat healthy!  I eat here all the time and appreciate the fresh food.  I recently found out Chipotle is owned my McDonalds (I only heard but haven't verified) which I thought was interesting.  Nonetheless, the food is always great.  They recently added brown rice which is a big win for me on the battle of the bulge front.  I also really like the corn pico de gallo they have.  Gives everything a sweet touch.
