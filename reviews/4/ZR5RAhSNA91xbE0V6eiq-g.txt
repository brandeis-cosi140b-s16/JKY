Get your head out of the gutter. Fuzzy's is a relatively new spot to Madison. Tough to get to if you're a college student without a car, but the trip is worth it. It's a great spot if you're looking for something light and fresh. 

I usually go with either the fish or shrimp tacos, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a signed picture of Steve Stricker on the wall, which is a definite plus in my book. 

It's a spot I will continue to frequent.
