My first time here. I got a $20 coupon in the mail, so I figured eh, free meal. I went here with my boyfriend and we were instantly greeted with friendliness from the staff. We ate at the bar and our bartender, Nate, couldn't have been more pleasant. He was chatty while still paying attention to all the other customers. Service was quick and the food was great! My boyfriend had the meatloaf - DAMN! That's some good shit. Even the rice and beans tasted unusual. I can always appreciate when a restaurant attempts to make ordinary, normal Mexican side dishes taste spectacular. It was truly a savory dish. I had the Tomatillo Salad with carne asada, it was very delicious. But honestly it paled in comparison to my boyfriend's meatloaf. I wanted to eat his entire meal!

Overall, great first impression. We'll be back.
