Driving home and was feelling mexican food.. Look to the right,  Oh whadda ya know.. There it was! Parking front and center, Nice! Greeted with grins from the staff upon entering through the front doors. Hostess sat us in no time and gave us the option: window or non-window seat. Whole place was scattered with x-mas lights, ribbons, ornaments.. In conjunction with their already decent decorated interior, the holiday theme just set a nice warm tone.

Chips and salsa and bean dip!! Chips were typical but they threw in some green, red and some black chips in there.. I don't know about black but the green and red, X-mas Spirited Tortilla Chips! Oh, how creative.. Salsa was alright. But I've only been to a few places that served bean dip, which was great! And it tasted great as well!

El Burro: Carne Asada Burrito with Monterey Jack Cheese Melted on top, green chile and red chile both on the side. Also comes with rice, beans and salad. Diced pieces of meat that had some real authentic flavor to it! Combine a fork full of meat with the Monterey cheese and (I liked) the red sauce = Definitely up there for me! I really enjoyed it! Only thing was the Burrito looked pretty small  for the plate. Rice, Beans and Salad = No Complaints.

Chile Colorado: break-apart tender cubes of meat smothered in its red chile sauce (how its supposed to be and its not really spicy at all). Not a bad version of this dish, pretty tasty but more peppery than ones i've had before. Also came with beans, rice and salad (plus I opted for flour tortillas). 

* Staff were on top of their game: drinks were refilled quickly, server brought 2nd round of salsa and bean dip without asking and food was taken and served pronto..

Summary:
Service was on Target *Bullseye!*, Well Decorated, Price was a bit high for the portions given and the Food was a Solid 4 Stars!
