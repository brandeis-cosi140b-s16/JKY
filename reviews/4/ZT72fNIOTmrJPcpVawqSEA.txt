Stopped in during the lunch rush today, and it was packed! Seems word got out pretty quickly. However, the line moves fast, so you don't wait long. You start over on the opposite end of the cash register, order your tacos, move over and order your sides, bowls, etc., then pay. It's a fast and easy system.

Their salsa bar is awesome, with salsas and condiments to fit any taste. My only recommendation would be to put labels somehow on the salsas for those who don't know salsas and accidently dump the wrong kind on their food. For those of us who can tell them apart, you'll be fine.

Their beer taps aren't turned on yet, so if you want beer, they have bottles. You can also get mixed drinks later in the day (their manager said the bartender didn't come in until later).

The tacos are tasty, and if you don't like cilantro, onions and guacamole on them, tell them in advance. I wish they put a little more meat in them, but for $2.25 a taco, you can't go wrong.
