Holy giant portions!  My boyfriend and I split a plate and were still stuffed.  I ordered the combo plate #1 which came with Rolled cheese enchilada, tamale, relleno, taco, 
Hatch Valley chile con carne smothered with your choice of chile.  I am a wimp so I did not choose the hot chile.  Really good, except the taco...this was totally a ground beef taco...yucky...but the rest of the food on the plate made up for that taco.  They do charge 2.95 for sharing but it is worth it because I don't see how anyone could finish a plate on their own.  They have such an assortment of flavors with their chips and salsa.  It comes with bean dip, green salsa, red salsa and a ranch type of dip.  All were quite tasty.  The best part is that the meal comes with sopapillas!  YUMMY.  They were delish.  They just need to get rid of that ground beef taco and replace that with some good ol shredded beef, that was the only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars.
