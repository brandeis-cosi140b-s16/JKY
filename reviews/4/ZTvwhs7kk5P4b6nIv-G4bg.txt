I love Mexican food! And Tamales Guadalajara is another reason why. It's not just another ordinary beans and rice kind of place.

A co-worker and I had lunch here today based on what I had seen on Yelp! and it was very close to my mechanics shop where I was picking up my car. My co-worker is a closet foodie.

Some of the reviews here mentioned the salsa. Again, nothing ordinary about something as commonplace as salsa. It's not red. It's not green. It's delicious! Clearly homemade with some peppers I'm not familiar with.

I ordered the Machaca and it was outstanding! Did I mention homemade yet? The homemade refried beans were also wonderful with the chips. My company may have only ordered a burrito, but he enjoyed everything about his meal and was ready for a siesta afterwards.

I would love to come back sometime when it's not so hot and sit on the really nice rear patio that I saw and enjoy a cerveza. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the iced tea (only sweet tea is available) tastes an awful lot like Lipton instant tea.  Otherwise, this restaurant is more proof that you can have amazing, authentic food in simple surroundings, just off the beaten path.
