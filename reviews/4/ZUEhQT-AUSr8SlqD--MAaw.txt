Have eaten here a couple of times. This is definitely a higher priced restaurant but the food is a step above traditional mexican restaurants. The menu offers salmon Mexican style and other interesting combinations. You get a lot of food on your plate and the tastes are interesting. Their sangria and margaritas are fresh and cold. The chips and salsa are warm and yummy.  We will be back again!
