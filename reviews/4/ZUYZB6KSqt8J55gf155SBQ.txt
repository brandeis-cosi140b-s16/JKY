I just recently moved to the area and I was on the look out for a decent Mexican restaurant. 
My partner and I ate here yesterday and it was actually quite good. We enjoyed a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla. 

On top of the good food they also have a salsa and chip bar. I may be Hispanic, but I tend to stay away from salsa. So for those that like salsa..enjoy!

I would recommend this establishment and I will definitely come back to try some of their other dishes.
