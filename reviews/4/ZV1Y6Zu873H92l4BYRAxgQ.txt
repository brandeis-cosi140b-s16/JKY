This was a quick stop on our way to Tortilla Flats...  Yelped it and was interested...  Looks like just any other strip mall taco joint but,  what counted was the food.  The place again was very clean, new actually.  The waitress's were very nice and helpful.  The food was surprisingly good ..  The pork taco's and Chili Relleno were yummy.  The taco salad was nothing special but,  good none the less.  Liked this place a lot...
