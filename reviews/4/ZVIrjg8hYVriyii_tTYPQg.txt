Ive driven past this place on the freeway about a million times and has always vowed that one day, i will try this place! 

and out of complete randomness.... it became my Saturday night dinner :) 

As we park the car, we could already tell this place was packed! we walked in and there were parties waiting to be seated ... lucky for us... we were seated right away... I'm sure we deemed ugly hungry stares for it to... hey its not our fault their are only two of us.... 

right after we were seated our drink orders were taken by a very welcoming young gentleman. :) 
and out chips and salsa were brought out promptly too! 
The Salsa was amazing... and the chips were fresh ... and hot!! that could have been my meal i was so content.... 

this place has great lighting.... not to bright or too dull... just how i like it. 
in the middle of the place there was a huge area where they cooked all the food... or at least some of it... it looked like fun.... 

we shared the beef Fajitas... they were amazing!! grilled on top of bell peppers and onions... red and white... mm served with rice, beans w/cheese, guacamole and a tray of salsa, sour cream and cheese... it was SO good and they brought out your tortillas in a little bowl with a cover to keep them warm.. but they tasted more like pita bread... either way everything was hot and fresh and out in a very timely fashion.. especially since this place was packed... 

i like this place alot... i would love to come back again and maybe sit near the chefs area :)
