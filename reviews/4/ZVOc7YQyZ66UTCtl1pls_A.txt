Great hidden spot off the busy freeway. Awesome prices and awesome food. Ordered a takeout order and it was ready and hot when I got there in 15 minutes. Love their pico de gallo and chimichanga! I ordered two entrees for $13 including tax. Go to a chain restaurant and you'll get half that food for that price. The staff is really friendly and the food is fresh. Can't go wrong here. Can't wait to try a margarita next time!
