This place is so good. In fact it the only Mexican restaurant I've truly enjoyed since moving to Arizona a few months ago. I've had their taco combination plate, rolled tacos, quesadilla, carne asada burrito, & California burrito (one of the best burritos I've ever eaten, period). Everything was good, tasted fresh, authentic, and fulfilled my craving for tasty Mexican food. This is the best Mexican food joint in the area, hands down.
