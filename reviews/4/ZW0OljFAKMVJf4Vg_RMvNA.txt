This Chipotle is sort of tucked into the shopping area.  Easy to see if you are in the right place, but otherwise a bit of a hunt.  It has the some format as every other Chipotle we've been to.  Burrito prepared quickly.  It was very tasty, as usual.  Seemed a bit smaller (I usually can't finish one in a single sitting).  But I can't be sure about that.

As fast food goes, this is some if the better stuff.
