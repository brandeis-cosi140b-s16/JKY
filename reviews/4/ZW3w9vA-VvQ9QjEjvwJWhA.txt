Solid 4. The food is always good no matter what I've had there over the years. Bean dip & salsa are awesome and always complimentary. 

Best thing about Serrano's is for lunch - they're very fast. Sadly unlike most of downtown chandler, Serrano's is fast and very nicely priced for lunch items. Staff is on top of things, drinks never empty and chips/dip never out. It makes for a great quick group lunch during the work week. Other places seem to take 1.5hrs in/out time.

No five simple because the scene is old, quiet and well... old. It's not bad, it's clean but just been there forever kind of old. There's no hipness to it, would never go there to drink at the bar, 

I've been going to this location and others for years now and will continue to do so. Enjoy!
