This place is my go to for good quality, flavorful fast food mexican food. I personally love the chicken salad with the house dressing. Their salads are  big enough for two and very filling for both people. I also enjoy their steak quesadeo and chicken burritos. Cant really go wrong with anything on their menu.  
They're alway super busy during lunch and dinner rush but you never have to wait too long because their staff works pretty efficiently on the food prep assembly line. This location is well maintained and clean and the staff is all pretty friendly and personable.
I would definitely recommend Cafe Rio to anyone for a yummy lunch or dinner.
