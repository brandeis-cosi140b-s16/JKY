Favorite Chipotle #3 (Part 3 of 4)

As an avid Chipotle fan who has tried Chipotle just about everywhere (and believe me, ingredients and quality vary greatly), I've picked four of my favorite ones. This is number 3.


Chipotle - Las Vegas Strip next to Harrah's

You wouldn't go to Las Vegas to eat Chipotle. However, I must say after a day of buffets, steaks, seafood, and an impressive gambling debt, Chipotle seems mighty good.

This Chipotle is located toward the middle of the strip, and I'm very impressed by the quality of the ingredients given their location. The peppers/onions combo in the fajita mix is very fresh and actually tastes like they just cut it up and put it into your food. The prices are reasonable even though they have the opportunity to raise it, and there's nothing like getting Chipotle late into the evening when you want to satisfy those midnight Las Vegas munchies.

This location shares the floor space with other restaurants (like a mini food court). Don't try the other places. The opportunity cost is too great.
