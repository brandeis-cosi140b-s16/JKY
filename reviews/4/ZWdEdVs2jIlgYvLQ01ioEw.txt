Another restaurant visit inspired by Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. Went with my friend while visiting her in Charlotte. Was very excited to try their fish tacos and was not let down!

The meal started with their unique corn salsa, a delicious mix of corn kernels, green bell pepper and tomoatoes served with tortilla chips.

For lunch I ordered their Tuna tacos with a honey wasabi sauce which was served with a side of mashed potatoes mixed with jalapeno peppers sliced in and cheese. The tacos were excellent with plenty of tuna and the wasabi sauce was unique, tasty and had the right amount of kick to it. While mashed potatoes are not usually thought of as a Mexican side dish, they were delicious and the jalapenos and cheese really added to their flavor. The whole meal washed down with a local Charlotte craft beer was the perfect lunch on a cold winter afternoon!
