I tried Cozymel's on a recommendation from my parents.  Living in San Diego, I never go to chain Mexican places - there are just too many other places to try.  I was expecting Cozymel's to be okay, nothing great.

We went for lunch, and I was happy to see a whole page of lunch specials for about $8.  Usually, an enchilada combo plate could set you back close to $15 at a Mexican chain.  Not here (during lunch at least).  

I ordered the taco salad with black beans instead of meat.  It came in an enormous flour tortilla shell - tostada style.  It was excellent.  The ingredients were very fresh, and it had just the right amount of everything. The chips and salsa were also fresh and delicious - no gigantic pieces of cilantro in the salsa, yay!  

Others ordered a seared chicken burrito, tortilla soup, and an enchilada plate.  Everyone thought everything was surprisingly good.  The service was fine.

Sign up for their email list and get $10 off.  Cozymel's is great if you're looking for something reasonably priced and healthy-ish (depending on what you order) instead of stuffing yourself at a Vegas buffet!  I'd return.
