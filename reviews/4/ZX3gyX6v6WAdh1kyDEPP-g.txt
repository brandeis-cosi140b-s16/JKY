points off for...
1. Called ahead to make sure they were open, when we got there sign said "closed".  The door was in fact open and we notified them that the sign said closed.
2. A child took our order (looked like 10 years old). I did not feel this was appropriate.
3. A smoke alarm with a low battery alarm kept chirping over the dinning area.

Good stuff..
1. The visible areas were clean
2. Service was friendly
3. Food was good and seemed to be prepared fresh.

Overall it was a pretty good experience and I plan to go again.
