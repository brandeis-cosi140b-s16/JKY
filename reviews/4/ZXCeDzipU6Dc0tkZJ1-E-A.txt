Tasty traditional Mexican food in the heart of Wisconsin? Check. The price is so right and the service has always been prompt and friendly. Tacos, enchiladas, huaraches, horchata, tamales... You can't go wrong. 

Taqueria Guadalajara is one of those trusty no-fuss joints you can hit up any day of the week. Don't forget about their weekend brunch menu that features various egg dishes and soup specials. 

Also, bring cash, as they are trying to avoid charging customers by credit card.
