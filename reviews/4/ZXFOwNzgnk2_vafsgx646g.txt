Came in for breakfast on a Sunday morning. I had heard good things about this place and finally I was able to make it in. I ordered the carne asada with eggs and my girlfriend ordered shrimp enchilada and a mole enchilada. My food was ok.. I was not a big fan of the seasoning that was used on it. My gfs enchiladas were very tasty she loved the mole.  The customer service really earned an extra star! Our waiter Walter was very friendly and attentive. He even brought us a spicier salsa which definitely blew the others Away. He kept checking in with us and making sure we were enjoying our meal. All in all I would definitely be back and continue trying other items.
