I am hooked on their chicken salad - I get without the chips.  It has lots of avocado and they way they do their chicken, the marination process, along with their hot sauce, makes this a good lunch salad for a reasonable price - less than $5.  The lady always remembers my order - no chips.  I enjoy seeing her friendly smile as I make my way through the drive-thru.
