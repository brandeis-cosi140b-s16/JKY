One of the few "fastfood" restaurants that I can walk away without feeling terribly guilty. 

Their food is fresh, and they have great service. 

Okay, it's nothing fancy...just a little Taco Bell type spot but on higher level. El pollo loco serves real chicken. You can see the giant grill behind the counter with  dozens of delectable roasting chickens.  It's like every day is a Mexican family reunion and you're invited! 

Don't skip out on dessert if you're a fan of flan^*^

The drive-thru is fast. The food might be a few dollars more than say taco bell... but you're getting much better food.
