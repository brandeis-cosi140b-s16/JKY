what isn't to like about Serrano's?

Service is better than most restaurants in Tempe. 

They bring you a pitcher in addition to your drink. This is great if you consume gallons of diet coke as I do. 

The chips, salsa, and bean dip (especially the bean dip) are out of this world. Be careful with them, because you will fill yourself before your entr√©e comes.

Everything on the menu is tasty. Reasonably priced, and VERY filling.

I eat an incredible amount of food, and very often leave restaurants feeling hungry. I have NEVER left this place without feeling full, or even overly full from eating so much of the bean dip.
