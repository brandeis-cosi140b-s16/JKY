This location is much smaller then the one in Tempe however it was just as fun and the food was just as good. We had the Holy Guacamole to start and then "World Famous Fish Tacos" by reccomendation from the server. It turned out to be pretty good the baja sauce put it over the top for me. Service was up to par no problems there. Happy Hour prices were awesome, very cheap!! Stayed for a little while drinking until the DJ started playing then called it a night. Overall very good experience, would reccomend to others!
