I really like the tacos here, they are on soft corn tortillas. Tuesday and Sunday are .99 tacos. My friend tried the nachos and didn't like it, the chips were a bit stale and when we they asked if we wanted everything on it, we said yes, expecting the normal toppings but they threw lettuce on the hot fake nacho cheese and sour cream. I have back to this place a few times and I've learned my lesson to always get the tacos. Great price and fills me up.
