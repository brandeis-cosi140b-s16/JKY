Cheap and greasy food that's perfect for your hungover drive back to LA!!! The service could definitely improve as the cashier looked like she wanted to spit in your face but the food was much needed and worth the drive from the strip. It's also not too far from the airport so it was good since we were dropping a friend off. There was no wait and food came out relatively fast. Definitely will go back.
