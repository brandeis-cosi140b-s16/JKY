I'm a personal fan of this Taco Bell because of their super friendly customer service.  There is another Taco Bell closer to me, but I always find myself visiting this one when I get a late night craving for Nachos Bell Grande with extra meat :)

I typically use the drive thru, but on the few occasions that I've been inside the place, it has always been very clean.

The food here always seems to be prepared well and is pretty fresh.  Usually with fast food places, you expect to get a bad meal every once in a while, but I've never had any problems here.

If you're in the area and have a taste for Taco Bell, I recommend giving this store a try.
