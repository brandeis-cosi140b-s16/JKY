Gourmet taco plate:
Baja Shrimp taco
Braised Pork taco
Absolutely delicious 
Salsa flight (5 choices) very good (pico, good; Roasted tomato and poblano, very good; Roasted corn and garlic crema, good; Habanero, great; Chipotle, great)
Service started out a little aloof but warmed up as lunch progressed. 
Interior is nice, but very small. Big tables, bar looks nice. 
This place will be hard to get into once "the people" catch wind of it! Let's keep it our secret for now.
