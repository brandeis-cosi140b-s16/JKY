If you're in the hood, drop in for their bean burrito. It's deliciously different. 

It looks like a 28-week preemie and weighs in right around the same.
I have no frame of reference on the taste however since I don't eat kids. 
I may appear mean enough to, but I don't so don't even go there, let's just stick with the burrito, ok? 

The beans, silky smooth refried beans. 
The tortilla, extra large... grilled until crisp and flaky. (the different part I was speaking of) 
And the taste combination?
Muy Sabroso!  (damned good)

The seating here is really strange. 
Hand carved, high-back wooden chairs so uncomfortable, anyone sporting a bony ass has about 3-5 minutes to eat before finding themselves scooching around like a bored first grader trying to get comfortable. 
Forget it. Not possible on these things. 

Overall, for a fast place to grab a very large and very tasty burrito, despite having to wolf it like you're in an eating contest...a result of the chair, I highly recommend this place.
