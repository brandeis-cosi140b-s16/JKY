The chicken torta was great moist flavorful chicken and a perfect roll soft but substantial. The fish tacos were fried fish. Normally not my favorite,  however, the batter was well seasoned and crispy and there was no over powering fish taste to the meat just the way a good fish taco should taste. I look forward to my next trip to see these guys.
