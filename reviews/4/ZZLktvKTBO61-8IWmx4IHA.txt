Thanks for the reco Joel, you rock!! Would also like to thank the the owners of Tortas El Guerro for opening a location closer to me than 16th street!! Woohoo!!

I have a long standing relationship with Tortas El Guerro. They make some of the best tortas in town at some of the best prices. You know you've hit the gold mine when you're the only white boy in the place!! Starting out at 16th Street then branching out, Ive managed to visit all their locations. So when I saw that Joel posted this I nearly wet myself!  

Ordered the Cubana, ($6.50) which had ham, cheese, pork leg and beef milanesa! This was a hefty man size sandwich that's a pretty tall order to shove into your mouth. Fortunately I have an unhinging jaw (well not really but sounds kind of cool like a snake or something) so I was able to eat it sort of neatly, I actually pressed it down a little, lol. The flavors were fresh and well seasoned. A topping of their avocado salsa really hit the spot but be warned, it truly is spicy. In fact I wasn't  expecting it, actually brought a tear to my eye, very nice!

Also order a Alebre Quesadilla ($5.99) which was stuffed full of steak, onions, peppers, bacon and cheese. Each stringy cheesy melty bite was sheer gluttony after having the Cubana. Next time, Ill only order one or the other. Egads!

I really liked the space. While it was clearly the shell of a Wendy's I liked that they added some rustic plank flooring and tight subtle lighting. Very comfortable, friendly and super clean!  

Looking forward to visiting again soon, love this place!

P.S. they have a drive thru!
