One of the better fast casual Mexican restaurants pretty much ever and I don't even eat fish. Always get something with chicken and Rubio has never let me down despite many strange menu changes over the years. In this visit, tried the two taco combo with rice and chips for about 8 bucks (about a buck more than it should be really). The chipotle sauce they drizzle on the chicken makes these tacos have a nice smoky taste. Use the coupon option to get a free large drink and you have a decent, healthy lunch. Lots of high tops at this location and a salsa bar that uses two sides finally.
