The service was good.  Young lady at the counter was pleasant and not bothered with my questions about the food.  I ordered the enchiladas.   The woman from the back (owner or manage perhaps.  Suggested i try one red and one green enchilada to try em both.   Each enchiladas had about 2oz of chicken by my guess.  Great mild flavor.   Both sauces were tasty.  The green was my favorite...it was a bit creamy and mild in heat.  I paid $6.71 total for two small/med size fresh made enchiladas.   Perhaps too expensive but satisfying enough.   I will eat here again.
