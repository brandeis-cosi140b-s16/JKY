Went on a Travelzoo voucher - what a find!!!!! The beer batter fish taco was great!!! Enoyed the Chicken Fajitas, the taco combo plates. Looking forward to going back, will get my own beer batter fish taco next time and not split it with my boyfriend :-)  The waitress told me they have good specials all week.  Only complaint was the rice was dry.
