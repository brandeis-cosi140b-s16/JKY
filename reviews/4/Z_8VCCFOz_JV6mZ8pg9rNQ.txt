Bought some today at the Gilbert Farmers market. I had to try one as soon as I got home and they are delicious. Four minutes in the microwave and boom they are hot and fresh. Love that every bite had the filling, nothing worse then  the filling only being in the very center. got 1/2 dozen of green chili pork and chicken chipotle.
