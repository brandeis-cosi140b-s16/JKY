Went here for lunch today and I would say that overall I was really impressed. They brought us chips that were delicious.  They were thin and we actually preferred to use them rather than the crackers or tostadas that came with our food. They also brought us a cup of their soup which was good but a bit too warm for this weather (it was still good, maybe as the weather cools I will order some of their caldos). I ordered the campechana while my wife ordered the pescado ceviche and even though we ordered the medium size it was a very healthy portion of food. Many places skimp on the seafood but this place gives more than enough to fill you up.  I actually wanted a bit more veggies because it was packed with shrimp, etc .  Service was great but at first we were one of only two tables but the place was quickly filling up.  My only complaint would be how warm the place was because they had a few fans on the counter to help cool the place down (my reason for four stars). Maybe something was up with the air conditioner but with seafood you really want to be in a cool place.  Looks like they listen to their reviews because the music was low and you can easily hear yourself or your partner. Place was clean and they were attentive. Will return again to try some of their other dishes. Hope they keep the quality and cleanliness and I will be a returning customer. I thought prices were fair but I eat a lot at Scottsdale restaurants so it could be an unfair comparison in prices
