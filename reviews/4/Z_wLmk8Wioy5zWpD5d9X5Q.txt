I didn't know what to expect when I came here ...maybe this would taste like Rubios? I think the fish tacos are much better here then Rubio's but the Shrimp taco impressed me the most ! I was expecting it to be made of popcorn shrimp but they were good sized shrimps for the money you pay. My husband had the Carne Asada burrito he said it was better then Robertos....I was like, "Are you sure"? The reason I questioned him on that is because Roberto's is our "go to place"  for So Cal comfort food . He said that he liked that their burrito didn't have a lot of meat fat (he hates meat fat) and it just overall tasted better. If you don't like beans or rice in your burrito make sure you tell them you want it on the side. We also ordered the guacamole and chips which I wasn't a fan of. I don't think they give you a lot of Guacamole compared to how many chips and it wasn't spicy enough for me. I liked their drink selection which had sodas, teas and Orange Whip ... it's like an Orange Julius. I was happy with the food and I would definitely come back!
