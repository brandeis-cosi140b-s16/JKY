The shrimp and steak burrito is the bomb-diggity. My family and I were impressed with trying several things from here and they were all good. The hospitality and great food is something that  I look for when trying a new place. I also tried the lengua, carne asada, and shrimp tacos and all exceeded my expectations.  Certain salsas I liked more then others but all of them tasted good. Check out this place and give them a try.
