YES YES YES. Burrito Express MAY just have the ABSOLUTE best Breakfast Burritos in THE EAST VALLEY. The Supreme Breakfast Burrito!!! In the words of the prolific Ke$ha: "I'm addicted. It's a crisis!"

The only disappointment has been.. items containing ground beef.. which is fine, because, eww.. ground beef.. (not a huge fan) D:
