Quite happy with this find. Have driven past the location many times but finally decided to stop and give it a try a couple weeks ago. With a number of visits now I have some favorites but haven't worked my way through the menu. The Mexican breakfast burrito is quite good and very filling. A large breakfast burrito with chorizo, potatoes, etc. The regular burritos that I've tried so far have not let me down. Again quite large & filling. I tried one of the plate meals for take out.  It was good but better eaten there. I also tried the nachos on another visit. The regular nachos at $3.49 was a lot of food and heavy on the toppings rather than the chips. Guacamole was generic and not homemade, but everything else was good. Staff are very friendly and I was already a recognized "regular" on my second visit.  I suppose you might compare this to a Frederico's, but my sense is that they are trying to be their own family place, and not a copycat of anyone else. From my perspective this is a small treasure that the NW valley, and especially Peoria, is fortunate to have.
