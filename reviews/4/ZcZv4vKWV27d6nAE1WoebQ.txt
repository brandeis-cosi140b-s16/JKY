Nice restaurant! Went there a few times. The weather was great to sit in the patio. Loved the musical artist. The drinks were awesome. There is this blue one blended tastes like kool aid and the alcohol just sneaks up on you......it slaps you all of a sudden. Be careful- lol. The service was good and the restrooms were clean. Great spot for tourist, drinks, and party goers.
