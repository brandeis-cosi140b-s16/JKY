Okay so it is a little hole in the wall and the greasy smell when I first walked in almost made me walk back out BUT I stayed and ordered and I must say that I'm glad that I did!

I ordered the Tres Enchiladas plate which they changed up for me (normally you get one chicken, one beef and one cheese) to just three sour cream chicken.  I also ordered my husband the two chimi (one beef and one chicken) combo plate.  The dinners came with rice and beans and they included chips and salsa in the to go order without having to ask for it...nice touch!

I get home and open my container still a little apprehensive after the smell of the restaurant.   The first thing I notice is the size of the enchiladas.  Wow!  These were the most chicken stuffed offerings I've had from any Phoenix restaurant!  Then I tasted them......oh, they know how to do an excellent enchilada!  They were so flavorful and the sauce was light and creamy.  Totally rocked it!

The beans were also very good.  Full of flavor, nice and sticky firm and not soupy like some places.  Total win.  Only thing that was disappointing was the rice.  It was just there.  Not much taste, bland, boring.  yawn.

Overall it was amazingly cheap and very, very good!  The fact that it's just down the street?  Bonus!
