Dropped by here on the way back from Mt. Charleston. I got a carne asada platter while my friend got the beef one. To be honest, I was surprised as to how delicious my food was. Even though their salsa bar was almost non-existent, it didn't matter. I would come back here whenever I'm nearby. 

The place is really dirty and un-inviting. It's kind of like going to a McDonald that's in a bad part of town. Needless to say, don't come here for anything but delicious Mexican food.
