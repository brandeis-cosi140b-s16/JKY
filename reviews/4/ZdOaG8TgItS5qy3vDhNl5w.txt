El milanesa sandwicho es muy bueno!  That was my inner Spanish-speaking voice said after eating the breaded steak sandwich at Los Reyes de la Torta (which, loosely translated means "Reyes of the Sandwich").  I tried a couple of other sandwiches too (thank you for that opportunity, Groupon!)... but my inner voice was not nearly as pleased with those sandwiches as it was with the milanesa.  On a different note, I was approached in the parking lot by a homeless-looking man asking for change... but I don't hold that against this place, as I am sure he was just trying to scrounge up enough pesos to afford a milanesa sandwich to go with his 40 oz Dos Equis!
