Don't go to Qdoba across the street! Veracruz has decent Mexican food and good prices. Fast service and good quality. Probably the best enchiladas verdes in PGH..... but you can do better at home armed with one of Diana Kennedy or Rick Bayless's cookbooks. If you're in a rush though- this is your best option on that strip.
