I've been to this Z'Tejas a few times. I typically enjoy their catfish but today I found it rather bland and tasteless. The Chambord Margarita I had was awfully watery; they are usually quite tasty (this was good, but not great). Now, my Tejas Mule was absolutely delish! The service was pretty decent as well. 4 stars

There'a ALWAYS interesting sites at the Scottsdale Z'Tejas.  Always!
