Finally got a chance to stop in and definitely do not regret it. I'm glad I found a solid little taco shop close to our place because two hippies just aint cuttin it. I had the pastor tacos and carne asada tacos and they were both delicious. Very homemade authentic taste and ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait to head back for more!
