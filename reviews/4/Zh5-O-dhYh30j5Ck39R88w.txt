I ate here last week and it was a pretty good meal. It is a really small place. It was not the best Mexican meal I have ever had but not the worst.

The chips were very good, but I did not like the salsa. It was very runny and too spicy for me. However, I know that some people really like their salsa like this.

There are a lot of vegetarian items on the menu which I thought was great. You don't often see that in a restaurant. I ordered the fajitas and asked if they would substitute mushrooms and squash for the bell peppers and tomatoes and they did so without a charge. The fajita meat came in really small pieces which makes it easier to put on the tortillas and eat without it falling out everywhere. My only other complaint is that the meat and vegetables weren't seasoned enough. They needed a little bit more and they would have been great.
