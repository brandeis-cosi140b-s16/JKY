This is my favorite taco joint in Madison. Authentic campechos tacos are terrific and cheap. A solid lunch will run about $7 here.

I happened by on a day when the special was a mole chicken that was out of this world. I wound up eating way to much of it because I frankly wanted to drink a glass of the sauce. 

I have never eaten at the restaurant itself so I cannot speak to the atmosphere or the noise level, but this is among my favorite carry-out spots in town.
