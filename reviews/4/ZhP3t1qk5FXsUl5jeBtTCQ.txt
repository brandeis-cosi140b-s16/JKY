I love everything about this place.  

I usually go with the Big Bordurrito with re-fried beans instead of the salad.  They are just much more tasty and seem to compliment the burrito much more than a salad does.  I have had their fresh, made at your table guacamole on a few occasions and can attest to it being "REAL."  Its fresh, and you can taste it.

The chips and also are perfect, they are the quintessential chips and salsa and are what every Tex-Mex establishment should serve up.  The salsa is excellent and always tastes and looks fresh.

I go here at all sorts of times, after movies or shopping at Concord Mills, or my gf and I will grab a Big Bordurrito to go and sit it at home in front of the television.  Sometimes I just go on a random weekend day for lunch and sit at the bar, drink a few Dos XX  Ambers on draft and do work on the Big Bordurrito.  The bar tenders are always chill but on the job, ready to fill you up with more salsa or get you another beer whenever you need.  

I can't really speak for any other menu items other than the Big Bordurrito and the table-side guacamole. Both are extremely tasty and you get big portions of each.  

I know its a chain, but what can I say, I AM A FAN, and of course, I WILL be back soon!
