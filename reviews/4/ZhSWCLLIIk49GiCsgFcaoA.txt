I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks. the first time three of us had steak fajitas, very good, peppers and onions perfectly cooked, three item combo plate with cheese enchilada, beef taco and chili relano plus rice and beans, all very good two, third person had Arizona Chimichanga  with Colorado chili. very good. Their salsa is delicious and not too hot. decor and overall atmosphere makes for a comfortable dining experience. This place has moved up to the top on my Mexican food restaurants.
