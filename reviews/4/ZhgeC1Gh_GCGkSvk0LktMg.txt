I was looking for a place to enjoy a quick snack and drink for happy hour. Remembering that La Hacienda at the Princess had just reopened, I decided to stop in and check them out. 

Walking through the resort's courtyards to the restaurant reminded me of what a nice place the Princess really is and put me in a relaxed frame of mind. 

Upon entering La Ha I decided to sit at the small bar right in front of me. I was immediately struck by the large assortment of tequilas on the bar shelves. If you like tequila then this is the place for you. They have over 100 to choose from at any given time. 

After looking over the happy hour menu I decided to have a La Hacienda margarita on the rocks. It was made with Sauza Gold tequila, triple sec and fresh lime. Really, it was quite good and at only $4 priced very well. 

Moving on to the food I ordered the Duo de Tacos (one beef and one chicken) and the Mahi Mahi ceviche. Both were very good and the ceviche was spicy in the citrus-tomato and chile juices. It might have been nice to have had a little more fish in the dish but again for $4 what more can you expect? 

The bar staff were very friendly and the service was good. All in all, a nice experience.
