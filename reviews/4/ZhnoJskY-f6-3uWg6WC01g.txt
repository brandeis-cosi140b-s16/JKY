I SO miss working downtown & enjoying the ever so delightful Johnny Burrito!
Their burritos are so delicious...but it is filling. (c) Ron Burgandy.

The regular size burrito is the way to go! Picadillo (spicy beef), lettuce, tomato, pico de gallo & cilantro is my weapon of choice.
The chips are always fresh & have just the right amount of crunch, but again...you have to be pretty hungry to eat the burrito & chips!

Mind you the space is small & there will be a line at lunchtime.  However, the line moves quickly as long as you know what you want prior to placing your order.  Think of it as a "Subway" or "Quiznos" type of order.

I defintely put Johnny's up against Moe's, Qdoba, or Salsarita's. Not to mention, you're supporting a small business owner!
