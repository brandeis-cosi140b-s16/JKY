You know it's going to be good when the daily specials board is written in Spanish. This place is the shit for tacos and gorditas. One of, if not the best places in town to get cheap Mexican food. Service is OK. 

It's also half a grocery store and has a lot of Mexican imports and cheaper cuts of meat. The drinks on the menu are basically "whatever you find in the store" which is confusing since you dont know who exactly to pay for it and then if you need a bottle opener you have to track down the waitstaff who aren't always around. Small price to pay imo, but some people might get salty about it.
