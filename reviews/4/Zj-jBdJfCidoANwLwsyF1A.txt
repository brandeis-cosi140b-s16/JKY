Other than the fact that the few times I've been here the employees seem miserable I go to Rubios because it has the best burritos. Sadly there aren't a lot (or enough locations) if you're a fan and that can be annoying. I wish it had the trifecta which for me is, the convenience and availability of a Taco Bell, the salsa of a Baja Fresh and well the deliciousness of a Rubio's burrito. One out of three it is for now but definitely one of my favorite "fast casual" restaurants as they call them.  Employees need to cheer up or at least pretend to smile though.
