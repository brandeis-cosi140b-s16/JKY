I really like Zaba's.  It's fast and fresh, but most importantly the food is good.  The only time I really eat Mexican food is when I go visit my family in my home state of New Mexico.  Here in Vegas when I do feel like eating Mexican food it's here.  I know it's not "authentic", but It doesn't stop it from being good.

What I really like about this place is the healthy options.  Whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, sweet potato's and so on.  So until I go visit home again and I'm in the mood for some Mexican food well this is the place I will keep coming back too.
