Top Shelf has been in business since the 70's.  How does a restaurant stay in business that long - especially with this economy?  GOOD FOOD!  Top Shelf has had consistently good mexican food for the last 30+ years and we always enjoy going there.  The Top Chimi with guacamole and sour cream is always good.  And the basics - taco, enchilada, rice and beans are as good as anyone in the valley.  You get a big bowl of chips with a large bowl of very tasty salsa when you are seated.  Also, you must try the cheese crisp.  We always say it is the best out of all the mexican places we have tried.  AND, we always get service with a smile when we go.
