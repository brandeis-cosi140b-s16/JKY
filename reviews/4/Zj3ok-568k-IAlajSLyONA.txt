This is my local Taco bell, and my Taco Bell of choice.  If you've ever been to any of the thousands of Taco Bells around this great country, then you know the tasty, affordable dining experience you are sure to have each and every time you go to a Taco Bell, and this one is no different.  

When I go here, I usually keep it simple.  I prefer the XXL Grilled stuffed burrito - chicken or steak, it doesn't matter.  I ALWAYS STAY AWAY FROM THE GROUND BEEF!  You just don't know what you're getting with that stuff, and its really not worth putting your life on the line to find out.  Other menu highlights include, any of the soft tacos, nachos bell grande, seven-layer nachos, chick/steak burrito supreme, seven-layer crunch wrap supreme, and the pintos and cheese.  Of course there are many other items on the menu from crunch-wraps to cinnamon twists, but the best part of taco bell is that this great variety of menu options is offered from 2 in the afternoon to 2 in the morning!

So if you want good, cheap, filling, food, you know what to do - RUN FOR THE BORDER!
