This place is right near my mother in laws house, so it's very convenient to go to when I visit her or drop the kids off for babysitting. The food is always fresh and delicious, much like you get in a home kitchen. Their carne asada burrito is very tender unlike most of the other big chains. I also frequently enjoy their shrimp burrito which is very fresh and the shrimp are never overcooked. They have a pretty fast drive thru and their horchata is the best!
