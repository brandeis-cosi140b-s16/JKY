I love Macayo's food, and have to admit it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I especially love this location.  

They serve the best Margarita's, nice and strong!  They have their own sweet & sour mix, which I believe is the secret.  The sunset margarita is a must try.  

Favorite foods: mini chimis, red corn taquitos and green corn tamale w/baja sauce. Oh and lots of chips & salsa!

They also have a very large patio with live music on Thursday's until 9pm.  The service is good and the bartenders are especially friendly.
