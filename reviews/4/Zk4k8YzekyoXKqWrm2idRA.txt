This is my favorite location..

I luv this restaurant, but most are always so packed you usually end up finding somewhere else to eat 
But this location has nice parking and always a quick, friendly que.
My biggest complaint is a common one for me.. the tables and chairs are to short. Feels like I'm sitting at the kids table at thanksgiving.

All around better than their 7th ave or camelback locations.
