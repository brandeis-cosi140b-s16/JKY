I was driving on the other side of town when I saw this little Mexican market, and I mean little, but I was surprised how much stuff they have in there, it's like a little of EVERYTHING in there !
They  have a kitchen where you can order from breakfast, to lunch and even dinner, but you can't eat there, they sell beer, regular groceries and the best part, they have a meat department, good prices and vast quality!
I've been going there for like 2 months now, very convenient,  I really like the people there, they are helpful and friendly.
