Great authentic place for Mexican food in the west valley. I am so glad I tried it!! I had the original torta paquime. Everything on the menu looked super good, hopefully I will get to try some other stuff in the future!

The best part about this place is the variety of food options that they have: you can get a full meal, but if you are just looking for a snack they have a bunch of different Mexican breads and buns. Also, they have about ten flavors of ice cream and a lot of different desserts on their menu...so you can also just go for dessert!! I will definitely be back just to get an ice cream cone sometime...their flavors look delicious and freshly made. 

The service is really good too...even though it isn't a sit down and order type of restaurant with servers and stuff...the guy at the cash register came around to ask how our food was!
