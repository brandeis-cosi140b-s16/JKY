I went to La Unica last night for the first time. I thought the food was pretty good.  As someone else mentioned they serve 2 types of salsa with chips, after chatting with the bartender a little, he brought us two additional salsa's to try, both had more way more spice than the first ones. The chips were hot and fresh and all 4 salsa's were very tasty. 

The steak fajitas were very good, meat was tender and well seasoned, the vegetables were very fresh.  My boyfriend had a sampler of the tacos and all were really good. 

Margaritas were awesome! Not too sweet - i hate that! Staff was incredibly friendly and fun.  

Dinner bill was under $40... overall its a pretty decent local mexican restaurant in Charlotte!
