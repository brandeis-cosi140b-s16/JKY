Driving around today we got the munchies. Was looking for Jacquelines Market place, but didn't realize that it was renamed to Cafe Carumba about 5 years ago.
I fought with the idea of having breakfast, but since I all ready ate breakfast, I settled on the appetizers.There were four of us so we all ordered appetizers: Tres Hummus Plate, Nachos in a bowl with tri-color chips, chicken quesadilla and chipotle southwest eggroll. 
That hit the spot. The Nachos in a Bowl and Southwest Egg rolls were a hit and the quesdilla and hummus plate were okay.
The server was slow coming to our patio table, maybe it was because he or someone dropped a tray load of water glasses by the entrance to the patio...JOB OPENING. But, after that, he was very attentive.
