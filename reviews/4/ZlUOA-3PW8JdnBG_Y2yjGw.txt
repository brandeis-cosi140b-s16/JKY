Yum! I have been to this place twice already since it opened. The food is delish and the service was good. 

They're chips are obviously made in house (versus most of the other Mexican restaurants in the valley who get them delivered). They offer 3 kinds of salsa- their house mild salsa, a chipotle and a spicy tomatillo.  The salsas are good, the only downer is that they only provide one basket of chips, then charge for each additional basket after that. My family can go through salsa and chips in no time so this was a downer. On the contrary, the food seems to come out of the kitchen really fast (even for a Mexican restaurant) so we didn't notice the difference as much as we could have.

I go the Plato de Mexicano. It consists of A cheese enchilada, beef taco and a red chile tamale. Served with refried beans for $11.95. A good sized plate. Everything was good, they don't have your run of the mill enchilada sauce which is nice. 

I have had the scallop and shrimp enchiladas (I believe it was a special). It was really good, served with a spicy fundido sauce, rice and beans. 

Someone else at my table had the Plato Burro which is a fresh flour tortilla filled with green chile, shredded chicken, beef or vegetables. Served with rice and beans for $10.95. She opted fir the beef and said it was awesome. 

I would highly recommend this place. About time we got another sit down Mexican restaurant in Fountain Hills. The only reasons I did not rate this place 5 stars was because of the chips and salsa issue and the fact that they have a TON of staff working there (we counted 20 lol) and we felt kind of rushed both times. It was nothing that our waiters did, just the vibe we got from so much staff running around. Don't let this hold you back. This place is worth it and is awesome and everyone we have interacted with has been super friendly. Enjoy!
