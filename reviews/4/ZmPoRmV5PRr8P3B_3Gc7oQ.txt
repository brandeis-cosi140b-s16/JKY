As Gabriel notes, don't let the trailer park in back fool you... 

It was a small restaurant with a few parking spots. I tried the barbacoa which was a first for me. "About Food" describes barbacoa as "Traditional Mexican barbacoa is completely different. It essentially steams and smokes the meat at the same time resulting in a moist and flavorful meat." Excellent choice which included beans, rice and tortillas. Complementary hot sauce (red and green) and chips was included. The red was tasty with some kick, but the green was our favorite. 
The waiter was the son of the owner. He was extremely helpful in describing the different items on the menu. Also, the owner stopped by our table to talk about the history of the restaurant and her love of cooking.
