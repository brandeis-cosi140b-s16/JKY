Rivas showed up with five stars on Yelp when I was driving around with my friend. 

I read the reviews before so I was glad it came across. 

The menu is small which, to me, is a good sign because I believe small menus let establishments focus on keeping core items really good and prices low.

It had salads, quesadillas, super nachos, burritos, wet burritos, rolled tacos. That's all I can remember.

I got the super steak nachos.

These are by far my favorite Carne asada nachos.. better than tacos el gordo! Which i love..

The reason is the steak was freshly grilled, the guacamole was actually thick guacamole, and the beans!

Beans are a filler in my opinion. 

Their beans were seasoned perfect and added to the overall flavor combination.

It was a bit hot in the restaurant, which I hate. Also, food came slow but it was a bit busy I guess.

But I overall loved the food.

The cashier was nice but not someone memorable. 

The overall experience including service, speed, and food will get a four from me.

Oh yea! There bathrooms were pretty clean haha :]
