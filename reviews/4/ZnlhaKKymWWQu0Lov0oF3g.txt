I love this place.... needs a little upgrade outside  but fun everywhere else.... I swear every time I come here i try something different to eat and drink.... but I always forget to check in.... I enjoy the Fillet tacos.. I get them with no cheese... they put alot....Mini Burgers are always spot on. . Chips and salsa don't have alot of flavor.. Prickly pear Margarita is the fall back when beer is outta the question. Tortilla soup is a no-go late night snack... It's never as good as in the day. Awesome happy hour and OPEN TILL 2AM... WITH FOOD. Really cool servers and bartenders. Come here if you need a BIG bat cave to hide in for a cool down.
