I work over on Camelback so I decided to check this place out.  Its nice to be pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga for lunch.  The obligatory chips and salsa came out first-the chips were not the greatest-the salsas were ok.  

As far as the chimichanga, it was excellent, one of the best I've had recently.  The chicken inside was white meat and it was tender and flavorful-the deep fried tortilla was crisp on the outside and somewhat softer on the inside.  I am not a big fan of rice in general but the rice they served with the meal was great. 

If I am in the area, I will definitely go back.
