I love Mexican food. Let's just get that out there..it's delicious and I love their use of spices along with fresh meat and veggies. I just had to try this joint out while here in town with a friend. I liked the feel this place had. It was simple and all about the food. It was laid back with a few spots inside and more outside...And the food was oh so delicious!!! I decided to go with the carne asada burrito, while my friend went with the carne asada torta and we added some horchata. We got the horchata and water and sat down in one of three seating spots. There are more outside but it's July and it's hot despite the misters. 

We both really liked the horchata. I love horchata and this had a great taste to it. A definite must for a hot summer day. Our food came quick and it was succulent and fresh and whooooaaaaa..It was delicious. There was such a great texture to the carne asada burrito and it didn't fill me up. Unlike other Mexican joints that load up on cheese, this place doesn't which means you get to focus on the flavor and the meat not the cheese and I'm ok with this. I was very impressed and wish they could send me their recipes so I can repeat them in Indy!!
