Checked out Taco Tijuana again!

After my review on Yelp, management said that the old chorizo WAS store bought, and that's why it was not as flavorful and dry. So they invited us back to give the new recipe a whirl!

The new chorizo definitely has more flavor...more spices in it, and more taste. The consistency is still a bit on the dry side, but the seasoning makes it taste great :)

The Al Pastor didn't pack the same punch though...but still good! It is still a bit oily/greasy compared to most, but that's a good thing! 

Still a great place to get your taco fix!
