Rhonda's review of that it's a "safe place to take visitors from out of town who want to try Mexican" is absolutely perfect.  It's good solid food.  But my problem is though I've been here several times nothing really sticks out at me as being exceptional.  Not the service or the atmosphere or a particular dish.  Normally it would.  Their Pollo Magnifico was good - but it's not specifically better than the same basic dish at other restaurants (Poco Pollo con queso at Ajo Al's or Pollo Fundito at Valle Luna and a few other spots).

The building is cute, and it's in a good location to hit up some other things while you're in the area.  It's a nice and shiny kind of spot, but I'd still generally chose Los Olivos over it even if it is a bit older.  The service is always good though, so I'll let that push this 3 1/2 star spot up to a 4th star.
