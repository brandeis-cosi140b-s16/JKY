i like the Tuesday special of coconut shrimp tacos with a mango sauce.  Good portions.  Sauces are delicious.  meat is nice and moist.  tortillas are tasty and fresh.

 just be careful because they will try to add on stuff, like if you want guacamole or extra sauce. they don't tell you some of the stuff is an extra .95 cents until they ring you up at the cash register.
