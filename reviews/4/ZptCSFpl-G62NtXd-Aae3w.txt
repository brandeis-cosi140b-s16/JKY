Since I'd been hearing many good comments about this place we decided to give it a try. Let me tell you, we don't regret it at all!!  Place is clean (even bathrooms), servers and cooks are very helpful and friendly.  We had the Flautas Ahogadas (rolled tacos drown in tomato sauce), Twin Burritos(red and green shredded beef) and a Chilindrina. All of the food was so good!!  We also had Mango and Horchata Aguas Frescas and they were the bomb!! 
Can't wait to come back for some dessert since we end up with no space for it after our dinner.
Restaurant didn't get 5 stars because is a bit over crowded, sitting area by kitchen was very hot and is not as big as it needs for all the clients they get. I think next time we'll take order to go. And I say next time because we're definitely coming back!! Overall was a good experience. I would recommend you try this place at least once. But I can assure you'll be back!!!
