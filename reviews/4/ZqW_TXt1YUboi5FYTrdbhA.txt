I steamed up the tamales yesterday and they were great, a mix of chicken and beef tamales.

When I was a little kid I got tamales from a truck at the beach and I loved them. I thought that was how tamales were, factory made tubes of really yellow corn meal with consistently round tubes of ground beef in the middle. The tamales at El Charro are the definitely handmade variety, and could not be more authentic or better. Shredded chicken or shredded beef perfectly seasoned.

Go in and order a dozen for pickup in a couple of days, or maybe some will be available right then. Steam them up for a couple of hours and you will be very happy.
