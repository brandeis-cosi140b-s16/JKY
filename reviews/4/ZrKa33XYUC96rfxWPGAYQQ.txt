Where do I start? I've been meaning to try this place earlier, but the sketchy (not so appealing) appeal kept stalling my visit. The place is small. When I went, there were no customers. I knew what I wanted from the get-go and I shan't order anything else except for CHEESESTEAK. Upon entering you're greeted with a long buffet bar, which at the time was empty. There was a female host and she was very polite, energetic, and friendly. Good first impression. I ordered a philly cheesteak with provolone, but I had to have cheez whiz on the side. Once the sandwich was delivered-it was gone in probably 3 minutes. Really good- closest thing to a philly here in suburban Avondale. The meat was packed, no frozen taste whatsoever and the onions had a lovely caramelization. Best thing about it was that it wasn't heavy in the tummy. No "ughh why did I just eat that junk" feeling. I've been craving to go back, prices are decent too! Will opt for the hot dog next time. Very casual dining, almost too casual that I'd rather have eaten at home, but maybe it was only because we came at dead time.
