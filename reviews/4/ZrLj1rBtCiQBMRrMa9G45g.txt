I've been here 3 times now, I'm a creature of habit and each time got the salmon and grilled veggies. Delish!!!! May be strange to get salmon at a Mexican restaurants but it was awesome. Love the new decor, and they're working their kinks out with new wait staff. I'm really surprised at the number of negative reviews, as I've had nothing but great experiences and good food here. I will be back!
