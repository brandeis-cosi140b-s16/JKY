I had watched construction of Canteen closely, hoping to myself that the establishment would not be doomed from the start like most of the location's predecessors. On the opening night I dined, drank, danced, and had an engaging conversation with a member of the opposite sex over paper towels in the co-ed washroom, and I had a blast.

The margaritas are decent and all of the food I have tried is great. The roasted half chicken was done to perfection and the pork entree was a great take on my favorite sad meat.

Stay away on fri and Saturday after 11 unless you enjoy rubbing on strangers more bass emission than a west-side highschool parking lot.
