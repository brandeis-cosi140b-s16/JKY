I'm glad someone told me about this place because I don't think I'd ever have found it otherwise. It's hidden in the corner of a shopping center, and maybe you can see a sign for it somehow but I don't remember seeing it from the road. 

I suggest you make a point to find this place though because it's a really decent spot for mariscos. It's small but comfortable inside. Our server was very friendly and helpful. 

Beer is pretty cheap here, which is always a plus.

The chips and salsa are okay. Chips were served cold which is kind of a bummer. The sauce had a sweet, canned tomato taste at first, but the flavor finishes off with an unusually spicy kick, so I can't really hate it.

Our dinner was great though. I got the filet with Diablo sauce. It was a huge piece of white fish smothered in spicy red sauce with saut√©ed onions. The beans and rice it came with were very good, although I would have like a little bit more. My wife loved her shrimp cocktail. I didn't try it but it looked wonderful. The ceviche was delicious and very vibrant.

Overall, this place surprised me with how great the food is despite its appearance and odd location. I'm gonna have to give it four stars, and I'll definitely be back again soon!
