Wanted Mexican food and have eaten at the one in Planet Hollywood and loved it.  This one was not as good as the one in PH, but it was good.  We ordered chips and salsa for the table, which came with 4 different salsas.  I liked the mild and hot red salsas the best.  The food everyone got was great.  Service was quick, ambiance was a little boring inside where we ate.
