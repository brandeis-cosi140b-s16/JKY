This Taco Bell has never given me any problem and I have been her numerous times, only this was my first time checking in there on Yelp. 

Being the drive-up line was at least 8 cars deep, I went inside and ordered my items to go, as I was meeting my husband at his work for lunch and also ordered an item for one of his co-workers. I only had to wait about 5 or so minutes before everything was ready and bagged. Very friendly people work there and they are fast! The only thing that was alarming was the filter cover was off the front of the soda machine and looked like a large eyesore. I couldn't keep from staring at it. I notice weird things like that, and it just creeps me out!

Got the food to my lunch destination and everything was good, although the left the salsa out of one of the taco salads I ordered (found it later inside of my order when we were finished). Everything tasted great and was a nice break from our usual sandwich lunches we have every so often. 

I just hope the next time I step foot in there, they have their soda machine filter cover back on!
