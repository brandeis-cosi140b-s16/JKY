If you like Mexican food, try this place!  Unique Mexican dishes that have an authentic flavor you don't find at the Americano-Mexican places like La Pinata across the street or any of the Filabertos-type joints this area is crawling with.  I hear the owners brought in a chef from Mexico City to train the staff...whatever it took, the difference shows in the food.  I'm not much for hot peppers, but this place treats them right, transforming what could be super spicy into something rich, delicious, and a perfect hint of spice.  I highly recommend the quesadilla sampler and whatever the soup of the day is for a newbie.  They quesadillas might not be what you expected, but like most things at Poblano's, it's a delicious surprise.
