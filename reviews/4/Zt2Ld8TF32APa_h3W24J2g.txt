My office co-workers and I decided to take on of our own who was leaving out to lunch . . . and this place was suggested.  Been here many times before . . . when it had a different name and different owners . . . so I really did not know what to expect.

I was pleasently surprized . . . I ordered the Big Ass Burrito with Short Rib meat and an Iced Tea.  As some of you know I am a BIG guy . . . so I was expecting a BIG burrito . . . it was a good size, but not the biggest I have had . . . and though it was very tasty . . . the best bites had the Short Rib Meat . . . which this burrito could have used more of.   The Iced Tea tasted fresh brewed and was nice and clear.

I will definately be back to try more of the menu , , , and it is definatelly worth trying.
