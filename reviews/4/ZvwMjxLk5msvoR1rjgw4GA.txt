Service is a bit spotty, but the tacos are delicious! Took almost 45 mins to get seated the first time and seated immediately the second time.

 To be honest I'm not typically a fan of fish tacos. I like seafood I like tacos. Not thrilled with them together. When I had my first bite of fish taco here my initially reaction was "not sure if just really hungry or best fish taco I've ever had!" (After the first 45 min wait). Went back yesterday and confirmed yeah probably best fish taco ever.
