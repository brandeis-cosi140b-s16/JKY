We got there at 9:59 and they still let us come in and eat indoors even though they had already mopped the place.  Good food...it's Taco Bell, and the staff was cool. Had never had the dorito taco, so i got the $5 combo box with that, a burrito and another regular taco.  Was good.  I was expecting more from the dorito taco tastewise, but it didn't taste bad or anything.
