Chilaquiles lived up to their reputation - it was a very involved dish but it had great layers of texture along with flavor. It also comes topped with a fried egg, and I'm of the opinion that everything is better with a fried egg on top. 

Little disappointing were the squid tacos. Yes, they were tender and moist and cooked notably well - but really lacking in flavor. 

The ambience is friendly and chill. They played some reggae and have a "street" theme going with art on the walls that borrow elements of graffiti, metal table tops, etc. The service was great - attentive, friendly, and fast. 

Only suggestion would be to get an espresso machine in there to provide some more caffeine options in addition to drip coffee (which was still pretty yummy as far as drip coffee goes - slightly darker roast, lots of flavor, not watered down).  That would definitely make this place a staple on my weekends.
