Solid 4 stars.  Just the kind of taco shop I miss in Seattle. If you like SoCal Mex this is your place.  Delicious Carne Asada and breakfast burritos.  Go for the Bombero style if you like a wet burrito! Homemade Jamaica and horchata too.  Ohh yeah, this place was featured on Diners Dives and Drive throughs if that makes any difference to you.
