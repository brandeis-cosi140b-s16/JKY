I went here after school with my friends today. I didn't know what to think at first, but this place is super yummy. They give you chips and salsa as soon as you walk in and tbh the salsa is VERY spicy. Especially for people with low tolerance(me). I had a pork taco and it was delicious. The pork was cooked well and it comes with a lot of seasonings. For dessert we had a burrito cheesecake and it was pretty bomb. It was really hot on the inside and covered in a strawberry sauce.
