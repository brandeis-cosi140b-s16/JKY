I only ate one thing here, but it was GOOD

I knew I wanted noodles, asked server for a reco, without hesitation he said dan dan mien.

The noodles were REALLY well cooked, you could tell they were fresh.

The sauce was really good (and I've had dan dan in Asia many times). It had that umami you expect from a dish like that. So good! I'd definitely go back to try more. 

I did notice that the menu is really chinese OR mexican (not really many fusion dishes) but its an interesting concept.
