I've been meaning to update my review for months now. This Roberto's is on the way home from work w/ a drive-through, so it makes for a very convenient take-away on those really long days! The food has gotten much better the last few months! The husband always chooses the chicken chimichanga, I typically choose rolled tacos & sometimes a few other additions... The rolled tacos are consistently good. The chips & cheese are also tasty. The beans at this location are typically good- the rice is "fine". 

I give it 4 stars because the food is good, fast, & convenient!
