Definitely a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican food joint with the classic washed out pictures of what you are going to be eating on the menu board. I ordered the 4 rolled tacos with guac and had a great meal overall.

Expect large portions, good prices and authentic offerings.

With a good Mexican cerveza the experience would have been even better (I guess I have to go for take-out next time to get the cerveza myself)
