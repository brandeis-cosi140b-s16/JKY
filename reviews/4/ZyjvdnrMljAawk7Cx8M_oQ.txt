This place lives up to it's name.  I can personally vouch for the margaritas, fish tacos, tamales, beans, red rice, white rice and salsa.  Que riquisimo!  The service was so so, but who cares. This gringo was  in hacienda heaven. I can imagine this place gets down on Cinco de Mayo.  The girlfriend and I plan to hit up the sunday brunch to get our mariachi laced funk on.  I bet the plaza is a great place for the family to convene for lunch in the spring.  Hasta luego amigos!
