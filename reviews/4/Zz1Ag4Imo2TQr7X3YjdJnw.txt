I really enjoy this place every time I come. The margaritas are amazing and strong I especially like the guava and passion fruit flavors! The food is good too I always get the queso fundido with the short rib on top and I love it the cheese has a great strong flavor. The guac is also great the chips are surprisingly very tasty and my favorite salsa by far is the green tomatillo. The Mac and cheese is another favorite of mine pretty unique and great flavor.

For other dishes, I've had most of the tacos and all of the meat ones were pretty good but I didn't like the battered fish one surprisingly!  I've had the chicken enchiladas which were pretty good as well. Also the ceviche with passionfruit sauce was really good!

This place can be expensive in terms of drinks and things but I love the tastes so much I keep coming back!
