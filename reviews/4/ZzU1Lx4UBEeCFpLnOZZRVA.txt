The restuarant was moderately busy when I first got there.   I did have to wait in line for five minutes before making it to the staging area.   They were out of chicken and it would be two minutes turned into about five.  I turned back and the line was now out to the door......   The manager was nice he comped my meal for the long wait I had to wait.....
