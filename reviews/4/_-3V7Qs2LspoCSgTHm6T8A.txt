It was early afternoon so the place was basically empty. I was seated immediately. The ice tea was weak so I probably wouldn't order it again and plus is was a whopping $2.95. Next time I'll go with water. 

The food: I really enjoyed the Supreme Tostada Nachos. They were perfect once I added a little bit of salt & pepper along with some Tapatio.

I'll be back.
