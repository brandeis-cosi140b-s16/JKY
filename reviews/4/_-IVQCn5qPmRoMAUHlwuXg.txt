No Chumpotle
By The Rue

Closing time is ten o'clock,
I nearly got there on the dot,
The employees were closing up,
I put in my order and got my cup,
Chicken burrito with rice and beans,
They're out of gaucamole it seems,
I didn't fuss and I didn't bitch,
They even threw in a bag of chips,
Since it was late I got my food to go,
Stopped by here after the movie show,
The dinning room was clean,
The workers were not mean,
If I'm in the area I'll come here again,
After I ate I didn't break wind.

Thank you Denver, good night!!
