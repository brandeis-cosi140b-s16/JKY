Qdoba Who?
Funniest thing happened, as I walked into a Qdoba I felt like i walked into a chipotle. Yes, same thing. Except that I had no idea what Qdoba means, (and I'm Mexican) but it looks more like a middle eastern word.
  The concept at Qdoba:  All the ingredients are laid out in front of you. You pick  from burrito to tacos or just a bowl or naked burrito, you pick your protein, steak, chicken or pork and last you pick all your toppings and you have a meal. A very good  Quality meal for a very good price, fast!
 I really like the location there is plenty of parking  and right across from my favorite star bucks. The place is clean and the service is also great. Great for quick lunch or a nice casual dinner with friends.

  Some "useful," information. The word Qdoba has no meaning, it was created by Qdoba marketing because two previous names they used were already being used by someone else. "funny" so they decided to come up with a unique name and they ended up with Qdoba."cool"
