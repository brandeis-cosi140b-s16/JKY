Their chicken is AMAZING! I enjoy this place and the funny thing is I had never been here until this past spring and I have been going to school for three years now. I was the one people starred at when talking about Chipotle and I pipe in that I have never been. Silence had fallen every time. 

However, now that I know what it is all about, I am a fan! I try to go all the time when I can! I enjoy their tacos. Their rice has the perfect lime bite to it, the black beans are delicious and the cheese just melts into the chicken which makes it all the more tasty! Their tortilla chips are awesome too. Some of them have a little more lime on them then others, so when you bite into it, your face puckers up for just a second, but still pretty darn yummy. I love the fact that the lettuce is always fresh too. Never a brown dry spot on it! 

The serving sizes are massive and I think it is cool that they list the calories in everything on their menu for those who care. Depending on what you get, I feel that this is healthy fast food. The lines get long because of how popular they are, but they tend to have a process that makes it go pretty fast. Now all they need is a bigger sitting area and it would be prefect!
