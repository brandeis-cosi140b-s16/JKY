I love three things in life:  My mom, my bulldog and Mexican food...perhaps not even in that order (sorry mom!)  Because of this unhealthy obsession, I found myself cruising to the eastside of Vegas for the first time in ages (oh is this what Boulder Highway looks like?!?!).  Pepe's Tacos has won a number of the Review-Journal's "best of" awards over the years and I decided I need to see what the fuss was about. 

Well to quote my homie Bill Shakespeare "It was much adoo about nothing."  Much how I still continually wonder how Cuba Gooding Jr. has an Oscar Award, I must question what Vegas-ites were thinking when voting for Pepe's.  To be fair, Pepe's is fine.  In fact, the tacos I had were pretty tasty and the other food I'm sure is good too.  Prices were reasonable and the place is open 24 hours.  The salsa bar is also above average.  The best however?  That's a stretch as I think Roberto's is still a notch above and I'm sure there is even better out there.  Pepe's does offer some unique meat choices like cabeza and birria that one can't find at Roberto's and their taco special Tuesday thru Thursday is a great value (4 tacos and a soft drink for $6.95).  

Some of the other reviews of this place seem a bit harsh as the place does it what it needs to do for being a hole in the wall Mexican taco shop.  Award worthy?  Probably not.  Lunch worthy?  Anytime...especially if my mom is paying (sorry again Mom!)
