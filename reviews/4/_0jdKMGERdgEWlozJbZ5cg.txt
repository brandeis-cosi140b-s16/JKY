I came here on Sunday with my husband he had the regular Carne Asada and I had the breakfast Carne Asada. What's the difference you ask?. ..mine had eggs, and potatoes. The burrito was filled with seasoned tender meat, eggs, and potatoes. It had a good flavor to it but I'm super sensitive when it comes to salt ...it was a bit on the salty side for me. My husband loved his burrito he liked the fact that the meat was not hard and there where no pieces of fat in it. The service was outstanding you can tell Frank has a lot of heart and he put it in this place. Our cups never went empty and the service was very attentive. I would love to come back and sample some of their dishes that have chicken in it because I hear it's pretty " Phantastic"!
