One of the few chains I can get behind.  Baja Fresh already makes it a company policy to serve fresh food, no MSG, and tasty salsas made on the daily - that stuff you can find at every location.  The thing that sets this particular location apart from the rest is the staff.  The manager there, Rami, totally KICKS ASS!!! Super energy + inviting, he makes every visit a treat and not a chore.
