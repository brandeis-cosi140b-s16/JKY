I give Headquarters four stars more for the comfort and familiarity factor than the fine dining experience :)

We often head to Headquarters for breakfast and it is standard diner type breakfast and always good. I usually get an omelet but my boys love the French Toast and pancakes.

Headquarters does not call itself a Mexican Food Restaurant but there is lots of Mexican Food and it is muy good. I always order the green chili chimi with red sauce. It is always good with a very homemade feel.
