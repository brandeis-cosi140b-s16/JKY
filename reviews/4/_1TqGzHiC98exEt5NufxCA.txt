This place is awesome, because the owners let 2 of my Lambda Chi brothers Randy and Shogren bartend for a night. Not only that, they let them bartend shirtless and have girls take body shots off of them! The owners seemed to have a great time watching us college kids let loose and be young, wild and free.

My other LCA brother Josh aka Dj Paradice was the dj for the same night as well. Another great decision made by the owners.

They had was seemed to be their own hired securty, so it felt safe.

The owners of El Patio are pretty laid back and are open-minded to letting college students throw events in their space. It was a good night and everyone had a good time.

As for their food and cheap margaritas..... I'll have to go back another day to find that out.
