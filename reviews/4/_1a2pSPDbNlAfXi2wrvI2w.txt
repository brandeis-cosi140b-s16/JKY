We felt so lonely for home when we moved here in 05.  Found this place by accident. Now I can honestly say I feel like a party of the family.  I fell in love with the food and bring my whole family here.  I dont really care for the menudo or the tamales (sorry Mr Serrano) my son gets the quesadilla with carne asada and fries. Mom gets the caldo de res, hubby gets chile colorado. I get the taquitos. Everything is really good ...if I had ever had a problem with the food, I just tell Mr or Mrs Serrano and they fix it quick fast and in a hurry for me.  Try it, and if you dont like it they will make it right.  As soon as I go back to Vegas...Im going to say hello and have dinner with my adopted extended family.
