Came here for lunch after another choice we made proved to be too difficult to deal with.  And we wanted Mexican. Turned out to be an excellent decision on our part as we were not disappointed in any way.  My wife had a Ceviche and just loved it!  Served on a fried tortilla and piled high it was enough to share.  I ordered the Rellano tiger shrimp and it was killer!  A great way to spend an easy lunch and it won't let you down. Staff were great and the atmosphere relaxed.  Definitely will be back when we're in town next.  Chayo Mexican Kitchen + Tequila Bar, you lost us indefinitely.
