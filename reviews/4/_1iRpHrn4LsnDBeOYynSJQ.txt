Chipotle is delicious.  Way better and fresher than qdoba, but they also don't have as much variety (I'd go for fresher and better over variety any day).  Burritos run about $6.50-$7, plus you can go for the upsell with guac, chips, and a drink and end up with a ~$12 bill, which is a little much for a meal in a fast casual restaurant.  

The burritos are pretty big, but I can't say that I'm completely full after them, however with the calorie count, I really shouldn't complain.  

Biggest downside to this location is that it's almost always busy; you can expect a 10-30 minute wait during lunch and dinner periods, and sometimes just randomly throughout the day.  Also, they aren't open all that late, so you can't satisfy those late night munchies with a Chipotle burrito :-(
