Don't let the lunch line trailing out the front door discourage you, this is the A team and they get you in and out fast.  I would recommend the chicken topping over the other meats and it helps to request a dash of seasoning when you order nachos.  Make sure to get to know Steve "the Legend Maker".  Seriously, his business card says "Legend Maker" as his title lol.
