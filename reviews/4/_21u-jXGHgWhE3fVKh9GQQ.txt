An excellent Mexican and Tequila bar in this sleepy college town.  Everything here is very fresh and made with quality.  It is a really small area.  A U shaped bar, with a few high top tables, and a bit more private booths.  No TV's at the bar, which is saying something in this town.  I really like the vibe here.  Relaxed and cozy during off hours.  Though this small spot gets packed during the weekend.  Though the bartenders and waitresses do their best, and the food always seems to come out quick.

My family and I found a seat in one of the booths.  A smaller menu, with a few aps, tacos, and a few entrees.  You can mix and match 5 tacos for $15.  I love the Pastor, and Chorizo tacos.  The Pastor has a great mix of fruity sweetness and heat.  The Chorizo has a really good kick.  Fresh as can be guacamole, and the black beans are so flavorful.  Certainly not your typical mushy flavorless mass of beans at most mediocre Tex-Mex places.

The bar is well stocked.  I am not a Tequila guy at all, but the Margaritas here are top notch.  They make some really good cocktails with the several house infused Tequilas and a huge selection to choose from.

Tasty food that is more than the typical Tex-Mex joint, good bar, good service, and an all around fun place for a meal and a few drinks in this wonderful, but small downtown.
