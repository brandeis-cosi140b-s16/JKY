I've been eating Lupe's food for years, first at La Fondita, then here at Lupita's.  It's fantastic; the daily specials are always a good value, and I've had about everything on the menu at some point and I've never been disappointed by any of the selections.  The green chili is probably my favorite.  The chips and salsa are always fresh and delicious.  Usually I get takeout for lunch so can't attest to the margarita quality but I've heard good things.  The decor is a little wild, but I don't come here to look at the art, I come here for the great food.
