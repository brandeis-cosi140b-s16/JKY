Very friendly service from the clerk helping us order.  She informed us if we went back a few days later there was a special where everyone who ordered would receive a free bag.  We missed that, but at least she told us about it.  I ordered the original fish taco since I had a card for a free one from a yelp party.  I don't care for anything breaded, but the dressing was good.  Also, they do have a salsa bar!
