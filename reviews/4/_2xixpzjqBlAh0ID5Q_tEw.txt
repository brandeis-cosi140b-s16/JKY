Server Deana, GREAT!!!! 

all the food was good, servers were great too look at, outdoor seats are a plus for me, I don't like loud and stuffy. ]

Got the burritto and I have to say the taste is weird but a good weird.. Id eat there again. 

I do have to say to get into the damn place with VALET is a task. I said i was staying there which he wanted to verify and I couldn't, so i told him hey im here to gamble and eat, be cool.  He was cool and let us in.  THANKS AGAIN :)
