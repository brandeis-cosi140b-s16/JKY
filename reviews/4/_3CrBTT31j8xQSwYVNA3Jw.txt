Who doesn't like Chipotle? They're always consistently good, the place is clean, and the staff friendly. I like that the food is always fresh, nothing processed. The boyfriend always gets the steak burrito and I tend to always get either a steak bowl or tacos. And I'm basically addicted to that corn salsa. You can't really go wrong by eating here.
