Ok, so lets just get something straight here. This isn't a place for a spectacular gourmet meal or anything. Conversely, BURRITOS THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD?! Come on, it is just down right monstrous. Honestly though the burritos and other various menu items seem to be made with high quality ingredients, quickly, and for a reasonable price. It is some pretty good football game food after a few beers. 

I would have to say that although I KNOW the food is good, to people walking by it may sort of seem like a dump. Some simple seating for you to devour your pile of food and no special decorations, or theme for that matter, within its walls. Once again though, I think of this place more as a place to refuel than an "experience."
