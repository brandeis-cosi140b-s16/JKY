Small hole in the wall but very good food.  I got both red and green salsas for my chips.  Both were very tasty and spicy.  I'd go back just for the salsa's alone, but I also enjoyed the enchilladas suizas I had.  I also experimented with a side dish (chiles *something*), which turned out to be small chiles sauteed with sliced onions.  I loved the onions but couldn't finish more than one or two of the chiles, my bad.  Accordingly, I'd be interested in trying other items on the menu that I couldn't figure out.
