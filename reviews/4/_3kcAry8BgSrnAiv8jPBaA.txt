I think if this place was located in San Diego they would only get 3 stars, but the competition in Las Vegas isn't as fierce.

Everything is well priced.  They currently have a carne asada platter special for $4 which includes rice, beans, a slice of avocado, lettace, and meat.  It also includes a large tortilla.  You can basically make yourself a carne asada burrito and rice/beans while saving yourself more than a buck.

The nachos were pretty good.  They didn't overload it with beans like most places do.  They did overload it with carne asada though!  Could have used more cheese.  Additionally it would have helped if they nuked the cheese for a few seconds so that it was properly melted.

I also had a quesadilla on one trip.  Very cheesy and buttery.  Unfortunately, like most Las Vegas taco shops, the tortilla is more on the rubbery side than the flakey side.

Anyways, for Las Vegas this is a pretty great taco shop for the money.
