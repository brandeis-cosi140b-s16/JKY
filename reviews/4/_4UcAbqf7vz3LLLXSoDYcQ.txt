I'm here from Los Angeles, ca. The service was great. Very attentive n greet you at the moment you come. I tasted the the tacos where delicious n meat felt fresh. But the menudo felt a bit greasy I took it home. The menudo really didn't have to much flavor. Not enough chili or spices. But I would recommend this place if what some Mexican food.
