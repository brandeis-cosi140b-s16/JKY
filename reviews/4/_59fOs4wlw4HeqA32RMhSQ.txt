Go to the patio area, get a 1/2 Yard Margarita (or a yard whatever works for you), sit back and enjoy. 

1/2 Yards are $20, 2 for $30.

This spot on the patio, outside of Caesar's, is perfect for people watching.  And Chuck is a fantastic bartender!  Quick, friendly and full of suggestions and stories.  The bartender that come on after his shift ended (I never got her name), helped us with directions and was very sweet.

Make sure you ask Chuck to make you the rainbow shot!!! :)
