Thought it'd be like a typical hole in the wall mexican place (NY style), but it was actually like a fast food like set up. Huge portions, really friendly dudes at the counter, pretty great for mexican food i think. I didn't eat there, but it definitely seems like something you could do, but i think takeout is probably best.
