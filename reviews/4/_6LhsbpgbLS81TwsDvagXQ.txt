Sometimes I have major cravings for Chipotle and it really hits the spot.

Favorites:

Burrito bowl: Rice, fajitas, steak or barbacoa, pico de gallo, corn, lettuce (sometimes when I want extra spice, the hot salsa also)

Taco: Fajitas, steak or barbacoa, pico de gallo, corn, lettuce (and sometimes hot salsa)

Guacamole either on my burrito bowl, or separately with chips.
