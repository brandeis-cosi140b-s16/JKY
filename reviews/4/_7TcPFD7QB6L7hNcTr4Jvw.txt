This is a short review because all locations of Mad Mex's food are consistently above average.  I work nearby this one, but one very important piece of information must be shared is that almost every item SPICY.  This does not matter to me, but my colleagues often gripe about it.  It's probably about a 7 or 8 on a high of 10 Spice-o-meter.  None of the other locations have a similar level of spiciness. Otherwise, one item that sticks out is the carnitas burrito if you are lucky enough to order when the meet has just completed cooking.  Unfortunately, I cannot tell you how to time this occurrence.  I ordered it one day and the bartender told me that I had timed it perfectly.  He was right.  It was probably the best burrito I've ever had at a Mad Mex.
