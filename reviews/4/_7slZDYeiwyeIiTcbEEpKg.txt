I ended the work week on a nice note when I met Donald S and a new friend at Tacos De Juarez for lunch on Friday.  We enjoyed good conversation amidst the early Goodwill high back dining chairs, the Formica tables mixed with the old Ethan Allen desks serving as tables (thanks for that insight Mark) and crowd of diners from a broad swath of life.

The chips were good, standard stuff.  The red and green salsa was also tasty, although the red is mild bordering on hot and the green is just hot.  I recommend waiting until your drink arrives before starting in on the green salsa.

I wanted 2 enchiladas.  They come with cheese and I wanted one with cheese and one with chicken added.  There was a bit of language difficulty and I ended up with 2 chicken enchiladas.  

But let me start with the basics because that is where my judgment of a Mexican restaurant begins:  rice and beans.  If they miss on the basic rice and beans then they will have a hard time getting me back.  The rice and beans were good.  Not greasy, not dry.  Great.  On to the enchiladas.

The chicken enchiladas were smothered in a generous amount of enchilada sauce and cheese and filled with a hearty portion of stewed chicken.  Good stuff.

I will absolutely add Tacos De Juarez to my list of good & cheap restaurants.  And having been in the El Paso/Juarez area recently I can say that even though the neighborhood immediately surrounding Tacos De Juarez looks a little sketchy it is not.  For example there were no poor souls executed and left hanging from a chain link fence here as there was a couple weeks ago along the border.
