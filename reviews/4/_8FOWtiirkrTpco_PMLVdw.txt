This is definitely one of those places that I'd consider a "hole in the wall".  There's nothing special or exciting about the decor and they had Mexican wrestling on the TV the whole time. 

They serve authentic Mexican seafood dishes.  We all really liked the food that we ordered, which ranged from Shrimp Diablo to enchiladas to oysters on the half shell. The service was fine. Not overly attentive, but nothing really to complain to about.  I'd definitely recommend it.
