Ok for being a hole in the wall the place is good. All the waitresses are attentive and good looking. The salsa is on point. Im a hige salsa fan and I have to say some of the best I got was here. 
I had the shrimp cocktail because thats what I was craving. It was plentiful on shrimp but it lacked some Pico. 
The place it self has a small fish market inside and a couple large tvs. If there is a happy hour I would be here more often. All and all im definitely coming back and would recommend to others.
