I had my 1st La Fonda experience with the daughter's location that opened down in Chandler. LOVED their salsa and the fajitas. Yum! We used to eat there a couple of times a month. When I moved to Tempe, I remembered that the original location was somewhere nearby...then...I saw the coming soon sign go up. I hate to admit it, but I would drive by and look for sign updates.  I was so happy to see it finally open. We stopped by around a 5:30 on a Friday night, but ended up leaving. The wait was approaching an hour and a 2 year old will NOT wait an hour for dinner. We came back a week or so later for lunch. The chicken fajitas were just as yummy as I remembered them. I got the cheese crisp and beans for my daughter; however, she was less than eager for either. I was less than eager to see the bowl of beans on top of her cheese crisp?  Would have rather had it served off to the side rather than the bowl on top of the cheese.  Quite a bit of the cheese stuck to the bottom of the bowl when I removed it.  =/  .
