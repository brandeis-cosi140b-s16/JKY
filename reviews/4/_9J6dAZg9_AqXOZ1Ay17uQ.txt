Fuzzys makes tacos tuesday worth it especially for all the deals. They have 5$ margaritas and 1.50 tacos. Doesn't matter if you want a veggie taco, fish taco or a pork taco they are all the same. If I had to choose my favorite it is definitely the fried fish taco.

My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.

The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you. 

As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.

Overall, the best days for a deal are taco tuesday but be prepared for crowds and for it to be loud. Otherwise feel free to check it out whenever. It is a great staple to mill avenue.
