My family and had dinner here the other night.  It had been a cold and rainy day, and I was in the mood for Tortilla Soup.  Being from Texas, I must say that this is a tough craving to curb, but Loco Lime came through.  It was sooooo good.  There were a few tortilla strips along with one large tostada shell to break up into my soup.  The broth was flavorful.  There was a significant amount of chicken.  It was loaded with Mexican cheese and topped with freshly chopped onion and cilantro.  It also comes with a side of Spanish rice that you can eat separately or mix into your soup bowl.  I, myself, am a mixer.  :)  The only thing that would put it over the top for me is sliced avocado...just like home.  So when you want some chicken soup with flare, come check out Loco Lime!  And by the way, kids eat free on Wednesday nights!  :)

Now if only I could find a Mexican restaurant that serves breakfast...
