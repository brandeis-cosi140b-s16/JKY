Not bad. Food was good. Service was good. Location is excellent if you're going Downtown. Love the decor and the "alley" entrance. Has a patio for some people watching. We got a boot h and took 2 little kids with us for a late night Vegas dinner. Wasn't packed and thankfully the kids were good, so I call it a winner. Love the mojitos too!
