Beautiful location although it is hard to find parking at lunch time in the middle of the week.  The menu was small which isn't always a bad thing. They serve you chips and salsa on the house as soon as you sit down.  The salad was actually delicious.  Didn't taste like any other salad I've had before. Didn't try the tacos so cant review on those. I would go again to try the rest of the food. Servers were very nice as well.
