Everything these guys do turns to gold!

Its very tough to get in, but once you do the atmosphere is eclectic and fun.  Fantastic tequila selection. Good margaritas. Solid chips/salsa and outstanding street corn.  I take a star off only because some of the tacos could use a bit more sauce/flavor/seasoning to go with the superior fresh ingredients.  Liked the duck confit the most. Pricing is very reasonable considering they could get away with more on their reputation.
