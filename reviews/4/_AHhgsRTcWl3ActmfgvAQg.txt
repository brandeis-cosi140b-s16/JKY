There's not a ton of lunch places up on ol' Craig Rd, so I was definitely excited when I saw one open up recently that was even on the front cover of the LV Weekly!! 
The food was good. Really good, actually. I had the 3 taco plate ($6.99) - birria, fish, and carnitas. I never order birria, but it was reallllly good. And so were the carnitas! Fish was decent, but not memorable. The plate came with 2 sides (I picked beans & rice), so it was totally filling. Actually, I didn't even finish it, which is pretty rare for an eater like me. 
Overall, excellent value. More food, locally owned, and about the same price as Chipotle. Plus points for 10% off military discount.
Ambiance, however, is kinda lacking. Or I mean, this isn't a place with ambiance. It's more like a Roberto's. Perfect for a lunch break from work. If I lived in the area, I might even hit it up for a casual dinner once in a while (2 for 1 happy hour! $1.75 micheladas!).
Possibly a 5-star joint, considering the neighborhood, but it was so hot in there at lunch that I couldn't give them the nod this time. Will try Saborr again!
