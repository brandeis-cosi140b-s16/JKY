The food here was very good and the staff very accommodating.  We had a large party of 19.  They broke us down into smaller tables but in a central location of the restaurant where we felt we were still dining together.

The sea bass tamale was delicious.  the chicken tacos were additionally appetizing.  Better yet, after dinner they have Salsa dancing until 4 am.  Suck on the sangria and enjoy a peach margarita!
