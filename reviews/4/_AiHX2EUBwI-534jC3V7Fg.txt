Okay, I favor down home Mexican food, and this places rocks!  Don't expect much by the way of decor - but since this doesn't affect the taste of the food, I'd rather not pay for it anyway!  :)  The place is an institution and the locals love it.  I love the hot sauce, while my husband prefers the strong onion salsa.  The refried beans are great and the shredded beef on the nachos is the best around.  If you're in south Scottsdale or north Tempe, check it out.  You can't beat the taste or price anywhere nearby.
