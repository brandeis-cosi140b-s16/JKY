After reading some of the reviews, I probably would not have stopped in here - but I'm glad I did go because I really like this place.

No this is not "true mexican food" everyone - it's a healthier interpretation of an Americanized version.  They try hard and the food is very good - and I give them 4 stars for that.  

They have healthier options you can choose like whole wheat instead of flour tortillas if you'd like.  The Taco Salad comes with a Cilantro Vinaigrette that is yummy and light and there is no fried taco shell.  One small note - the ground beef is a bit spicy so if you're not a spice fan, you should opt for the steak instead.

Favorites on the list - Burrito (ground beef) Enchilada style with creamy green sauce, Taco Salad and the tacos are really good.  My favorite tacos are the Mahi and -- holy crackers -- the shrimp taco's are to die for!  I also love their refried beans.  Not sure what they do to them but they are creamy, delicious and addicting.

Ask for a Top Shelf margarita made by Eric and you will get a smoooooth and wonderful taste sensation.  The family and I go on Saturday afternoons as we always do and we've been coming here the longest now.  Yes, you pay for the chips and salsa but they are fresh and the rest of the food is so reasonable, I've paid more for much worse in other places that served free chips.

Go in, have a margarita and some chips and queso.  Ask for Eric and let them know Olga and Ryan sent you...
