I've walked by this place many, many times and finally decided to try it. I'm glad I did. They serve fresh chips and salsa. I sat at the bar area and the service was fast. It was actually a little too fast. I got my order before I even got close to finishing the chips and salsa. That's really my only complaint. 

The menu isn't huge and there are no combination plates, but that wasn't a problem. I highly recommend the 3 Steak Tacos plate I got. It comes with rice and beans. 

The waitress/bartender was really nice. I didn't order any alcohol but someone near me was drinking a margarita and it looked big. 

If you're looking for vegan food, they have a vegan menu. 

I plan to come back here again sometime.
