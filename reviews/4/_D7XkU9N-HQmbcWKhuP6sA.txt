I finally made it here for lunch today. Not in the mood for meat, I ordered a veggie burrito, which consisted of rice and black beans. (The menu also listed guacamole as a vegetarian ingredient, but that was conspicuously absent from my burrito.) I specified "enchilada style" for my burrito, meaning that they coated my burrito with a hot sauce and melted cheese. Overall, my first experience was pretty favorable. The tortilla was fresh and, since heated to melt the cheese on top, soft and easy to cut. Together, the black beans and rice made for a great combination, but the "enchilada style" sauce, while mildly spiced, could have been a little spicier. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican culinary experience, Cafe Rio would probably not be on your short list, but the ingredients are fresh, the food is good, and the menu makes for very good Mexican fast-food. I would definitely go here again.
