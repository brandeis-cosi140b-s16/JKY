Pretty good food overall. Definitely a lot of food to go through. The steak is really soft and moist and really has some strong flavor. The ground beef is very juicy as well. FYI: free chips and salsa for all you people with the munchies. The wait-staff is very friendly, but there is a bit of a language barrier (our waiter came back three separate times trying to remember our order, and we only had a group of three).
