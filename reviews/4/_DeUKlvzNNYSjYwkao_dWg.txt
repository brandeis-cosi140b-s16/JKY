Great food.Enchiladas were packed with chicken and flavorful. The carnita street tacos were awesome and all ingredients were fresh. They will be expanding the menu which is a plus. Will be nice when we can enjoy the food with a margarita. Service could improve a bit. Had to ask for more salsa 3 times.
