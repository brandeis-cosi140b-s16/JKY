Please get free WIFI, Abuelo's--have bypassed  stopping here many times for that reason.  Otherwise, consistently above average chain food--fresh and plentiful with prompt 
service and reasonable prices.  The chips are super thin with a variety of complimentary salsas.    I agree with earlier assessment of table game technology--tacky, unclear, and a bit sticky/germy  The decor is lovely and spacious.  The hostess might actually thank you when you leave--have visited many times, and they are generally all cadets--nice, but not focused.
