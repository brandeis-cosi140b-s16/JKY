Margaritas by the pitcher were very good.  And strong.

The taco and enchilada combo were very solid.

The chips were never empty and oh so tasty.

I'm not sure why this place got bashed so hard either.

The Presidential table was just across the way from us, but didn't glow or anything.

The prices were reasonable, but everything in Phoenix was reasonably priced.

Then again, I was drinking for three hours straight at the baseball game right before coming here.  Nah, the food was good anyway.
