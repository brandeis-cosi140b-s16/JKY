Stopped in because I've passed this place and always wanted to try.  I got myself a bean and cheese burrito with guacamole on the side and it was amazing!
One of the best tasting burritos I've had in the area.  I've had two different ladies serve me, one rolls the burrito HUGE.  The other rolls it medium size, I mean it doesn't bother me either way because it doesn't take away from the taste.

I haven't tried any other food there but for burritos, this place is the spot to go!
