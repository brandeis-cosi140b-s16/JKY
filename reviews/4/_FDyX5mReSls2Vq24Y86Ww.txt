Visiting Florence for Country Thunder and found this little old Mexican restaurant. Our waitress was very friendly and the food is delicious!! Big portions too. Carne Asada burrito and shredded beef taco were great! Salsa is really good too! If you're craving good Mexican food and want to sit to eat visit this place!!
