This is one of my favorite places to eat. The only downside to eating here is you get really stuffed every time. Its authentic Tex-Mex at its finest. 
I have eaten here about 10 - 12 times (My business partner lives in Scottsdale) and I look forward to Macayo's whenever I am in town for business or pleasure.
