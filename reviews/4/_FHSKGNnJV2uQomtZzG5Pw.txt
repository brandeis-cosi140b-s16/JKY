Went here for my lunch break and my experience was actually pretty good. I had a carne asada burrito and it was great...they didn't skimp on the meat like some chains do! The chips and salsa wasn't the best, but edible. Service was good...fast and friendly. It was packed and got even busier as we ate our food. One thing I did like...although not a big Pepsi fan, they had bottled Pepsi from Mexico, which is always tasty with Mexican food. Prices were about average. I'll be back for another burrito. I'd go here over their competitor down the street.
