Now that I have had two breakfast burrito's, I can honestly review this place again and say that the egg, bacon and potato burro's are quite good and reliable. The bacon is chopped into pieces and never fatty, there is no grease at all in any part of the burrito (usually on bottom), the eggs are well cooked and the red sauce (get two) really adds some gentle pop to the experience. The place blends into the industrial neighborhood, but there is one strange cardboard cutout in the parking lot consisting of a hot woman with a stroller which is bizzarre. Lots of other breakfast items here, but this burrito is in the rotation for breakfast every so often now. Not open on weekends..too bad because breakfast burrito's and AM football are a great combination.
