Today's visit was our third to a Mexican restaurant this weekend.  Hot tortilla chips and pretty decent salsa curbed our appetite while we waited for the inlaws to arrive...In my opinion salsa can always used more cilantro!  Today I ordered the chicken quesadilla from the lunch menu for $5.99 and it was a great size for the money and the rice was good as well.  Service was good and very attentive...bill was combined and had to be split at the door which is kind of irritating, but all in all another good trip.  Maybe Rey's is growing on me :)
