Jalapeno Sauce the consistency of Mustard!  This Sauce gets Five stars for flavor!  Be careful this is pretty HOT!  We were adding this to every dish only in small quantities.

Lets start at the beginning!  My Amazing new Girlfriend likes Mexican food, might be her favorite food so when I asked POPROCK LOVE for a place the five of us could meet for a early Labor Day Dinner, she chose this place without hesitation - I have been wanting to check this place out!

My Girlfriend and I arrive and POPROCK LOVE and her Husband had a table for all of us...This is a fun place to meet friends and hang out!  We had a taste of a non-Margarita Drink (not not,mic mic, nick knack know what it is called) Grapefruit juice? Something?  It was good!  Good enough that one taste cured me!  If you think that is funny you should have been there when it happened, if you do not think it is funny read again and check your sense of humor, It's funny! 

The Chips were Exceptional and the Salsa was very good!  I'm usually not a fan of much Guacamole, Guac seems too mild for me, yet I like the oiliness of it!  This Guac with a little of the Jalapeno Sauce was good enough that I bet everyone else at the table was wishing they had invited my Girlfriend to eat without me.. I ate more of it than the next two people combined and I was not hungry! Great start! !  ! 

My Girlfriend got something like an Enchilada and something like a Taco.  I liked the "Taco" better... Since we have not been dating that long and Mexican is not a cuisine that I am that familiar with, I wanted to eat what she ordered... One of our friends who will remain nameless (you can call him Alejandro from Ecuador and he is from Ecuador) gave me half of his meal (something like delicious PORK wrapped in a soft shell with Onions and Cilantro) This was VERY, Very Good!

Is it a Hole-in-the-Wall?  Kinda, Not to me, because it is plenty Clean though about what you would expect for the address!
