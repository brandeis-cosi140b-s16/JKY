I find Rosarita's Beach slightly better than Fausto's and Robertos in quality and in service. I enjoy their carne asada burrito and chicken enchiladas. The carne asada is not nearly as dry as some of the other places I mentioned. The prices are comparable to both Faustos and Roberto's. This restaurant is much more specious than Fausto's and some thought was put into the decor to create more of a beachy feel. Inside of the restaurant is clean, and they have the salsa bar here as well. They have $4.99 breakfast specials which include a coffee. I believe they open at 8 am by which time I am already at work and unable to take advantage. I do believe Rosarita's uses higher quality ingredients than Fausto's and Roberto's.
