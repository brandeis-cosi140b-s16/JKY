The way you order is similar to Chipotle but the taste is not similar to chipotle. This place is just so good. I recommend a try. I always go for the fire grilled chicken salad with black beans and no rice with everything else on it. I love that this meal is cilantro and lime flavored. Their cilantro ranch is basically what makes the flavor. I order it this way because the entree is quite a lot. I would always share with my boyfriend because of how much it is and how full I'd get. Place is so worth a try. There's other options of meat and different ways you can have your food prepared.
