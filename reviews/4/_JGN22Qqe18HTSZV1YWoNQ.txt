SO.... Yelp led me to this place.  I was bored and craving Mexican so I took a ride down town.  Really classy place. A lot of time was placed into the decor and i liked the vibe.  Went for lunch and the place is big and im not sure there was anyone else there.  I had come to this place just because of the review that the one girl did when she asked "how come no one ever told me about this place?"  

I feel the same.

Had a guac salad and I had a marinated chicken that looked like an El Pollo Loco chicken but it was much much much better.  I think the menu said the chicken was cooked on a wood palate.  Very tasty. Salsa was only weak spot as I didnt think it was that great.  Other than that it was a great meal in a classy place, didnt break the bank.  No reason not to go back.
