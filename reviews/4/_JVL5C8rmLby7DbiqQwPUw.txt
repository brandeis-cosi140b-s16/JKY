Chips and salsa were great

I got 2 cheese enchiladas one red and one with ranchera sauce when it came out I had one green instead of red but they caught it before they brought it out and brought a third red a few minutes later.  The ranchera was great went with the cheese perfectly.  The green would have been better with chicken or fish.  Tons of food didn't even eat the third but the red sauce is tasty.  Left overs are great.  Will be back sometime.
