Based purely on simplicity, I'm a fan of this casual side of Vida.  You can come in for lunch, have tacos and be back at work (or wherever in no time).  Usually it isn't that busy, but if it is, the servers and the limited menu make it quick enough.  Mostly come in for tacos, but they have salads and I believe burritos available too.

The menu is one sided! the other side are all the fun drinks you can't have during a work day, but maybe one day.... ;)  The dining room is large with lots of tables.  Their tables and chairs remind me of a school classroom (heavy, colorful high-top seats) and almost retro style tables with metal accents on the side.

I've never been here in the evenings, but I'm sure it takes on a different atmosphere.  A decent stop for a night out... or afterwards to soak certain cocktails up from the other places at the EpiCenter.  They've got some outdoor seating and based on their location, a great way to stop and people watch.
