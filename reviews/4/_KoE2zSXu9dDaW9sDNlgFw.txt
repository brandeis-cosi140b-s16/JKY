The Charlotte area has a plethora of smaller Americanized Mexican restaurants and most of them are pretty similar. Chips and salsa while you look at the menu. The menu is a study of how many different ways you can put chicken or beef inside of a tortilla shell of some sort. Rice and beans on the side. And served with a Mexican beer or a margarita. Most of them are so similar that they could almost be considered a chain.

Rey Azteca brings that to the Fort Mill area, where Tryon crosses over Lake Wylie into South Carolina. In a strip mall, they have a couple of signs out front.

inside, it's the same as any other "Ameri-Mexican" I've eaten at. Booths along the walls, tables in the center and such. The menu has some lunch and dinner specials. Chips were crisp and warm. Salsa wasn't too thin.

The food arrived quite hot and with a good portion. Not too spicy, not too bland. I cleared the plate.

Check arrived and for $10 with tip, I left with a full tummy and a satisfied palate.

I'd return.
