Super cute place, very open and airy with all of the garage doors and simple decor. I had the chicken and cheese quesadillas. They were totally different than your usual quesadilla. The server made sure I understood that they were homemade empanada style rather than the typical two tortilla variety. They were delicious, served with a fresh guacamole and some sour cream. Pure also has some great margaritas.
