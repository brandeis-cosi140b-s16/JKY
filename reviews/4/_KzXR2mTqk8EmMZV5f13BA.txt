The bar service is extremely hit or miss. I have been at the bar and the gentlemen not acknowledge me within ten minutes of chilling in front of him. However the management and other servers have outdown themselves other times so concistency would be the only issue. I love their margs. and have been going to them since their original location on monroe st.
