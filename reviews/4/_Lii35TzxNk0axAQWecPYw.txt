I Love Filly-B's! The food is great! It is cheap! Open 24 hours! you can't ask for more! The food is be horrible to my heath! I am surprised i have not gotten violently sick from eating there!  But i am willing to take that risk when i eat at Filibertos! If you get hungry and night and nothing else is open Fillys is the place to go! I feel like crap every time i eat there but it is 100% worth it!
