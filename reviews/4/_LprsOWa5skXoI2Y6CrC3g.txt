I have been wanting to go here for so long, especially after I read a "Best of Phoenix" review in Phoenix magazine. 

I get so SOOOOO tired of americanized "mexican" crap. I am up to my ears in cheap enchiladas, bad ground beef tacos and a weak tequila menu. 

I love the authenticity of the cuisine offered by this cute little restaurant. It is authentic and unique, because there is a wide variety of regional flavors incorporated into various dishes on the menu. I, being the carniverous hog that I am, chose the Torta de Filetito...hey steak and chorizo with bread?! I am so there...and it was comida chingona. :) Filet, Roquefort cheese and spicy chorizo on toasted crusty bread...The boy had Pollo con Mole Negro. It was my first experience tasting Mole, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and the tasty mashed potatoes and squash that cam with the chicken. 

I can't wait to go back and try the Tamarind Glazed Duck Salad. 

I was a little disappointed that our service was average at best. The man was nice, but didn't really pay much attention to us. He was a little casual, and although the atmosphere is casual, when you work in a restaurant that doesn't serve your normal americanized mexican fare, you should make an effort to make sure your customers questions are answered.
