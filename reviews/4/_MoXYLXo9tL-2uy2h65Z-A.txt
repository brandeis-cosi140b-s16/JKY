Some friends and I met up here last night to watch a football game. We used to come here all the time when it was a different restaurant. 
The restaurant is clean, with different sized TV's placed throughout for optimal football watching. 
We seated ourselves in front of the largest screen. Our server took drink orders promptly. My margarita was a typical margarita. Nothing remarkable. 
We were a large party who was not easy to attend to- people coming and going and switching seats to talk to others throughout the evening, not easy for a server, but she handled it well. 
The chips on the table were delicious! I didn't care for the salsa but the other 11 people in our party loved it. 
Our party ordered a variety of food. The food came out at different times due to lack of kitchen help, apparently. My friend and I ordered chicken fajitas. THEY WERE AMAZING. Not greasy like so many other places. The portions were kinda small, but they were also not expensive. The guys in the group ordered carne asada and also loved it.
Overall the food was very good, smaller portions, but delicious. The service was good. 
I wouldn't say this is a Mexican restaurant but definitely a bar with corresponding bar food. 
Very good for what it is. I'll definitely go back.
