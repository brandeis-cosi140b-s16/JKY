We are regulars at this location and most of the staff recognizes us. It's nice to enter and see someone smiling back at you, ready to happily take your order! 
I order the fish taco plate most of the time. I did try the portobello mushroom tacos. They were good for a vegetarian option. 
The kids enjoy the chips, salsa, rice, beans a guacamole. All of these things you can get as sides in small portions. 
Thanks for providing a quality,kid friendly, and relaxed  lunch spot! See you next week!
