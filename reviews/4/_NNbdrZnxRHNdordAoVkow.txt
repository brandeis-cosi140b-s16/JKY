Mexican Junk Food you just gotta LOVE IT. Lunch at least once a week. Brought my team here for a staff meeting and got voted Best Boss Ever On The Planet!  

Shredded Beef Taco with the Red salsa.  Bean/Cheese Tostado with the Most Excellent Green sauce that makes my scalp tingle - I think its a jalapeno avocado sauce (?) and it is Muy Excellente (end of bilingual vocabulary).YES to the lettuce, its cold, crisp and totally soaks up the junk food juice!

Staff is Always Nice and Always Friendly and they got a nice new iced tea machine so its fresh every time I hit it!
