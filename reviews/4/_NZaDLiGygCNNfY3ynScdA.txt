Not sure why the reviews are so negative. The margaritas are fantastic and expertly made. If you're looking to get trashed on cheap frozens, head somewhere else. This is a place for unique, creative and fun margaritas on the rocks. The food is very good as well. The chef puts a fun creative spin on lots of traditional dishes. The only negative was the atmosphere; the restaurant filled up quickly after we arrived and was quite loud inside. Otherwise it's definitely a good place to go!
