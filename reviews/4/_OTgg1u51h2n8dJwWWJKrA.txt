This place is around the corner from my house, so I thought I'd pop in for a look-see. Normally, I frequent Roberto's, but I had a hankering for something different. 

The place is very very clean and orderly. Bathrooms were immaculate. Tables were quickly cleared and wiped down. It's even nicely decorated. I love the neon sign on the outside. Very tasteful! Dining area is a nice size as well. Tables are well spread out so you don't feel like you are sitting on top of someone. Although, every time I've been here, it's been pretty empty.

Staff was friendly. I ordered the lingua tacos. The linqua was cooked to perfection, and they didn't skimp on it either. A lot of mexican restaurants I've been to, will throw a couple of pieces in there and then fill the rest with cilantro and whatever else.

Chips and salsa were super tasty - not greasy. I don't know what their house salsa is but it was so good. I couldn't get enough.

I will say that the food was under-seasoned, but still delicious. It just needed some simple salt or authentic seasoning to complete it. 

I'll def be coming back here as an alternative to Roberto's. The food seemed fresher and less greasy.
