Chipotle is great! I enjoy going through the line and telling the Chipotle employee what I want and watching him/her make my burrito. 

I especially like this location. They are open until 10pm and even when you walk in minutes before they close, you are greeted with positive attitudes and big smiles! Trust me, I've gone in many late nights to prove this. 

They make huge burritos with delicious ingredients! The chips have a nice, zesty salty and lime flavor...mmmm. If you want fast, inexpensive, and delicious and not "fast food," try this Chipotle.
