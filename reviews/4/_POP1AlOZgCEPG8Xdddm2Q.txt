The real deal. If you're tired of chili verde made with tomatillos then you have to go to Carlitos Burritos. OH MY GOD! A combo burrito smothered with chili verde and cheese with a margarita for $11 and change. Are you kidding? The food is New Mexico/Colorado style...finally a restaurant locally that makes awesome Mexican food.
