Yum!  We don't have Mexican food like this in Eugene, Oregon. Being a So Cal native I have missed good quality Mexican.  The chips they serve are fresh fried and delicious. The salsa, pico de gallo and green sauce all came with the chips. We ordered table side guacamole and it was the best quacamole I've ever had not to mention it came in a large bowl. A meal in itself for my hubby and me. 
The braised beef tacos melted in our mouths. The only thing negative is it is a little pricey. But worth it!
