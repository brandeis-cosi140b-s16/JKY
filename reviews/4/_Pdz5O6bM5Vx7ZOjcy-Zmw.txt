One of the things I was most excited about when I moved to Arizona, besides Jack in the Box (judge me if you want, I LOVE their tacos) was Someburros.  

I had my first Someburros meal back in 2009 when I came to Arizona as a tourist.  I fell in love with their menu... so cheap yet soooo good.  Thus, when I moved here, I decided to high tail it to my local restaurant.

It was good, but not as good as I remember.  Maybe it was the dish I got, though.  I got the veggie burrito and it seemed... dry.  The tortilla was dry and the burrito wasn't full enough, so it was mostly just dry tortilla.  I may try a meat filled burrito next time, just to see if it was the type of burrito I ordered.

The chips and salsa are excellent tho!  So is the side dishes you get with a combo meal: Spanish rice and refried beans.  Their refried beans are very good, the best you'll get from a "fast food" restaurant.

That's another thing... I put fast food in quotes because the only thing that makes it fast  food is the speed with which you get the food.  And the fact that the food comes on disposable plates and with plastic cutlery.  

Wonderful place, glad I went... but the next time I go, if I get a generously filled burrito in a tortilla that didn't seem microwaved, I'll review Someburros again and give them 5 stars!
