I'm voting this the best customer service I've had in a long time! 

We stopped into this Valle Luna on our way home, I've never been to this location, but now I think I've completed the circle.  The bartender was very polite and attentive and the waiter was also very sweet and helpful.  They must treat their employees well, cause they are certainly not disgruntled.  

My boyfriend and I love Valle Luna, not sure if its because we both grew up on the restaurant or what, but they always satisfy.  All of the locations are kinda dark inside (good if you have a hangover). Mostly booths.  We like to sit in the bar area.

The margaritas hit the spot and are around $5-8, they usually have specials, and usually use good tequila. The margarita's I had today were especially delicious,  (maybe cause it was the first 100 degree day?) I had a raspberry marg and a white death marg.
