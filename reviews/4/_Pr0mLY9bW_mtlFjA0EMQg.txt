Wayyy of strip, this was where we stopped by when we craved breakfast burritos on our way back to LA from Vegas,
Chorizo and egg breakfast burrito TOTALLY hit the spot...so big and so tasty. The carne asada fries, which were recommended, were pretty damn good...tons of meat, tons of guac and pretty damn good fries.

I was, however, disappointed with the jamaica. It was so ridiculously watered down, it didn't taste like much at all. Not cool!! But the food was still so good.
