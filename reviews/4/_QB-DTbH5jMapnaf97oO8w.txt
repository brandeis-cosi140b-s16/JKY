Some great Americanized Mexican good with an awesome happy hour.

Decided to check out supermex after a couple friends kept telling me about how good the food was. I had always thought it was like a Mexican themed bar/gaming hall, but it turns out that its actually a full service restaurant and cantina.

We came in during happy hour and were surprised to see such an extensive offering of HH dishes. Pretty much their entire appetizer menu is half off with a few exceptions. We ordered the street tacos, nachos, and carne asada fries. Keep in mind, that the place can get pretty packed during the HH especially if there is a game going on,

The street tacos were perfect. Lately, I have noticed alot of 'street taco' places pop which offer a tiny taco with a small portion of meat on a small corn tortailla. Here, you actually get some real street tacos. 3 big tacos topped with a bunch of meat (can't go wrong with the chicken or carne asada) along with a bunch of feta (i think) cheese and salsa. For about 5 bucks during HH it's a steal.

The nachos/fries were pretty standard and actually interchangeable. They were essentially the same dish one with chips, the other with fries. Nothing special but not bad either. 
One of the cool things about the place is that they actually bring you unlimited chips (which are actually just small tortillas fried and served whole) with a variety of salsas and bean dip which ends up being a meal itself. 

The serve was great despite being so busy and the place is actually pretty nice. If you looking for some good mexican food, look no further.
