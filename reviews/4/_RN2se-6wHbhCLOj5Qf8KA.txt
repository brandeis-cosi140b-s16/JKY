Imagine going to a taco shop and taking a bite out of your burrito while oil is dripping down the side of your mouth.  Not a pretty sight is it? Well, Amigos is not one of those taco shops that overindulge their cooking with oil or lard.  Thank goodness! 

Amigos have great burritos and they are huge! Particularly their breakfast burrito that I order with eggs, cheese, potatoes and crispy bacon all for $4.50! Another favorite is their deep fried fish taco for $2.65, this crispy catch is a great bargain for a tasteful meal! 

Considered Mi Amigos Tacos!!
