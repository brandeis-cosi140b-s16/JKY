Came here for dinner with a friend before seeing a show at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. Knowing it can get busy on a Saturday, especially on the night of a show, I made a reservation on OpenTable. Got there on time and checked in at the hostess stand. I wanted inside seating because eating outside during a Vegas summer isn't preferable while dressed up for a show. However, the wait for an inside table was going to be 20-30 minutes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of my reservation? Since we had a show to get to, we reluctantly took the patio seating to get seated immediately.

Our server Carmie was very nice. She was very helpful when asked for appetizer recommendations. We were torn over which ceviche to order, but she informed us that we could split a ceviche order in half and get a bit of each. Perfect solution. We tried the Baja Ceviche and the Tuna Crudo (the recommendation of Carmie). Ultimately, I preferred the Tuna Crudo. Props for the recommendation. Because we're locals, Carmie suggested we sign up for the VIP Club, which would get us 15% off on future visits, as well as the current visit. Saving money is always appreciated.

As for my entree, I ordered the Ropa Vieja off the specials menu. It was braised beef short rib, carrot puree, mojo, and crispy yucca. Knowing I'm eating on the Strip, I was a bit worried how much short rib I'd get for $27. Once the dish came out, I was pleasantly surprised at the portion. It was a ton of short rib. Very tender and I could pull it apart without the need for a knife.

Overall a good experience, but not perfect due to the inability to seat us inside even though we had a reservation.
