Love love love this place!
We have eaten at some of the Cabo's in other Station's and this one is by far the best one. It does sadden me that each of them aren't has consistent as this one.
Right now they currently have a special (obviously subject to change) where you can get Fajitas and a Margarita for $9.99 wish players card. The Margarita is on the rocks. The Fajitas are so tasty and have such good flavor.
I take a tortilla and just rub it all across the skillet to let is soak up all the juicy flavor.
For an appetizer we always get the "Chili Con Queso" it costs $8.99 but it so darn worth it. It it a good helping that you can munch on with chips then put on top of your food when it arrives. It is very thick and cheesy!
The decor has all sorts of bold colors which my man doesn't like but I actually do.
They have TV's in the bar and above the kitchen that usually have sports games on.

The salsa is the only terrible thing about the food... It just doesn't taste fresh or like salsa.
