The food tasted the same as Chipotle back in my home state, so it was consistent. This Chipotle also shares the same establishment with Panda Express and pizza place. It's very popular (can get loud) but the service is quick. You may have to wait a little to find a seat because you're sharing with the other restaurant patrons too. They don't have large tables. Most sit 4 at most. This Chipotle also allows you to order ahead for large groups.
