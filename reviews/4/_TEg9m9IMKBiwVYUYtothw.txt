It was only lunch and we were really just out for a nice poolside meal.  The waitress was so darn nice and accommodating, though, that she deserves a special call-out.  Nice work, Alicia! The kitchen went out of their way to make me a custom ceviche without shellfish, and that was really cool.  They could have just said no and sold me my second choice (at a higher price), but they went the extra mile and that also deserves a call-out.

Great chips, great ceviche, a beautiful day on a nice patio watching beautiful girls by the pool...with my beautiful wife at my side.  What could be better?
