Having had to do chemo I was starving for protein and knowing that I could not eat anything fresh, per dr. those on chemo have to eat only cooked foods. So I knew Chipotle would be excellent and it was :) beef, chicken, rice, black beans, refried beans, they got it all that will give you just what you need it's great, I love it - I have had it at least three times this month and my sister just sent me a gift card for more ;) good stuff, thank you for having such fresh items.
