Went here for a business lunch and so glad this was the spot chosen! I love their lunch special which is choice of soup/salad and two tacos of your choice. This is the perfect amount of food. This time I had the crispy fish taco and the carne asada taco then the Ensalada Fila salad. I ate every last bite of it all. The side salad or soup is a very generous portion as well...all that for $9. The service is always great and they do really pay attention to the lunch hour time crunch. I cannot wait to go back and try more items!
