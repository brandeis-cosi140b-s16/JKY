This was really good.  I wasn't expecting much, but the dishes were unusual and nicely executed and really tasty.  I had their Enchiladas Topicales, and my dining companion had the Relleno  Blanco.  Both were really good!  I eat a lot of Mexican food, but I'd never had anything quite like either dish, but they were both delicious.  I will absolutely be back, even though I live in Chicago and only visit Champaign occasionally.
