A Living Social deal finally got me here and I was pleasantly surprised.  My burrito contained spicy chicken, queso, hot sauce, rice and beans and it was very flavorful.  The margaritas weren't too bad, either!  My gift certificate was worth $30 and my friend and I got guacamole with chips, 2 burritos and dessert in order to use the full amount.  If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I'll definitely stop by again.  Especially if it's a Monday when the specials are $3 Cuervo margaritas and $5 burritos.  

A warning to those looking for true Mexican food: Mexi-Casa promotes itself as Pittsburgh's Least Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  I give it 4 stars for what it is - good and cheap food in a place that proudly celebrates Phil Collin's birthday.
