It's good to have this restaurant back. The menu is pretty much the same as before. The tacos are still inexpensive and very good, and the fried onions and jalapeno served on the side are a really nice touch; and they have the best horchata I've had in Phoenix. The counter area may seem cluttered with cases of soda, but the rest of the restaurant is orderly and the service is fast.
