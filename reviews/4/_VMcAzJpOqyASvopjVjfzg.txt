I enjoyed this spot for lunch.  They serve complimentary chips and salsa before the meal.  The chips were nice and warm and the salsa was fresh.  They served two types of salsa and a bean dip which was great as well.  

I ordered the tri-colored enchiladas, one beef, one cheese and one chicken.  The shredded beef was great.  The red enchilada sauce was different than what I am used to.  It was not spicy at all but was flavorful and good.  The green enchilada sauce was a little tart.  It seemed to be more tomitillo based rather than green chili based.  The cheese enchilada was good also.  They used cojita cheese rather than a cheddar so it lacked in flavor somewhat.  

The beans were great, they had a slight smokey flavor.  The service was very good and everyone was friendly.  I would love to go back when I can try the margaritas as they boast about how great they are.  

All in all, a great local place with good food that isn't the same as everywhere else.
