Checked out this new place last weekend for a late lunch. I was excited to try it as I love Tex-Mex of any type. The wife however... not excited. 

I was thinking this would be a typical full service place, but it's an order at the counter and they'll bring it to you place. Okay. I can roll with it. Ordered the blackened chicken quesadilla while the significant other got the mahi salad. A side of guacamole for both was worth a try as well. 

After ordering and paying, I noticed an awesome and HUGE hot sauce bar. 10 minutes later I found 2-3 sauces to try and they were hollering my name for the guacamole. Nice, large serving with warm chips. Chips were a bit flimsy but okay overall. Guacamole was pretty good. Huge serving. 5-6 minutes later unheard my name again and out came our entree. Quesadilla was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but solid.  Wife really loved her salad that was served in a whole wheat shell. Hot sauces were a nice touch and I went back to that bar a couple times. 

Overall a nice addition to East and should do well now that Longboards is gone. Certainly a better option than Noe's.... I mean Moe's. I'll be back- probably for takeout.
