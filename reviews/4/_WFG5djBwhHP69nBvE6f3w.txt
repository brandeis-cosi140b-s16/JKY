Very tasty tacos and incredibly affordable.  The cooks were both very friendly and they offer a military discount, even though they are ridiculously cheap.  The fish taco was the only miss for me.  It was a little too fishy for my taste.  But, fresh guacamole and sides with all the fixings and only $8.72 for 3 tacos, beans and rice, and a horchata.  Fantastic deal for the budget conscious!
