Okay, I know it's owned by McDonald's, but Chipotle is surprisingly healthy for fast food (although heavy on calories because of portion size). Chipotle was easily the cheapest VEGAN food in Vegas - and it's tasty.  About $6 for a veggie burrito with grilled vegetables, rice, black beans, pico de gallo, salsa, lettuce (romaine!), and guacamole.
