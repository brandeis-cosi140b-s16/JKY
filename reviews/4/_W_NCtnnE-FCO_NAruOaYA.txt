This is a great place, with a lot of good choices. You will deifnately get your fill here for your money. I think the previous reviewer got the rolled tacos, and they have traditional tacos as well which I have gotten a few times. Their shrimp burrito is very tasty and has a lot of flavors going on. Its always busy, which is a good sign.... I would opt for take out, because they are rather small.
