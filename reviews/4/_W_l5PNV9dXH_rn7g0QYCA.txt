The food is excellent. My co-workers and I love to order delivery through Grub Hub. It takes about 50 minutes but the food is EXCELLENT. Fresh and hot, and the order is always accurate despite our picky eaters' modifications! Some favorites are the mexican pizza with chicken, the chips and salsa, and the green enchiladas. YUM!
