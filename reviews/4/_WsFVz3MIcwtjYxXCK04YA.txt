I wish there were half as many Fausto's around town as there are Roberto's. 

Walking into Fausto's you will see an almost identical menu to Roberto's, but IMO Fausto's has them beat hands down on taste.

I love their carne asada and their carne asada taco platter is the best I've had. Hearty portions of high quality food. Excellent Spanish rice too.

The California burrito with the carne asada and french fries inside is pretty awesome too.

The service at this location has always been fast and friendly. The guys in the back are usually singing along with the Mexican music and look like they are enjoying their work. When you open the meal box it looks like they actually care about making it look good and don't just throw it all together as quickly as possible like some other places.

IMO they have the best fast Mexican food in town. Just wish there were more locations.
