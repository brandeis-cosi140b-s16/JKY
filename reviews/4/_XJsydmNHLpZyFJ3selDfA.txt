Some new peeps joined our team today at work, so we decided to welcome them to the team by bringing them to lunch at Rubio's!  Heck, I go there a lot, I can't believe I haven't written a Yelp review yet.  

When you get in, your taken to a clean venue with an Islander feel.  The salsa bar has a thatched roof feel, lots of windows which offers a lot of sunlight and makes the place open up.  There's a self service soda bar for free refills on your drinks.  When you walk into the location, the order station is surely the focal point, with a huge menu behind it.  The staff is super helpful and super patient.  Heck, we had 15 different orders and he took the time to get our order correct!  I don't know his name because his name tag said Shrimp and "Shift Leader."  He was super cool though!

For lunch, I got the Grilled Shrimp Seafood Burrito for $6.99.  I got the gourmet style which may have been an extra charge, but I didn't notice on the receipt.  The burrito is stuffed with seasoned shrimp, onions, cilantro, beans and cheese.  The gourmet style also includes:  bacon bits, avocado, Chipotle white sauce and rice.  When I think of "gourmet,"  My mind doesn't necessarily gravitate to bacon bits, but let me tell you, the burrito is awesome!  Every bite contained super flavorful shrimp.  The bacon bits were smokey and dispersed throughout the burrito as well.  The onions and cilantro offered a super light and crunchy texture and if you've ever read my past reviews, you would know that I LOVE avocado.  YUMMY!  This dish was also accompanied with homemade tortilla chips and salsa.  

The food is clean, the prices are affordable and the staff is on point.  Why wouldn't you want to visit this place!  Come check them out.  There's like 20 million locations city wide!
