Can you say once you've tried one Mexican restaurant, you've tried them all? Eh...kind of.  My experience here was no different than other one I've been to.  The food came in large portions (like normal), you get your chips and salsa (like normal) and you'll leave thinking, "Yeah, that was decent Mexican food."  I will say that our server was great.  You rock Elisha!
