Chronic Tacos.....is pretty delicious. I decided to go with the Chicken Taco and a Carne Asada Taco...while making it a meal. They have two options a combo with a drink and salsa with chips or a meal with chips and salsa, beans, rice and a drink. The wait time was a lil long for a "fast food" type of joint, but it was worth the wait. The fianc√© ordered the Chicken Burrito and that thing was huge! The chicken was definitely moist and tasty, my favorite out of the two. The lime rice was awesome and the mild salsa was a tad bit spicier than what I think a mild salsa should be, but I am a wimp when it comes to spiciness. Overall, I think this might be a place to go to for some yummy tacos and I definitely will be back to try more tacos!

P.S. Someone recommended the flautas too!
