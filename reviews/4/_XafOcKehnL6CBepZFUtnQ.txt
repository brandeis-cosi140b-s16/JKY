Very good food, and very accommodating given the limited menu when we went in.  My dining companion was offered a wonderful vegetarian option though not on the menu.  The staff was welcoming and courteous.  The highlight was the chips and salsa for me.  I definitely will go back and hopefully see some new options on the menu next time :)
