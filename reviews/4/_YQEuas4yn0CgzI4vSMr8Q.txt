The BF and I stopped in for a late lunch on Saturday as this has been on our long list of new places to try. We were immediately impressed by the eclectic decor with a great mix of contemporary, Southwest and classic styles. I love the lighted "brick" wall and mirrors tilted just right so you can always see what's going on behind you! 

We started with the tableside guac and it was delish! We ate every last bite and definitely enjoyed the presentation aspect. Then we shared the corn (to die for) on the cob with a clever mix of spicy mayo and cotija cheese for the right mix of salty, heat and cream. 

We finished up by sharing the pork shoulder tacos. These were fantastic and love that all their tortillas (including the chips) are 100% corn and therefore GF! I could have eaten 10 of them as they were that good! 

My only knock is that it does seem pretty expensive. Throw in one margarita and one Tecate and the total for both of us with tip was $60! Yikes!! 

All in all, a great addition to So Sco that we will definitely visit again!
