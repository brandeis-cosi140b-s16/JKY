Yum! Came with a bunch of friends for Taco Tuesday. As others have stated, the prices are awesome--$2 tacos and $5 margaritas (there is a lot of ice though), with unlimited chips and salsa.

I tried the carne asada, pork adobada, and chicken tinga. My favorite surprisingly was the chicken tinga--the chicken was super tender and I loved the toppings. The tacos are a bit on the smaller side--my guy friends had to order 5 or 6.

The only thing I disliked was the guacamole--DO NOT GET IT. What a ripoff. $8 for a tiny tiny bowl :( 

Otherwise, a great place for tacos! Also the atmosphere is super funky and fun.
