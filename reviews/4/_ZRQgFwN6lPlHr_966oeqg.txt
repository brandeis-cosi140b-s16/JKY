Best. Chips. Ever.  It makes me sad when I reach the bottom of the bowl and get the boring tortilla chips.

Fabulous margaritas.  You never feel like they make them properly until you've had 3.

Outdoor dining is awesome.  I really enjoy the outdoor bar.  Comfy and fun.

Shrimp tacos are to DIE for.  Perfect amount of food (seriously...you need more than two?  Chew your food.  Your pants will fit better.), well-seasoned, and presented with great sides (big fan of the rice).

Seating has never been a problem any time I've gone.  The place is HUGE.  It gets a bit loud on live music nights, but that's really to be expected.  You shouldn't eat here if you want a cozy, quiet, dimly lit corner booth with privacy.  It's a family restaurant.  

Big fun to be had!
