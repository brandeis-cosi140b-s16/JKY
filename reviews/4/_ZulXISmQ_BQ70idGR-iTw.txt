I like the concept of them cooking basic food for you (tacos, quessidailas, burritors, etc.), and then you dressing it up with all the salsa that you want.  This makes it easy for ANYONE to enjoy their food. I also like that they had a breakfast selection here. The food was good, and fresh tasting...I kind of wish they packed out the tacos more for the price of what they were.
