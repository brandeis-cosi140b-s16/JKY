I had written a poor review(see below) but have given them another chance and the service and food quality have greatly improved.  I am a fan again.


Previous Review:
I placed an online order to be picked up at 4:45, as my cashier was helping me a younger girl yelled at me for showing up to early....  I asked her to let the cashier help me instead of yelling across the restaurant that I was too early(the attention was embarrassing).  My order was ready, she was confused.  As I checked out they informed me my wife added quesadillas, and I said I don't think she called, the lady practically forced me to take them.  Turns out my wife never called, they gave me somebody else's food.  I love guacamole, but I don't dare to eat this brown stuff they call guacamole.  My wife tried it and immediately warned me not to eat it, as it tasted bad.

I have eaten at Cafe Rio in Utah and other locations in Nevada and this doesn't even seem like the same restaurant.  Whoever is the owner of this location should be ashamed at the service and quality of food.
