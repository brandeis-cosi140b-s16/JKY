First, I have to say, totally not what I expected. I guess I expected a Filiberto's experience. Instead I walked through the door and they offered to seat me. The place was very quaint but well laid out for it's size. However, I decided to get my food to go as I was in a bit of a rush today.

 I ordered the "La Merced" signature house torta and a large horchata. The horchata which is a Mexican rice drink, was outstanding. Best horchata I have had in years. When I was handed my food, I thought something was wrong. The box weighed as much as a half gallon of milk. I went to my truck and could not wait till i got home to see what was in the box of food she gave me.

I opened the box and my eyes popped out. It was the sandwich from hell. Now I admit I am caucasian and have tried most of the Americanized Mexican food joints and I like  the Filiberto's  type places too, but this was a whole new something different.  The menu stated that the sandwich had chorizo, eggs, ham, sausage, and chicken on it.   I was thinking YES BREAKFAST SANDWICH... Wow was i wrong.

What I got was this HUGE Bun that was Super Tasty. On it was mayo, pico, guac, a chorizo, egg and chease omlete. Couple slabs of ham, Some weird chicken fried steak looking thingy, and 3 hot dogs split in half and grilled.  I laughed my butt off looking at this thing. This looked like something one of my stoner friends would have come up with during a case of the munchies.  I decided I had to take a bite and I have to say.  I was impressed. The bun especially is very good. I was a fan of everything except the hot dogs and chicken fried steak looking strips.  Just to be clear I am not a big hot dog fan to begin with so I cant take a star off for that.. Over all the Sandwich  taste was about 3 stars. The horchatta was 5 stars. The staff was very nice, 4 stars. 


So all in all I have to give it 4 starts for a Huge Meal at a decent price, Prompt courteous service, and excellent house made Horchata
