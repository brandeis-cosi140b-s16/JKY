Big Space, Fast Service and AMAZING House Margarita with a souvenir shaker. Loud place but better than eating a burger good food. I like the tacos and felt the quality of food was good. But the perfect place for a margarita keep in mind this is a place for Tequila so not a huge beer selection but the perfect place to stop by for lunch or dinner if you find yourself with a layover.
