This was my first time to this establishment. I gave it 4 stars because they seated us right away, swift with getting our drinks, and entree.  I ordered the seafood enchilada dinner and my wife had the chimichanga combo. I am a big connoisseur of seafood, however the enchiladas didn't pique my palet. However the chimichanga was amazing. Other than the enchiladas, everything was great. Definitely going to come back.
