When we hit Madison we go here.  We could go anywhere....we go here.  My girlfriend has sampled the menu way more than I have.  I had the chicken mole when she first showed this ex-west-coaster this place, I've never ordered anything else in two years.  It's always been very friendly.  They're always busy but food is still served without a long wait. Great prices.  Last time we were there they had a sign stating they would prefer if you paid cash.  They still would take debit or credit though.  We had cash so we paid in cash.   I imagine margins are tight and even small credit card charges make a difference.  I will remember to bring cash.
