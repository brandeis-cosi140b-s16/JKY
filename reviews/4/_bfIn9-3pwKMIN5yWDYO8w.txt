Really surprised at how nice this place was. I expected a dump and got a very pleasant first impression. Inside looks a lot like Chipotle, although nothing will ever beat Chipotle's burritos in my very biased mind. They had interesting toppings so you can choose a Mexican or American style wrap. Their salsa bar was cool, although I didn't really care for any of their salsas. I think one of them was actually a little rancid but it didn't turn me off to the experience as a whole for some reason. I got the chicken burrito special which came with chips for only $4.99. Can't beat that! Will definitely go back.
