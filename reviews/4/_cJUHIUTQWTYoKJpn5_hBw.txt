This place has re-opened, I'm happy to report.  Solid burritos and service for cheap.  Good beer selection. Talked with one of the managers last night who said they are working on improving over the way things had been prior to closing (there was a sudden decline shortly before the temporary end) - better quality ingredients in particular.  We'll be back.
