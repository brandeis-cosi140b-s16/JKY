Well, still not a 5 star.  In fact, now I'm at about a 3.5.  Still gristle in the meat that made the fajita's hard to bite thru.  My wife says I've got to expect gristle in skirt steak.  Sorry, I want to be able to bite thru without a piece of steak pulling out of the fajita.   The meat flavor is excellent - great marinade. Our guests thought the chicken fajitas were wonderful.

And the margaritas were not as good as last time.  We were disappointed. Great service, really good service.  I'll keep the 4 stars for now, but I'm getting closer to 3.
