I've gotten take out here at least three times and have never been disappointed. 

The pork and fish tacos and burritos are very tasty. 
I like their green salsa, but it does get a bit spicy after a while. 

You know most places might load their burritos and tacos with rice, cheese or lettuce, but not Two Hippies. They don't skimp on the meat.  The tacos and burritos are loaded with chicken or pork or fish... I wish they would add a bit more pinto beans to their burritos.

I'm not sure if their tortilla chips are store bought, but the chips do seem like they are Tostinos brand.

I find the prices to be very reasonable. Good sized burritos for $4, a three pack of tacos for the same price.

I don't know if I would sit and eat here as the place is so compact. Sure they have there patio area, but overall the place is kind of tiny, so I just usually call it in and pick it up. If they ever serve some booze I just might sit and eat on their patio.
