The Chicken Fajitas are wonderful!  BUT--Here's a tip to ensure they're fabulous: Order them "well done!" 

Don't worry--you won't get charcoal-y bits of tough chicken.  Rather, ordering "well done" makes everything the way you'd normally expect it---nice and caramelized--the onions, peppers, etc. and the chicken takes on a whole new dimension.  It's honestly the way they should be done.  Otherwise, the fajitas come out looking and tasting more like steamed chicken and veggies.

The tortillas are great with them (I get flour) and the beans and sides are good, too.  

We've been coming here for years----it's close, the servers know us very well and practically have our beer waiting for us by the time we sit down at the table!  The patio is nice, too (when weather is not too hot)!

Their chips and salsa are also rather additive!

This has always been a good standby for us!!
