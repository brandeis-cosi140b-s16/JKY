I love this place. They have a salsa bar and the best refried beans in country. 
Try the burrito with beans and the creamy green enchilada sauce.
I've pretty much eaten everything on their menu and keep coming back to that burrito.
Service is always on top of things and quick with a drink refill. 
Juan Jaimes is a weekly stop for me and the family.
