Finally, great mexican food in Queen Creek. Small lil place that if you blink you could miss it, but I'm sure glad we didn't. I've only been there once but my daughter has twice and she loved it too. We even saw owners from another restaurant eating there on their day off, and their restaurant's food in awesome. Says alot when a chef from another restaurants eats at your place.
