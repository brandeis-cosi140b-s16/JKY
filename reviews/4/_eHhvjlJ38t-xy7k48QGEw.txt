This place serves NEW MEXICAN food, not MEXICAN food.  New Mexican enchiladas are served on thick tortillas with the "filling" stacked on top, rather than wrapped.  It's very spicy and also served with a fried egg on top.  New Mexican beans are also different from refried beans, so don't expect refried beans.
If you come here expecting tasty, spicy New Mexican food, you'll leave happy.  If you come here expecting Mexican food, you'll be confused.
Also, don't complain when the food is incredibly spicy...there's a sign on the patio with a chili pepper that says "Some like it HOT", so consider yourself warned!
