Finally made it to this restaurant. Loved the albagodonas soup. The margaritas were outrageous. The atmosphere was really authentic. I would definitely go back. My only concern was that the waitress took along time coming back to us. They were busy so I get it. The tacos were also great! The shredded meat was tender and full of flavor! Nice to find a Mexican restaurant with lots of choices. Will eat there again!!!
