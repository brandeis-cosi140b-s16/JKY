Finally went to Barrio Cantina last night. Have been wanting to go for some time now.  The decor inside is very contemporary and yet reminds me of old world Mexico at the same time.  The service, (Matt) was exceptional.  The menu offers a wide variety and the prices not bad. 
I tried the Tilapia El Rojo because I am a sucker for grilled corn.  

I had a few house margaritas as well. Not too bad. 

If you're in the area check the place out.  I liked it.
