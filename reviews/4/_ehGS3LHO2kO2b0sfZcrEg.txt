Well after having din din with the wifey I needed to get my sweet tooth craving under control....so I stopped here ti get some pan dulce. This is xalled Panaderia and Tortilleria Guerrero. Nice place great food....on my way out I was staring at the carnitas and the guy behind the counter asked if I wanted to try them.....and of course I was not going to say no lol.....the meat was tender and the flavor was out of this world. Gonna come baxk and pick some up next week. Should of taken some pics but my battery was low. Great place friendly workers....nuff said.....adios lol
