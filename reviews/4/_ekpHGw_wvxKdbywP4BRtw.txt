I know, I know, it is a chain.....but for my tastes it is one of the best (remaining) Mexican chains.  There are so many "traditional" style Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area - I find them bland and same tasting.  A good measure for me is the Salsa....in this case On the Borders uses a pureed FRESH salsa mix, with a strong fresh tomato taste.  The local Mexican places always use a cooked/canned/jarred old tasting salsa.  The Chips at The Border are also very light and not the heavy thick corn chips.   Now on to the food....the Chicken is a highlight and is seasoned very well - it is great in almost every dish. My favorite is the Chicken Burrito or Chimichanga with the sour cream sauce.
