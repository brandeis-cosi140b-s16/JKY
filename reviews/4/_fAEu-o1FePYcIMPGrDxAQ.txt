I have heard a lot about KoMex Fusion so when a new location opened up near me, I wanted to give it a try. The place was packed, but luckily there were still 2 open tables to choose from. I have no idea how many employees were in the back, but I only saw the same two girls working the whole time and they were doing a fantastic job at keeping all of the tables taken care of. Our server took the time to go over the menu with us and suggest things we might like try. 

After my "Mexican Coke" was brought to the table some complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole soon arrived. The guac was fresh and delicious! The salsa had a nice fresh flavor too. Hubby and I decided to order a few different things to try buffet style between us. 

Fried Wonton's ($1.50) - These came 5 to an order and were good! They were stuffed with green onion, ground beef & pork. The dipping sauce that came with it was sweet and yummy. 

Chicken Flauta ($2) - The flavor was very good and I can't even describe it, you will just have to try one of these tasty flautas yourself! It had some sour cream and pico de gallo on the plate as well. 

Fusion Tacos ($1.75 & $2.25 for flour tortilla) - I tried the pork and beef with one being on a corn tortilla and one on a flour tortilla. They weren't totally bad, but nothing spectacular to me. 

Beef Chow Fettuccine ($8.50) - This was the dish hubby wanted to try most. The cabbage and carrots were left out, but the portion was still hearty. The flavor of this dish was something new for me and I liked it. You can't go wrong on this dish with the price, portion and flavor. 

At the end of the meal fortune cookies and a fresh orange were brought to us. The orange was a light and tasty finish to our meal. I was very pleased with the service, taste and price here at KoMex Fusion!
