I have not been to an On The Border forever now.  We were in the area getting some work done to the Lexus so we decided to try it.  I am glad I did.  The salsa is fresh and the service was great.  It was surprising that during lunch it was not busy at all.... sign of the economy times?  who knows, but I enjoyed it ...

I had the steak and enchiladas with rice and beans and my wife had a salad.  We both enjoyed.  Still not worthy of 5 stars, but I will go back and try other things.  It is one of the better Mexican food joints I have tried in a while.  Good and fresh ... thats the main thing right there.
