They were busy but moved quickly to get everyone through the line. I tried a margarita from there for the first time. I expected sub-quality and watered down. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. It did take them awhile to make it but they offered a but one get one free as compensation. I hadn't even mentioned that they were slow so I was impressed. Love the addition of brown rice to the menu and thrilled they're going GMO free.
