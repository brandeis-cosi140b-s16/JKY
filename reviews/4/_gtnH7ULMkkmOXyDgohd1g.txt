I have been to this location several times and have always had fresh food which tasted good.  They always have coupons and other discount offers so getting a good bank for your buck is rather easy.  The outside seats are shaded, but plastic, and are close to a main road so noise could be an issue at peak traffic times.   

The salsa bar had many options, and you can take little cups home with any left overs.  The ingredients taste fresh, and the presentation of the items is several steps better than a fast food place.  There are several choices for fish tacos, and have always been cooked well for me.  I wish they had real iced tea instead of the soda fountain mass produced type.
