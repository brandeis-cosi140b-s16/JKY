Had Lengua taco. It was good but tiny. Girlfriend's taco was also tiny, she said smallest tacos she has ever seen. However, the Sonora Dogs were great. They have extra sauce and sliced pork or other meat, great combo. Very messy and great. The other customers had big portions, so tacos only item appears to be small. Would definitely come back, especially for the sonora dog.
