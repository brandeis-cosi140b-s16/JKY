Okay, so Chipotle is the "Subway" of Mexican food. 

But, you want to know what makes it better than Subway? Their meat isn't prepackaged and salty and full of chemicals. 

At Chipotle, while you're ordering, you can see the cooks actually grilling the meat! If that doesn't make you want to chose Chipotle over Taco Bell....I don't know what to tell you. 

Chipotle is my go-to place when I want a quick bite. I think about the days where I'm going to be rushing and plan my Chipotle visits - thats how much I love this place.


I order the same thing every time: a burrito bowl with brown rice, half black and half pinto beans, peppers & onions, half chicken/half steak, mild salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and lettuce. When I'm not feeling "naughty," I only request a little bit of rice and I cut out the steak, sour cream and cheese. 

I also cannot resist ordering chips and salsa. Their chips are delicious because they're salted with a slight lime flavor. Best chips in town. [I'm not sure that I'm qualified to make that assertion because I don't really eat a ton of Mexican food or have much experience with other chips ;)]

Sometimes, I also get a Corona (or two...) with my meal. They serve alcohol here! SCORE!

This Chipotle is always clean and organized and although it gets crowded during lunch time, I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and do their best to keep the line moving. 

Fresh, fast, and tasty. Can't go wrong.
