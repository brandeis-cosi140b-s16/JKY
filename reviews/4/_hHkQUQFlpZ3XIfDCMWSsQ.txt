Expedited, hot & fresh, Del Taco quality food. What more do you ask of a fast food chain?

Note: every time I am at this particular DT they go cheap on the package sauces ie: DT hot sauce or ketchup. Be sure to ask for a specific quantity or else your food could end up being free of DT hot sauce, and thats always a sad day lol:)
