Had a long stopover at the Charlotte airport and decided to give Tequileria a try - I've seen them in many airports before and was wondering what the experience will be.

Somehow in my mind I was expecting the experience similar to Vino Volo, only with tequila tasting flights instead of wine. That was not the case - this is a regular Mexican restaurant with slightly extended tequila list, mostly Jose Cuervo ( I ended up drinking Corona).

Food was good - had chicken gumbo soup and chimichurri burger. I would've like more chimichurri sauce on my burger, but that would be the only complaint. Little side of chopped jalapeno/tomato/sweet onion mix was outright delicious (had to ask for a second).

Service was prompt and friendly.

Recommended.
