Pretty good Mexican burger. Thats what i recommend. Has chorizo, bacon, mexican cneese, avocado, good artisan bun, and good flavored/cooked meat. It comes with fries. This place has good guacamole, chorizo queso, nachos, and habenero salsa. This place is pretty pricey though. Pretty good peach margarita (on the rocks). I got the chicken tacos (appetizer) and they were mediocre fyi. Good service.
