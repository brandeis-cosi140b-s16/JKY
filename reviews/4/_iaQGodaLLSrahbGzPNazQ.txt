Gave it a 4 star, open on christmas day. Buffet was clean, fresh food & set up very nice, had drinks & desserts. The menu was over priced. No usual chips or salsa with meals, need to order off the menu. Staff were good, but had to wait/ask for refills. We ate outside. Location was a plus, near the stadium. Portions were satisfying. Tamales were good. Not roomy. The table we sat at was not stable, everytime we got up or moved our drinks would spill. The chairs were bulky, I felt like it was leaning too far back, i like to sit upright when im eating n a little too low for my comfort. Meal for 2 was around 40.00.
