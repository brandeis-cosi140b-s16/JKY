Asadero Toro may not be much to look at (outside or in), but they serve high quality Mexican food. The menu may look a bit daunting to a gringo, but the employees have always been very nice and helpful when I had a question. The setup is casual with a small salsa bar that contains sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, lime halves and pickled onion slices. For liquid refreshment, you can get a cold bottle of super sweet Mexican Coke or even Mexican 7-Up (that's something you don't see every day).

Condiments and drinks aside, the main reason to come here is -- the meat! Tacos are nice, but I usually pick one of their huge burritos with lots of savory beef stuffed in a huge, fresh tortilla. The carne asada is wonderful, as is the birria de chivo (a goat stew). Their meat tastes as if it's been stewing in juices all day, making me wonder if they leave it bubbling in a huge vat overnight. 

One thing I like about Asodero Toro is that they have items that use the, ahem, offbeat parts of the cow. Recently I tried the beef tongue burrito, which was great. Perhaps one day, when I feel REALLY brave, I will try that cow's head burrito.
