I really like this place.  Not only do you get chips and salsa, you get re-fried beans when the chips come out.  Plates are fair priced and the specials of the month are always a nice deal.  I have never had a problem with the service, food is always hot and fresh and tasty.  I would recommend for sure and if you play some, your dinner could be free (or the hundreds of dollars  you lost to the one armed bandits!!!)
