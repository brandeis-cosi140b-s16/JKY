Summary: Excellent food!!! The guacamole was made right there at the table. The service was wonderful. The Marriott cheese band was great. I would go again.

My family and I were traveling through North Carolina. We decided to stop and have dinner at a Mexican restaurant. This one popped up on yelp it looked like a good place to go so we tried it out.

We shared the tres alteca and a Texas fajitas. The food arrived hot and fast. It was way more than three people should eat, but we tried. It was excellent. For new people going I would definitely recommend the homemade guacamole and tres alteca.
