Food 5 stars. If you don't care much for service food is good and portions are generous.

Another con is that they have a restaurant.com coupon but they do not take it on the phone, they ask for it on paper (boo!)

Yaay! Keto/Lowcarb friendly Menudo. They have the option of menudo with or without hominy. With pata! (feet). We went there 3 times in the past few weeks and food is consistently good and service consistently slow. Honestly I tipped just because I do not know if it is because they are shorthanded and that would not be the servers fault. Since they have 2 separate rooms you don't see what is going on.

However, in the spirit of bad service, I saw here something I had never seen before. 
Went there for lunch once and we took a table by the window that had not been cleaned yet. When I called this to the attention of our server, she cleaned only half. Only the half that was most dirty... I was like... whaaaaa? then she left and I asked a girl that was cleaning a neighboring table if I could borrow a rag... and she was really nice and came to clean our table the way you expected to be cleaned.
 
I stand by my previous review... service is slow and inconsistent.
One of the servers is very nice and friendly, though.

About the food:

* Great menudo
* Great shrimp cocktail (not very sweet, enough big shrimp)
* Hubby had pork fajitas, they were delicious and the portion was huge (see my review about the wimpy fajitas for 2 at Salsa Brava in Flagstaff). Barquita's regular portion (for 1) was like twice the meat of the fajitas for 2 there. 
* Churros are good, but extremely hot!!, please order them at the beginning of your meal. We thought we ordered them ahead of time this time but still they took forever and we ended up waiting for a while after we finished our meals.

Bottom line, I may come back if I am in the neighborhood and I am not very very hungry : )
