I'm pretty positive that  La Unica has new owners over the past few months. I originally passed over this place a few months back due to the negative yelp reviews. After having a friend mention it, I gave it a try. I mean it's Mexican right by my house with outdoor seating. It doesn't get much better than that. 
This place is your standard Mexican it's no Pacos or Cantina, but it's good! If you're looking for a quick and affordable meal give this place a try. Starting out, the salsa is fresh and they give you mild and spicy- can't complain with that. The queso is simple, but does the trick. I've had the tacos- Al pastor, and a few others, always really fresh. More like street tacos. Last week, I split the 'No name' meal and it was enough food for both of us. 
The wait staff is speedy and friendly and I've always been able to get a table outside. I'm glad I gave this place a try. Simple Mexican- I'm a fan. I just hope the word doesn't spread too much about this place, but they deserve more business, so I'll do my Yelp duty and give them a deserved review.
