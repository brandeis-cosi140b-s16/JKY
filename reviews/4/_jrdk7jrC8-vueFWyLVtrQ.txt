Dos Gringos is a good place to go grab some drinks and some food to snack on. Every now and then we will go hit up happy hour here because they have often drink specials. 

Drinks: They have good prices and a good selection of Mexican and domestic beers. Normally they have some type of special whether it's happy hour or not. Their margaritas are very bland and taste like they are a result of some type of random mix. I normally just stick to beer.

Food: My favorite thing here is the Nachos! They aren't badly priced because they are HUGE! It's best to get them with some type of meat chicken or steak. They come with sour cream and Guacamole. Their Guacamole is very good and isn't filled with sour cream or large chunks of tomatoes.
