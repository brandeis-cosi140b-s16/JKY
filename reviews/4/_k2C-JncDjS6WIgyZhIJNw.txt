1st time here, was recommended by reviews on @Calle16PHX instagram.  Love this street and the latin culture feel it has. Went in on a Sat. afternoon their service was pretty fast.  Had an appetizer of the Toritos, shrimp & fish tacos and tostada de agua chile (green) and a shrimp tostada.  A friend and I tried a little of each which we weren't disappointed and the Micheladas we're good! Plus a $15 gift certificate I had made it all worth it :) will definitelty come again.
