Gazpacho Heaven

I remember reading the ingredients for gazpacho for the first time many years ago and thinking how it should taste. Unfortunately, it never had. Until now, at Los Olivos. It arrives with chunks of tomatoes, cucumber, and onion, slivers of cilantro, all swimming in a cool but not teeth-chattering liquid that is salted and oiled to perfection. If it were just the gazpacho I would give this place a 5.

In short the service was competent but not stellar, the smoky grilled chicken quesadilla was large and well filled with cheese with light smoky flavor. The tacos et al. were OK. The decor is dated and very casual.

The three real stand-out items were the guacamole dip, the gazpacho soup, and the chunky salsa that comes with chips at the beginning of the meal.
