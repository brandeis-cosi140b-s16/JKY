Good selection of Mexican dishes. I being the vegetarian that I am always have to look for creative ways to put a meal together. The staff at the restaurant was very helpful and I didn't feel the usual rudeness that comes with taking an order from a vegetarian (I'm sure my veggie friends agree). I ordered a bean and rice burrito and it was awesome. I would come back and try their breakfast burrito some day, my friend ordered it and it looked delicious :) the chips and salsa were also great and the salsa tasted fresh and home made. I would say that the TV was quite loud while I was there but that would be my only complaint.
