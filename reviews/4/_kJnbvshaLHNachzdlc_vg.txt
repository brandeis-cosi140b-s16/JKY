* I don't know if this is the page for the La Salsa that I went to, since there is another one on Yelp nearby. *

For something on the Strip, expect it to be pricey, of course. However, a sign outside that said "2 FOR 1 CORONAS" caught my eye, so that drew me in. The prices are a bit higher than I would normally pay for Mexican food. However, the food was seemingly a lot better than I had expected. The burrito ranchero I ordered burst with the fillings when I cut into it. I got it with carnitas, which I am glad I did, because the meat was great. In the end, our group ordered three entrees and 4 Coronas for the price of 2, and our bill was just under $60. I guess we got lucky and got the better quality service, because I really can't complain about anything during our visit.
