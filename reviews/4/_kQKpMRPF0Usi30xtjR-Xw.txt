Tacos N More has become a standby for us here in the Copa.... Don't want fast food and don't want to drive to town - lets go have Tacos!   The staff are very friendly - the place is clean and the food is good.  We usually get to-go - having a Mexican Coke or Mike's hard while we wait.  Almost everything is available a la carte - though the beans and rice are good - I usually just go for the main course!  

Carnitas - yummy.  Seasoned Pork - also yummy. Carne Asada - has a good flavor, but I usually find a gristle piece and get grossed out (weird I know).  Ground Beef - also very good - and not your mama's orange seasoned meat but course ground and flavorful.   Tamales - delish (last time we were in there they suggested them enchilada style - yum!)  Rolled tacos - Very good.   Hubby likes the quac - and 2.50 for a big container isn't bad at all.  Also a nice salsa bar.  I think my only complaint is the chips - they are thick and kinda stale tasting to me.  

*insert catchy jingle music here*  Next time you're in the copa  - come and try some tacos!  And Moreeeeeee!
