This place is great, it's the panda express of mexican food with respect to the ordering and making of your meal.  Very reasonable and tasty. They have specials everday which include your beverage and a bit lower in price than the menu fare. Pay specal attention to the prep of your order, staff will ask you if you want additional items, pico de callo is good. Served up in an aluminum container, so you can take it to go, or just sit for a bit and watch the constant flow of patrons come/go. Place has outdoor seating w/ misters. This valley is rife w/ Mexican restaurants, this is a very nice addition. It's not gormet, but it's really good...you will enjoy it..
