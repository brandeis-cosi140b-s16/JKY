There was a time in my life when I was coming here every week with my mom.  I probably still would be if we lived here, but we moved from Peoria in 2005.  (Yeah, I've been going for years and it's always been consistently good.)

But even though it's been a several years since we were regulars, our server Andrew still remembers us and can bring us our drinks before we even order.

They've got the salsa down.  I could eat a bucket of the stuff.  I don't know what makes it so special, but it's my favorite salsa ever.  Perfectly thin, crispy chips that aren't greasy.  And they aren't stingy with refills.

My favorite item (my favorite food, PERIOD) is the Pollo Especial.  Shredded chicken and green chiles fried in a tortilla, then smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar.  Sounds simple, but anytime I've gotten a similar item elsewhere, it doesn't hit the mark.  If you get this at dinner it's a lot of food.  The lunch sized version suits me just fine.

Can't say how their dessert is.  I've always been too full to try.
