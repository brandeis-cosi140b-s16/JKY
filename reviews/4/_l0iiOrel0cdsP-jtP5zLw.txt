Just moved here from central California and my boyfriend and I were craving a taco salad and a burrito. I ordered the chicken taco salad and it was delicious! All of the ingredients looked very fresh and the chicken wasn't drenched in any oily marinades. My boyfriend on the other hand ordered a chicken burrito with a side of rice and beans. Note to self: a chicken burrito is just that-a tortilla filled with chicken! His was very good as well but we have never had to specify that we want a chicken burrito with rice, beans, salsa, cheese etc. This won't deter us from coming back, but wish we had known prior to ordering!
