If you want Mexican food in this area, do not make the mistake of going to the nearby Hal-O-Penos Mexican Cafe for "microwaved mexican food" and instead get some more authentic Mexican food from Los Armandos.  You can't have a bad Mexican place and start your restaurant name with "Los", huh?

Any of their burritos should be superb but the pollo asado burrito is a staple for me when I go to taqueria burrito places so please take this advice if you're in the area.
