Desnudo tacos ( tacos naked ) is not your ordinary taco shop, they don't rely solely on grease for flavorful tacos, they actually use some kind of Aztec or Mayan magic to create some of the best tasting tacos I've had this side of the I-15 in Vegas.
With my tacos I ordered some sides, the fideo soup which it was really good, alittle bit on the salty side but good nonetheless. The garlic rice was...we'll too garlicky for me, the beans where so good I could just eat a bowl of them by itself. The meat in the tacos was juicy and tender and topped with real Mexican cheese, I added some real good homemade Mexican salsa which they have in many heat levels nicely supplied in a bottles instead of the common little salsa bowls.
 This is also not your basic traditional taco shop either, it is actually a sit down restaurant where they bring you a menu and go through all that blah blah restaurant stuff and although the service is more than awesome the reason I usually go to taco places is for quick fast food style service but if they are going to take the full service route then they should at least serve complimentary chips and salsa. so next time I stop here I'll make sure I have more than enough time to enjoy the nicely decorated room, dia de lo muertos style, and listen to the not so Mexican alternative rock style music. 
 No shirt, no shoes no service..... But go desnudo.
