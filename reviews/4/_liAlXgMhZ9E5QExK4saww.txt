Overall, I really  like Pasqual's. First of all, my old man and I went to New Mexico on our honeymoon, so anytime I see green and red chile on a menu, I always order it. It's nostalgic. :)

I also  like that Pasqual's is laid back, affordable, and makes hella strong margaritas. (really, they'll knock you on your ass, so be careful)

The Monroe Street location is warm and inviting. The food is great and I appreciate the option to have smaller portion sizes. I like that I can get a filling meal for only 7 or 8 bucks. Combine that with half-price Margaritas on Tuesdays, and you have one happy (and drunk) Elise M.

I don't like that Pasqual's charges for chips and salsa. It's always bugged me! I could understand charging after the first basket or something, but the fact that they make you pay when all other Mexican restaurants in town don't, is kind of lame. Also, some of the items on the menu are bad. For example, one time I had the black bean soup and it literally tasted like partially blended canned black beans. No flavor. Lacked salt. Gross. Another time, I had something with pulled pork that I didn't really like. However, most times I think the food is pretty tasty and it seems fresher than the fare most other Mexican joints in town. My go-to order at the Monroe Street branch is the chicken tamale with green chile sauce. I get the black beans and rice on the side. It's nummy!

NOTE: I've been to the Hilldale location 10 plus times in the past 5 years, but I never **really** liked Pasqual's until I tried the Monroe St. location only recently. The Hilldale one is loud and echos a lot. It always feels cold, and I seriously think the food is not as good. I actually used to somewhat dislike Pasqual's until I went to the Monroe St one. So, if you've only been to Hilldale and not been impressed, then give Monroe St. a try before writing it off completely.
