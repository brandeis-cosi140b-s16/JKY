I had almost given up on Mexican food in Phoenix.  I tried this place on a Friday during lunch.  I had a combo meal that included a taco and cheese enchilada.  This restaurant is one of my new favorites.  The cheese enchilda was a great choice.  Excellent flavor.

The taco was also nice and crispy, and the beef had great flavor.

The chips and salsa were very good.  The salsa was not the best I have ever had, but very good.  I wish they would put the salsa in bowls.  I cant stand eating salsa off of plates.

I will definitely return to this location.  Great food and service.
