A light meal is nonexistent at Chipotle. Even when getting a salad, the staff piles heaps of each ingredients into the bowls. As stated by their board, all of the protein choices are raised in hormone and antibiotic free conditions and the veggies are mainly organic. Which means the copious amount in front of you will only put you into  a food coma.

The options are limitless. With the availability of brown rice and black beans makes me happy. The pile of shredded barbacoa only adds to my delight. The dressing is not my favorite. It is unnecessary with their pico, roasted corn, mild and hot salsas. For a quick meal, Chipotle does hit the spot.
