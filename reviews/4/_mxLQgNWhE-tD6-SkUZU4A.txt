We stepped inside for dinner after a long work day, eager to try this new restaurant. In addition to your standard burritos, chimichangas, and tacos, they also offer options like sopes and have a small American style menu for those not wishing to eat Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant :). 

We were seated immediately at a bright, comfortable booth. The decor is very festive and lively, with warm gold and yellow tones echoing throughout the restaurant. I loved the atmosphere, the unique tables, and the vivid, multi-colored cloth napkins. As soon as we were seated we received some chips and salsa. Both were quite good. The salsa was green and was filled with fire roasted green chiles, adding a nice spicy kick to go with the light, crisp chips. We looked through the menu and I decided on a 2 item combination plate ($8.95) with chile relleno and chicken enchilada, and. I also tried some carnitas chimichanga. 

The chile relleno is a lighter version of what I usually see in restaurants. The poblano chile is not breaded and fried, but still stuffed with cheese. I enjoyed it, as the chile was perfectly cooked with good flavor. The chicken enchilada was filled with shredded white meat chicken. Again, it tasted like a lighter version of what I usually see in most restaurants. The rice was green, which was a unique twist, and had a more delicate flavor. The refried beans were decent, no complaints. The carnitas chimichanga was filled with tender carnitas pork, and I could taste a hint of cumin in the mix. Like the other components of my meal, this dish also had more of a delicate flavor.

Service was friendly and cheerful and we were checked on as needed. 

They also have a breakfast menu that I might like to try some day. If you're looking for lighter tasting versions of Mexican favorites in a sunny, cheerful atmosphere, you've come to the right place!
