Small and neighborhoody, this is a "joint," plain and simple. Tacos are $3 a piece, drinks are $2 (oh, and no fancy pants cocktails here ... just sodas--all made with cane sugar--and water). And folks, it'll be the best $10-$15 you ever spend on tacos. 

There are 5 choices: carnitas (pork), chicken, spicy beef, American (read: NOT spicy) beef, and vegan. Dear GOD, are these tacos good. We (my adventurous eating kids and I) had an assortment, but agreed that the carnitas was far and away the best. We also had some refried bean dip, hot and steaming and yummy on a cold fall day, to mix things up a bit. 

There are just a few stools to sit on around the counter, and the folks who create this delicious goodness are friendly and chatty (and who totally indulged my daughters games and party tricks, which are endless).

Super solid choice of yum in the South Side (I want to go back today!)
