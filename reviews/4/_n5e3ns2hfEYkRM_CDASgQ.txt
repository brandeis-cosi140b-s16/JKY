I have been to Los gemelos a million times and I think it is because they are doing many things well. The owners (which is a big family) and the whole staff are always nice and make you feel at home. They make all their food from scratch and offer a variety of items to choose from. There is always a menu on the tables but they also have a menu board where they write down the specials of the day. 

The chips and salsa as other mentioned, are ok. My favorites are, the tacos campechanos (a mix of steak and chorizo), quesadillas (with cheese only), the green chicken tamales (which are served only on weekends), the dough it's really tasty and the chicken and tomatillo salsa filling has the right level of spiciness (I always ask for a side of crema mexicana (a table cream, not sour at all), it adds a nice refreshing element to the spicy tomatillo salsa. I also like their chipotle chicken soup, spicy and smoky at the same time, however, it is not available everyday, so you would need to check on that.

They also have a lot of mexican beverages, juices and even beer. For some people their "grab yourself" your beverage system from their coolers could be kind of confusing but I think it's kind of cool to choose your own and take a peak of their grocery store as well, it's like taking a tour while you wait for your food ;)  they have a bar area and I don't know if they serve cocktails that they can bring you, but as far as the beverages where you serve yourself is concerned, once you are ready to pay at the counter they always ask what kind of beverage you got and they charge you accordingly.
