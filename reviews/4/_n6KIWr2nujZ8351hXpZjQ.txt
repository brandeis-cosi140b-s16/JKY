i'm neither nexican nor an expert on mexican food ... but this was tasty!  nearly as authentic as i could imagine.

disclaimer:  i didn't enter the restaurant; i only ate food carried out from the restaurant.

+1 for fantastic tacos, both beef and chicken.  our family ordered 15 of them for dinner.

+1 for great beans.  i've found this to be a great measure of a mexican restaurant.

+0 for unsalted chips

+1 for great prices.

recommended.
