Love trying new places, heard this place had amazing Mexican food... Let me tell you it was delicious! The salsa bar and guacamole.... Oh my... BUT the only thing that held me back from giving 5 stars was because of the bartender, our waitress was amazing but the bartender was helping too. She would hand out food from over the pony wall near the bar while the waitress was getting our order... Or reach over the pony wall to get old dishes... It was the most oddest thing I've ever had happen at a restaurant.... Other than that food was amazing even the margaritas!!
