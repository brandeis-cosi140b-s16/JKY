I go here with a friend about once every couple of weeks. Thus far the food has been very delicious, though the staff is hit and miss. Sometimes they are helpful and attentive, other-times you might have to wait around for a few minutes before they get to your order. 

Also, you must be specific with what you want on your food. For example: if you want extra beans, speak up!

The seating is a bit small, but that's because half of it is reserved for the patio area which is just lovely. Overall a decent place, I'd call it the Subway of Hispanic food.
