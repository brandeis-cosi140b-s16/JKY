soooo....my love of my life, (MLML & AKA the Hubby) decided to go to 2 Dos Potrillos after passing by the District where we were planning to go.  This is not our first time visiting 2 Dos Potrillos...probably our 4th or 5th time...maybe even 6th time within the last year that we have been here.
One reason is the MLML loves the mole sauce they make and he always orders the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.  
Of course he orders the same meal and adds pico de gallo with jalapenos.  I love pico de gallo but never had it with jalapenos.  Well he adds the pico de gallo  to the wonderful salsa that they automatically bring to the table with chips and it was so hot, I had to wave the owner/waiter down to get me some milk!  My tongue was sizzling!  MLML loved the spicyness!
The tortilla chips are also very crispy.
I ordered the pork carnitas which was like a pulled smoked pork with the seasonings that were very distinct and tasty.  It also came with rice, beans, sour cream and guacamole. 
Also after reading one of the reviews for this restaurant, we did not hear any microwave beeps going off.  Actually we were the only ones there for awhile and the owner was just great! 
We will be back...!
