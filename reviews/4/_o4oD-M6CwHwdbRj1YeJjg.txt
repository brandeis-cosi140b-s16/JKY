Great tasting Mexican food on the cheap! Better- tasting than many of the sit-down Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. It's a small little place with a dine-in or drive-through option. Many delicious items to choose from...my favorites are the steak and cheese quesadilla, cheese enchiladas, frijoles, and their awesome salsa!
