***update*** I wrote a letter to the store to share my dissatisfaction. Normally I love chipotle and this experience was not the norm for me. They have done everything they can to apologize and take the feedback. I'm impressed because often any feedback good or bad is pretty much ignored. I have received an email and a phone call to discuss. I appreciate that and that says a lot about the store and taking customer feedback seriously. 

Thanks chipotle and the chipotle managers. 



Normally I like chipotle and am relatively satisfied. But I've never been to this location nor will I return. It makes me wary to go to another location as well to be honest.

We arrived and waited for them to finish a phone ahead order I'm guessing. No problem there. Then it was our turn. They skimped so much on the meat that my husband ordered a 2nd helping of meat. That cost 3 bucks. No one said how much that would be. He also ordered guac and sour cream. We assume charges for those but no one said how much. You should always say how much.

I was next with tacos. They put a comically small amount of meat on my tortillas and she tried to spread it out to look better I guess. Then she asked me a question. I didn't hear her so I said "I'm sorry what was that?" And she stared at me. Just stared. Lady what did you say?! So I tried to guess and said "salsa? Medium please." And I watched as she tried to put Pico on my tacos. Ew no!!! So I said "wait uh..." and the guy next to her told her which one. She was clearly frustrated and grabbed a salsa and put it on my tacos. I assumed it was medium. It was green. 

We got to the end and walked out for 22 bucks. For a burro and 3 tacos. No drinks or anything. So that kind of price I should have a waiter and a margarita lol. 

It's definitely not worth the price to get "mexican food" from chipotle. Especially not that location where they skimp on your meat, 2nd helping of meat, and extra condiments.
