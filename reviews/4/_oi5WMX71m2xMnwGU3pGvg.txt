This place had the perfect happy hour for a trio of budget travelers.  $5 taco and 24oz tecate!!!!!  Plus $6 LAYERED nachos!  The taco was so-so, but the nachos were actually some of the best nachos I've ever had in my life.  They were so loaded up with goodies that we had to ask for extra chips to finish them off!!!  Also, we were lucky to stop in on a Thursday, which happens to be the day to get $13 dollar bulldogs (margaritas with a pacifico poured in...normally $18!).  Service was a wee bit slow, but it wasn't so bad that it really phased us.
