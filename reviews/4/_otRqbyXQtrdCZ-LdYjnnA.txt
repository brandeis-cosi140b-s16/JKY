came here late on a Thursday night.
My wife and I split the Del rey torta and i really liked it. I would order it again. also ordered a watermelon fresca that was really good also. 
the sandwich came with potato chips which we all thought was weird because we were at a Mexican restaurant but it was a sandwich i guess but still would rather had tortilla chips.
