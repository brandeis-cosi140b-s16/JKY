Have been here three times.  Once with wife and 2 kids, and twice with work buddies.  All 3 times the food was excellent, the service was top notch, and the atmosphere was fine.
Visit 1: The Camarones Special recommended by the server was incredible.  It was Friday so they had cheap Dos XX Lager deal going.  Wife's meal was a quesadilla that was huge and delicious.  
Visit 2: Got the Carne Asada Tacos, also chosen by same server.  She has great taste.  These were incredible.  More Dos XX Lager.  Buddy got Chicken enchiladas and said the "best he ever had."
Visit 3: Acalpulco(?) Fish Tacos.  Not bad.  Huge meal and I was starving so that worked out.  It was a different server so I went out on my own.  Shows what I know.  Still a great time and I do not regret my choice.  Look forward to trying more from 1900.  Did try the guac, which was pretty good.

I will be disappointed when my work in Charlotte is over.  This place is great.  The missing star?  Their salsa is average at best.  The corn relish is great, but salsa needs improvement.
