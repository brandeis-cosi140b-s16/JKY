The King Taco of Vegas !

I love this place. Get the Adobada Pork! The sauces arent as spicy as the King Taco sauces but their sauces are on point. I usually get the tacos. The Carne Asada fries and the Adobada fries were both fails. Stick to the tacos. Its a little off the strip but its worth it. This is the perfect place to come when you're hungover and broke from losing all your money on the strip.
