This is as close as you get to authentic Mexican/Central American food in Charlotte.  The key to most any kind of good cooking is fresh ingredients and the ingredients here are as fresh as you will find around these parts. But, having just come back from Arizona, I can tell you that the Mexican food around here simply doesn't add up to what is available in that part of the country.  I really can't figure that out.  Anyway, like I said, for around here, worthwhile.
