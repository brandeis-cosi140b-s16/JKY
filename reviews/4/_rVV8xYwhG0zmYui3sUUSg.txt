We have been to this restaurant a handful of times.  Service is usually pretty good.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip are amazing.  We love their lunch specials, usually around $6-$8 ea. and dinner menu pricing is not too bad either.  The restaurant is not very busy, and the food is delicious!!!  We haven't eaten anything we haven't liked.  They make really good tamales too!
