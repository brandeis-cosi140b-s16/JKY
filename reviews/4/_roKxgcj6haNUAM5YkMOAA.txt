I had to stop by since all the ones around me are long gone.  The steak nachos are to die for, no skimping here, plenty of guacamole and sour cream.  This location is super clean and has a well stocked salsa bar.  I had totally forgotten about the pineapple salsa! so good!  Prices are on the high side but if you join their email club they will send coupons regularly.
