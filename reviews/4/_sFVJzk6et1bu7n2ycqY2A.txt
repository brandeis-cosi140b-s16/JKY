MMMM Robertos! I love Mexican food! Like so much that if I had to choose one type of food to eat for the rest of my life it would be Mexican! Roberto's does the trick, it's not the best in town, in my opinion but for a 24 hr joint, they rock out the goods in fast and friendly manor. I love to practice my Spanglish here, I feel less judged anyhow, the enchilada was probably my least favorite thing I order.
