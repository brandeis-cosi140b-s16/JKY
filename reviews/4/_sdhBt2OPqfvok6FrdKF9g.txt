I had Del Taco 13 years ago for the first time. I recall having thoroughly enjoyed that fluffy flatbread taco with grilled steak. So, it is a wonder I never made it back, until recently. Thanks to this location, I have delicious crispy chili cheddar fries at hand when the craving hits. Now, don't turn me into a liar, you must consume the fries immediately so they are crispy to the end. Of course, if you let them sit in the carton on your drive home, they will be a soggy disappointment. Oh, Joseph had me take a bite of his bacon double del and it is great, too.
