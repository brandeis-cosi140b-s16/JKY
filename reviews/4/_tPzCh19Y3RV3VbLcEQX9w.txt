I could eat here most everyday if my waist line wouldn't mind. Since I can't do that, I manage to sneak in a couple times a month. The ground beef nachos are to-die-for!!! Their queso is the bomb. And their chips are excellent and very fresh. If you love fresh salsa and friendly service, this is the place to go in the University area.
