The food was legit.  I think this place is a sleeping giant, but they are not quite ready for a busy show.  Being very picky, the CRUZ margaritas were a bit pricey shrink the glass option.  I like less mix and more tequilla.  Other than that, it is good food.  The green salsa was interesting as I could not distinguish what type of cheese was added.  Hoping queso fresco, but probably velvetta.
