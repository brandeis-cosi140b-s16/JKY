Let me tell you a story about a time i went down to Mexico... eh maybe not... not appropriate for yelp

But let me do tell you about taking a venture through Mexico right here in phoenix. I love and I mean I LOVE tacos. I enjoyed lunch here today with some coworkers and had the al pastor burrito and al pastor tacos. Holly goodness batman!! 

Tacos are like right from the streets of Mexico, they are delicious! The al pastor was awesome flavor and really good. The burrito was also very good, the handmade light flour tortilla was perfect. 

The only problem? 
I couldnt eat more...

I will definitely be back and

My search for a great taco has come to end end
