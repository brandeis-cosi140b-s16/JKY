Not as good as I remember when I was a kid (much more grease over the past couple of years), but still a place everyone should experience. Their hot sauce is the BEST!! My husband asked why they didn't sell it by the bottle. Apparently, it is made from all fresh ingredients. To bottle it would ruin the flavor because of all of the preservatives. Bummer, because now I live in California and can only dream about the burritos!
