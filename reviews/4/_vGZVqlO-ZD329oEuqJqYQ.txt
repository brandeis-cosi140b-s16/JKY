A recent purchase on the Restaurant.com website brought us here, and I was pleasantly surprised.

-Chips and Salsa.  You get regular salsa, as well as a pico de gallo-type corn salsa.  Delicious, and with free refills.

-Appetizer.  We got the cheese dip.  This was very good, even though I suspect it was from a jar.  Still, it's pretty hard to mess up cheese dip.

-Bevs.  It being Sunday, margaritas were $3.  They were fine.  For $3.  a bit weak, but again, $3.  I noticed that some very good drink specials were featured on other days of the week, including a $2 pint night on Fridays.

-Entrees.  I had the "Fajita Salad,"  for $10 with carne asada.  The steak was a little bland, but the rest of the salad really made up for it.  The taco shell was still warm, and the salad didn't have an overly large amount of the shredded iceberg so common to taco salads.  There was a generous amount of cheese, sour cream, and the "good" type of jalapeno (not too spicy, kelly green).

My boyfriend ordered the "pick three" combo for $9.25.  It came with three items of your choice (enchilada, taco, etc) as well as rice and beans.

Service.  Our waitress was very attentive and prompt.

All in all, this place is worth a visit.  On a side note, they feature probably more than 80 tequilas.
