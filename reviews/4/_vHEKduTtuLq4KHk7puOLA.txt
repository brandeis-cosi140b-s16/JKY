I always buy the same thing when I go to a Mexican food restaurant: a bean burro, enchilada style (red sauce). It's a simple item, but it's my all-time favorite food. I thought the burro and the enchilada sauce were excellent. Having a side of beans with my bean burro sounds redundant, but they were yummy. I liked the rice as well. I also would have liked to order a burro by itself without getting the beans and rice. Eating too much wreaks havoc on my six-pack abs. Okay, I admit it. I actually have a one-pack, but it would be great to have the choice of getting items a la carte. I thought the chips, salsa, and red sauce were all good. All the servers and greeters were very friendly. I sat at the bar and watched the 2012 Summer Olympics as I ate. I think they had three (or four) flat screen TVs in the bar. On one of the TVs tonight, the Diamondbacks were playing the Dodgers. I hope La Fonda is successful at their new location. Including the tip, my bill was about $14.00. That is a tad steep for someone who really only wanted a bean burro, enchilada style. I will go back, but I'll have to reduce my normal number of visits because of the cost. I added some photos of my dinner and of the outside of La Fonda, which is located just east of McClintock Rd, on the south side of Baseline Rd.
