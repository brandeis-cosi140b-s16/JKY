The reviews of the new C4 have done a really good job, so I will make this short.  I had never been there before, so I can't compare it to how it used to be.  My experience on Valentine's Day with a group of 10 was wonderful...very friendly server who did not mind answering all of our questions and knew quite a bit about the new menu; nice decor (loved the hanging crystal pieces); and, for the most part, good food. My husband and I split three of the appetizers for our main meal-crabcakes, sliders, and chicken quesadillas. I liked the quesadillas quite a bit and my husband enjoyed the sliders. However, I didn't like the crabcakes at all...I'm a very very picky crabcake girl and unfortunately I am still looking for good ones out here in the Valley.  There was no lump crabmeat in either of my cakes and they were too flat...I prefer fat and small cakes to big, flat ones. Plus the filler to crab ratio was much much too high.  I will say that I did enjoy the remoulade quite a bit though.  The desserts that I tried were delicious...the Mexican flourless cake was divine and I really liked the pop of spice.  The seven layer chocolate cake was moist and not too rich at all. 

My husband and I found the prices very reasonable for the most part...the appetizers we ordered were all under $8 and it's hard to find that in most places nowadays.  We ventured up to the rooftop before dinner and it was beautiful. I will definitely be going back when it gets a little warmer out to enjoy music, the view and drinks up there with friends.
