Went with some awesome industry folks to check out Patron last night - SUPER fun environment, and I felt like I was legitimately in Mexico again! YAY! 

Great frozen margaritas, and the Enchiladas Mexicanas were a big hit among us. 

PLUS! Free chips & salsa! We all agreed that there really isn't anything better than that.

That staff is fun and friendly, and they have a nice variety of tequila (naturally). Definitely a great addition to E. Lib.

Check it out!
