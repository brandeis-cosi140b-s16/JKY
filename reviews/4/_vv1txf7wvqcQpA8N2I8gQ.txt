Love the food. I eat here about once a week and I almost always get something different. taco Tuesdays are crazy busy, but if you go a little later it has calmed down. I especially love the "Trainer Salad" with chicken. I will say that sometimes the food isn't consistent from one time to the next even if you order the exact same thing. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it is made fresh and they are humans. However, they can occasionally mess up your order, but will fix it for you no problem. I love that it is family owned and the staff is friendly. Can't wait to go again... next week.
