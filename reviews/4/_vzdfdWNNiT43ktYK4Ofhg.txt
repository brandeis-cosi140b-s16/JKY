Marisol and Martin were working today at the (day before) Labor Day party I attended with my family. It was a Mexican themed fiesta, with authentic food thanks to taqueria Guadalajara!  Brilliant and oh so fitting...and the tacos were delicious. 

Guests had their choice of rice, beans, and tortillas with chicken, pork or beef (I had chicken) + a huge condiment bar including veggies, chips, and several types of salsa.

I am not sure what the cost was to bring these guys in, but I totally may have to "borrow" this idea for future entertaining needs. Gracias amigos... Ojala probarte restaurante y verte mas en el futuro pronto!
