I really, really like this place.

I've been to Charlotte two weeks in a row for business.  On the first trip I discovered Zapata's by accident.  On the second trip I came back because I liked the first meal so much.

Situated on a small man-made lake in a modern mixed development, you can enter the upper entrance (which is more strip-mall esque) or from the patio on the water (which is a little more unique feeling).  I have eaten inside downstairs (which felt cave-like in a very cozy way) and upstairs on the deck (which was delightful).  

I've ordered the Tacos Al Carbon and Tacos De Cerdo Al Horno.  Both dishes came with crumbled queso fresco on top, a simple yet clever garnish that made my food look EVEN MORE DELICIOUS.  Both dishes came with a side of a very unique pico de gallo: rather than diced vegetables, this was made from delicately thin strips of onions and peppers.  In addition to the flavor being top-notch, the presentation and mouth-feel was unique - I wish all places made their pico like this.

The top-shelf margarita, curiously always on sale, was very good.  Nothing particularly special, just a good margarita.

The Tacos Al Carbon were good, but not nearly as good as the De Cerdo Al Horno.  Amongst hundreds of meals at mexican places over my life thus far, the carnitas taco things stand out.  Way out.

And finally, with your check comes a complimentary dessert: a sweet fried tortilla topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream, drizzled in honey.
