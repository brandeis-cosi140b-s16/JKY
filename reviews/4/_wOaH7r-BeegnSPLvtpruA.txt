As far as my prowess on burritos go, I would have to say that Zaba's is up there with Chipotle as the top 'fast-food' quick service burrito-crafters around.

The two restaurants are very similar in the simplicity of their menus, but Zaba's just edges out the competition with the addition of some seafood options which I have yet to sample.

I have been to this location a handful of times and I have gotten the carne asada burritos and the pork burritos. I usually only grab a complimentary water cup with my order, and after stuffing the burritos with double-protein my total always ends up being around $11. It does seem a tad bit pricey, but the ingredients are fresh enough to warrant me shelling out the scrilla. They even offer two types of potatoes as ingredients to put inside the burrito. Typically after I grab my food and water I make sure to snag a bottle of the Chipotle Tabasco. Not sure why, but for some reason I go crazy for the stuff. I usually already add green hot sauce to my burrito during its construction, and there is something about that smoky chipotle flavor that makes the meal for me.
