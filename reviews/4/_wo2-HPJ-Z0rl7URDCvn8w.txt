Skirt steak was yummy! The portion was huge, perfectly cooked and had sides of rice & beans. I don't think there was any fat at all! 
Their salsa is very tasty. The bar is well stocked, especially with many brands of tequila! 
They were featuring 2 Maui Brewing varieties in cans, and I had the Coconut Porter, which is just as good outside of the island!
The patio was busy, as it was a rare, not sizzling hot August evening! 
I like this place though I don't get out to the Lake much anymore. Sonrisa has a lot of happy hour and other daily deals, like AYCE Taco Tuesdays, that are worth making the trip for!
