Be careful during happy hour. Shocktop is considered a craft beer here so they will charge you more for it.

That said what is cool about this place is the Bloody Mary bar.  You can totally fill up your cup with almost anything and everything there and create your own mix of stuff.

After that the food is good and overall a great lunch stop.
