Stayed at the Grand Hotel which the Commissary is apart of and this place is good. Happy Hour prices and choices are pretty good and the food is good too. I had a burger and it probably was the best burger I've ever had. Add in the friendly staff plus the good food and you've got to make a stop. Besides the burger and bar there is also coffee bar and a taco place. It was so good my friend's and I went twice. They don't open too late I don't think but if you are in the area and want a good burger and a beer, give The Commissary a try.
