When I need Mexican in a pinch and don't want to walk in and order. I've only ever had the rolled tacos, pretty much the only thing I ever order at these fast food Mexican restaurants. Don't know why though but that's not the point haha. They are big, crispy and filled with a decent amount of meat. Comes with sour cream, cheese and guacamole on the top and rice and beans on the side. I don't know why but I really don't care for the guacamole. It tastes gross and overly processed. My mom makes guacamole from scratch and it definitely does not taste like avocados at all. Keep forgetting to tell them to take it off but that's my fault. Overall it's a great place for Mexican on the go. I prefer Mi Familia down the road but they don't have a drive-thru. Makes it hard to get good food with groceries in the car during summer time.
