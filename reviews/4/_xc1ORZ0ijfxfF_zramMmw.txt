My wife and I decided to go to Abuelo's for dinner on our first wedding anniversary this past weekend, because we wanted Mexican food in a classy setting. For this purpose, Abuelo's was a good pick. Even though we had been there before to watch a football game in the bar area, there is good separation between the bar and the dining room. The dining room itself is classy, with great artwork and Mexican architecture. In many of the Mexican restaurants I've visited, the feeling is a bit more cave-like; Abuelo's, however, has a very open feel with good lighting and a vaulted ceiling. 

Service was extremely friendly. We loved our server, Patience, who gave us plenty of time to enjoy ourselves and our meal. Food came quick and was delicious. 

The price was surprisingly affordable. Our meal included two drinks, appetizer, main dish, and dessert for a total of $43. We were shocked, but pleased! Of course, we tipped Patience bigtime. She deserved it.

If you want an authentic Mexican restaurant feel, Abuelo's is probably NOT the place. Overall, a good spot. I'm sure we'll go back many more times.
