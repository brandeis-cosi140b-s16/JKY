When I lived in Phoenix and worked the graveyard shift, my only choices for food in the middle of the night were Whataburger and Roberto's.  Now, all these years later, I have a Roberto's close to my house at the Gibson location.  Gourmet food this is not - but for a quick lunch that will fill you up or after a night of cocktails, it's the perfect choice.  The prices are reasonable and oddly enough, I always order the same thing and never deviate.  The food just tastes so good, though sometimes I question the quality of the meat.  There is plenty of seating available, but I usually order take out and eat at home.  This establishment is always clean, including the restrooms, and the staff have always been friendly.  It's a great alternative to the traditional fast food outlets.
