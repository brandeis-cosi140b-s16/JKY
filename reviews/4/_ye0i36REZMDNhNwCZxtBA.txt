Hot and fresh are the first things that come to mind.  Made fresh to order, plentiful portions - it is the ideal street food.  I ordered the beef burrito and the carne asada fries.  Hot plentiful and fresh they are.  My quibble is would prefer a more robust seasoning for the beef, but still had good yet subdued flavor.  I would say the carne asada fries is best described as "Mexican Poutine" - true booze munchies. Look forward to trying other items.
