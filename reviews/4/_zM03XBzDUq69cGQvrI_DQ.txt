I am really happy to write this updated review, and I'm glad I went back to give them another chance! The food has improved significantly since last year, and I'm in love with their red salsa/hot sauce (although I wish they would fill up the little cups they serve them in so I don't have to ask for a million of them).  

Prices are a little high compared to other similar places, but for the convenience/location next to my neighborhood it's worth it. Oh, and by the way, the tortillas are awesome. 

Way to go Gordo's!
