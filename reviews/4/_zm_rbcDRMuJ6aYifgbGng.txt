It's been a while since i've been to a Rubio's mainly because the closest one to me is 187miles away! So I went to this location and the girl who served me was Lorena. She greeted me as I walked in and was ready to serve me in 30secs. I had trouble ordering because what I wanted wasn't on the board. (Mesquite Shrimp tacos) I mentioned that I didn't see it and she told me it was no longer on the menu but she could still make it for me! She charged me accordingly and i had exactly what i came for in a matter of 5 minutes! Thanks to the friendly staff and quick service!
