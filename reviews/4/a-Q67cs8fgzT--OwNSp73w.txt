OMG; they were right in prev reviews; it is going to a small Mexican beach restaurant. I cant believe we got a dozen oysters on the half shell for only $10.  Of course, we were lucky we went on a Friday, during their happy hour time; First visit, not the last for sure.  Everything we ordered was delicious. 
And, the free cup of soup, called the 7 seafood soup was great!!! Do try the shrimp tacos , as Hubby loved them,, and he is not a big tortilla fan. I want to try other  items, so we will be returning;  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff who served us was great. And, of course, I ended my meal with the Fried Ice Cream; it was awesome. The place was clean, and cheery inside,  and they even sold some seafood at the back of the eating area.  Not a lot of custom when we were there, but people should absolutely try it, Ole !!
