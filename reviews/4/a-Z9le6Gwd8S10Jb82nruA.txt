I'm normally one to shy away from restaurants that appear (inside and out) as if they're going to give me the worst case of E. Coli/Salmonella/Asbestos/Gun-shot wounds I've ever had.

But I just don't care when it comes to Carolinas!  Having worked at Sky Harbor for few years I ate here too often to count and never had a bad experience.

Just don't look too closely at your surroundings when you're picking up your grub!
