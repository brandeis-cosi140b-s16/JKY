I am not much of a mexican food fan, but this was a very nice restaurant that had a lot of variety.  Besides the waiter accidentally spilling a margarita (which was very tasty) on a person in our party, the service was excellent.

The pork was wonderful.  The shrimp tacos were absolutely delectable!  The chips were fresh and pleantiful.  Salsas were very good also.

I can't believe how busy it got while we were there.  Obviously a hot spot in this part of town.  I can see why.
