I really enjoyed my meal here.  It doesn't seem like they care about whether or not you're impressed, but they're confident you'll enjoy your experience.  A friend, who is a regular, brought me.  Obviously, as an out-of-towner, I never would have found this place on my own.  It's not a place you simply stumble across.  
It's definitely not inexpensive, but I wouldn't say it's outrageously priced.  You get what you pay for: fine food, prepared well, served in a pretty cool space.  
It's New Mexican cuisine.  I'm not sure what, exactly, that means, but there were a lot of chillies and tortillas.  
There's not a whole lot of seating, so you may or may not get seated right away.  And I think they discourage bringing children, although I don't think they're necessarily unwelcome.  
Also, I guess they have excellent breakfast, although I ate dinner when I went.
