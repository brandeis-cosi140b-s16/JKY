Love this place! I have visited this taco restaurant 4 times in one month alone, and it's addictive. That is all I can say. Tortillas a little bit greasy but the meat is so tasty and delicious. They marinate their meats so well, that it makes you going back over and over again. If you have never tasted an authentic taco, you better visit this place. I'm sorry to tell that Taco Bell, is not your authentic food.! These tacos, deserve the title of being called "tacos!"
