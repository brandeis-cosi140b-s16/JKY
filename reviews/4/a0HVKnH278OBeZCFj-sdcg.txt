I love the decor of skulls and surfboards. Been a fan of this place since it was called Chronic Taco and that's why I'd go there. But I liked the quesadillas and a Dos XX. Still a good place to go when out on Mill Avenue. One complaint: They have Rockstar over Redbull. Great view of "A" Mountain from the patio.
