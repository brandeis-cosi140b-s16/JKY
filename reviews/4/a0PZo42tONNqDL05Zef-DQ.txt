I like to get about one hundred burritos under my belt before I review a taco shop. In all honesty, America's Taco Shop is my neighborhood go-to place for my bean fix.  I stop by on my bike ride home.

(By the way, where did the red bike rack go? It disappeared when the front patio grew. One-star deduction for disabling your cycling customers.)

As other vegetarians have pointed out, the bean-and-cheese burrito is one of few veggie options (salsa, guacamole, vegetarian quesadilla, corn) at America's, but it makes the place.  I've heard rumors that the beans are not pinto, but some other two-word variety. Pray tell, America's.

For a party at my house, I ordered triple salsa and chips and America's more than doubled this catering order in a large foil chafing dish.

People often complain about the narrow options here, but I for one like a restaurant whose identity is clear -- carne asada and the best beans in town -- and sticks to it.

The corn with cheese and hot sauce is hit or miss, depending on the tenderness and sweetness of the kernels that day, but subpar America's corn is still good corn.

Bring back the bike rack, please.
