Papa Chevo's is very good for what it is, a cheap taco shop. It has a generally pleasing atmosphere and a amazingly polite staff. They were patient and helpful while i decided on what i wanted. They have very good tacos, although i would like to see a shrimp taco on the menu. Their horchada is not all that great. I found it to be very watered down and not have the delicious cinnamon and spice taste that i usually get. My Carne Asada taco tasted absolutely delicious and gave me a feeling of comfort food. Their bean side is covered in cheese, thick, hot, and delicious. The first time i went around my rice was cooked well, if a little bland. However, the second time i went, my rice had many hard and under cooked grains. In the end i recommend going to Papa Chevo's if you want a quick and delicious taco.
