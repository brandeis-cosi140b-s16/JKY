Optimally I'd only rate it 3.5 stars, but our server was so friggin nice. We've come here about 5 times now in the last year. Usually when we get there the hostess, who's always different, seems either high or just totally spaced out. Unfortunately that sets the tone for how things are to pan out from then on. I can't tell if they want their servers to wear whatever they please, but there were two of them walking around half naked and the bus boy looked like he just got out of bed.
As far as the service itself, Angelita was so nice. It was like being served by mom. Now we did have to wait a bit but no longer than 5 minutes.
The food was good, but I also have to put it this way, it's Mexican food. If anyone has high expectations of Mexican then you're probably also writing critiques of Mcdonalds. Tortilla,cheese, meat... Taco, chimichanga, enchilada, burrito, taquito... slap some rice and beans on the side. I don't think I've had ever Mexican and been like, "WOW, HOLY CRAP THIS IS THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER HAD!!!!" and I don't think I ever will. It's not like it's gourmet.
Overall, I'd recommend this. I personally came out here from North Carolina and it really does remind me of a few of the Mexican restaurants I used to haunt.
