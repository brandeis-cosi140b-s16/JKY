Disappointed by the salsa they provided us with (tasted like ketchup mixed with chili sauce), but was pleasantly surprised by dinner: Baja tacos and my boyfriend got the shrimp fajitas which we both enjoyed! Staff was below average, but atmosphere, food, and prices were all excellent. Also had very very clean bathrooms! Would definitely come here again, just pass on the salsa and don't have expectations on the staff.
