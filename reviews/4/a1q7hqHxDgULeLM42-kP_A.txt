Los Sombreros is genuine Mexican dining. I spent two summers living in Mexico, enjoyed family meals. Los Sombreros brings back all those memories with its authentic Mexican seasonings, sauces, and my favorite, Mexican cheeses. I am quite picky on Mexican restaurants, I confess to a rare taco/enchilada/rice/bean lunch combo Tex/ Mex style.Those restaurants are exactly what Los Sombreros is not. It is unique and my only choice for true, flavorful dining. Favorite on the menu-hard to say-
I love the lamb adobo, the chile relleno, and there are always the tacos. The difficult choice is go with a favorite or venture out with something new. Margaritas-good.   Service-never had a problem. Highly recommend.
