Went here for lunch today and I must say was very happy with it. The service was very good and friendly staff. Fresh food!   I got the Mango Habanero Mahi Mahi taco plate and had it blackened. First it looked fantastic and when I took my first bite I was in love. The flavor was lipsmacking good and had just the right amount of punch. If you like some heat this gives it to you. Awesome job Rubio's!
