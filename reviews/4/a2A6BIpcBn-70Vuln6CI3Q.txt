So hungry one evening and my gf mentioning tacos, I yelped for the nearest place for a log.  

I came upon Los Tacos on the way home.  Dropped in and ordered myself a carne asada burrito with everything.  Quite an expensive log, but I guess it was quite worth it.  I watched as my log was being made.  I guess they had a new employee attempt to make it.  He may have put too much carne asada since they weighted my log before putting it into a bag for me.  Regardless, I was so hungry that it was excellent.  Meat was so tender and the hot sauce that came with it was perfect.  

Overrall, it was good.  Just not the price.  $8? Dang..
