Really good food! The meat is way better then ta'carbon and the portion size is just right.. I had the mega burrito and only finished half! They use pan Virginia on the hot dogs which taste amazing!! The only thing I didn't like is they have 3 cash registers for "cash only" and 1 for "debit/credit cards only" it's 2015 everyone has debit cards now days!
