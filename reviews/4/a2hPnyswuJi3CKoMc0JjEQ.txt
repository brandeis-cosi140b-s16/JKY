I loooove this Don Tortaco. This is my GO TO place!

They are always friendly and welcoming and make whatever I want the way I ask them. Their store is always clean and I always see their workers cleaning or doing something to make sure the store is ready for business.

They're open 24 hours, so it's great to come any time of day!

I usually get Adobada Fries (extra crispy) with no sour cream or guacamole. It's soooo delicious. Whether I eat there or take it to go, they always seem to hook a girl up.

Definitely love me some Adobada Fries.
