I've been to Distrito twice now... once for a grand opening party and once for breakfast.  Both times I was super impressed.  I'm a huge fan of the modern decor, bright colors, moderate prices, and friendly staff.  And I was super impressed with the food as well!

I met Chef Jose Garces (yes - the distinguished Iron Chef) at the grand opening party, and while I don't follow the chef scene too closely outside of Arizona, it was an honor to see him in action!  A couple of glasses of their sangria made the experience even more fun!

When I returned recently for breakfast, I had a lovely experience dining outside on the patio overlooking the park.  The (Garces Trading Co) coffee was fabulous, as was my order... the Huevos Rancheros.  Service from Manny was spot-on as well.

My husband is a frequent luncher at Distrito; he finds the $15 lunch deal to be quite a bargain.  Maybe one of these days I'll get lucky and he'll take me back on a lunch date!   

While Distrito may not be top of mind when it comes to choosing a restaurant in Old Town, I hope it does well.  But not well enough that I can't get a table when I choose to return!  (I kid, I kid... kind of!)
