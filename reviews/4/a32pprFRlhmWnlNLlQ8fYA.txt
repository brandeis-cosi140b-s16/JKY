Isn't surf and turf normally steak and seafood?  Yea.... their surf and turf was a fish taco and chicken quesadilla.  Mind you - that totally hit the spot, but surf and turf??

Anyhow, this is an awesome spot.  Lots of great options.  They even had a pork mole burrito!!!  Who has that?  I just recently noticed it and I'm totally getting that next time.  

Fast food/healthy mexican is something we could all use a bit more of in our lives if ya ask me - but so is their service.  The kid was so freaking NICE to me I thought someone from their corporate office must be in town.  Yea, THAT kind of nice.  And yet, he was a kind of mellow that most folks don't get naturally.  It could have been all the cool regge tunes giving him some flash backs.  All I care about is he was nice and he made one heck of a quesadilla.
