What a nice addition to the neighborhood, located right next to the French Grocery, Mucho Macho is the product of one of the founders of the now-defunct Tacos Atoyac. I stopped in for some takeout and got a carne asada burrito, the chicken quesadilla, chips and salsa, and an horchata. Everything was very fresh and tasty, and at a reasonable price (around $20 total). Will definitely be coming back here, especially for take out.
