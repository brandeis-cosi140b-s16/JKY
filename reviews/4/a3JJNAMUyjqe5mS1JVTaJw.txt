I have been going to this place since it was Riva's. The been & cheese burrito enchilada style cannot be beat. The chicken burrito is good too. It is a little place with a drive thru that is always fast. Be sure to get the red hot sauce, it is fantastic! They are open 24 hours. The breakfast burritos are good and everything is HUGE! Bring your appetite...
