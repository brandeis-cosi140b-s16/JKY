We had about a group of 20 celebrating early Cinco de Mayo. This is a great place for large groups. They have a few separate dining areas.  

I had the chicken chimichanga with green chile sauce plate. The potion size was decent.  I thought the green chile sauce just wasn't enough on the chimichange. 
No sour cream and guac came with the plate. I don't mind paying for them if the server offered. It wouldn't be a Cinco de Mayo celebration without margaritas. The ladies ordered strawberry and classic frozen margaritas while the boys got beers. If you are a light weight with the alcohol consider sharing the margarita.    

At least they still give complimentary chips & salsa plus sopapilla for dessert.  They bring you both sopapilla in plain and cinnamon sugar.  Made hot and fresh!  It's messy, but so worth it!
