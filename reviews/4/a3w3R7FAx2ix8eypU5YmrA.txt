This was a unexpected West Valley find. I decided last minute to try it out for lunch and had a great experience. The staff was friendly, the service was top-notch. I ordered the Enchilada suizas with chicken. The meat was tender and fresh. It comes with a small side of slaw as opposed to a few strands of iceberg lettuce and tomato like you see at most Mexican restaurants - nice added touch. The ambiance was festive with attention to details on the southwestern theme. The music was not blaring with loud horns and fast beats, but was soft while still being traditional. My server Elizabeth was friendly, helpful, and very attentive without being overwhelming. As you know, a clean bathroom means a clean kitchen and I'm happy to report that the men's bathroom was also spotless. 4 Stars only because it didn't blow me away with unique options like you would see with gourmet tacos, unique tequila drinks and more. It also may be slightly pricier when compared to the competition. But surely an above average place to go for your standard Mexican fare. They get everything else right.
