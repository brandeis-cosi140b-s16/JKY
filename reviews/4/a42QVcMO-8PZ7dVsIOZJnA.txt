Our first visit to Rosita's was after we moved right down the street and not disappointing.The food was about what we expected but better.First rate hot sauce,as good as the sauce my husband makes.And that's good. Service was always great as we sit in the lounge or even at the bar when we go.Awesome happy hour,2$ beers,half off appetizers.What could be better!
