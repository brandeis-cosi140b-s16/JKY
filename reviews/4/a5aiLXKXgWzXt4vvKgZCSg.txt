I like this place. Huge menu, everything I've had has been good and the price is right.

Ok, I gotta qualify this...I haven't really gotten past the Rolled Tacos Supreme. It's just too good. Five taquitos blanketed in guacamole, lettuce, crema. cotija cheese and ganished with chopped carne asada....I want to try the rest of the menu, I really do, but when I get to the head of the line something takes over my vocal cords and I hear those three little words come out, again. J. likes the Nachos which is similar in ingredients to my fav with more carne asada and beans and he has had the fish tacos which he thought were very satisfactory.

Even though I've been able to resist so far, they have a good selection of Jarritos. Unfortunately the Jarritos Pi√±a goes straight to my hips (like the entrees are calorie free???) so I prefer water or Ice Tea with my meals, but they are lovely to look at in the chiller next to the register.

This little taco shack has all the elements of a cheap Mexican delight. Variety, Flavor and good value for your buck. Look for me when you try it out, I'll probably be there ;-)
