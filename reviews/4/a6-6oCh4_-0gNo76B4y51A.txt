I really like this place. 
I have had their fish tacos, chiladas, tacos, chicken burrito, Carne asada, quesadilla,  breakfast burritos, salsas. And nothing is bad. I mean really, they are pretty damn tasty. 

I love their breakfast burritos. They actually have good flavor! The decor isn't special but they do a good job of keeping the place clean. Good spot to get some tasty food. :-)
