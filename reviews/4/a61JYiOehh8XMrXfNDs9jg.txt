Qdoba why hadn't I tried you sooner, wait it's because I live in Buckeye. Lol I had the three cheese nachos with the green salsa and chicken. I wouldn't like to compare it to Chipotle since all they really have in common is the fact that it's a "Mexican Grill," the flavors are completely different the chicken however does have more flavor. 

If I ever find myself downtown again I will definitely stop in again.
