There are many *****berto's in town and I have probably tried them all. It had been several years since I had been to Eriberto's and after a night of drinking and karaoke I stopped by for a late night Mexican food fix. 

Everything was great. I had a carne asada burrito and three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Both were really good. The carne asada burrito was huge and probably had half a pound of meat and the rolled tacos were covered in fresh guacamole and cheese. All food is served with fresh green and red salsa on the side. 

It's a very casual place so don't look for fancy here, but it's very clean.  

Best part is, this one is open 24 hours! Aren't all *****berto's open 24 hours you ask?  Actually no, there are several in town that are not. 

Enjoy!
