Located in the hotel we stayed at for a conference, this little place was good.  Between three of us we tried a bunch of things over a few days and each dish was great.  It was fresh and not overly salty--which is a complaint I have often about Mexican food.  The fresh salsas were nice too. I didn't like that it was buffet style for the salsas, but that's the clean freak in me :)
They did only have two people working for the conference I was there for--so be prepared to wait.
