This is a hidden gem!  My family stumbled on this restaurant when we went to a show at The Quad.  Need dinner before the show, but didn't want buffet nor fast food.  The Asian place next door was a bit too expensive so we came over to Quesadilla.  Service was friendly!  Food was delicious!  We loved the shrimp quesadilla and shrimp enchilada.  Carne asada was great too. Prices were very reasonable!  Yes, we would go back!
