Ate at the original shop for years and loved the place, still do actually. Ate on the patio here the other nite and loved the atmosphere, the professional wait staff and incredibly fast and efficient service.

Had the red burro enchilada style and it was spectacular! Highly recommend.

Hop on over to Popo's asap.
