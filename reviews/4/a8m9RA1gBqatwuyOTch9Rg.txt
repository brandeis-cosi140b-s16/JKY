So came to this place with my mom after deciding that we wanted Mexican and someplace that we don't have to drive too far.  This place had some really good reviews on yelp, and we were excited to try this place out. My mom complained about not being able to see her menu because she's older and her eyes aren't good. I could see perfectly, and I wanted to try something I've never had before.
I ordered the empanadas and this red soup, sorry the name escapes me. The staff was really friendly, and attentive. The empanadas were okay, but the soup man....the soup. That was pretty killers. It was forest red, but wasn't super spicy like what you would think. The meat inside was good and tender, and this soup made me enjoy chick peas. It was a subtle explosion of taste in your mouth that was savory, salty, and packed a punch.

Overall the ambience, food, and experience was pretty cherry. I'm glad we ventured out of our comfort zone, and would like to com  back to try other entrees on the menu.
