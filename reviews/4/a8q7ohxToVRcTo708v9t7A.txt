While flipping through last year's 50 Best Dishes issue of Phoenix Magazine, I saw that this place won the 'Best Sandwich' category. Being not only a fan of sandwiches but tortas specifically, I had to check this place out. A friend of mine treated me to The Cubana, the award-winning sandwich. It was good looking but not as handsome as the sandwich pictured in the magazine (not surprising). Torta half in one hand (it was big) and a chile toreado in the other (Free at the salsa bar!  Win!), I began to pig-out.  While I was chowing on the delicious, grilled-to-crisp roll filled with various pork products, queso fresco, avocado and the usual sandwich veggies, my friend asked, "Is it number one?" I replied with a peace-sign gesture, the number two. Though the sandwich tasted good, was worth the price and is my new fast-food of choice while in the Arcadia area, it does not trump The Del Rey from Los Reyes De La Torta, overall. However, Los Reyes is a full-service joint and consuming more then one Del Rey in a three-month period will result in morbidly high cholesterol numbers. Thus, I will no doubt be dragging my friend to Tortas El Guero, regularly.
