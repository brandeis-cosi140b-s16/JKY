Probably the healthiest fast food around Love their tostadas salads and their twice grilled burritos. Great value and always clean especially at this location. Plus look in the mail great coupons. Only suggestion is bring back the smores desert it is awesome.  I would give them another star (5 total) if they bring that desert back.
