With the end of Gallo Blanco, this is our back up place.  Menu is about the same.  Guacamole and chips are a necessary first.  Love the naco torta with a friend egg.  Messy but wonderful. Fries are A+.  The menu offers breakfast items and lots of interesting Southwestern and Mexican dishes with a flair with very reasonable prices. 
Yes, it is quieter than Gallo Blanco, but that is a plus if you want to have a conversation with someone.  The ambiance is not so wonderful, but if you want good food at reasonable prices, you will notice why this place is crowded.  Parking is somewhat limited.
