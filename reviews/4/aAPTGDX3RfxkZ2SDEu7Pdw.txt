Ok, this place is authentic, very well priced, and damn good!

When I worked for the power comany we used to hit this spot up when we were on the east side of town. Good steak & shrimp burittos, street style tacos.

I sometimes take my out-of-town white friends here to let them see a side of Vegas most tourists wouldn't see being so far away from the strip. :)
