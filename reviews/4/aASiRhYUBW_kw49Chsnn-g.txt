There were some highlights of my meal, but, some lowlights as well. 
I love Michelada's and have had some of the best around the state. Yeah, funny that I didn't say Mexico, because I sadly didn't get to discover the awesomeness of Michelada while I was traveling out there. Yes, shame on me. Now you can start throwing rocks and food at me for that. 

I chose to mix my Michelada with Negra Modelo. They say this is the best combo so I thought, why not go with the best. 
The one I had here was mehhh. It was missing some lime, and the ratio of clamato and beer was a bit off for me. 

We ordered the giant mixed platter for 4...this can feed 6 people in my opinion. It had imitation crab, real crab (delicious by the way) and shrimp three ways (as a sampler), scallops, clams, and fried fish. The crab (which I think is fried?)  had a great marinade and was delicious. My favorite was the Shrimp Diablo. The flavors in it were so amazing, I'd definitely come back and order this. 

I love ceviche, but he one we ordered was a bit too raw for me. 

Shrimp empanada- I didn't like this very much, as the outer dough part was too mushy/soggy for me, and I prefer my empanadas to have a little crisp and crunch. The inside shrimp filling was delicious. 

The horchata was dang good. The check-in offer is one per table FYI. 
Chocolate cake was simple, yet moist and delicious. 

I'll definitely be back to get me some more of that shrimp diablo, and the crab is so worth trying.
