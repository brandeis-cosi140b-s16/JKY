out of all of the Filiberto's this is my favorite. they are always busy, which usually means two IMPORTANT things...1) the food is good 2) the food is fresh. another important thing to notice is that you even see hispanic folks eating here, that means it is fairly authentic. you can't beat homemade Mexican food but this is pretty darn close! i like that they play spanish music playing almost all the times i go in there too
