I've eaten here a bunch of times since discovering it back when i moved into the Rhodes Ranch area in 2006. Coming from the North East, you don't get many places with good southwest flavor like this.

Have had numerous things from here. Chicken tacos are bomb, little greasy but damn tasty. California burrito is good, way better than those I have had at Roberto's. My wife digs the carne asada taco's, I'll agree with some other reviewers though, not very big on seasoning flavor here, but it is quality meat and the salsa, cilantro and guac makes them go down easy.

All in all, this place is cheap eats, done proper. And oh yeah open 24/7. Can't be beat really.
