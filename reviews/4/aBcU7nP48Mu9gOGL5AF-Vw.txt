I was impressed with the building both inside and out with its nice decor.  We were seated promptly and our waitress was over with menus and took our drink order immediately (and it was relatively busy).  I ordered the spinach enchilada while my wife went with the cheese enchiladas.  The chips were good but the salsa lacked any kick at all but I did like the way they had the salsa in a pitcher and just came around and poured you more when they saw you running low.  The meal was very good and I very rarely eat the rice as I just don't care for it but the rice was very flavorful so that was a nice surprise.  The service though was excellent as they refilled our drinks before we had to ask and were there for the extra napkins I asked for, etc. Often, you order, you get your order and maybe once during your meal you will see your waitress but here, they were very attentive.  I took the one star off for the lack of 'pep' in the salsa although it was good just needed at least a little kick!
