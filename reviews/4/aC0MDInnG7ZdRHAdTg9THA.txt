Fish tacos are delicious! I order mind with extra chipotle mayo and extra onions! Sooo delicious. My boy friend always orders the carne asada on corn tortillas, and he is never disappointed. We call ahead to ensure we're in and out in just a few mins. The brownies are so delicious, so worth the couple bucks! 3 for $5 is a great deal.
