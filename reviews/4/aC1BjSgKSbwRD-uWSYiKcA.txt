This is what I would consider authentic Mexican taco fare.  Excellent!  I really was sad when my meal was over.  It was so good.  

Paper plates, cash only, very good food.  

Tomorrow night we'll be finding another such place to eat.  Not because this wasn't great food, because it was.  Just because this place has got me hooked and I've got to try more.
