I've been eating at this Filiberto's for years and they just keep getting better. Their staff is usually right on the money with my orders, even when I have custom requests and I'm not sure if they heard me right :) Their ground beef (molida) is amazing and their 99 cent ground beef tacos are huge and delicious, and way better than what you get for the same price at the Taco Bell right up the road. Their Patron burrito is very good and filling, full of meat for the carb-conscious and very well priced for what you get. It's stuffed with steak, bacon and carnitas with monterey jack cheese and some pico de gallo. In the last couple of weeks they replaced their aging menu board and order speaker and have added a couple of new items that I've been obsessed with. The Gordo burrito is a mix of steak, chicken and shrimp and is very tasty. The Big Juan burrito is enormous! It comes with your choice of carne asada (steak) or pollo asado (grilled chicken) and included bacon, beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and pico de gallo all wrapped in a double tortilla. The first two times I ordered it I got the pollo asada which was very good, but this last time I ordered carne asada and they hooked me up with the biggest burrito I'd ever eaten. This burro is definitely a two-fister and enough calories to keep me satisfied for most of the day.
