Hubby and I went today.  I ordered Asada plate.  I thought meat was better quality than Robertos.  My husband had enchilada/rellano plate.  I liked mine better.  My plate had rice, beans, pico and guac, along with 2 fresh, piping  hot flour tortillias.  Condiment bar had usual fare.  Food came out very quickly and order was correct.  I will return.
