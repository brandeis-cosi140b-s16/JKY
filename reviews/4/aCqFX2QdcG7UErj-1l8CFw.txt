It almost doesn't make sense reviewing a place that has 44 reviews and you're giving it what it averages, but I want to add my own two cents. 

Carolina's is a dive hole in the wall, that I wonder how it is still standing. It is dirty, in a terrible neighborhood, and has no table service. 

Knowing that before you go, you're in for a good meal! Their tortillas are incredible, and my favorite is the Chorizo and Potato burrito. The food takes a while to get, but it is so worth it. If you feel unsafe going here, there are always DPS, Sheriffs, PPD, PFD, etc. all over the place. It's probably the safest restaurant in town!

Delicious.
