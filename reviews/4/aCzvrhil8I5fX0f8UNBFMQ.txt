Garcia's is a comfortable respite from all the cheesy Mexican food joints (probably a hundred or so) in the area.
The decor, ambiance, and uniformed servers all give Garcia's a solid four stars. 

The food?
It depends. 
Order one their signature items and you can't go wrong. Any of the combination lunch plates, chimis, or burritos...all good. 

On this day I ordered a bowl of red chile. It arrived lukewarm but I didn't care since I was hungry enough to eat the ass out a dead and rotting rhino. I inhaled it. Then proceeded to make my guests nervous as I sat and stared at the food on their plates. 
I'm guessing they liked their food too as they slowly did the hand-plate wraparound, overtly signaling how I should back the fuck off.

No problem, I ate an entire basket of chips. And when I finished them, they brought me another. 
I had three diet cokes, two baskets of chips and a bowl of red chile. I haven't a clue as to what any of it cost since one of the guys I went to lunch with is richer than God himself and I knew he'd pay. 
I know, it's fucked up for me to think like that, but I really didn't want to get into a pissing contest with him over a bowl of red chile and some free chips.  Not classy.
Neither is throwing up in the parking lot for that matter.

I think I have an ulcer. I really need to get it checked out.
I hate my life.
I wish I was a matador or something.
