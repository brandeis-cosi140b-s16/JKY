The chicken is amazing, in any form.  Avoid the tortas, they're horrible.  The beef is just so-so.  I deducted a star because the tortas are so bad, and I still regret eating it 3 weeks ago.  UGH!!  But seriously, get the damn chicken.  Oh, and any of the sides rock.  Solid, go-to place.  Salads rule too.
