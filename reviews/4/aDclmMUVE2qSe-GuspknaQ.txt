Distrito has a super sassy modernized Mexican interior and a delectable menu to go with it. I loved all the bright colors in the dining room and I was especially a fan of the glittery pink table tops, so FUN! The food was just as sassy and flavorful. Plus, any place that can make a simple yet delicious guacamole is an automatic favorite of mine.  Distrito is one of those places! The guac was perfection; it had the perfect balance of lime, serrano peppers, cilantro and cotija. The portion was super generous and great for sharing. 

I joined a small group of friends to check out their Restaurant week menu. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so making a decision was a little challenging. I'm pretty sure we ordered every option on the menu, since there were several people in our group. 

Course 1: I had the Chilango Chop salad. The combo of of the apples, cranberries, spiced pecans and queso fresco was outstanding and creative.  

Course 2 : I had the Nachos, which is something I would never order and I am so glad I did! I've been on the search for a review worthy nacho dish, and lucky me! I finally found it! Traditional ingredients like beans, cheese, and jalapenos were used, but this nacho dish is gourmet perfection.

Course 3: Seared Tuna. Unfortunately I don't remember this one as much. I know it was tasty, but I was so full by this point in the meal!

I plan on coming back for my own order of the ribs, which I had a little taste of. They were succulent and fell right off the bone.

I also enjoyed several refills of the Margarita throughout the course of the evening and left Distrito very very satisfied.

Just thinking about the food puts a smile on my face.
