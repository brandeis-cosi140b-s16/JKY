This place is a good place for something sweet or a small meal. I LOVE nachos, and I usually get that. I either get the carne asada ones or the ones that you eat straight out of the chip bag. They also have great mango with chile and lemon. And good agua frescas. I will contine going here, the place is usually packed and very limited seating situation. I hope they will soon open a bigger establishment out of the mall. Untill then I will continue to go to this location.
