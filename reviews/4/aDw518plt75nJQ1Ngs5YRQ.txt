7/10/15: My co-workers & I had a great lunch here. This wasn't our first time and it won't be our last. The staff is very friendly and the food is excellent. The wait time isn't bad at all. It's nice to go somewhere, eat good food and still have plenty of time to chit chat before we head back to work. Highly recommended.
