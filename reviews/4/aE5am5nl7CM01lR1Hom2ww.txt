Build your own tacos? Don't mind if I do. 

Heard the truck would be in my neighborhood so I walked over. Was going to bring the dog with me but since he's not allowed people food I figured that was unnecessary evil. Happened to run into fellow Yelper Jimmy D. there too, so that was a nice surprise!

Every taco comes standard with a cabbage and veggie mixture. Then you select your meat (or no meat,) toppings, sauce, and shell. I went with chicken, cucumber and water chestnuts, in teriyaki on a soft shell. Delicious! They focus on fresh, local, all-natural food, so these are healthy noms, guys. They have sushi listed on their menu, but Grant who was running the truck tonight told me that a city regulation prevented them from serving it. I hope that changes soon!

My tacos took less than 10 minutes. There were no tables or benches in the lot so I got it to-go and headed home. (I thought about hijacking a CM patio table but I think they might have frowned on that.) My shells got a little soggy with teriyaki by the time I got to eat them, but they were still delicious and I ate it all. Excellent stop for a quick, healthy, yummy meal!
