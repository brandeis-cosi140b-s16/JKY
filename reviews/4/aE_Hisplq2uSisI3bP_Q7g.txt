I came here with a friend before heading to the movies.  I bought the Yelp Deal which was a gift certificate $10 for $20 towards your purchase.   The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable.  We had the endless chips and salsa and 2 shredded beef tacos!  The salsa was delicious and the tacos were very tasty.  

The happy hour drinks are also a great deal.  This place is  perfect to stop at before a movie or even for happy hour or dinner!
