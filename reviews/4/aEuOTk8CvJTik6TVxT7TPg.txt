Don't let the exterior (nor interior) turn you away.  The food is definitely worth going in!

AMBIENCE:  
Seems like the place was a fast food restaurant turned to a sit-down.  Not a place to impress a date.  A few TVs with the Hispanic channel on.  We were the only English speaking patrons.  Obviously a favorite of the locals.

SERVICE:  
Friendly and attentive - but limited English.  Be very clear in what you want to order.

DRINKS:  
The cans of domestic beers were only $1.  Corona beer was $3.  I asked about their liquor selection and the waitress said none - perhaps she didn't understand me?  The coupon showed a picture of a margarita ....?

FOOD:
Excellent authentic Mexican food for a very reasonable price.  Large portions. Good flavor.  Cooked well.  Good selection.

SUMMARY:
Highly recommend this place for the food quality and portions, as well as, for the low price.
