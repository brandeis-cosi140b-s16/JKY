Ran across this place while running errands today.  I felt like I was in Newport Beach or something.  Got the 3-pack tacos for $5:  what a deal!  The owner, Andy, came out to welcome us and ask how everything was.  Very friendly guy, and funky little neighborhood place. They use mostly AZ products and try to go organic for their produce which is a big plus.  Check it out if you head over that way.
