This may not be exquisite five star dining but it is nothing less than four star Jalisco Mexican dining,this is not average it is very good and the owners Maria and her husband are super nice and charming.

On our last visit before several, my husband enjoyed Albondigas Soup, it had two large meatballs a large potato, a large zucchini in a tasty rich chicken broth. (3.95)

The Jalisco meals are what many people enjoy coming here for that you can't get at the usual Mexi places. We have been here several times and mostly pick Mexican Meals we can't get elsewhere.

He had the Birria plate this time and it was falling apart tender tasty beef with rice and beans served with a plate of cut radishes, onions and cilantro and choice of tortillas. (9.99)

I had Carne De Res Con Chile Rojo (beef in red sauce) my beef was tender and also came with rice , beans and choice of tortillas. (9.99)

Both meals were great and fresh, the carne de res con chile rojo was more of a building spice dish, and I would rate it at 6 out of 10 on the spice scale but slightly building and interesting.

I spoke to Maria Saturday and SHE TOLD ME NEXT WEEK, they ARE moving to new location at 7 and Thunderbird next week and she showed me the picture of the store front and it reads El Conquistador
