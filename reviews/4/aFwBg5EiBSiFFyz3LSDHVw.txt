Sometimes months will go by and I forget about Rubios. Then I'll have it and I'm reminded how good it is!

The salsa bar rocks. Chips are free with every meal. Prices are reasonable. Oh, and they have some healthy options as well (the HealthMex tacos/burritos are really yummy!).

My husband LOVES their fish tacos--the original AND the grilled versions as well.
