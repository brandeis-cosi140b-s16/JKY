SALSA!

I grew up on Macayo's. My dad was a busboy there when he was a mere 15 years old in Old Vegas. I swear I wouldn't be as tall as I am today without the influence of the TCT (toasted cheese tortilla) and the bean and cheese burrito. I still haven't found an albondigas soup that even comes close to Macayo's. Plus there is nothing like their unlimited smooth salsa with tortilla chips that come at the beginning of every meal. Heck it's so good they sell the bottled salsa at your local grocery store. 

In my adult age, I have learned to enjoy a new aspect of Macayo's: the MARGARITAS. My favorite thing now is to bring my Cha-Cha margarita glass to the bar and have it refilled for $3.99 a glass. Cha-Cha is a ceramic glass in the shape of a Mexican woman and her hat serves as the receptacle for the healthy margarita refills. She originally cost $10.99 with a margarita. 

The service nowadays is a toss up. Sometimes it's great and sometimes it's not. They have a pretty good happy hour with discount beers and margaritas if you don't want to go the Cha-Cha route. You have to sit in the bar to take advantage of the half off appetizers. The Shredded Beef Burro Enchilada Style is beyond amazing. This may not be super authentico Mexican food but it knows the way to my heart.
