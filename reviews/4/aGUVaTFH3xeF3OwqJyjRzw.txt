MI Pueblo has been a standard lunch stop during the week.

The prices are on point and the food is served hot and fast.
The salsa bar is very good.

The only complaint I could ever come up with would be that the food comes out so fast that you hardly have time to get your drink, chips and salsa. Still its made to order and is hot.

Great lunch for the price.
