This is likely the best Mexican restaurant in town. I ate once at one of Rick Bayless' restaurants (I was sitting in one and ordered off the menu of the other. Yes, weird.) (He's *the* go-to guy on Mexican cuisine in the US, competed on Iron Chef, etc.) I enjoyed my meal at Mas Amigos more.

My wife ordered the Steak with poblanos. It was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful. The poblano chilis were beautiful.

I ordered the Chicken enchiladas with molé sauce. I am a big sucker for a good molé, and this was a *great* molé. The chef makes the sauce on the premises with dozens of ingredients. It is complex and flavorful. Mmm. Just thinking about it, I almost forgot that the sauce was served with some fabulous chicken enchiladas - tender tortillas wrapped around moist and tender shredded chicken. These are the enchiladas and sauce that the others in town should aspire to be one day.

The chips are also made on the premises. They aren't exactly low-fat, but they knock Chevy's chips to a far distant second. Likewise, the salsas. In addition to the dish of fresh salsa, we were served two made-here bottled (plastic squeeze bottles) salsas: a red, smoky and firey, and a green that reminded me of summertime.

I used to think that the beans and rice at a Mexican restaurant were a very optional part of the meal. Not here. Both are surprisingly tasty and of very good texture.

Although pretty full by the end of the main course, we are suckers for a good Flan. We were not disappointed. Texture and flavor were spot-on.

The service was friendly and attentive.

This place is doing so much right, they really deserve to succeed. We will definitely be returning here often!
