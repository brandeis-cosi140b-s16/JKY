Rubios is a version of a fast mex food... their specialty is "sea" tacos.. Tilapia, shirp, lobster tacos... their prices are very good and their food very delicious. also if you sign up online you can receive discounts and a free meal on your b-day.. 
i would recommend their combos.. half salad + any taco or their bowl..
the chipotle salad was amazing!!
