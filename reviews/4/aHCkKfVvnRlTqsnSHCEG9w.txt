It was finally our turn to try Maribel's for dinner on a recent Thursday and the Yelp friends were correct: delicioso!  It took a few wrong turns for me to find Doc Holliday's where Maribel's is also located, so note that the building is behind Freed's Bakery.  This is definitely a hole-in-the-wall joint, but the food and service were top-notch.  Sam, our very professional and personable teenage host/waiter was at the top of his young game, greeting us and making sure we had our ice water and chips and salsa after we were seated.  There were only two other tables occupied when we arrived and then it was just the B/F and I, which doesn't make sense because the food is great and the prices are more than reasonable.  I had the guacamole and chips all by myself to start since Mel doesn't eat avocados.  The guacamole was fresh with tomatoes and nice chunks of avocado.  The serving was more than I could eat by myself so I took the rest home.  I chose the chicken enchiladas for my meal, which came with rice and beans and it was served piping hot by Sam the man-child.  Bottom line:  the food was great and it was just like eating at a friend's house.  The atmosphere is casual and Sam is the son of Maribel, the marvelous mamacita cooking up the food in the cocina.  We didn't meet her, but Sam proudly told us how his mother is the one doing all the cooking while he and his hermanas help out with everything else in the restaurant; this kid has charm and he loves what he does.  
We'll definitely be back and I know it won't be long before I update for cinco estrellas.
