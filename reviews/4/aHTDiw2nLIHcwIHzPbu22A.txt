What can u say ??? Great food awesome taste but something is missing?? The price was little high paid almost 30 bucks for me and my wife. Where I could of got a lot more food somewhere else. However if the quality was not tasty I would of gave this place a 1 out of 5 stars. It's a one time thing maybe next year I come again the prices really had me only come once to the great place.
