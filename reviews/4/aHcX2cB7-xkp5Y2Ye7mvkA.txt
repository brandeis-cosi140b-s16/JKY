The crazy chicken is crazy good! For healthy but filling fast food, El Pollo Loco is pretty hard to beat. My husband loves the 2 piece combo meals, with breast and wing. The citrus marinade they use is excellent and the chicken is always nice and moist. 

I have always been a fan of El Pollo Loco's side dishes, like the steamed veggies. They recently added some premium sides, which are slightly more expensive then the standards.. The premium sides include sweet potatoes fries!! The fries were excellent, a little on the softer side but not to the point of being mushy. 

It doesn't seem like many people in Henderson know about how good El Pollo Loco is, as there is never a wait. I don't mind that one bit.
