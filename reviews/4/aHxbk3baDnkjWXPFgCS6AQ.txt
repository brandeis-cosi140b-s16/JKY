Really enjoyed it, pleasant to sit outside, the music is just loud enough that it covers the road noise but so loud you can't have a conversation. 
Really tasty tacos - both the chicken and the pork. Good margaritas especially the blood orange one. Friendly and efficient service even when it was very busy on a Saturday night. Would happily go back.
