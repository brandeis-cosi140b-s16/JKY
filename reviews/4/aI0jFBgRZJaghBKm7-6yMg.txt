So, I usually can't help myself whenever I'm in Maricopa and I end up at Taco's N' More. Today however, I was given a tip from some locals and told to go to Cilantro's...I owe my friends a Thank You card! 

Great service, clean restaurant, excellent food...good all the way around.

I had a California burro and added jalape√±os, grilled fajita veggies and sour cream.

I'd definitely go back any time.....MMMMMM
