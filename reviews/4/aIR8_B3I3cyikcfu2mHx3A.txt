I was on the South Side with my wife one evening looking for a place to eat whenever we stumbled upon El Toro Loco.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but once you are inside you are well aware that you are in a Mexican restaurant.  There are sombrero's everywhere on the walls.

For my dinner entree I decided to order the Burritos Aztecas.  While we waited for our food to come out we were given some chips and salsa.  This ended up being my favorite part of the meal as the chips were fresh and the salsa had a little kick to it.  After finishing the chips my meal came out and consisted of some burritos smothered in some sauces.  They ended up being decent and there was enough food that I was stuffed by the time dinner was over. 

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  The atmosphere and the food were decent and I imagine that if I hit it on a Tuesday or Thursday night like many of the other reviews had then I would be very happy.
