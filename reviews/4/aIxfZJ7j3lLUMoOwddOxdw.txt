I tried this place out today when I was looking for a cheap, quick Mexican joint and it was actually pretty damn good. 

I had the El Pastor Plate ($7.50), which usually comes with rice, beans, lettuce and tortillas, but I opted to go without the beans or lettuce. The meat was very juicy with a fantastic flavor, as was the rice. The tortilla was piping hot and I made myself some nice miniature tacos.

I also ordered a side of chips ($1) and tried out one of the salsas. Whichever one I picked was delicious. It was the red one that didn't have seeds in it. The perfect amount of spice without being so hot that there's no flavor.

I would definitely say I enjoyed this place far more than Don Tortaco, Roberto's, Fillipito's, Tacos El Gordo, Tacos Mexico...the list goes on and on. Definitely my favorite taco shop.
