Best green corn tamales around. Great for takeout - small indoor and patio seating for dining in. Super casual ambiance, fantastic lunch specials, extremely good food and beyond reasonable prices. Fresh hot chips are always included with your order and beer/margaritas are available here as well.
I understand they do a large amount of catering and have always wowed customers with exceptional service.
This location had been in the heart of Old Town for as long as I can recall and I've never been disappointed. A must for anyone in the area.
