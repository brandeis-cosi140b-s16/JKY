We have been to Mad Mex several times and always have a tasty Mexican meal. The restaurant has cool Mexican inspired decor and atmosphere. The music is very loud and can be hard to hear at times. Food is delivered quick and service is adequate. 

All dishes are large in portion size. My favorite dish is the mahi mahi fajitas. They are delicious and always enough for more than 1 meal for me. Guacamole is just ok, salsa has a nice spicy kick. They have many options for vegetarians as well as gluten free and vegan which is nice. The one thing they don't do is give free tortilla chips which many other Mexican restaurants do. 

I'll keep returning anytime I'm in the mood for good Mexican food.
