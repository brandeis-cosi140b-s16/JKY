Okay, I'm a Chipotle girl.  No need to try Qdoba in my mind.  But I'm glad I did.  I love that they have several choices including soup and salad variations.  Also, they have a vegetable burrito that is not just beans and guac but also squash and other real vegetables.  Servings are similarly huge so you have to watch your consumption, but nothing is too expensive and four-for-four experiences were very good.
