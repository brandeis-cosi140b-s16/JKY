I had been craving a bean & cheese burrito all weekend, so on Monday come lunch time I searched my Yelp app for a Mexican food place on the way home (I was meeting up w/my hubs). Caramba was the 1st place to pop up so I decided to check it out. After looking over the menu I ordered the following for us to try: bean & cheese burrito, chicken pollo fundido, beef fajita combo plate & a cheese quesadilla w/a side of sour cream. Since I was taking it to go I forgot to grab some salsa from the salsa bar, next time!

I had half of the bean & cheese burro & about a third of the pollo fundido for my lunch, I can't decide which was better as they were both so good! My hubby split the bean & cheese burro w/me & ate the cheese quesadilla w/sour cream, he also loved the burro & said the quesadilla was good too, not greasy like most places. That night for dinner I finished my pollo fundido & my hubby had his fajita plate, he said everything was very tasty! Total for all that food was about $25, not bad. 

Next visit I'd like to dine in & order their famous stuffed quesadilla & the cinnamon crisps dessert. They also have beer & margaritas & serve breakfast burritos all day. So glad I found this place!
