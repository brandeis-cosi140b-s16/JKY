I've eaten here twice, with last time being yesterday. First, very nice owner works there with his wife, so it is a family business, which I like to support. Second, the place was clean, although they were just cleaning it with Pinesol...I wouldn't use that stuff in a restaurant, it smell awful...but getting past that, they offer great Mexican drinks and pretty good  Los Angeles style Mexican food.  The bean though aren't my favorite style, looks like they use light pinto beans, I like the dark beans. But it was tasty enough. The chips were hot and crispy, a big Plus there.  I had the Taco and Tostada plate. Not bad.  But I do miss my L.A. Mexican food...like Las Fuentes...This is a good second though.
