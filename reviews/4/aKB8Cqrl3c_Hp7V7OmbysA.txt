Their portion sizes are enormous.  I was part of a party of six and we ordered their nachos as an appetizer. Those nachos alone could have served as the meal. Nice selection of excellent flavored margaritas. Their chicken enchiladas were tasty, including the red sauce, which was moderately spicy. Their sopapillas are the highlight of the menu. Not since living in New Mexico have I had such fresh and fluffy sopapillas. Pass on the option to have them served with ice cream or sugar. Have them served plain and then drizzle them with honey. It's makes for a great dessert. Another highlight is Ajo Al's Southwestern ambiance, which provides for a nice, relaxed atmosphere. This is a great place for dinner with family or friends.
