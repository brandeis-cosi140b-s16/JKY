The chipotle here is a great hangover cure! I love getting a burrito from here in the morning when I wake up not feeling so well in Vegas. What I may love even more than that is getting a HUGE burrito for dinner, putting half of it away and coming back later that night after an evening of festivities at the Vegas nightclubs. Either way, this Chipotle never disappoints, which I find ironic because I would think one would with it's location being Vegas and the sheer volume of drunk people they have to cater to. Kudos chipotle people, kudos!
