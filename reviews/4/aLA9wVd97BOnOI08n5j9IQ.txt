When it comes to Mexican food, this place is pretty solid and one of my go to places for lunch when I am at work. The food is great and prices are fair. My personal favorites include the chicken nachos and the Quesdilla's which don't seem to be on the menu for some reason. Or maybe I am just to blind to see it.

**TIP** Call your order in ahead as everything is made to order as it should be. Be prepared to wait a bit if you order at the counter but it's never painfully long.

My only gripe about this place is they charge a $0.35 charge or so if you use a credit/debit card.
