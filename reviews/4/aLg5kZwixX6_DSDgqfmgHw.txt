I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place. They cook the pork in a one of those rotating gyro meat cookers with a whole pineapple on top, with the outer skin removed so the pineapple juice continually bastes the outer layer of meat as it cooks. I had the burrito with pork and that was great and then...I tried the torta, that lovely Mexican sandwich. It was on this great, fresh, soft torta bread with a layer of guacamole, not to thick, and then a layer of pork, enough to provide a taste, but not too thick. I loved it! I also like their mexican corn, though it is a bit messy and I have only had it once, since you eat it right off the cob, sprinkled with white queso cheese. 

So, a reliable place for a quick lunch. The prices seem a bit high for what they offer but...I keep coming back so they must be reasonable. I think that basically they are more of a quality than a quantity place, which is a nice thing to see in a place essentially offering fast food (but not junk food like at many corporate fast food joints). Try it out, I don't think you will be dissapointed. :-)
