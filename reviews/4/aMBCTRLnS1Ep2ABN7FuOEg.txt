I've lived in Dormont for 3 years and have never hit this place up. Why? Well, there's absolutely no good reason! I love Mexican food too, so this means there's been a lot of missed opportunities to eat tacos. 

While I feel like there's always a great debate about what's "authentic" Mexican food, I always feel like I can't chime in. I know that there are taco's I like, and taco's I don't like. A lot of it for me has to do with flavor. So my knowledge isn't on what's "authentic" but what is tasty to me. 

I had the taco platter where you're able to choose from a plethora of different meats. Sadly, this did not include the "new" fish tacos, which I was bummed about. I went with the spicy chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom. They come dressed with lettuce, cheese and onion, in a flour tortilla (you can also get a hardshell). 

While the mushroom was a little blah, the spicy chicken and pulled pork were awesome. What made them awesome was the meats, of course. They were seasoned fantastically and cooked perfectly. I kept saying over and over how good they were. 

I also had a side of guacamole and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo, but I dig that kind. I also thought the gauc was very good. Plus, they have a whole wall FULL of hot sauces you can choose from. I'm literally in sauce heaven here!

Their beer list is small, but they have some good drafts, like the Pumpking. I mean, there's nothing like a taco and Pumpking... I kid, I kid. I also kept going back to the drink menu and looking at this Apple Pie cocktail made with moonshine. You're only allowed to order 2 per person, assumably so you don't run down the street naked or something. I threw caution to the wind and ordered one. It was delicious and not once did I taste any kind of alcohol. You definitely could end up in the danger zone. Glad I stuck to one. 

The service was incredibly friendly and I'm excited to make this my new go to Mexican joint in Dormont!
