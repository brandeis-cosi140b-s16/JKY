I stop by this Roberto's for lunch from time to time and they are pretty consistent at this location. I mostly stop by on Wednesday because chicken tacos are just 99 cents (limit of 12 per customer) and they have a drive-thru so I can grab my food and go. I've been inside a couple times and it has been clean however I mostly use the drive-thru. The cashiers are friendly and they actually repeat your order back to you making sure it's correct. If you are paying with anything other than cash, they will add a fee for running the card.

Bean and Cheese Burrito ($2.85) - It's a huge flour tortilla filled with you guess it, beans and cheese. This is a meal all by itself for me. The beans are made from scratch and grate the cheese on site. All of the burritos are fairly priced for the size and what you get.  

Chicken Taco ($2.35) - It's kind of hard to come here and pay full price for these when they are just 99 cents every Wednesday. That's why I only order them on hump day. The tacos are fried, so they have a greasiness to them, but I like it. Any of the tacos here are perfect after a night of drinking!

Beef Taco ($2.35) - Fried like the chicken taco, but with shredded beef inside. These are my favorite tacos here and they don't skimp on the fillings. 

3 Rolled Tacos (2.35) - You can choose chicken or beef and it comes with two types of cheeses on top. For the price this is a tasty deal. You can add guac and sour cream for a $1.15 more. 

Carne Asada Fries ($8.10) - This is a huge portion and can easily be shared. Fries topped with beans, sour cream, guac, salsa, cheese and carne asada. They are generous with all the toppings and the fries surprisingly don't get too soggy with all that's piled on top of them. 

Cheese Quesadilla ($2.85) - They use on e of their huge flour tortillas for this and a good amount of cheese.
