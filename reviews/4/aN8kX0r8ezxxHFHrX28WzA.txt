Let me start by saying the food was really good.  I shared Carne Asada fries and a San Fran Burrito...

asada fries were excellent. Fries were crispy topped w shredded cheese (glad for that because i dont like the nacho chz sauce)  guac tasted fresh and the meat itself was nice tender chunks.  Half star deducted becuase i would have liked more meat.

San Francisco burrito... Fries bacon chicken and salsa... This was good too. 

I loved the fact they served our meal with a small dish of shredded lettuce pico sour cream and a dollop of guac. That was a nice touch.

Half star for the wobbly table, that was on my nerves for reals.

Lastly the dining room and bathrooms were clean.  Ill be back to check on that wobbly table and update my yelpers.
