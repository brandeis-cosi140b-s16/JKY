3 cars deep.... 1130, on a wednesday.
While it isn't the fanciest, it's actually better food than I have had most places that are a "real" sit down restaruant.

Ordered the carnitas tacos, and a fish taco. Carnitas were a little crunchy on the outside. The fish taco had too much cabbage on top for me... But over all, no complaints. Their breakfast burritos are quite good, and filling. You will only need one of those, and then a nap.
