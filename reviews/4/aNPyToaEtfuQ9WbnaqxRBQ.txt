If you're cruising around Casa Grande with a fiver in your pocket and the munchies, you need to go to Nico's. It's a closet-sized shack in a giant parking lot, but don't let that throw you. Nico's serves freshly made, delish Mexican food in generous portions. Entrees like enchiladas, burritos, and chimichangas are packed with meat, loaded with cheese and sauce, and most are under five bucks. 
Most sides like rice, beans, or guacamole cost only a buck extra, which is fine for me because I'd rather fill up on the main dish. The only "in-house dining" is a few picnic tables outside but their takeout window services is efficient and super quick.
The biggest draw for me is the quality of the chicken they use: it's shredded in big hunks, and so tender it's almost like candy!
When they ask you if you want "atsass" with your order, say "Si, gracias!"
