I have finally found a mexican/southwestern restaurant that lives up to the fact that it"s IN the southwest! Seriously, iI've had better mexican food in Chicago than most places in Scottsdale/Phoenix! I am happy to report that this place really satisfied an intense mexican craving.  The guacomole is an absolute must order. It seems a little pricey, but it is a very large order (4 hungry girls and 2 baskets of chips didn't finish it) and the chips are bottomless.  Skip the queso, it was too thin and not spicy enough for my taste. I would definitely recommend the chimichangas   Beautiful presentation, crispy, just the right amount of spice, and tender chicken.  While the mexican beer braised enchiladas were good, they didn't live up to their name. I couldn't taste any beer flavor, and the meat could have been a little more tender. My friends reported the shrimp and chicken tacos were both good, but their favorite part was the beans served on the side. Its like a mexican style baked bean...fantastic! It was a quiet night at the restaraunt, which was the lone drawback as I like a place full of people. Although it was nice to be seated immediately and be able to hear your friends without shouting! I will definitely make it a point to return when the weather is nicer to take advantage of their patio, it looked very inviting. All in all, I would definitely give a high recommendation to try this place out. It's worth the drive!
