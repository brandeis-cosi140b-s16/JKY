I have been here a few times when visiting from Calgary, AB Canada. My Canadian friend brought me to this bit of culinary heaven Southwest Mexican style. It is a short drive from San Tan Valley to Florence. 

Travel past the prisons where the most ironic scenario exists that I have ever seen: prison yard backing onto a parking lot and Sonic. Also, there is a shop with prisoner-made goods. Never checked it out, but could be interesting!. Old Main St.of Florence looks like it could be intriguing! Damn!!

OK, now the food. The fundido is to die for - enough on a plate for 4. See pic. The rich cream cheese and seasoning is "unpossible," but there it is! The machaca is epic as well. Chimichanga, beef, which I had today was very nice but not exciting. Again it was good and made better thanks to my dining-man's  (aka wingman) order of grilled jalape√±os! Fajita platter is so hot that there is no chance the meal will cool! Still sizzles as juices drip from the fresh tortilla.Damn!!

The complimentary chips and delicious salsa are refilled until you say STOP! Damn!!

The unsweetened tea, which does not exist in Canada, that I have ever tried. A can of Brisk or Nestea is not even close. Plus it is unlimited refills! Damn!!

Get out to the LB Cantina ( as it now named) and fill your middle with the aforementioned goodness!  Did I say Damn?
