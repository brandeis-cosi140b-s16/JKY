Qdoba is right up the street from where I work, and my coworker is a big fan, so we eat there ever few weeks. I have only had one thing, the naked burrito. Naked simply means no tortilla, so no extra carbs, and you are cutting 330 calories! All the goodies go into a bowl instead. 

You get to pick chicken, steak (both of which are good) and I think they have pork as well, but I have never tried it. Then black or brown beans (I always go with the black). Then you can pile on the rice, veggies, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and multiple different kinds of salsas. The corn salsa  is my favorite, but last visit they had a mango salsa that was excellent. I really hope it is not seasonal bit I bet it is.  

Service has always been great when I have gone, and I have never experienced the employees skimping on things like other reviewers have mentioned. Then again this is the only location I have tried, so perhaps I just don't know what I am supposed to be getting? I am always happy after eating lunch from Qdoba though, so I am a fan.
