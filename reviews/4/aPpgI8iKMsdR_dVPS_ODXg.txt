I love Pittsburgh, PA it's a great city with great people. Being from San Francisco born and raised and Latino at times I've found it difficult to find a place that sells decent tacos and Latin food in PGH. 

I'm glad Doce taqueria is in the southside and just a few blocks away from where I stay when I visit. The tacos and beans are legit. I love the fact that they use queso fresco and crema. Staples for Latin food. The chicken and carnitas are on point. The tortillas are great and it's awesome that they give you options of corn or flour. The beans have a nice kick to them and go well paired with a couple tacos. 

Most importantly Steve and Carrie who work at Doce are great people who you can tell care about the quality of the food and make sure patrons are doing well. 

I'll be back in town soon and looking forward to having a few tacos and chatting with Steve and Carrie again.
