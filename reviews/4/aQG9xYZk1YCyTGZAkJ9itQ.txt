Easy to overlook this place if it weren't for the number of cars outside. A big, old, almost run down exterior holds within it the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona, prepared diligently by a team that knows exactly what it's doing.  Mexican food is too often drowned out by context; either it's "Americanized", or it's spiced to death, or it's hidden behind pseudo-fusion that rarely works beyond some gourmet examples. This place, though, was perfect. Authentic, simple, delicious. Serving sizes were great, sauces were incredible, food was consistent and colorful and delicious. Great experience.
