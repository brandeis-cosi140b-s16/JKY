LAS VEGAS, NV, WORLD TRADE CENTER: Stopped in to Mundo to rest my feet a bit after plowing through xteen levels of the furniture show.  Had the stuffed chile Relleno.  It was flavorful, rich, and with abundant chile.  It was a saut√©ed dish, more than a dry dish, which was untraditional.

The churro dessert was awesome as well.
