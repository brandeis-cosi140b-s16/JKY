I love this place!

I love this place because of their popusas. I've had every kind and they are awesome! Everything else on the menu is good but I mostly go there for the popusas. They come with a side of veggies in vinegar. It goes best if you order chicharones con yuka as a side. Chicharon is pork and yuka is a type of  fried vegetable (it's not sweet or spicy, tastes plain sorta) which you can flavor with red salsa.
