How can you not love this place? It's cheap. It's easy. They have menudo for crying out loud. Many are open 24/7, which is awesome if you work a weird shift or are drunk and coming home from the bar. I'll take this over taco bell any day of the week and twice on Sundays. Please expand to other states.
