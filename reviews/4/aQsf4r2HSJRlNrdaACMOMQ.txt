When I'm craving Mexican Food, I always get tempted by Chipotle to stop by and grab a Steak Burrito.  That's exactly what happened a couple of weeks ago....I couldn't shake the image of a delicious Steak Burrito, so I dropped by this location to satisfy my craving.

When I arrived, there were 6 people ahead of me however it didn't take too long for the line to move.  I ordered my usual here....Steak Burrito w/Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, and the Spiciest Salsa.

It only took a few seconds after sitting down for me to take a bite.....yep, it was just as good as I had imagined.  My all day craving was finally satisfied!  Needless to say, I devoured that bad boy in no time.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience at Chipotle.  I like this location and will definitely return.
