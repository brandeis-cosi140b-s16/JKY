Seeked this place out looking for a sit down, but off the path mexi place.  My wife had a whole fried fish (mojarra) and said it was outstanding.  She thought it could have been cooked a touch more, but that indicates to me that they did it just right.
Kids had carne asada tacos plain, no toppings at their request.  They wolfed them down.
I had two cheese enchiladas topped with their mole sauce.  It was very good.  Service was polite, sincere and prompt.  I would go back in a heatbeat.  After looking at the bill I was even more enthusiastic about this place.  Great job!

Worthy note:  Besides their delicious salsas, they had my wife's favorite bottled hot sauce on tap (Castillos).  That is a first!
