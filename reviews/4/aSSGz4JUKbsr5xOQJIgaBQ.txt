Stop being loyal to the big over priced chains of the lindos and the vivas, give this restaurant a try! My mom brought us here the last time she visited,  I had a shrimp cocktail which was full of shrimp and avocado. This was the first time I had a michellada, now I am in love with this drink, I crave it. My husband had a shrimp and tilapia dish which he described as delicious!  So we have visited a few times since,  every dish we order tastes fresh and recently cooked. But by far my favorite is the molcajete dish with the shrimp, chicken, steak,  potatoes and a hot sauce, to die for, perfect for a cold day, along with some hand made tortillas.....yumm! You must try the home made horchata!!!!!
