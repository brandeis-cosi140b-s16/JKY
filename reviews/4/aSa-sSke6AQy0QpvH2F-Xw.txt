We've eaten our fair share of Mexican food here in Las Vegas, and this was one of the first places we tried.  It's consistently good, and not very expensive.  This was the first time for this location, and on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy.  

We ordered the green chili bites as an app and they were so good.  I got the baja burrito which I love because of the sauce.  I could eat that on just about anything.  

The food was fresh, hot, spiced just right and the service was swift, definitely a return visit is in order.
