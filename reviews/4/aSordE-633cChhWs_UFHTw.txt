Came here the first time and they recommended the beach house and the brûlée. Went with the brûlée and it was really good. Worth it for $7.

Came here for a second time and tried the beach house. SOO different, but it's still a solid choice nonetheless.

Cons: The baskets, chairs and tables need to be better cleaned. I got unlucky and got some sticky residue on some furniture.
