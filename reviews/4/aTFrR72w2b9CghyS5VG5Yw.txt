It's dangerous that I can walk to this place in about three minutes. Their shakes are AMAZING. Best ever.

Their burgers are great too, as are their fries. In fact, all I need is a shake and some fries from this place and I'm happy as a clam. Unfortunately, we really did not enjoy the tacos here. Hopefully, they improve on them - I would love to have a great drive through taco place minutes from me.

I've never actually been in this place, just through the drive through. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a shake.
