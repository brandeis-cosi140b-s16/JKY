For Vegas, this was a treat.  Once you get past the fact that you are sitting in a fake Venice, next to a fake canal, indoors, the setting is as charming as it gets.  We had a table on the patio overlooking the canal as the gondolas slid by, the gondoliers singing beautifully, their songs echoing off the sky painted on the ceiling.  Everything in Vegas is fake something else and this is one of the better cases.

Anyway, I love Mexican food and the food here was quite good.  I had the chicken fajitas and my friend had the chicken mole.  It wasn't the chocolately style of mole he likes but it was good all the same.  My fajitas were tasty and plentiful but nothing exceptional.  The margaritas were very good.

If you compare prices to other Mexican restaurants you know, this is pretty expensive.  (The charge for chips and salsa.). But if you compare the cost of a decent meal in a beautiful setting anywhere else in Vegas, it's a bargain.

Pros:  good food, good service, reasonable prices, wonderful setting

Cons: should have asked "salt/no salt" when we ordered margaritas and why did I have to ask for a glass with my beer?
