My husband and I come here at least once a month to unwind.  If you sit inside when they open up all the sliders and enjoy the breeze (when there is one) you can almost pretend you are in San Diego at the beach.  We always have the same girl serve us and she is so sweet.

I'm super picky about my drinks, so I've had a hard time finding a cocktail that I like.  I don't play into the whole "Skinny blah blah blah" so when I order a margarita or mojito, I expect to get the calories.  The food is decent.  They have more seafood items than anything and I don't eat seafood.

Honestly, El Santo is retro- cool.  I am immediately sent to relaxation mode when I get here.  Better than a massage!  That's why they get 4 stars (and for the server!).  I just think they need to work on their drink recipes.

Also, their happy hour is awesome.  The location isn't that bad.
