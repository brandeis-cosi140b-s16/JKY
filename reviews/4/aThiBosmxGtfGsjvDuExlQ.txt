My husband and I always enjoy eating at Julio G's. The queso dip is the best.  And our absolute favorite is the Pollo Diablo fried extra crispy!  We love taking people here who are visiting from out of town and so far everyone loves it.

The restuarant stays busy with customers and I have never had to wait for a table.  I always enjoy my servers.  They always polite and informative.  Keep up the great work!
