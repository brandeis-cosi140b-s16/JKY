I pass by this place all the time between work and just in general. So looking forward too checking it out plus always good thing try new restaurant yelp about. Lol! My first impression is not feel like normal taco or mexican restaurant. No over the top decor granted still some things keeps it real. The menu is decent size but I was in the mood for some tacos, rice, and beans. I got two lingua and two carne asada. Side each of rice and beans. Not use too because fan of Pepe Tacos or Roberto so rice and beans comes automatic. I wanted too try as much things on the menu as one person can. Fan of that the others not offer is got chips and salsa (in cool pepper bowl) comes with order. Chips really enjoy the salsa was ok. I felt salsa could have been more hearty and little more kick too it. Just my personnel taste buds talking. The tacos was awesome! They gave nice size portion of meat in both! The rice and beans both ok nothing special pass on next time just stick with the tacos.
