A pretty cool place indeed!  It is family friendly.  And it's a family.  What you get when you arrive is always changing.  Sometimes when it is slow the owners and staff will slide right down next to you and chat you up.  When it's busy things can get backed up and service suffers.  They've been working on this issue though so it is getting better.  The enchiladas and pizza are exceptional!! Worth every second of the scenic drive to get there.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  A great place to stop if you are traveling with your furry friends.  There are pool tables.  And two pool leagues play out of raceway.  If you are a pool player and want to get to know some people the leagues are a great place to start.  They play Monday and Wednesday nights.  All in all raceway is a great place to be.  Go when you are not pressed for time.
