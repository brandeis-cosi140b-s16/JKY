I love all of the La Canasta restaurants in the valley, with south 7th ave being my favorite. This one however is the one I frequent most often because it has a drive-thru. The employees are friendly, the food comes fast and is DELICIOUS. La Canasta is always my go-to Mexican food  restaurant and I am always comparing others to them, few have stood up to that comparison. only wish they gave free chips with combos as they do for dine-in
