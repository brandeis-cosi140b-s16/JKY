I have never been to this restaurant, but product vendors will seldom come into our office, bring goodies and treats to the Interior Designers! 

This particular fabric vendor pays a visit in the mornings with a bag of Felipito's breakfast burritos and it is very good! It is not oily, has amazing taste and portion is huge! I can only eat half which fills me up pass lunch time!

I am a fan of their breakfast burritos!! Keep em coming Mr. Fabric Vendor!
