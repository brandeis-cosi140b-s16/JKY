Great margaritas n yummy fajitas.  The prices are right in line with other family Mexican places in the area.  Very nice wait staff. Nothing fancy about this place as I sit in sneakers and jeans with a belly full of fajitas. .definitely recommend for a nice lunch/dinner out when you're being low key. Oh and its not just a name. .the fajitas come out in a flaming presentation.
