I thought the atmosphere was really fun like a cantina in Mexico would be, and the food was good with generous portions. 
Only thing was that the tacos were a little too salty and the margaritas were pricey as hell. 
My wife got the salmon though, and that was delicious with that chipotle salsa on the side. 
Still a fun place to go on the strip and the food is still good enough to go back to.
Really good for groups.
