I'm only giving this 4-stars because I do not want to mislead someone looking for a little bit more of an upscale meal - but fact is, this is absolutely delicious mexican-american and for the food & service I'd give it a 5.  I love everything I've had on the menu and I love the rice so much I wish I could get the recipe...I don't think I'll ever eat a Mexi rice I love more.   Good sized portions - note, if multiple people want a side of rice, just order one....it's massive (did I mention I love the rice?)

I've said this about my love for Monical's pizza and same goes for El Toro...I live in ChiCity and have yet to find a (non-fancy or specialty) Mexi place here I like better.  I'm sure some would say I'm crazy...I don't care!  YUM!

Their service is the FASTEST I've ever seen.  Which I know could be a good or bad thing depending on what kind of experience you're looking for (again, the 4-star thing) - but if you are HONGARY this is the place.  Chips and salsa on the table as you sit down.  Someone ready to take your order/answer questions immediately.  Water glass never goes empty.

And last but not least, so very reasonably priced (I shouldn't say this but it's cheap actually!).  3 of us can eat there for less than $20 and that includes my $3 big margarita!

I wouldn't come here as an 'experience' outside of the great food and quick service...meaning you might want to go somewhere else on a first date or with friends if you're looking for atmosphere.

Only other thing, is that they can be heavy handed on the salt....
