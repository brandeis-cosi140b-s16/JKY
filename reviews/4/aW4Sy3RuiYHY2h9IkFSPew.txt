This my fix when I want cheap and easy mexican food quick! 

open 24 hours, so if your hungry and leaving the club in Scottsdale its nothing to take a cab down the street and get a burrito from this spot
I have only tried the breakfast burrito and the California both are delicious..

cant go wrong with 24 hr Mexican food especially this spot..
