The food is good...but..I think it's overpriced.  Once went in not really paying attention too what we were ordering...and the bill for two was over $30 which was ridiculous. 

Now I order the salad with the creamy tomatillo dressing...sooooo good!!!  It's a huge salad and it's only $6..I always have some left over. The tortilla's are amazing..I can't stop eating them. I'm not a fan of the pork, too sweet for me. They also have amazing lemonade's and tea's that can be mixed with fresh mint...very good.

It is loud here but that doesn't bother me.
