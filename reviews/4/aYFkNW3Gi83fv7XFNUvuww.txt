Be careful you might pass this place up. Don't be fooled by the brick exterior. Inside hides a gem. Good service and very nice staff. Awesome hot dog buffet. It comes with a drink and fries as many refills as you can handle for $6!!  Wow.  Great al pastor tacos. Tender meat a slight crunch of the tortilla and their salsa. Yum!
