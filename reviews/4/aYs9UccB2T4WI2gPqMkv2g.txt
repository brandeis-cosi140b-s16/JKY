I had about 20 minutes yesterday to go in and get the burritos made (we got steak) and get back home.  And it was no problem.  Food was fresh, burrito was very good, they made the burritos exactly how I asked.  The place was sparkling clean.  I got a grapefruit soda, and it was warm and the front counter person was a little snotty, otherwise it would have been 5 stars.  I'll be back!
