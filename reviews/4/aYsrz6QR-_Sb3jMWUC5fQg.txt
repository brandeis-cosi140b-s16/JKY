Best-kept secret of South Mountain. Awesome, flavorful, juicy, generously stuffed, shredded beef tacos (only .99 ea. on Tues.) Generous portions. All made-to-order, fresh as can be. Verde Sauce is incredible. Refried beans homemade and authentic. Shells perfectly deep-fried crispy, but not greasy. Adequate sprinkling of Queso Blanco. Salsa Bar with chunky-sized limes. Huge menu. Many Specials and Combos to choose from. Breakfast Burritos too. Just fast enough service for an easy wait, and slow enough to be homemade and authentic. Staff is friendly and polite. Drive through (open 24/7) is quick, but narrow, and a neat trick to maneuver after-bar, so drive really, really slow and carefully or your going to take the side of your car out on the back wall. No joke.
