I personally loved the food here. I had a carne asada burrito and it was seasoned perfectly. The flavors with all the ingredients it came with was very good. I think the rice was also seasoned well and the beans were nice. I'd say that the food gets a perfect 5 stars. However I am rating this 4 stars due to the small size of the restaurant. It was incredibly hard to get around in that place, especially when its busy. The location seems a bit dumpy as well. I remember passing by it all the time thinking eww, but after reading reviews and seeing this restaurant on Best Of Las Vegas's website, I had to give it a chance. The other factor that brings this down to 4 stars is the fact that they don't serve fountain drinks. They only serve bottle/can beverages, so don't expect free refills. Overall, a solid 4 out of 5 and worth the price as well.
