I love it here - I really do!

Definitely a fan of the bar/restaurant/outside pool concept. Especially during our brutally hot summers here in the valley.

I like their inside area - I feel like I'm almost in a cave of sorts - very cool. Outside is great too - very glam (w/their chaise lounges/sofas/pillows in cabanas)! Wish there was a wee bit more room to meander around the pool - always feels like someone is inches away from falling in pool.

Service is always quite friendly and prompt too. Good drinks and I've only had appetizers here (typical bar food). ;)
