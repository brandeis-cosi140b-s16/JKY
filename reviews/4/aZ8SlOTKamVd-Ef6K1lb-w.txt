Last night around 7PM my boyfriend and I were on our way to El Hefe for Taco Tuesday but decided to try something new & go here (of course I had anxiety because I didn't have time to check the Yelp reviews first LOL). We sat at the bar and there was like one other person in there besides us, so I was kind of worried. HH was still going on so I got a glass of wine for $5, it was nice big pour, & I spotted that it was one of my favorites -- Velvet Devil (which in stores is around $15) so this was a great deal for a bar. The boyfriend got a $5 HH margarita which was good, a little too strong for me, but I'm sure most people would love the fact that it was that strong. The Taco Tuesday special is for $2 ea you can get carne asada ; chicken ; barbacoa. So we got some of each & they were all really good & big for street tacos! A lot of stuffing, and even a big dab of guac, I was impressed. I would definitely come back here.
