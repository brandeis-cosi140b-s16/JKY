This place is great.  I love the blackened shrimp tacos and fish tacos and they have some really tasty carnitas too.  I haven't had any of their burritos since I crave the tacos so frequently, it pains me to order something else when we do go!  My husband loves that they have Horchata in their self serve drink area.  We try to make it there at least once per month!
