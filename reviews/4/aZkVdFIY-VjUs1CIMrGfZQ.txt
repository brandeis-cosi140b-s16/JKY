I've been going to this location for years... Ever since I was a student at UNLV. It's always hit the spot, usually it's kinda dirty and unkept but the staff has always been pleasant. It's between a 3 and 4, I'm sure closer to a 4 for all the times I've been there. Also, don't know if they still do it, but they used to give a free drink to UNLV students with their ID. Awesome promotion.
