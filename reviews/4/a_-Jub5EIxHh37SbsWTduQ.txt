So I have been to Vida Vida three times now. Once just to drink and twice to eat. The atmosphere is super laid back and chill with some good outdoor seating. Everything is a la carte.

Drinks: They have decent drink specials. I had there margarita just once. Super crazy sweet....havent ordered it since and have just stuck with beer the rest of the time.

Food: For appetizers, I have had the queso and guac. The queso is actually really good, it's like a chipotle tasting queso. The guac was good as well, though the serving may have been a little small (though, it could be that Im just a guac freak and never can have enough guac!!!). For tacos, I have had (between various visits) the philly taco, the Carnitas taco, and a fried fish (or maybe it was chicken, who knows) taco. The philly is by far the best.....super yummy!

Overall, great place to eat at in a relaxed atmosphere with good prices. All of which is hard to come by in the Epicenter!
