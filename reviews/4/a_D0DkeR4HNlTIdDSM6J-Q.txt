Been coming here for many years.  Although the food has had slight ups and downs I would have to say that overall it's never disappointing and the people are always very nice. 
I want to give it 5 stars but I think 90% is a solid summation of my experiences here. 
If your new in town this is definitely a must visit and should be a staple for a great lunch dinner or happy hour. 
I order the fajitas steamed instead of with oil so it's healthier and only had an issue once getting it that way out of the kitchen (hence the 90%). It's much better that way to me. 
Chips and salsa are dangerously good and they are pretty generous with them. I try to exercise self control but they usually defeat me. 
Enjoy!
