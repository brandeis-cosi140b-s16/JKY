Where to begin! First off the area in which the restaurant is located is not the most pleasant. But don't let that scare you away because the food is amazing! The inside is pretty small and not suitable for large groups. This place is also cash only. Every single time I go to Ritos I get a bean burrito enchilada style. And it is soooo good!!!!! It's pretty big and I only finish half of it. They also have some of the best tasting guacamole tacos, at times it has a kick to it which I absolutely love. Their quesadillas are huge too and packed with cheese. Finally, the tostadas and damn delicious! The only criticism I can give to Ritos in regards to their food is the salsa. I think they can up the ante with it.
I would've given them 5 stars but their hours are always a hit or miss! I'd give them a call first to make sure they're open.
