By chance stumbled on Gil's, and walked away very pleased with my meal.  The staff was extremely friendly.  The chips quite possibly could have been the best I ever had - crisp, thick, not greasy.  Although green chili's are the specialty, the red sala was great, with a terrific smokey flavor.  

To top it off - BYOB!!

It was empty when I went, so I hope others frequent Gil's.  I would hate for Gil's to fail because of lack of interest. We have our share of bad restaurants so when you find a good one, you just hope it succeeds.
