I frequented this location the most on a recent one month stay down in Las Vegas.  It was the cleanest and the quickest service.  Open 24 hours was convenient for when I was getting out of work at 4:30 in the morning.  I had everything from their taco's to their tortas to their burritos, all are wonderful.  You won't break the bank on a meal here too, which is great and rare to get a good value for your money these days!
