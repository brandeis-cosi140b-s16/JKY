You have to go to this place during happy hour! 3-5 Tues - Fri: 1/2 off drinks and $1.50 tacos. They have about 5 or 6 different types of tacos and they are small like street tacos. I had the fish, shrimp, & shredded pork tacos. I couldn't choose which one was my favorite, because they were all really good. 

They have so many types of Tequila too. I had a great margarita with 100% agave. Later we ordered some guacamole which is delicious. They mix pomegranate seeds in the mix with tomatoes, onions, and avocado. I think they normally make it table side, but they were pretty busy when I went in there.

The service was great, our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu items as well as the drinks. She recommended items to us that would satisfy what we were looking for. The place has some great art surrounding the walls. They also have murals outside on the alley side. It's quite refreshing seeing this art instead of graffiti coming up to a place. Well done!
