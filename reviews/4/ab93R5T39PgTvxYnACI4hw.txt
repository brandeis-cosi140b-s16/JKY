after spending a few days at the grand canyon and living off Dennys I was dying for something ethnic to eat. So on my way to vegas i bust out the yelp app on my phone and start looking for places close to where I am. I just randomly picked Faustos from the list. Mexican food sounded good and I was dying to eat something decent. 

I was pretty happy with the food here. sure a lot of it had to do with not eating anything worth wild for the past 3 days. I thought the quality was pretty good. Decent mexican food in a casual enviroment. 

I am happy I stopped here to eat. If I'm ever in the area again i would come back for sure.
