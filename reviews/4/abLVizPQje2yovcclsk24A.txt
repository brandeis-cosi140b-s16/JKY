Ok the food is really not much to talk about, its good and cheesy but kinda bland for mexican food.  The only reason I am leaving a review is cause the guy that works the counter at night is so AWESOME I had to put it in writing.  I don't know his name but I usually see him around dinnertime and he is always so happy and friendly and upbeat.  He really cares and that is such a rarity these days.  Thank you for being you and making me happy every time I come in.
