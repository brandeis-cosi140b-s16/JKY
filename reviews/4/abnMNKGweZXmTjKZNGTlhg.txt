Stopped in for a quick fix on one of my King's Ranch loops and it was pretty cool - I liked the outrageous color graphics that help draw in the hungry traveler. Very indigenous. 
So the agua fresca; I'm always a sucker for Pi√±a - they know how to buy and prep pineapples! 
   Loved the pastor tostada - went down pretty quick. I forgot the second item ordered so I'll just have to go back, reassess and report my findings.
