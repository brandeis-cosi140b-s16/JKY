We arrived for breakfast and were delighted to see 5 empty tables. Then we were told we couldn't sit down because , per the manager, "they were reserved."  We waited 20 minutes in line with others and the tables remained empty. No one was seated in them for an entire hour. It seems crazy to operate a restaurant with empty tables. Meanwhile the wait staff and chef worked their magic. The food and service were over the top. I will return. But note to owner- this is a place that could run itself. A manager who stands around looking at an iPad is a manager you don't need. Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
