A solid Mexican food restaurant and honestly, very surprised that finding good Mexican food in Phoenix can be challenging.  

Location is in a large shopping plaza with lots of parking.  Very easy to find so you should have no problem getting there.

Food is not bad at all with standard items like burritos, tacos, and chimichangas.  More of an Americanized version of Mexican food but what I value here is the consistency.  We have been coming to Macayo's quite often now and the food is never bad and our experience is always pleasant.  I like getting their combo items of tacos/burritos/enchiladas. 

Price is very reasonable and you can bring your whole family without breaking the bank.
