I met some friends at this new place this last Saturday. I had never been to the previous Mucho Gusto, but this new place is very good!  The restaurant is decorated in the new "hipster" decor like a lot of new places in the area.  It doesn't bother me too much, I let the food tell the story.  The food was great!  I had the braised chipotle rib.  very tender, lots of flavor.  The corn and beans that came with it was very tasty! Being not a fan of most "Mexican" food places in Tempe, this place isn't authentic Mexican, but it is well done! We also had some chips and guacamole. Those were good as well.  Service was pretty good. We all enjoyed ourselves.  Plus some live music playing some 90's hits.  Drinks are little on the pricey side would be my only complaint.  But, I will be back to try some more of their yummy food!
