Spot is sort of "off-the-beaten-path" ... Had my friend not told me about it I would have never driven down the road and found it. Looks a little iffy from the outside, but the inside is pretty modern and updated. Everything looked very clean, and the bar was full with people eating/drinking.

My wife and I both got tacos --- pretty good! Nothing to write home about, but for the price I'll definitely be back. Our favorites were the chipotle chicken & the pineapple pork. If you come on Tuesdays, they have $1 tacos (with drink purchase I was told). Thursdays are $4.50 margs ... a fun place to come with some friends for cheap food and drinks!
