I may have to start every Mexican restaurant review with a warning: I'm not an expert on Mexican food but I sure did tear up the burrito I ordered!  Translation...I thought it was amazing!

For a burrito to please me, it needs to be big (this was huge!) and have delicious and flavorful ingredients.  I ordered the shrimp burrito and the first thing I noticed was that there was a ton of shrimp in it and they seemed to be fresh and not frozen.  I love me some sauces and I think that really topped it off for me because the queso sauce inside was incredible!  There was also loads of rice, peppers, onions, and tomatoes.  The only issue was that it was TOO stuffed and the whole thing fell apart.  I didn't really mind, considering I just ripped it apart with a fork and demolished it!

So now that you know I'm a fan of the burrito, I have to also talk about how the chips were definitely freshly baked and probably some of the best chips I've ever had.  I realize that normally people want a kick to their salsa, but since I end up crying after a couple bites of something hot, the mild salsa was just right for me.  I also love chunky salsa, and this fit the bill.  The gauc was whipped and not chunky at all.  I was a little surprised, but I still thought it was good.  

I just wish this place wasn't on Route 51.  How awful is 51 with the traffic??  I worry it could be the downfall of this place because it stands alone, not really around anything else. I also hope they start letting you bring in the booze...I would have enjoyed a nice Dos Equis with my meal!  But....

As I'm typing this my mouth is watering for another taste of that fantastic burrito.  I'll be back for you my tasty burrito friend, don't you worry!
