The name of the game for fast food companies like Chipotle is consistency.  And as you might imagine, a company that was invested in heavily by Mickey D's, you can count on consistency at each location and this one is no different.

The quality of the ingredients is what really separates Chipotle from their competition, the meat, cheese, salsas, etc was just wonderful.  Every time I eat at a Chipotle I feel like I've eaten the best ingredients available.  Love their ice tea, seems to marry perfectly with their burritos and bowls.  The corn salsa paired with the medium salsa over chicken is terrific.  They will always give you a little extra of each ingredient if you ask (meat however is an extra charge).

This location always seems to have a ton of counter help at the rush hour to get you through the line quickly, much appreciated.  The tables are clean and the condiment area is as well.  

Cops always seem to be at this location, added bonus to see sidearms in public from those in Blue-thanks for your service!
