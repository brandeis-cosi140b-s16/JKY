Another excellent meal at GG's!  It's like one of Carefree's best kept secrets, tucked back in Spanish Village.  The signage isn't great, but it's worth looking for.  There's two ways in----a small arched doorway by Desert Treasures Gift Shop and a larger arched gateway that says "Spanish Village" above it.

The patio was perfect last night. Fairy lights were twinkling, soft warm breeze----sadly, DH wanted to eat inside!  (He'd been outside all day at Horseshoe Lake and I think he wanted some wall time)  Anyhow, I have to admit we were so happy with our meals last time we stayed on that same path and had the pork belly tacos and Chrissy's red enchilada again!  Just as good last time---and so much food!  I definitely have lunch for today and probably tomorrow!  (After all his activity at the lake, DH had no prob snarfing the whole enchilada!)  We did try the Buttermilk Salad--we split between us and the greens were fresh and the dressing EXCELLENT!  (I'd like to have the recipe!)

We had a different server than last time--this time was Scott.  He was great.  Prompt, personable.  Our food came out hot (or cool re the salad!) and in a timely manenr.  He kept my iced tea topped off as well as DH's wine.

I swear, we eventually are going to try the Italian menu---I just can't get past the tacos!

And someone told me they have a super Happy Hour from 3-6 pm.  I could hang on the patio for a few hours, no problem!
