I had the carnitas tacos and cheese enchiladas. Both were amazing... the carnitas was marinated perfectly, the enchilada had queso fresco and onions in it. Absolutely delicious!! the red sauce they put on there enchiladas is awesome. The people that work there are super friendly. Can't wait to come back. I would definitely recommend this taqueria shop.
