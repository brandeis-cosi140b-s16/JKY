One of the more reliable places to dine at Tempe Marketplace. You actually get a decent full meal and you get what you expect... Mexican food... ish. Whatever Chipotle is, that is what you get. Nothing fancy, nothing too terrible and at the price you expect, and I have to admit, it fills you up.

It's your typical fast food place but I do really enjoy Chipotle, and this location hasn't let me down yet. There are other options in the mall, but sometimes, it's the cheaper things you want and getting what you are expecting.
