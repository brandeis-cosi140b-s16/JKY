The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it is pricy for tacos. 
That being said, these are gourmet tacos and Very very good tacos, large portions.

 We got the guac and unlimited chips ($6.99) the guac and chips were very good. 

3 taco dinner ($10.99) + $1.50 substitute for Tortilla soup (which was darn good, great with the chips too!). 
Tacos: Carne Asade con Salsa verde
Al Pastor w Pineapple
slow roasted pork something (wife got) 

All were very good, fresh and delicious. Add one beer and 1 soft drink and $26 total. 

As I said, a bit pricy, individual tacos are $3.50 each. But for fresh ingredients, good service and a gourmet selection, I would go back on occasion or maybe for a happy hour or meal deal. 

Very good.
