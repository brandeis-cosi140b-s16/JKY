I found a yelp deal for this location of Blue Burrito, so I thought I'd give it a try. It's about 7 miles from my home, but I rode my bike because it was actually cloudy and nice for an August day. I ordered the build-your-own burrito with the grilled cod, sat at the bar, and had a couple blue margaritas with my meal. The cod was perfectly prepared and seasoned, the margaritas were refreshing, and the service was excellent! The staff are very friendly, the restaurant is impeccably clean, and they even have an outdoor patio with comfy seating. 

Bonus - because the burrito was so large, I was only able to eat half. They wrapped it up for me, and placed it in a bag of ice, so I could take it with me (which was the only way I could get it to go, since I was on a bike, and though "nice" for AZ in August, still about 100Â°).

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the salsas are weak - none hot, none all that great. Otherwise, this place is fantastic, and I will definitely be returning!
