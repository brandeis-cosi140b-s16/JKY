One day the hubby and I were looking for a good mexican joint...we were tired of the food from the strip..so we were being brave and driving around a city we dont even know. This place caught our eye since its shaped differently and the color was oh so bright. 

We ordered tacos de cabeza....which are delicious...I really didnt care for the tacos de carne asada...ive had better...but the cabeza was finger licking good. the awesome part is that you get free refills on horchata which you dont find that here in our town....

This place has became a must everytime we are in vegas...
