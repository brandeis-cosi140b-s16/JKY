This place was awesome when I first came to college and Chipotle wasn't around.  I still prefer it over Chipotle because they have nachos.  

There was a short period when the state street location offered breakfast burritos on the weekend but that stopped after a few months which was a shame.  The breakfast burritos were awesome.  It was like sonic x2.  

I'd go there every weekend and pick one up and eat half of it in the morning then pass out.  Wake up later in the day and finish it off.  I'd easily give it 5 stars if they brought back the breakfast burritos.
