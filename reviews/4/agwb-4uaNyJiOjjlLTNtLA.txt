Tex-Mex chain restaurants are as inspired as the American hamburger these days, but On The Border really sticks out for quality service, food, and portions.  I can't say that I was overly wowed by it, but I was quite pleased with what I got.  

On all occasions I visited, I have had friendly, personable staff who seemed to enjoy what they were doing and joked around with our party.  Their taquitos are great; crispy fried goodness with chicken, onions, and covered in sauce.I agree with Kathy that the food is greasy, but what can you expect from a chain like this?   Rather than the obligatory refried beans and dried-out, bland rice of most places, they use black beans and well-seasoned rice.   The chips and salsa were surprisingly fresh and not overly salted like other Tex-Mex chains.  For a chain, they have surprisingly fresh food.

Service is quick and On the Border is rarely crowded like neighboring restaurants.  I recommend it for a hearty lunch with co-workers or friends. It's nothing that will leave a lasting legacy, but On the Border probably won't let you down either.
