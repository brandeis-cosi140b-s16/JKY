Not bad, Zaba's!  I pass this place almost every day, as it is close to my gym, but I've never stopped to eat here. Today I decided to bite the bullet (or the burrito, as it were), and give it a shot.  

This place is kind of like the Subway of Mexican food. You pick your type of food (burrito/bowl), the type of wrapping (flour or corn tortilla), the meat you want, and they'll slide you on down the line as you pick your fixings.  I decided on a chicken burrito with a flour tortilla. I particularly appreciated that beans were not mandatory on my burrito and that sour cream was not extra.

All in all, it was pretty good. I felt like they were a little skimpy on the chicken, but all of the fixings were tasty and it was a sizable enough burrito. One thing that needed improvement was that it wasn't very hot. I am one of those people who likes my food piping hot, and this was just warm at best. The corn salsa also has lots of cilantro, just an FYI.

Service was very quick and friendly, and the cost for the burrito was $7.59 (including tax).
