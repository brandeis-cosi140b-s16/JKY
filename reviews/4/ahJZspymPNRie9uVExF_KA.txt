It's a cool looking place. Have eaten there 3 times already. The tacos are small and if you are a big eater you might need to order two sets of 3 but they are good (the chicken tacos are very good) except for the Veggie tacos which are kind of only mushrooms and tortilla.  At night it turns into a cool bar. They even have a DJ on weekend nights and the one I heard was great. So for food 3 stars for margaritas and ambiance 5 stars. So average 4 stars.
