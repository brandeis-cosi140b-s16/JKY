Two delicious tacos for $5.  Awesome!  Corn tortillas with your choice of the usual meats but also lengue (tongue).  Fish and shrimp tacos cost a little more.   Don't forget the great sauces -  the green is mild, one of the red sauces is very hot - just look for all the pepper seeds floating in it.

They were making enchiladas that looked great.  

Go inside and get some of the chips from their chip factory or take some tortillas home for a make it your way, since you can put almost anything delicious you want into a taco.
