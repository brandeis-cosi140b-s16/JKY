Huge line today but they got us through very quickly. They had four guys helping to build your burrito.  I love the fresh ingredients. Brown rice and chicken is the best but I've had the pork and steak and that's pretty good. Just love the chicken cause the spices and the grilling. Always perfect. 

To top it off the servers were very friendly and smiling with a very clean environment. The only downfall of this Chipotle is the parking. Seems like the parking lot is always full. 

Love Chipotle. Burrito madness love it.
