This place really sucked under the prior owner BUT the original owner is back and I the food is much,much, much better! I only hope thar the prior owner didn't cause irreparable harm to the place by running it into the ground. Before you couldn't pay me to eat there. Now that the original owner is back, we literally go no less than once a week since we are mexi food junkies!
