Ok, so the fourth star is really for our 2 pitchers of Paloma Blaco margaritas. Sorry, they're light, they're refreshing, and they go down well after a day of screaming down hills and mountains in Boulder City.

We checked this place out because during our latest trip to Vegas we stayed at the Monte Carlo and we were HUNGRY. Table for six at 12:30 was relatively easy to procure.

All in all a great time, the chips were light and salted just right, served with 3 types of salsa. Only thing is I kept waiting for the most interesting man in the world to come and sit with us and say "stay thirsty, my friends."

The food is ok, satisfying with good portions, if not 100% delicious (a la El T, OTB, etc), but good times with lots of good looking people around.
