This is their second location . Located in what was formerly a Boston Market, I truly must say this is one of my favorite family Mexican restaurants. I have not had the opportunity to try out many items on the menu but by far it has my favorite Chile Relleno's in the Valley. Side items are generous if not a bit costly (though I love Chipolte and guacamole is $1.50 vs $2.50 here). Decor is a bit dated but otherwise I definitely recommend it.
