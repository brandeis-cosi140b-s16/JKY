The burritos here are some of the best I've had in Arizona.  

I recently had the Hash Brown breakfast burrito.  Like all of their burritos, it was HUGE and filled with fresh ingredients.  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've ever inhaled.

I have also had the surf and turf burrito.  Very good, but must of the shrimp was clustered in the middle part of the burrito.  It was several bites until I tasted any shrimp.  

And finally, I had a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style.  This might have been my favorite.  

Mind  you, lest you think I am a complete pig, I did not eat all of these in one visit.  Each time I've been there, the place is virtually empty (mid morning, mid afternoon).  I do tend to go to restaurants during "off" hours when I can (i.e. like 2-3 for lunch) so maybe that has something to do with the lack of patrons each time I've been there.

They have a drive-thru which I utilized one morning for breakfast.  Each visit has been quick and the service staff have been friendly and I've always gotten exactly what I've ordered.  Oh - and I really like their salsa.  It's an excellent compliment to the Hash Brown burrito.  I'll be back!
