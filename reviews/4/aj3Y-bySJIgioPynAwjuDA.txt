We've been to Sunday Brunch numerous times. I always look for waitess Cecila to serve us  as she is an EXCELLENT waitress. I think she has ESP because she always knows what we need before we have time to ask her for it!  LOL!
The majority of the brunch is excellent especially the grilled jalepenos, chorizo, chil verde and colorado. The Chile Rellenos are to die for!!!  Acording to the manger, they only serve one tray of them so if you dont get there when they open and you are one the first persons in the buffet line, you may not taste these killer relenos!!!.
The only complaint I have is on the menudo. Whoever makes this stuff  needs to he sent back to "menudo cooking school," LOL! It has no flavor and I have yet to find a slice of tripe in it. It looks like they used beef and bone scraps to make. It is an insult to call it menudo. 
To summarize, you love most of the food and service. Just dont eat the menudo.
