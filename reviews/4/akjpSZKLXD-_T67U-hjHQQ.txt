Excellent fast food restaurant. Way better than any of the Bertos. Carne asada has good flavor and seasoning. Green and red hot sauces taste good not super watered down stuff most of these type of restaurants serve. Staff will warm up to you after a few visits. If you need your carne or rolled taco fix this place is great.
