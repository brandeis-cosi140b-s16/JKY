As of now, the Chipotle here has fantastic and fast service, whereas I dread going to the one in Oakland. The parking lot is huge, and hard to not find a parking spot. Additionally, the location is home to great stores and a Carnegie Library down the block.

The food is coma-inducing, but so worth it every time. Get the vinaigrette too! It is a nice addition to your bowl or burrito
