I was here for Breakfast Club. I have heard for years I really need to go here.  Well, my friends were right.  The food and service were really good and I had to leave early so I gave my cash to another Yelper and consequently did not have to deal with the cluster of paying in a large party with one check.  I had grilled chicken breast with eggs and beans.  The chicken was topped with a red sauce, grilled onions and some mild jalapenos.  The parking has gotten so bad they make employees park off the property so some have quit after several break ins to their cars.  In the evenings they have security but only in the lot. They have supposedly bought the property to the North and applied to expand the building and add parking.  Talking to long time Hispanic residents, the building was once a dance venue with live bands. The biggest hangups about this place are parking and getting seated.  It is not uncommon to wait almost an hour including weekday lunch times.
