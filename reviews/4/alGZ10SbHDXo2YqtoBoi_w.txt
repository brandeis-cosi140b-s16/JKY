Noms.  Open late, always smells fantastic, exceptionally clean, lots of Latino locals (always important when looking for good south-of-the-border grubs).  Horchata IS fantastic here, as is portion size and did I mention nom?  

Had the .. er, 'La' Merced, wasn't sure about an omelette in a sandwich but I'm now a believer.  While I've only been here but once, its apparent this is much better than your average Mexican restaurant in the valley, and I rate nothing on Yelp unless it deserves it.   The family proprietors obviously take great pride in their homemade food and it shows, we've all been to Fili's and such and while I can't possibly complain about Super Nachos! this seems to be an orthodoxed church of authentic Mexican grub.   Even though the establishment is a smallish joint it's cleaner than any McDonald's I've ever been in and the love that goes into the food is apparent.  I was only there for a bit to pick up some food for the late night muchies but still got homemade chips and salsa (real salsa, ie don't bring grandma or those cousins from Ohio as they will whine about the heat) and even got to watch some Univision.  

TL;DR: Eat here, it's good.
