First time here, and impressed that they opened a second restaurant in our small town where restaurants have a hard time surviving--but now I know why! We had the shrimp soft tacos, fajita-style quesadilla (carne asada--steak) and a carnitas (pork) red chile burrito, enchilada-style all for about $22 after a 10% coupon from the local newspaper. Immediately the freshness of the food was apparent especially with the fresh green bell peppers, fantastic succulent shrimp, and nicely seasoned steak. The tortillas themselves tasted freshly-made. We used to go to Taco Hell when we needed a fast fix, but never again--for the same price you get high-def vs old B&W analog, more meat versus less junk-indiscernible filling, and what seems a lot more fresh versus a lot more frozen. Their salsas are worth filling up on, too! Two in particular: the green salsa verde had a generous amount garlic that made it quite nice and full-flavored, and an clear, oil-based one that had a very rich roasted and slightly smokey flavor that produced a nice growing hot sensation during the after-taste. The more you used, the warner your mouth got! My new favorite. The reason for the four versus five stars was the pork, although very generous and moist, to both me and my wife, tasted a bit too salty. Summary: this is the quality and freshness of Baja Fresh, and the quantity of Filibertos, and at a good price. Can't wait to go back and check out how they make chicken!
