Lien must have seen the confusion on our faces when we walked in. He commenced to offering us delicious samples of the menu items. I deceided on the jade red chicken, the machaca and the jerk fried rice. All were pretty tasty.The meats were seasond well and i loved the jade sauce. They also threw in some snickerdoodle cookies that were also tasty! The service was fast and friendly and i'm glad we ate there.
