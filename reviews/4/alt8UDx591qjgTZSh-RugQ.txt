I came to Cabo for a birthday dinner and this place is great!  The salsa bar is AHHH-mazing because Cabo provides different sweet, mild, and spicy sauces.  Some examples include tomatillo avocado, pico de gallo, a sweet and spicy fruit salsa, and these hot salsas that I can't remember the names of.  They also have a refried bean sauce that helps neutralize the spices in your mouth.  I also like the fact that Cabo has a self-serve chips area so that customers don't have to ask the workers, "Can we get more chips?"  The carne asada burrito was definitely flavorful because the steak was marinated well and the corona-rita was smooth and buzzing.  If you come here on someone's special day, they sing and give a very large sombrero.  I'm definitely a fan and I will be back in the future!  If you enjoy Mexican food, this is the place to be!
