Two words...happy hour.  One of the best happy hour's in town, 4-8PM, 2 for 1.  A great place to kickstart your night with lots of cheap drinks.  The only food I have ever eaten are the quesadillas and chips/salsa...both were decent.  This review only applies to the bar aspect, food is 3 stars.  Great place to watch football games too.
