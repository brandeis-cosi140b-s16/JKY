Tried out their Champagne Brunch on Sunday and it was a treat! From menudo, posole, enchiladas, pan dulce and a lot of other choices! I'm usually pretty nervous when I hear Mexican buffet but after trying pretty much everything at Las Fuentes not only was I stuffed but wanted to wait around a while just so I could have more. Service was excellent and judging by the crowd this new place won't have any problems staying busy.
