For being fast food I absolutely love love love Robertos especially on my 3am drunk fast food runs!! 

I usually order there Carne Asada soft tacos there so delicious from the tortilla to the carne to the guacamole to the cilantro everything on it is delicious. If I don't get that I'll get there carne Asada nachos those are sooo freaking delicious!!! And huge huge portions two people can eat 1 order of the nachos that's how big they are.I have never been disappointed when I eat there.

I always take my friends here from outta town after the club or bar and they all agree Robertos is the best fast food place ever!
