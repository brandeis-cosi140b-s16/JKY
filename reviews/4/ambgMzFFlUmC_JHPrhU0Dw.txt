I was so pleased to find out that in that fake little village that is the Homestead Waterfront, there is an actual family-owned-and-operated restaurant among all the corporates.  It's right next to The Improv, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best place to have a meal before the show.  I've been there twice now, and even though I've been to some of the best Mexican restaurants in Southern California, this place made me smile.  Want a BIG margarita?  They've got'm.  BIGGER?  They've got'm.  A PITCHER OF MARGARITAS?  Yep, they've got'm.  Great service, an incredible selection of Tequilas that you've never heard of, and yes, really good margaritas. (on the rocks - not frozen.)

My experience with the food has been mixed.  The stuffed pablano peppers are awesome.  The fish tacos are superb.  The Carnitas Verde is THE BEST thing I've tried on the menu.  They came up short on their enchiladas.  I would have to say that either somebody blew it in the kitchen the night I had an enchilada, or they just don't know that there is more than just a change of tortilla that differentiates a burrito from an enchilada.  I was a little disappointed (but not surprised) to find out that the beef in the burritos and enchiladas is ground beef, and there didn't seem to be an option for shredded beef.  I will definitely be back to this place to explore more of the menu.
