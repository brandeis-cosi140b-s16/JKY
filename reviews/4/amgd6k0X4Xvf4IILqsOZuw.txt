This place needs way better reviews because I fell in love with the tacos here!

I got the carne asada and the adobada taco - both were good and had gigantic portions of meat, guacamole and other toppings but the flavor of the carne asada was absolutely amazing!

If I lived in Scottsdale, I'd easily become a regular here!
