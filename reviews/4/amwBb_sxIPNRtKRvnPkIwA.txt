Rocky's is a cool little place on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.  Not many tables, though.  Food is good, prices are cheap.  Most of the breakfast specials include the cost of your drink in the price.  So my breakfast, a tasty bagel sandwich with egg, bacon and cheese was $5.34.  And that included both home fries and my coffee.  The cook was our waiter but my cup was never empty.  I'll return for more.
