We had family in town and I didn't want to cook. I get tired of pizza or subs for larger groups (10 of us) and wanted something fairly healthy. I thought of Rubio's and wasn't disappointed! Everything was ready on time, and our burritos and salad were delicious. I'll definitely use Rubio's again for my catering needs.
