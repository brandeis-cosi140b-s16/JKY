Its a chain, its in a mall and it was busy.  I was prepared for a pretty poor experience.  What we got instead was great food, very attentive service and a wide menu that accommodated our GF and dairy-free needs.  

It was a Friday during Lent so we were confined to seafood or veggies.  My wife loved her mushroom enchiladas - probably the best dish we had.  My baked seafood enchiladas defintely gave it a run for the money though.  My son had the diablo pasta with shrimp and finished it before i got a bite.  

We were there to watch an NCAA game and enjoyed it thoroughly, with a crowd of folks getting into the game with us.  Much, much better than I expected when I showed up - we'll be looking for these in the future.
