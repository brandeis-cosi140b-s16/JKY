I've been getting to go food from here for years it's on my way home from work! I have never had a bad order and I like the salsa's too! It's a must have for my family who visit from CA, they love this place and never leave with out stopping at least once while here. The chorizo burritos are excellent too large enough to feed two! I will continue to stop in for some scrumptious take out food. YUMMY
