Throughout the years I have been to a ton of the *berto restaurants, and for the most part they more or less the same.  Sure one place has a little bit better rice, or one has a better horchata, or whatever.  For the most part though they are all pretty similar.  This one, however, has been consistently better then the others I've been to.  

If you are looking for a good burrito, some tasty tacos, or my personal favorites the super nachos and the carne asada fries, this is definitely a place you shouldn't over look.  I can't speak any of the seafood dishes here (I just can't muster up the courage to try fish at a place like this) but pretty much every thing I've tried has been great.  Like I said the carne asada fries and the super nachos are both mine and my wife's favorites here.  The rolled tacos bring up a really close second though.  All the combos and platters are all pretty tasty too.

The next time you are in the mood for something a little bit greasy and unhealthy, this is a place you should check out.
