Very pleasant atmosphere, given quick service Mexican food is on the menu. 

Excellent vegetarian options. I don't know if this is a franchise or a chain - there's a terrific El Portal in San Diego (Clairemont area.)
 
Chips and salsa and my combo plate (grilled vegetables) were delicious. The beans and rice were tasty. The staff is attentive even though it's quick-serve. 
CNN was on the TV - so sitting and eating @ El Portal was a nice break from all day meetings on the 3rd floor of ASU's Cronkite building.

Very convenient eating option if you're near ASU's downtown campus. Healthy dishes are on the menu, comfortable environment if you want to sit for a bit. Service is friendly and fast. They evidently now take ASU $$ (campus meal plan/points?) So I hope that ASU students will support this business.

Will eat at El Portal again on my next trip to Phoenix.
