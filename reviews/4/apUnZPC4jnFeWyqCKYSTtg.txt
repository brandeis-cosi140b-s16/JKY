Finally. A Phoenix Mexican restaurant that knows that chilaquiles are more than chips with a couple of ladles of sauce poured over them.

Chilaquiles are not fancy or difficult food, which makes the lackadaisical approach taken by a lot of Phoenix restaurants somewhat baffling. El Horseshoe does them up right by taking a couple of minutes to simmer the chips in the sauce, letting them absorb some of the chile goodness, before putting them on the plate. 

Here, the approach to this very simple dish, is well, simple. Once plated, the sauced chips are sprinkled with a goodly amount of queso anejo, and that's it. No crema (though, it might be available upon request) and no garnish. I ordered mine with a fried egg (for an extra charge), which came served on the side. The delicious, hearty, and sneaky hot green sauce will make itself known to your mouth's tender bits when you're about halfway through the dish.
