At first, I'll admit I held a grudge against Chipotle for not having queso. Finally one day I asked "WHY NO QUESO?! WHY??" The employee responded by telling me Chipolte strives to have fresh (locally sourced if possible) ingredients. After I let my hankering' for queso go, I started to truly appreciate how superior Chipolte was to other burrito chains in terms of quality.

I've been to a few all over Charlotte, but I think the staff here is the best. I really love that most Chipotle's are open until 10pm!!

Thumbs up for being "fast food" and vegetarian friendly. Veggie burrito is just as big and filling as the carnivore options. I dig the Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa with just a bit of the hot Tomatillo-Red Chili Salsa on my burrito.
