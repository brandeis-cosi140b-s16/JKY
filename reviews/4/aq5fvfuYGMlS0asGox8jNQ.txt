Really good Mexican restaurant. Watch portions: they are huge. I had machaca con huevos and it was delicious. They have great freshly squeezed orange juice. Watch for dirty Old Mexicans grabbing waitresses asses. If you stalk it out patiently it will happen. Also, be ready to wait on Saturday mornings.
