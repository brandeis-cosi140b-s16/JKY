Good Service. Enjoyed the chimichanga, which was with shredded beef and delicious.   Someone else at our table had the beef enchiladas and enjoyed them as well.  Great salsa with chips as well.
The location was hard to find the first time but now that I've been there, it is easier.  Parking can be hard, but you can park on the street with no problem.  Get there early for no wait during dinner.
