Holy guacamole! Who knew that you could get amazing tex mex in the airport? Blanco was a very pleasant surprise. We were starving and knew we'd need sustenance before a 6 hour flight to Hnl. The lure of tex mex and a smartly designed restaurant drew us in. All I can say is yum yum yum! The tacos were so delish. The machata pork was so soft it was melting in my mouth. The accompanying rice and beans were impeccably flavored. Chips and salsa were also delicious and not too greasy. Note though that they come at an extra $2. Solid 4 stars. Decent prices for authentic Mexican fare. Bonus points for great service and the fact that its in an airport!!!
