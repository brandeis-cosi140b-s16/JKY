I don't give them 4 stars because we have only tried 1 dish-their tamales! They are so yummy. You pre-order and they will call you when they are ready. My husband said that their customer service is really good and the lady in the back came out to help him figure out the best way to get them. Let's just say we ordered 1 dozen and in less than 24 hours between 2 of us they are gone. I don't usually like tamales because places use too much masa and too little meat. These have a good balance of both, good flavor, are only $1 and are moist too, not dry and flaky. Check them out, they are delicious! I can't wait to try more of their food. Stumbled upon them and I am hooked. Just off the I-17 too!
