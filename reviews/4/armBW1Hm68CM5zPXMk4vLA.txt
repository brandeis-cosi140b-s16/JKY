Visited while on work trip.  Food was yummy.  Service was kinda slow as we only had an hour lunch break and were late back to our conference.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. Guacamole was delicious.  We needed more chips and they were not refilled until after our meals came... overall ok and I would visit again.
