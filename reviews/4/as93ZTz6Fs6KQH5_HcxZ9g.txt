Restaurant/Decor: 4/5 - a bit cramped, but cozy and definitely a feel of Mexico or a cantina.

Menu: 3/5 - limited menu. No fajitas listed and there are more appetizers than entrees. 

Drinks: 5/5 - Margaritas are fantastic and made from lime juice, not a cocktail blend. They are also strong, so beware.

Food/Taste: 5/5 - food, although limited on the menu, is excellent. Good flavors and presentation.

Chips/Salsa: 3/5 - this would be a 5/5 but for the salsa. It tastes like something from Roundys and doesn't have much flavor. The verde salsa is pretty good though and the chips keep this rating from being a 1/5. Chips are amazing and fresh made I think.

Overall this place is quite nice. Food is great, drinks are amazing and strong and service is quick and friendly. The chips and salsa and limited menu are the only downsides. 

Would definitely recommend.
