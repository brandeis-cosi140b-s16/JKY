I came here with friends and the food was really good. I ordered the fajitas and the meat was seasoned very well. The salsa was also pretty good and they increased the heat upon request. One thing that I would love to see improve...the hostess. Such a sad looking young lady with zero enthusiasm. You don't want to arrive to a place where you feel as if you're unwelcome .

Otherwise, the food and portions were spot on!
