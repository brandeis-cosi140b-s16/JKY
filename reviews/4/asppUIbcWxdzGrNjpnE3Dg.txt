OMG! This Place is SOOOOOOOOOO Good! My first time was a couple years ago. I tried making reservations last year on Valentines day, but they had no availabilities.... wasn't happy.  I just went back last month while staying at the MGM! I'm tired of hearing people complain about high menu prices at places like this.  It is so worth it! The quality of the food and margaritas is an A+.  The guac they make at your table is divine! I had 2 orders!  I also got the same thing I did my first time there... the chicken mole'.  I practically licked the plate clean! Diego is a MUST for anyone!
