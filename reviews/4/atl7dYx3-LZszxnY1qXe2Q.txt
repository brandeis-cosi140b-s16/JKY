Big fan of the flour tortillas.  Yummy.  The cheese in the tacos is maybe a little overboard, but tasty.  I wish there was a smaller option for chips / guac for a single person dining alone.  Shredded Chicken is awesome.  The sweet pork was... too sweet for me.  Love the salsas and the salad dressing stuff.  Wish you had fried fish tacos all the time.

Ok BIG pet peeve.... the singing is juvenile.  This shouldn't be a Chuck-E-Cheese or Applebees.  Knock that off.  Its embarrassing to us professional food snobs and makes me not want to be there when it happens.  Please reconsider that.  Its degrading to the employees too imo.    I really wanted to give a 1 or 2 based on the singing alone.
