Where to start, where to start. I don't know if it deserves four stars or not. I am definitely stuck in the middle. 

What I liked: atmosphere, free piping hot corn bread served out of a skillet, and its been so long I remember liking the flavor of the food (but don't remember what my party ate).

What I disliked: "Mexican" restaurants charging for chips and salsa (see corn bread comment above, though), their prices were definitely on the higher side, and not knowing who was serving me also bothered me. 

In my opinion, this is a very pricey "Mexican" restaurant. Though I may go back again, will I? Probably not a good sign if I doubt my self returning here. There are plenty of Mexican/Tex-Mex restaurants in Arizona for me to go to, before this one pops in my radar again.
