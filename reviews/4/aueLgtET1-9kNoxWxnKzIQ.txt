I have lived in Az. for over 50 years and my wife an I have been eating at all the little mexican places in search of good food. This place is authentic for sure! The food at Huauchinangos is fresh homemade authentic mexican food from Huauchinango (80 miles N.E. of Mexico city). The menu was confusing because I wasn't familiar with most of the things on it. But they have tacos, burritos, enchiladas and such. The chips are exellent and the refried beans are even better! They make their hochata and jamaica fresh from scratch. Delicious!!!
The staff are kind and courtious. (Owner and wife) 
Their hours are 8-10 except Wednesdays (close at 6).
