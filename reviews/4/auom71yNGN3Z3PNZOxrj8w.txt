Yeah buddy this is great island style food I tried each meat and the steak and chicken.... OH my! It's setup kinda like chipotle on how you order food which is great! I Got a bowl and it's super flavorful. The ladies and service behind the counter was great as well. Relaxed environment good music. 

One side note.... the white dude with the too tight and braddahs shirt and backpack made a scene. In the store not sure over what but probably need to give the guy a attitude adjustment. Other then that place is great....

Update:
And now the guy that was acting out sent me a cocky message. He's the owner. Food is good but every time I go I don't want to because the owner.... Lost a star because of it.
