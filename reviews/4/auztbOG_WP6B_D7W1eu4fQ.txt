In terms of fast food, Chipotle is one of my favorites. This location used to be "Moe's" which was much the same. Food was a bit heavier and greasier but burritos came with all you can eat salsa. Chipotle does not and their chips and salsa is rather expensive. So if you haven't been to this location in a while, you may be disappointed.

But overall the food is good and the staff here is friendly.
