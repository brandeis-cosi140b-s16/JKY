Month we went-May 2009.  Out to dinner with a friend and we had a delightful time. Our waitress, Sharona (I kid you not), was friendly and very helpful. She saw me perusing the margaritas and spoke about a couple of them. Our drinks arrived with the chips and salsa. I love that there were 2 little pots of salsa, one for each of us, as we love salsa. The margarita was a 9 out of 10 limes! We ordered a sampler of appetizers, and it was very good. I ordered a combo that included a chile relleno (I love chile rellenos). Our dinners arrived in a timely yet not too quick manner. This gave us time to work on our appetizers as well as have some great conversation. We didn't finish the appetizer as we were afraid we'd be too full to eat our dinners. My combo was hot and tasty. Sharona was a great waitress. She was knowledgeable without being pretentious. She gave us a take out container for our uneaten appetizers and we were on our way. All in all, this was such a relaxing dinner.
