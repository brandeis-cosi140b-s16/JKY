The best Mexican I've found in Charlotte.
I find most east cost Mexican food to be very bland (says the girl raised near the Mexican border), so I was very pleased to discover 1900 Mexican grill and it's very flavorful food. 
I typically avoid any house Margarita since most places use mixes with artificial ingredients, but decided why not try, and was very pleasantly surprised at the freshness. 
I visit 1900 every time I am in Charlotte.
