Food was good.   Greeted by the staff and offered a sample of their meats.   Decided on two burritos,  one Kalua pork and the other was steak.   Both burritos were very good.

This place would've gotten 5 stars had it had Hawaiian music playing in the background to give more of a local style ambiance.   But people were really nice and food good so we'll be coming back. 

Two burrito,  two fountain drinks and small box of coconut bark with $10 off the bill.   Total $19 bucks
