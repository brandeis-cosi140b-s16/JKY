For the last several months America's Taco has ruled the downtown Taco scene.  Now just across the neighborhood a new rival emerges.  Not since Magic and Bird graced the hardwood have we seen the seeds for so tasty a rivalry.  
From the great Mexican artesenia laden decor to the great service to the impeccable salsa bar- try the strawberry or peanut salsa- the place is top notch.
The menu is diverse so it merits several repeat visits for purposes of exploration.  I'm still a novice but I am completely sold on the cochinita pibil.  The pork is as tender and flavorful as anything you will get up the street at the Barrio Cafe.  
The place is still young.  But the rate at which incredible reviews surface on Yelp , it is testament enough that it deserves your patronage.
