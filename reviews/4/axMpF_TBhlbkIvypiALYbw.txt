good food! subway type of style, as in you order a carne asada taco and you decide all the topings. Ive tried the chicken, carne asade, and al pastor. Stay away from the carne asada as a mexican whose had their share of great mexican restaurants this did not taste much like carne asada. But then again this isnt a true mexican restaurant so...Portions are HUGE beans and rice and yummy! Its a lil pricey but def worth it.
