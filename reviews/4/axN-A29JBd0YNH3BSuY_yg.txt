Ok, so I am a fan of fast food tacos :P  Del Taco has the market on that.  Considering this place compared to "other taco fast food" the tacos shells are always crunchy.  I like  the texture of crunchy tacos mixed with cilantro, sour cream, tomato, lettuce, and meat.  The ultimate is the way to go in terms of tacos here.  That is if you like the above ingredients.  Other places seem to have soggy tacos from the ground beef oil getting into the shell.
If you want crunchy tacos eat at Del Taco.  I always get the correct order at the Surprise location and they actually give you napkins and sauce, not the norm at some fast food.  BTW I generally enjoy the sauce, but not on my ultimate tacos; hides the cilanto flavor.
