What?! This is a fast food restaurant?! Wow... just wow. 

First of all, when I think of fast food Mexican I think of Taco Bell... I'm sure that doesn't ring (no pun intended) too well. In fact, most would say Taco Bell is completely disgusting. I wouldn't go that far, but it's clearly fast food. 

I was more than pleasantly surprised to walk in and be greeted by an incredibly clean looking and smelling place. Furthermore, the manager on duty who took our order was friendly, helpful and more than accommodating. My wife and I can be pretty picky when it comes to certain types of food, Mexican especially... boy were we pleased with the outcome of this side trip. 

Would I go here again? Absolutely. Would I go out of my way to go here again? That's debatable. But even now just thinking about the fish tacos... my mouth watered. 

Yum!
