Tasty and cheap has always been my personal motto. I came upon the place by accident. I haven't lived in Arizona long and had been craving pan dulce (mexican sweet bread) for a while. Then all of a sudden I am just driving around and see the sign. I am greeted very warmly and appreciate the basic menu, and they also had a substantial supply of pan dulce. The food was very good. I had the shrimp tacos and a burrito.The burrito wasn't overly huge and the tacos not greasy at all. The salsa was fantastic with just the right amount of kick. I didn't leave feeling overly stuffed and gross like I do sometimes when I have mexican food. An hour later I tried a piece of pan dulce I picked up and that was great too. I was very pleased with my under $10 meal and 4 pieces of pan dulce.
