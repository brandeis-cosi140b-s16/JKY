I stopped in for a quick bite and only needed something small. My gf got some soup and I got the carnitas taco app. Pork was a tad salty but delicious. The soup was very traditional tasting and hearty. We will give this place another go for sure to try and earn its last star. Wait staff was every nice and attentive. I would recommend!
