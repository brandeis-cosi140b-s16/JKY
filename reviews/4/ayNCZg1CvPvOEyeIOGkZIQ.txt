Whenever we're in the area (which is infrequently), we come to Rita's. The chips and salsa are great - though a little too spicy for my gringo husband.
I have enjoyed both entrees I've purchased (the carne adobada and the combo with the beef tamale, shrimp taco and chicken enchilada). My husband got a little more adventurous (and expensive) and got the Azteca and didn't care for it.
Also have to disagree with other Yelpers on the Toritos. They aren't extremely tasty with the exception of the sauce - and we took the extra sauce home because there was way too much of it and we used it as steak sauce. I wish they would bottle it and sell it separately!
Margaritas are also tasty, but not extremely strong. Go and support your local AZ businesspeople. To me, it's better than Valle Luna and many other self-proclaimed "authentic" joints.
