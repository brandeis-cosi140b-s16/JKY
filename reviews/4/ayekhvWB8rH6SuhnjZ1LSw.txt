It's a simple order at the window, pay, take a seat, wait for your number to be called, and eat system. Portions are big, food taste Mexican- American, and good prices. I would consider this an upscale Taco Bell. The cashier was very informative and helpful. He had some good recommendations.  They have a great selection for the free salsa bar. Free nachos are always good. I got the carne Asada tacos which were good. I also went for the tamales which were pretty authentic. Save room for dessert bc the fried ice cream is pretty legit. I was overall satisfied. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing negative hence only 4 stars.
