4 stars only becuause there is always a line! Lol, which I guess is really a good thing. Have tried their taco Tuesday $1 street tacos, their rice &  bean platters, even the menudo is muy delicioso... I kind of judge a place by how they make their Spanish rice. I grew up on some good stuff, so I know when rice is made good or too overlooked/undercooked. This place does it good  
The decor in here is super cute, love the big Mexican skeleton drawing. 
Today tried the carnitas quesadilla. Good size portion & the meat was a decent ratio. It's hard to mess up a quesadilla! Call ahead if you are looking for to go.
