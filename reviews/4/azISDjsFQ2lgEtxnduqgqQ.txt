The food here is kind of pricey but you get what you pay for. I love the chips and salsa here but I don't get why they serve their chips and salsa in weird containers that make it hard to eat. It's so frustrating! They also serve you your food piping hot so make sure to let it sit for a minute or else you are going to burn your mouth. Other than that the servings are big and the food is great.
