I loved Paz Cantina, after two businesses not working out at that location, I feel this one will be there for long! 3 things I loved: the tacos, the street corn and the ambience! My bf and I had a really good time and we will definitely come again! I would give 5 stars, but our waitress forgot our drinks and she took a little long! You must try :)
