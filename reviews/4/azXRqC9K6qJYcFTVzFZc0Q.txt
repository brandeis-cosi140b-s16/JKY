This was a great choice for me tonight! I had been to the Moreno's on Arizona Ave. and thought it was good so I checked out their website and found this place.

When I got there the place was very busy. I was eating alone so it didn't take all that long to get seated. I had a nice convo with a guy was there with his significant other. That passed the time very well.

I looked at the menu and asked my very friendly server his opinion. After consultations were finished I settled on the Arroz Con Pollo. It was so good! My only complaint was there wasn't enough of it. 

The only legitimate problem I had was I couldn't access the Wi-Fi. My guess is there had been too many users before me and it needed resetting. 

I'm definitely going back!!
