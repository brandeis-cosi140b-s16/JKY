The Phoenix metro is all about hidden gems.  Anyone who hates the Valley because "it has no character, everything is a chain" just doesn't know where to go.  Los Sombreros is a prime example of this.  

I have known about this place for a while but have never stopped in because, well, it doesn't have much curbside appeal as you roar by on Scottsdale Road in the XXX zone.   Shame on me.  I went this weekend and walking in the back was like being transported to a friendly cantina in Mexico.  The ambiance, service, and food were all delightful.  This is authentic/gourmet type dishes in a casual setting that includes an outdoor patio and bar.  The scale of the whole place is small and intimate.  I had seafood crepes in some kind of avocado sauce.  The plates around me looked equally delightful, from the traditional mole to the carnitas to the mango crab salad.  The pepitas crusted snapper is next on my list to try.   I'll be back again... soon.
