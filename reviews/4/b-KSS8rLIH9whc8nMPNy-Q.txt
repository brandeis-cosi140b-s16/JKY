Traveling for work and was famished as I landed in Charlotte. A quick yelp search suggested this restaurant and I thought I would give it a try.

I'm all for dive bars and restaurants but this place, located on what looks like a forgotten access road, had me saying, "no no no..." as I pulled in; I couldn't decide which was worse - the restaurant or the derelict motel next to it.

I was just about to pull out and figure out a plan B when I decided to throw in the park and take another look at the reviews; the restaurant received four out of five stars from nearly 100 diners, many of whom acknowledged that potential customers shouldn't let the aesthetics scare them off.

So glad I trusted these 100 strangers...what an amazing, flavorful meal! If I lived in Charlotte, I would be a regular. 

My only bit of criticism is that I thought the staff could've been a little warmer but, hey, when your food is this good, you know people are going to come back.
