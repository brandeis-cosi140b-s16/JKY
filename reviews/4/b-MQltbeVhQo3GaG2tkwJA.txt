Chipotle is the best place to get a fast food burrito in Pittsburgh, bar none. The ingredients are always tasty. I'm quite fond of the carnitas burrito with fajita veggies. Their cilantro lime rice is sooo good.

You can't deny that Chipotle's business practices are incredible when compared to other businesses. While McDonald's basically controls the quality of beef, even in the grocery store, making sure what we get is cheap and tasteless, Chipotle goes the other direction and makes sure its ingredients are sustainable and free range. It's so easy for a chain to want to do things the quick and dirty way, I commend Chipotle for swimming upstream.

Seriously, their burritos are tasty, they're better than most burritos you can find in the Mexican restaurants dotting Pittsburgh. Don't confuse sustainable and grass fed with healthy, however, one burrito will cost you 1500 calories.
