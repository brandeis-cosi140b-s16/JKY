Stopped off at this new Chipotle location last night before picking up Little C from daycare.  From the outside, you'd never know that this location is open for business.  Unlike Smashburger next door, they do not have a sign along Scottsdale Rd stating they're "Now Open".  

Standard Chipotle fare.  All of the workers seem very enthusiastic to be working there.  And were very friendly.  I'll more than likely return to this location as it is easier to grab and go (if we're not cooking dinner) before picking up Little C than going to the 44th/Thomas location after picking him up.
