If you have been drinking and just want a quick inexpensive fix for your hunger you cannot really go wrong with this place.  The folks are friendly and the food comes out quick and hot.  I have never ordered any of the plates as I always get the same thing:  carne asada burrito with pico de gallo and guac plus the three rolled tacos with cheese and guac.  I literally go down on it and don't come up for air until it is gone.  Is it gourmet?  Hell no but is it good and cheap?  Hell Yes.
