I was very surprised how good the food is here. I had a chicken burrito and for the price and quality I really enjoyed it.  The chips and salsa are amazing two different salsas. Happy hour is amazing the only downfall is the atmosphere they had a bootleg UFC fight on every tv. Like the fights you see on a weird channel, Just kinda weird for a Mexican joint. I hope this place stays around I didn't see too many people in here.
