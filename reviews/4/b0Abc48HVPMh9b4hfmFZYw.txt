Good food,  large portions, friendly service,  and a spacious atmosphere with a decent sized bar.  Prices are moderate and the food is fresh and authentic.   Most meals come with soup, rice and beans,  and a small complimentary dessert snack is provided for the entire table.  

The exterior of the restaurant is non impressive,  but don't be discouraged.   The interior is spacious and inviting.  We will definitely return!
