So last night after a few brews at Santa Fe Mining Company I decided to check out Dimas Tacos. It is in the next parking/building area and I have of course seen it a few times but never seemed busy so I was unsure if I should try it. Well Last night buzzed hunger overcame and I did. 

I ordered the Lengua (tongue - usually cows tongue) Tacos and the Tacos Al Pastor (shepherd's-style tacos) made of pork, were both very good. Tons of meat and nice refreshing Pico De Gallo (rooster's beak) which some also call Salsa Fresca. They were both hot fresh and mouthwateringly delicious. Of course could be that I was tipsy LOL but they really were Nom Nom Nommy. 

I also ordered some Churros (a long, slender, deep-fried pastry coated with sugar and cinnamon) they were very yummy, hot and fresh.

I talked to another customer there (who turned out to be a Sin City Roller Girl - Props to her) and she said she has come a few times.

I would also like to note that the place was really clean, a easy menu consisting of names with pictures for us tipsy folks ;p

I will definitely be going back :)
