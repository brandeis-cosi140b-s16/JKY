Bar upstairs!

This doesn't get 5 stars because Chipotle is superior. But this is also not a review for food. This particular Qdoba is home of a bar upstairs. Attention college Students: this is the CHEAPEST bar in all of Pittsburgh. Yuengling is always 2 dollars for a pint, and other drinks and shots are 2-3 dollars as well.

I think it was on a Friday or Saturday, they have specials on their fishbowls. Beware of the fishbowls though. They don't really come in fishbowls, just pitchers. And they all taste terrible. However, there is a lot of booze in them so if you are looking to get plastered, go for the lime flavored. That's the most tolerable. AVOID BLUE!

Anyways, I like this place because it's small, and you can't smoke here because it's a restaurant so if you aren't a smoker, you don't come out of the place smelling like tobacco like many other bars in the city.
