Not where you might expect to find a great restaurant, I found it because I was having my car repaired next door!
Been there twice now -
Cheese Enchilada Huevos for breakfast, Chicken Enchilada and Chile Rellenos for lunch, they have Negra Modelo on tap too!
Excellent food, great service, will be going back many times
