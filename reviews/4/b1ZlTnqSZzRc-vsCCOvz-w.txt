Muy bueno!
The pineapple tamale was surprisingly good. I also tried the pork, chili and spinach/chicken. 
Good flavors, tasty fillings but not enough sauce. I should have asked for more!
There really isn't seating inside, so be warned that you will be taking out your food. This isn't a great location either, it's awkward to get into this strip mall. But I made it work and am glad I did!
They have a speciality tamale menu which isn't very prominent, they should feature this more!
The menu only has the regular tamale list, and the other list could be missed.
