Their tacos really are pretty great. Their choices of margaritas are very plentiful and I don't think anyone could be bored with their drink menu. Their fajitas, though, seemed old (not even sizzling when brought out, although still hot-ish). The meat was about 3/4 fat, instead of meat, so eating the fajita tacos was more of a task than enjoying a meal since I had to pull out the fat. I think if I go back, I'll definitely stick to the tacos. Tried the pineapple and mango jalapeno margaritas...the mango is definitely more spicy than the pineapple. Both were decent, though.

---the Monday margarita flight is amazing!! Also, the Monday taco special is great. I'd definitely recommend getting tacos when you come here, but steer clear of the steak! The blood orange margarita is now a favorite.
