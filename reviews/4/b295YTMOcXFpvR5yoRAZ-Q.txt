Pretty good! Came here several times already. Prices are VERY good... and food is very decent with big portions! I love their beef rolled tacos with gauc (~$3-$4). Sometimes I crave it when I want something lighter. My husband is in love with their chicken enchiladas and gets the same thing every time. The tacos and quesadillas are decent, but not my favorite on the menu. I also tried the Surfin Burrito. My friend thinks its 'to die for,' but I personally think its decent but not my favorite. My favorite is the rolled tacos with gauc!! :) We will be regularly going back here. 

On tuesdays, combos are $5. Everyday after a certain hour.. I think after 5 or 6pm... combos are also $5. That's cheaper than McDonalds!
