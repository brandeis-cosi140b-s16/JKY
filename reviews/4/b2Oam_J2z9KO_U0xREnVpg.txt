Don't let the front entrance fool you.   There is plenty of room inside.  Or order out.   That's what we did.   They were very friendly and even brought me chips and salsa while I waited for my order.  The chips and salsa was good by not exceptional.   The enchilada and burrito were of good size and cheap.  We also ordered the fried plantains which were sweet and very good.  it is in the very middle of a strip mall and you could miss it if you don't look carefully.
