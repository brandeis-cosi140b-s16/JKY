I always have a great time at Aunt Chilada's.  My latest and favorite thing to order is the El Pollo Fundito.  It's so cheesy, meaty and saucy!  I've also tried the quesadilla, torta and the fajitas before and all are great choices.  

This place has great decor such as a nice patio and an outdoor bar outside for the perfect spring nights.  It has Bocce Ball, a band on the weekends, and good staff.  The service is usually good, with the exception of one rude waitress we had.  I took my mom here when she visited and we had a blast.  We drank, ate and danced to the band.    

I also threw a surprise birthday party here for my fiance, Paul.  We reserved a part of the back patio and it turned out perfect!  It just so happens there was a very fun band playing that same night.  

I will be back to Aunt Chilada's for some grub and drinks and I recommend you try it too!
