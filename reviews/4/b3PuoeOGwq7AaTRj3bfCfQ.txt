I teetered between 3 and 4 stars and gave them the benefit of the doubt.
I was just here recently but prior to my last visit I had not been there in YEARS. It was still Lily's last time I had been there (the Lily's sign is still out front below, and slighlty more noticeable, than the Fajardo's sign).
We went on a Sunday. The chips were warm (but store bought) and the salsa was fresh and good! I ordered the pork chops and eggs. The pork chop wasn't grilled as I had expected, but instead had been cooked in a crock pot (i think). It just had a different flavor and texture that I wasn't expecting.
My dad tried to order the cocido (not available) and then the albondigas (also not available). I don't remember what he wound up ordering, but along with everyone else, we all agreed the food was good but not really mind blowing. We may be back but not before we go to La Perla's just around the corner.
The service here is definitely worth mentioning though! I think thats what pushed me to give them four stars
