Really great place for carne asada.

Asadero Toro takes the minimalist approach and it works well.  The carne asada tacos and burritos just come with two things:  carne asada and a tortilla.  From there you can go to the salsa bar and add what you want to taste.

To get away with this you have to have good carne asada and this place does.  It has a nice balance of spices.  Most places either add too much or too little.  The salsa and pico are fresh.  If you order the rice and beans you can get them inside the burrito if you want.

One thing that I didn't like:  can sodas.  I tend to drink a lot of fluids when I eat and going through cans kinda sucks.  Other than that it's a place worth checking out.  Really easy access, easy parking, fresh, and cheap (under $10).
