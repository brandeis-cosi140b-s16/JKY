We bought a Living Social for this place and were excited to try it out. The atmosphere is funky and fun. 

We ordered the T-bucket Sampler (fries, onion rings, carnitas quesadilla, mini chimis, chicken fingers)  and the 2 tacos (carnitas and centerfold). The food was delicious and their prickly pear bbq sauce is delish! The bucket was HUGE and had plenty of food for the two of us. We had enough leftovers just from the bucket for another complete meal.

The waiter was extremely friendly and attentive. Service was quick. Our waiter even offered us a to-go drink for the road which I LOVE!  We will be back!
