3.5 stars, but rounded up.

Had all four tacos that were offered today, which were chicken, beef, pork and tofu with egg. 

Overall the tacos were okay, all the tacos have kimchi, so expect a bit of a crunch and a little spice, would of been better if the the tortilla was warmer and soft. The tacos were $2.50, and just a bit bigger than a 99 cent taco from Del Taco, if it was somewhere like $1.50 a piece, I would certainly load up on them each order.

The fried dough was good, reminds me donut holes that taste like funnel cake. 

The wait time may be a little long because it is a one man show and everything is cooked on the order. 

I did not try the hot dog, but perhaps in the future I will next time I am in the area.
