Come for $5 breakfasts before noon!

If you're at this end if the Strip, You just can't beat the $5 breakfast here. 2 eggs, American potatoes and bacon. Add a bloody for $1 if you're feeling ready for it. I also snagged Coronas for $3 each. Didn't try the margaritas by the yard - which seem to be popular with Strip goers - but they blend them by hand which is a nice alternative to the premade stuff. Wasn't a hug fan of their guacamole, but maybe that's what I get for being a glutton.
