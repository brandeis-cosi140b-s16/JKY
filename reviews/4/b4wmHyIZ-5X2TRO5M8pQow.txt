In regards to the reply from my first review, I am updating this to reflect the quality of food (which was superb) instead of my disappointment at the change of menu.   I had been a regular here (with a group of co-workers) on a weekly basis for months, and was flat out told last week that anything other than Empenadas was "Catering Only" from now on.
