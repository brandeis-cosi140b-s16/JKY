We have been in Henderson for years and never know about this place until we met a vendor from Utah who said it was his favorite. Their not so secret ingredient, New Mexico chilies. Nothing like them (they also sell the chilies.) Sunday is breakfast burrito BOGO day and they seem to be busy most of the day. My personal favorite is bacon and chorizo. They don't skimp on the meat. Speaking of New Mexico treats, finally found a place to get sopapillas, those little fried bits of goodness. Cinnamon and sugar is incredible. Good service and dare I say perhaps some of the best burritos in town...
