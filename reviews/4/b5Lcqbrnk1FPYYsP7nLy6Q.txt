Went here about 5 am and really enjoyed the service and the food.  I had the steak quesadilla and steak taco with verde salsa.  The only reason I had to give four stars was because I ordered a steak breakfast burrito and my boyfriend wants to take it back... However her is s very finicky eater...so take his opinion like a grain of salt like I do. I would go back though.
