Suprisingly not too bad... and i didnt get sick... I just popped in to get a taco and bean burrito and it was very good and super cheap... this is almost like one of those taco stands you would find in mexico, but it is indoors... and they even had a "vintage" street fighter 2 video game... i have not seen one of those in like 10+ years... but if you want some food the same price as T-Bell but more of the real deal check it out...
