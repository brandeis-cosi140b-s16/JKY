Delicious! 

I've been to the one on Rainbow and 95 when it first opened. Fifth time visiting...So far so good, the nachos are BOMB! Lengua tacos are delicious. This place kind of reminds me of Roberto's excluding the oily part. 
The price is reasonable just like any taco shop. Small but clean! Also they have a drive thru so if your lazy hello drive thru!
