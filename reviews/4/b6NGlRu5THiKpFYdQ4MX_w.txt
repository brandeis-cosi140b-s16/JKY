This is my current favorite restaurant.  It's family-owned and close to home, which are important factors.  Yes, there is indeed a weird vibe, but I am weird, so perhaps that is why I like it so much.  Excellent chips and salsa, but the star of the show is the Cadillac margarita.  Trust me, I can drink with the best of them, but it takes only half of one of these drinks to get the job done.  Food tastes authentic and homemade.  I highly recommend the guacamole chicken burrito and the chicken machaca.  Shrimp fajitas are also yummy.   It is not cheap to dine at El Burrito, but I love it anyway, as the service and food have both been excellent.
