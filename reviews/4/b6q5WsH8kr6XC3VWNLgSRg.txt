No one who's eaten this food with me has ever been inside the restaurant.  No, I'm not pawning it off as my own.  I just know that some folks are willing to eat quite a bit of food that they might not eat if they saw where it was from.  Now that they are converts - I am tempted to take someone with me next time I grab their food - or maybe send them alone.  But I don't want to ruin a good thing. 

For the price of this food, you could get Taco Bell.  But if you can get Carolina's, why would you ever get Taco Bell?  I've always grabbed it on the way home from work - so around 6ish.  I have to say, besides the fact that it's in an older neighborhood, I've never seen any of the other things that seem to scare some of the other reviewers.  Maybe I'm just lucky.  Who knows.  

All the food is so good I don't even know where to begin on what to suggest.  Something with a tortilla.  They are just that good.  Or - get whatever else you want and buy some extra tortillas to go.  Eat one on the way home like McDonald's Fries.  And just like Fries, they are SO much better when they are still warm.  

5 stars for food, but losing some for parking and then their limited and spotty seating in the restaurant.  Wish I could go 4 1/2.

Special note - They have some of the best Christmas Tamales in Phoenix.  But don't think you can just walk in and get them.  I'm not sure how soon the waiting list goes up, but you'll want to get on that list ASAP.  They sell out quite quickly.
