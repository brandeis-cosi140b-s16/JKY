i picked up a baja fish burrito from here the other day during the lunch rush and the line moved quickly as did my order through the line. while i was waiting i managed to snatch up a dq free blizzard coupon from their coupon wall which i have added to my jewish food stamp book.

i took my burrito to go as well as a couple of salsas and a to-go bag of chips (complimentary). got home and wolfed that bad boy down. short and fat little thing, but totally filling. the fish was good and they use cabage in their burritos which i love. 

fresh, tasty, and filling. i'll be back. especially cuz they dropped a couple of coupons in my bag. incentives like that to come back are always good. and they have 1.99 margaritas. yum.
