Qdoba is a hidden gem for those of you that have been hiding under a rock or never heard of it. The concept of Qdoba is similar to Chipotle and Zaba (healthy Mexican food). They have quesadillas, burritos, taco salads, tacos, and some of the best nachos with toppings that you can buy. The queso dip is incredible as well. You are able to pick your meat of choice as well as the toppings to go along with it. Very simple. The naked burrito is by far one of my favorite things on the menu when I want to eat healthy. You order what you want and they put it in a bowl for you. The staff are always very friendly and the place is always extremely clean. Enjoy
