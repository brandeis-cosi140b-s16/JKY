I've been eating tortas my whole life! These people make them the way they are supposed to be made...huge and stuffed. You get a lot for your money, plus grilled jalapenos. If I wanted to go on a suicide mission I'd stop here and eat non stop till my blood insulin level  go through the roof. Please enjoy.
