I have lived next to this fine place for the last 2 years, but for over a year I had always thought of it as a seedy place full of roaches and tacos that would punish me for enjoying their delights. If I had a time machine I would go back in time and drop kick my face for even thinking that this was the case. 

I had thought that all the ___berto's were the same, and having been to Filiberto's once, getting my order wrong, cold and dealing with the stench that was clouded around it gave my past self a bad image of all taco shops, but every day I would pass I would see Poliberto's full of people at all hours. I decided to take the plunge and try some of their tacos for myself, boy was that a good day!

I am a HUGE fan of getting the 3 mini taco plate combo, which is 3 double mini corn tortilla's pilled high with carne asada, lettuce, cheese, sour cream and guac with a side of beans and rice and a bottle of Coke. Fills you up for $6.50 - $7.00. The beef was tender, full of flavor and plentiful and they have several salsas to accompany your free freshly fried corn chips. I reccomend getting the chunky one, as it seems to be the best combo of flavor and spice. 

The cleanliness of the place isn't sparkling, reflection in your face clean, but it isn't downright dirty either. The service for me is usually speedy and most days friendly, although sometimes the person at the front seems to not want to be there.

Overall the food is great, downright cheap, filling and they have Mexican Coke in the bottle!
