This is the nicest El Pollo Loco that I have eaten at in AZ.

As much as I find El Pollo Loco's secret marinade so addicting, I was taking a hiatus from it because I had hit a bad run of dry chicken and super small pieces at other locations. I also thought I had to sacrifice cleanliness in order to get my chicken fix because almost every El Pollo Loco that I have been in recently has been slightly grimy with a thin layer of chicken grease on almost every surface and a messy salsa bar. Not this one! Light, bright, spacious and clean - shocking. 

Two piece meal with rice, salad and flour tortillas - perfection.
