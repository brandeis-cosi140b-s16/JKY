I missed mexican food since i'm from california, always pass by this place coz i live on Cheyanne and surprisingly enough i like it alot. i would go back...the tamales are no joke. its prolly just as good as that one lady who sells them after church rite when you get out for like a dollar except Dona Maria sells them for much more. its worth it though. i would suggest buying in bulk though since its cheaper than buying it individually.  Had a 2 item plate, pork tamale and 2 cheese enchiladas with beans and rice and an horchata...have to have the horchata, chips and salsa are complimentary.  very mexican decor overall...if you gotta a hankerin for some decent mexcian food and not robertos status then have this place. its delicious!
