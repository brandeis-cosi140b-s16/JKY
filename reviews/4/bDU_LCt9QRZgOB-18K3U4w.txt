I was craving Mexican, well Americanized Mexican, so I went to Don Pedro's.  It was a Sunday afternoon about 1 pm and the restaurant was very busy, but I was able to get a table right away.  The basket of chips and bowl of salsa appeared right away too.  The chips and salsa were OK, but I've had better.  

My waiter came by and got my drink order not shortly there after.  While waiting for my drink I decided on the Deluxe Burrito.  The server came back with my drink and took my order.  The staff seemed very friendly and even though the restaurant was about 80% full the were taking care of business.  I even spotted a manager or two wandering through the room checking on things as well.  It is always a good sign when you see management doing that.  My burrito came out pretty quickly.  The burrito & the plate were super hot, temperature wise, and the server was quick to warn me about that when he set it down on the table.

The burrito was big, covered with melted cheese, and loaded up with sour cream and guacamole.  I had to wait a couple of minutes for it to cool down past molten lava stage to take a bite.  It was pretty good, I wished I had looked at the menu closer as it didn't come with rice and beans.  But, it was big enough to fill me up so it really didn't matter.  The food is pretty good, nothing to wow you, but tasty non the less.  The service was outstanding.  Even with the restaurant being 80% full with several large tables I always felt taken care of.
