I had the opportunity to try SOL at Monday's yelp party.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but this was different.  I fell in love with the calamari and the dipping sauce it came with.  It was large pieces of calamari with a crispy coconut breading.  I could have eaten that alone all night.  I also loved the mushroom quiesadilla or something like that.  Delicious.  I also like the goat cheese dish and I'm not a fan of goat cheese.  My only complaint is the ceviche... A little to sour and too much onion.  Other than that, I would recommend SOL to a friend.
