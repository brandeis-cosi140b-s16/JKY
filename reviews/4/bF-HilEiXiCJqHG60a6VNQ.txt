This place is neck to neck with Chuy's near Southpark Mall.  Amazing food, especially those Chicken Enchiladas!  So glad I ordered the guacamole, it was made perfectly table side.  The drinks were ok, nothing great about their house margaritas.  I would definitely recommend it for a nice dinner with friends.
