My most recent visit to Pasqual's was for my birthday, and it turned out to be a great choice. We hadn't made a reservation for our group of eight anywhere as we were waiting to see how the weather would turn out, and Pasqual's was able to accommodate us quickly and easily (granted, it was 7:00 on a Sunday with icky weather). Our service was quick and helpful, frequently checking in our drink status. We all started with the chips and salsa/guacamole, because the seasoning blend on the chips at Pasqual's is the stuff my dreams are made out of. Most of us had their seasonal margarita at the time, a cranberry-orange variety that was dangerously delicious. As always, the portions were enormous and most of us ended up taking a lot home. I've been to the various Pasqual's locations many times over the years (and frankly, in 2013 it might have been my most often default location) and can't come up with a complaint.
