After a friend's review, I expected the baristas/fountain workers at the Lavazza Coffee Cafe to be exceptional, and they were lackluster. No sense of excitement or urgency with this twosome when it came to me. The next guest was obviously a regular and they knew his order before he asked, even knew his usual partner in crime's! I will attribute my experience to super high expectation. 
My latte was made with care, the barista melted the honey I requested in the bottom of the cup before adding ice and milk. I was not asked what milk I wanted, but it turned out fine.
I will pop back in tomorrow and see if they are more lively in the afternoons.
