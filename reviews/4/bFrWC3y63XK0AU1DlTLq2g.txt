I was cruising down Las Vegas Blvd looking for a place to watch the football games.  Passed a billboard for this restaurant on LV Blvd.  Searched yelp for sports bars which lead me off the strip and into scary land.  All the"sports bars" I visited were horrific to say the least. Just when I was about to give up on football, I coincidentally drive by this restaurant.  The staff was kind enough to seat us in a closed section near the bar so we could watch the game.  We enjoyed salsa and hot re fried beans with chips.  They were having a Sunday brunch buffet which was delicious!  Didn't have the seafood, because I was starving and didn't want to wait.  I would definitely visit again.
