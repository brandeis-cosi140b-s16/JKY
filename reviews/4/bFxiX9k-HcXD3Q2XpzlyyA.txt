I was feeling a bit under the weather, so I was really craving some chicken soup. I mentioned this to my roommate and she immediately suggested that I go to Los Antojos and have their Consome Loco. I stopped by and immediately fell in love with this tiny place. It reminds me of the hole in the wall restaurants my mom and I love to go to. It's very cozy and the people are very nice. 

The soup was very simple, yet delicious. Exactly what I needed while I was sick. It had chicken broth, shredded chicken, and avocado. It was perfectly seasoned and definitely hit the spot. This will be my go to place when I'm not feeling well. I would also love to stop by and try some of their other menu items.
