Some pretty decent mexican food, and quiet cheap as well. $5 for a burrito, though it's not as big as the $6/$7 burritos or taste as good as the ones in San Jose, CA, it was still good. if I was from here, I'd probably come here a lot.. maybe a little too much though. I tried an Arizona Burrito, which was potatoes, cheese, and steak burrito. Pretty good, though the potatoes seemed a little too hard, but it was whatever. Just tasty greasy food, my brother said it's the perfect hangover food, and they are open late so :).
