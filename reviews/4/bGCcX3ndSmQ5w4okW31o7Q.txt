Last night while i was drunk as heck coming back from a party, my friends and I collectively decided that we were extremely hungry. It was 2 in the morning and not a whole lot of choices came to mind. That is is until my friend suggested the 24 hours federicos. 

There was a drive through and the service was fast and simple. I got the carne asada buritto with sour cream and pico, with a little quacamole. It was made quicky and i have to tell you that each and every bite i took of that mama jama was equal to heaven. 

The buritto was huge. And freakin heavy. Every bite was filled with carne and sour cream. It was funny because my friend was like "take a few bites and we will eat the rest when we get home" , but i couldnt stop. I devoured the entire beast within minutes and I was satisfied.
