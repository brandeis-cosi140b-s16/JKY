Very good restaurant. Small, but not in a bad way. The drinks, which are a good way to start, are excellent. Strong, but in the way that a margarita should be. The lobster quesdillas are VERY good, a must try. 

They prepare the guacamole right at the table. The waitress recommended a pork dish and I was not disappointed. The prices are high, but it is still worth going. This place has won best Mexican for a number of years and I can see why.
