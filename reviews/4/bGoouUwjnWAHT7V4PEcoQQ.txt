A Chipotle even closer to me!  We ordered to go and I noticed that you can even order online. There was no one there probably because no one realizes that it's opened yet but it is!

We ordered the usual...a chicken burrito and a Barbacoa bowl. They put a bunch of meat in my bowl but not enough rice which is fine. My meat was a bit on the dry side but I'm sure they are still working out the kinks. Overall it's still one of my favorite semi fast food places.
