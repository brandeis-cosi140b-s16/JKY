I really like this cozy little restaurant, and I enjoyed a nice quiet meal with my husband and son here tonight. I had the Huevos a La Mexicana and Flautas, and my husband tried the Huevos Rancheros, Oriental Taco, and Carne Asada. We also shared the Frioles Charros and chips/salsa - all for only $29!! Everything was yummy, the service was quick and friendly, and place clean too. We'll definitely be back!
