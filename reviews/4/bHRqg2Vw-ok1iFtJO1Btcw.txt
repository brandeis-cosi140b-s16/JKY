Clean, quirky hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant.  Definitely authentic (they serve Menudo on weekends).  Reminds me of those great little Burrito places where you can get a bite to eat at 3am after drinking. 

Oh wait, you can do that here too!  Whoohoo! =)

Carne Asada tacos + rice + refried beans = great alternative to drive-thru after partying all night.  Everything is made to order.  They boast having the bigges burrito in Las Vegas.  The pictures look convincing.
