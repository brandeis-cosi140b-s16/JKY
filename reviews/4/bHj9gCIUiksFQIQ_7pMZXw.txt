Micky's better get used to seeing our faces! These Sonoran style dogs are very good and they use a good quality dog to boot. They use fresh Mexican style sweet buns, so they know what they are doing! We also tried the pastor taco and the carne asada taco. They are tiny...so order more than one! You will be left wanting if you are hungry. Yum! The pastor had just the right amount of spice and the carne asada was super tender. The salsas are fresh and flavorful. Service was great! They do not open until 11 am...
