Carlito's is not your typical Mexican joint, but it is not Mexican, it is New Mexican and that makes all the difference in the world. I am a huge fan of New Mexican food. When Carlito's opened up, I was so very excited that I could get some authentic green chile and real deal Navajo tacos. After my first visit, I was not disapointed. Since that first visit almost 6 months ago, the wife and I have been back many times, and the food always continues to satisfy. I typically get the Navajo Taco or stuffed sopapilla minus meat. The beans are always great, the rice is fantastic, and frybread/sopapilla's are delightful. The green chile varies in heat each time, but the fact that it is New Mexican green chile that is either fresh or frozen fresh makes it all good. We've recommended Carlito's to many friends, and all our meat eating friends say that the pork and beef are both very good. We also like the $1 drafts and I don't really care if its not a fancy beer, its good, cold and goes well with the food. The margs are also good for the price. The staff at Carlito's is great, always friendly and they remember who you are if you've been there more than twice.
