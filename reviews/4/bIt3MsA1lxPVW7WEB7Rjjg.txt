What an enjoyable experience. Love the ambiance and had a blast watching the turtles. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating. The salsa trio was fresh and vibrant. I had a shredded beef taco that was juicy and flavorful and the BEST cheese enchilada I've ever had (I've had a lot). Soooooooooooo good! I usually don't care about refried beans but I cleaned my plate! They were so smooth. My husband's food was good enough that I didn't even get a taste. This place is definitely worth a visit!
