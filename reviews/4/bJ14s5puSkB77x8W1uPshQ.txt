It's been a little while since I've been there, but to break it down, here's what I remember: 

1.  Excellent chips with a salsa trio
2.  Good food (I ordered a burrito.  I don't know what I was thinking, because I'm really only a fan of taqueria burritos, and this was one of those knife and fork gourmet logs.  In any case, a return trip would call for something else - like quesadillas, nachos, carne asada, or some kind of combo plate.
3.  Excellent environment to get a night started
4.  Excellent margaritas
