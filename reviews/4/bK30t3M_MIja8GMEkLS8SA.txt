So I don't know if anyone reading this uses Mint to manage finances, but basically there is this option where you can view total spending over the past few years by specific store/restaurant/etc. One day I did a search for Mad Mex, and the number that appeared was absolutely horrifying.

So I'm at this Mad Mex a lot. Too much, maybe. It's just so conveniently located, the happy hour is good, food is consistent, and most of the staff is very friendly. My history with Mad Mex started at the Oakland location while I was a Pitt undergrad, and once I moved to Point Breeze on the very edge of Shadyside, I was glad that this new location opened within walking distance. The location itself is WAY better than the Oakland restaurant. It's so much bigger, has a cool garage door, and a very large bar.

The margaritas. Okay, so they're not the best margaritas ever--not even close, really. But the BIg Azz margs are HUGE and are cheap during happy hour. My friends and I actually calculated that getting two Little Butt margaritas at happy hour pricing is a better value that one Big Azz. Two Little Butts will cost $6 for 24 total ounces, while a Big Azz is $7 for 22oz. Knowledge is power.

I usually stick to the Wing-O-Rito which combines two of my favorite foods: buffalo chicken inside of a burrito. The standard rice, black beans, and cheese are also inside, along with salsa and ranch or bleu cheese on the side. I find it really hard to deviate from this even though I'm sure there are probably many other tasty things on the menu.

One other food item I do love is the Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu. Try it. Even tofu haters will like it.

True story: one time my friends and I won a 20lb box of coconuts and bananas here (plus a round of free drinks). You just can't say that about most restaurants.
