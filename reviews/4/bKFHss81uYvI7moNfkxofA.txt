Fantistically festicy, seriously spicy, and always an adventure.  This place is a Phoenix staple, there is no other place like it.  from the patio to the decor it is all one of a kind.  I like the traditional Mexican food (I recommend the Carnitas).  However, mostly everything is seriously spicy, so take the chili warnings to heart.
