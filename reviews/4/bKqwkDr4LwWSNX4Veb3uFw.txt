I love this place for Mexican comfort food. Is it authentic? Who am I to say? Does it really matter? I like their avocado salad and the albondigas and their chiles rellenos are the best in Las Vegas (Supermex has the worst).  The chips are good, and the salsa is different - like a seasoned tomato sauce. I also like that if you order a soda, it comes with a festive fruit garnish.  Unfortunately, the iced tea (which is very good) doesn't have the same garnish. It is very dark and reminds me of family restaurants from the early 80s. They have a great waitress who is ALWAYS there. She is like a younger Mexican grandmother, which adds to the homey feeling.  You won't find Rick Bayless here, but there is room in the world for both schools of thought.
