Tried this on a dare.  An awesome "little hole in the wall" place.  A very small place that offers an abundance in variety of hispanic foods.  This has to be one of the best Mexican restaurants I have visited here in Madison.   Staff is great and food comes fast.   

You are not there for the ambiance...its all about the food.  This is a must try if you haven't yet.
