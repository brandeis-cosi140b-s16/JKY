Went for the $9.95 lunch special while staying at SouthPoint. This included a free margarita which was quite large and tortilla chips with a trip of dips. The dips were traditional salsa, a yummy warm bean dip and a delicious guacamole. I was surprised, as I eat Mexican frequently, and have never gotten free guac before.

Lunch started with a Fideo soup. This was nothing special - short, little noodles in a tomato based broth that seemed like a mixture of Cambell's tomato soup with the noodles from their chicken noodle soup. 

Our lunches arrived quickly and were piping hot. We both got a chicken enchilada and a ground beef taco that were accompanied by rice and beans. The food was good and tasted very fresh and exceeded my expectations. 

The dining room is upstairs from the casino, so it was quiet and comfortable. This was a nice change of pace from the endless buffets that are Vegas.
