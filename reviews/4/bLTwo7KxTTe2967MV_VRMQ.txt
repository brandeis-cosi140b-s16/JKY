I like Some Burros for a couple of reasons.  One is consistency.  I hate going to a restaurant where you order an item and it tastes good one time and bad the next.   I like their ground beef and potato tacos and they are consistently good.

I have also had their chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas, which I enjoy..  Although this review is for the location in Chandler, the other two locations in Scottsdale and San Tan are just as good.  They only thing I don't care for is their salsa.  Good churros also.
