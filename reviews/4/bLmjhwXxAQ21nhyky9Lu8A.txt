Best guac I have had in Las Vegas! Tiny place that was built into a crevice on Main Street, south of downtown. Only about 10 tables, and the menu is compact, but with a good variety of the usual south of the border fare. 

Prices are very reasonable, everything I have tasted here is very good, and I will always return when I need a fix of their fantastic guacamole!

OLE!
