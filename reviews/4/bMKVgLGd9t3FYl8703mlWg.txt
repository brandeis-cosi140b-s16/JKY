Cantina always satisfies my Mexian cravings every time. I always enjoy sitting outside on the patio and indulging on a mojito and over indulging on chips and salsa. I know several people were not happy with the changes in management but I have not noticed anything that would keep me from coming back. They have all the basics and they fix them perfectly ever time I've been.
