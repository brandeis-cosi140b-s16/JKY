Walking into TC Tacos I was immediately excited by the discovery of what all Yelpers hold dear, the "whole-in-the-wall". On arrival, I was greeted by Eddie, who was very welcoming and suggested that we explore their chicken tacos. 

Receiving the food, I would say I was satisfied but not ecstatic. With that said, they have a modest yet delicious salsa bar.
