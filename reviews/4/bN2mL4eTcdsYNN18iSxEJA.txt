My family and I have been eating at Zapatas for years.  The staff is always friendly and the food is excellent.  My favorite dish is something you might never have had but I highly recommend the Pollo con Mole'.  Their Mole' sauce is sweeter than most others and I end up eating here many time just to get this dish.

The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean.
