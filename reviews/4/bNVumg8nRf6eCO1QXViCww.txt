In a single word this place is... AWESOME!

We were up in Phoenix on Wednesday afternoon and stumble upon this little gem right at the end of happy hour. Their happy hour tacos are delicious, especially the tinga tacos. SO GOOD.

Helping ourselves to the fresh salsa bar was a blast. There are so many unique and yummy flavors up there. I think we tried 12 different salsa and absolutely loved four of them. (Not to say that we didn't like the other flavors.) 

We then went on to order the the shark, the mahi mahi, the mole and the pibil pork shoulder tacos. I can't say enough about these. The mole was tasty and rich. The pibil pork shoulder was sooooo good. The meat in that one had so much flavor and was just perfect. The shark taco was more like a shark taco with a LARGE side of more delicious shark. Seriously, too much shark for one taco. (Not that such a thing is a bad thing!) The mahi mahi taco was more like a scrumptious mahi mahi pizza. The portions for these tacos are more than enough to keep get you full by the end of the night!

I really liked every little taste that this place offered up. Why isn't this a five star review? Honestly, the service isn't the greatest. It isn't bad service, it just isn't five star service. Seriously, I would over look this little point time and time again if I lived close to this place. The food is AWESOME. Seriously. Check this place out and you will leave full and happy!
