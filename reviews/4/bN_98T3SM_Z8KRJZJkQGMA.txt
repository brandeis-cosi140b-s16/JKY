We love this place!

When we first moved from California, we began searching for a good take-out Mexican food place. Surprisingly, we were having a hard time finding one until we found Backyard Taco.

We eat here pretty regularly now. We find the tacos to be good, but we like the burritos even more! The restaurant is always clean. Also, they have a good selection of salsa's to choose from. 

If I knock them for anything, it is the guacamole. It is runny and seems like it came out of a squirt bottle - I'd rather have the real stuff. 

That aside, I highly recommend Backyard Taco!
