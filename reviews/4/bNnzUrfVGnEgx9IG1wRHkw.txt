We had finally gotten to the point where we were ready to stop trying new Mexican places. It wasn't that we had found the best ever, it's just that every Mexican place is essentially the same damn thing with a slight variation on the chips and salsa.

Fortunately, some badgering  from a neighbor got us out to lunch at Los Arcos for their lunch buffet. i think it's the first Mexican buffet i've ever come across. They've got your shells, taco bowls, beans, rice, lettuce, jalapenos and other toppings, beef, chicken, shrimp and a few pre-concocted enchilada or chimichangas, (i never really know the difference between all the Mexican dishes, but they all have the same level of deliciousness). i didn't even have to panic when the server normally asks me to choose beef or chicken for my entree, i chose beef AND chicken on my taco, i almost threw some shrimp on there. Call me loco. 
i'm not saying their food quality is all that superior to the other Mexican places, but the buffet is dinero (as in the Spanish word for Money)

Bonus, they have patio seating and a nice little bar area. 

So why settle for the #22 combo of just 1 measly enchilada and 1 burrito with your choice of rice OR beans??  Satisfy your American tendencies and eat as much as you can with a Mexican lunch buffet. According to their web site, Monday through Sunday 11-3.

Holy hell, i almost forgot, they have a life size cut out of the most interesting man in the world by the front door making for  an excellent photo op on the way out. Don't judge me.
