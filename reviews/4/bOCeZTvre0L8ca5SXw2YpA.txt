Honestly, I've had better Mexican food, but the outside patio and dining room is so beautifully decorated, I always make sure to bring out of state guests here.  The waitstaff has always been friendly and the food is served quick and piping hot.  The wait for a table during snow-bird season can be awfully long so be prepared.
