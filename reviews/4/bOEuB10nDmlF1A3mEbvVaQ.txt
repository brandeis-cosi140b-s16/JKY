This fast food mexican restaurant is just off the strip-5 minutes WEST 

It's like a 50's style mexican diner-

It's very roomy-lots of tables and some video games -

Service is fast & friendly, Everyone is english-speaking.Dine-in orders are delivered to the table. But you can help yolurself to free refills. and the salsa bar.

The carne asada is very good. tender & spiced just right. everything was hot & fresh. 

It could've used a little more cilantro & onions but they are 2-bite tacos. 

Excellent value for the $$. $1 Ea.

ONLY CON:

They could use a TV

We eat here at least 1x a month-they have 4-6 locations in Las Vegas and they are always voted best mexican fast food!!
