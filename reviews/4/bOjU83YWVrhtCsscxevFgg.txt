Chipotle has quickly become a staple for my roommate and i on indecisive dinner nights or hangover sundays.  while still a chain, they have avoided the manufactured taste by constantly offering fresh ingredients.
personally, nothing quite hits the spot like a steak burrito bowl and the ample servings leave me hard pressed to finish.
the midtown location is quaint, but feels like it has more of a carry-out vibe to it.
