I was out shopping with two of my coworkers last week when we all commented that we'd been in Phoenix for a week without once having Mexican food!  This was the closest thing we could find to remedy that situation so we plopped ourselves and our bags down at around 6 on a Wednesday.  The place was pretty much empty inside so I was a little confused why our waiter always seemed so busy.  We had to wait quite awhile for our check, but the service wasn't so bad as to diminish the enjoyment of our meal.

We ordered chips and salsa to start and I ordered the mushroom enchiladas and my friends ordered a salad and the mac & cheese.  The chips and salsa were good, we were pleasantly surprised to find out they were half price (our waiter didn't mention that they had happy hour prices on drinks or appetizers!).  My enchiladas were darn tasty, although they were so rich I almost felt like I was eating pasta.  We all left happy and stuffed - I'd definitely come back here again.
