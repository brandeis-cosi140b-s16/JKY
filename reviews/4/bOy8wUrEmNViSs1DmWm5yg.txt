To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought "strip mall Mexican, need to check this out".  

The place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.

The food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.

This is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos.
