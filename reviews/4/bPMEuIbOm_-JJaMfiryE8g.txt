De-licious!

Their straight forward menu and very friendly service has me smiling and looking forward to my next visit. 
Kudos for their bright and large signage since it made it a lot easier to find. 

While looking at their menu, the workers there offered water and made sure I understood what I was ordering. 
I really liked their fries and the Standard also packed great flavors. Remember when Carl's Jr. tried to advertise "gourmet burgers at a fast-food price?"
The Stand has this idea executed perfectly. 

It is a bit pricey for everyday lunch, especially with a shake, but it'll be hard for me to drive this place by without making a stop.
