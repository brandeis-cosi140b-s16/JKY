Service was slow...we waited about 10 minutes before a busser came over and got us our beverages. Considering the service, we weren't sure what to expect, but the food was fabulous!
We had tortas: one halibut, one with the grilled ribeye & two eggs...both were bursting with flavor! Lime tart and tres leches cake for dessert,
again...fabulous.
They use local vendors and serve breakfast all day. We will go back...the staff could use a little tweaking.
