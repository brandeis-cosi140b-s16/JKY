I usually go here every other Wednesday when we go off-site during work.  The place is kept clean & decent in size with tables and chairs appropriate for the mass of hungry customers. Located in a plaza complex by Stephanie it gets a lot of repeat customers.  You can find all the authentic mexican fixings like Roberto's.  The great part though, is Fausto's Mexican Grill isn't shy to pack your food with plenty of filling that will fill you up and then some.  Their Carne Asada Burritos are heavy to the lift.  Feeling like a 5 pounder...(it isn't really...but I am sure you can order one) their burritos are not hollow at all and wont fall to the side like some places if you hold it straight up.  A solid hunk of meal on a wrap would make Tim Allen grunt with a tear of joy!  Prices are reasonable and affordable.  Not the healthiest of food, but with Moderation and excericse like all...this is a treat almost everyone will enjoy.  I would come here more often, except this place isn't as accessible as Roberto's taco shops around the Vegas Valley.

Great stuff though...value and quantity! definitely a recommendation I can make!
