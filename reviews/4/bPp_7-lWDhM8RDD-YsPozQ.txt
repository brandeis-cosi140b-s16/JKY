I always go for the Arizona Burrito.  I perfect combination.  once came in for something different and ordered the Carne Asada fries.  the fries were under cooked.
but all in all next time will just ask for the fries to be cooked longer.  I will definitively come back.  This place is alot cheaper than Filbertos ....a dollar less for my burrito.  and the burrito is better here.
