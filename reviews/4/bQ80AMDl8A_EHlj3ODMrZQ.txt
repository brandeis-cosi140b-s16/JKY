Never been to the original location but was happy to see this spot pop up in the "little-strip-mall-location-that-could"; just a hop, skip and jump from our home.

I love the modern decor and the patio space. The service was very friendly and the food came out fast. The veggie burrito actually had more on it then I was expecting, it's simple but had lots of flavor for sure. I am still not sure about the salsa, it was different and had a nice bite but might take a bit to get used to.

All in all I am very happy we have a vegan friendly Mexican spot in this area of Cen Pho that has good food and service.
