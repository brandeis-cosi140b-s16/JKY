Yummy food, clean environment, amazing prices! Super friendly guy at the counter, owners brother I believe. He made suggestions and was helpful & welcoming! They have delicious pastor! Their red & green sauce was so flavorful with just the right amount of spice! If I didn't live in Los Angeles this would be my new spot! Can you guys deliver to SoCal?  ;)
