Not a taqueria but more of a real sit down restaurant which usually means ungodly portions. Maria did not disappoint. I ordered the choripollo which is chicken breasts covered in chorizo covered in cream. When I asked the waitress whether to get that or a more expensive shrimp dish, with no hesitation she said choripollo.

It was decadently rich and think and unfortunately a bit too salty and I'm pretty ok with a pretty large amount of salt. Still when you need some real stick to your ribs mexican food in Charlotte, Maria's has been my favorite so far.
