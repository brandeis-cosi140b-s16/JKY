The neon sign at this place lured me in and the good food and atmosphere kept me there! I recommend the "El Pastor and Pineapple" taco on the taco platter- great flavor, especially for people who like things like Hawaiian pizza. Chips were good and you get to choose your own salsa at the salsa bar! Beans and rice seemed better than most places to me. I'm impressed! The place is fun; go with a date or a big group! Tacos for all!!!!
