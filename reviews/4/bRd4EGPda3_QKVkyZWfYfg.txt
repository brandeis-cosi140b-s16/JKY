One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. It's such a nice departure from the Mexican food you find on every corner. This "Latin American" food is flavorful and fun, there is really no comparison to anything else around. If you're a fan of pork, you'll be in heaven. Sure, the tacos are tiny but they are filled to the top with the good stuff-meat and seafood. Who cares about the tortilla? 
Tableside guacamole is fantastic. Pork belly can't be beat. The pork tacos, seafood tacos (especially the scallops), and the beef short ribs are some of the best things I have ever tasted. The drinks are expensive but they are yummy.
I like the presentation of the tortillas on the salt blocks and the salt wall around the kitchen is pretty cool. The decor is very nicely done with two huge patios that are perfect for Arizona evening dining or enjoying a cocktail in the sun.
They get knocked one star because service is not consistent. I have been here four times now, twice the service was over-the-top, best waiter/waitress I've ever had. The other two times were just average wait staff, not bad, but why go back to the Honda when you've had the Bentley? Otherwise, everything else is perfect.
