We ate here while we were at a party at The Clarendon Hotel. For the 4th of July (possibly always? Not sure) they had poolside service from this restaurant. The waitress was super friendly and helpful when taking our order and was prompt with drinks. 

I ordered the carne asada burro which came with fries. The meat in the burrito was actually really well cooked, fresh, and tasty. I like that the tortilla was toasted and still warm when the food was brought out to us. It was super messy and tough to eat, but still good and definitely worth having.

The price was super inexpensive for what we got (two meals and an alcoholic drink), only about $24. The only downside is that the service was a little slow on as far as getting the actual food out goes, and there were a few things we asked for but never got.

But I would come here again for sure.
