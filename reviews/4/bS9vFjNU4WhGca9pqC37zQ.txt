I used to live in San Diego and have pretty high standards for Mexican food. I loved Taquer√≠a Guadalajara, but sadly, it isn't an option any more. I am also a vegetarian, which I have found to be a challenge for several Madison Mexican restaurants. However, I was really happy to find Cancun! The chips were warm and the servers were very nice and the food was good! I had a taco salad and when I said no meat, they offered fajita veggies!!! My boyfriend got a quesadilla, which he said was really good. It was pretty empty in there for a Saturday night, so I hope more people start trying it out.
