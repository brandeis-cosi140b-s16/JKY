We walked in and were immediately greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere. My wife had the taco salad and I had the chili relleno w/ a small bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style. The white cheese oozed out as soon as I cut into the relleno. Side note...if you tear into one of these bad boys and cheddar spills out, run the other way! My wife kept scooping the enchilada sauce off my plate at telling me how good it was. The signage out front reads "Authentic Mexican Food" and authentic it was!

**Edit (minus a star)
The service was on point, as it always is! We had the same server and he is phenomenal!! The chili relleno, was not. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't the same. My wife got the taco salad again and she also agreed that there was something off. Maybe it was a different cook? IDK, but I do know that consistency is key. If you want to depend on repeat customers, they need to be able to depend on you. We'll be back and I'll be ordering the chili relleno, again!  :)
