El Santo is a big pool party in North Scottsdale!  I went there with a few friends on a Saturday and the place was packed around the pool.  Most of the people at the pool were in their 20's and 30's and were there to be seen (typical Scottsdale folk).   

Venue - I was impressed by how nice this place is, the owner's put a lot of $$$ remodeling the old Jilly's.
