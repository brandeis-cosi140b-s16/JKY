So goood.. Sweet sweet cholesterol. Nursing a hangover from the weekend, my friends and I decided to venture away from the pricey strip options and search for some highly rated, 1 dollar sign places on yelp. Lucky for us, KoMex satisfied our only 2 requirements. 

We shared a plate of bulgogi nachos and I had the chimichanga. Everything was fried, oily, and absolutely delicious. Excellent food for getting rid of that death feeling after ingesting too much alcohol at 3am. However, I wouldn't exactly recommend eating here with 6 of your friends and then cramming onto a plane back to the Bay Area. Sorry again for all the farts, UA1463.
