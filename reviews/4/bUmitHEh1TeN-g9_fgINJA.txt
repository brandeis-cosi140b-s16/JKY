New place.  Hard to go against the alternative of healthier Chipotle. I went around 6 PM on a Tuesday and they only had two employees.  The order nevertheless came out fast but if they get a rush there could be a problem.  I ordered the  chicken super burrito which was very tasty ..  Its only super because of what's added in it and not the size.  The size of the burrito is similar to Chipotle's.  Ordered a drink but had no refills.  The price was around $9 which is again similar to Chipotle.  The napkins provided on the table are the ones you have to use  dozen to do the job.  Restroom was out of hand soap.  That all said, you have to sympathize with a new sole proprietor thus the four stars
