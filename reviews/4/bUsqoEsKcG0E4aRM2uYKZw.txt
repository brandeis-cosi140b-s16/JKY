so heads up on this place - it is TRULY a hole in the wall....stuck in a small strip mall, it doesn't look like much of anything.

But OH man is it good and authentic.  Their tacos are divine!  Microscopic, but divine.  Their mole is in the top two in the US.   Their chips weren't as fresh as I'd have liked, but their homemade salsa actually had kick (something that restaurants in the Bay Area are afraid of....it's almost like being in Utah sometimes) (ok, vague....anyone who's had salsa in UT will get that).

Their beer is cold. Their service is friendly.  A definite thumbs up, and a definite fan.
