I've seen this place on food network, so that usually makes me want to NOT go. However, the 20 vegetable fried rice seems to good to pass up. It was delicious! I mean, seriously, it was SO good. The service was Ok, maybe a touch on the slow side but nothing to complain about. The prices were decent considering they are in the Cosmopolitan. We also got the dragonfriuit salad, which was delicious. They were out of dragonfruit though. And for dessert, we got the sticky mango rice. Ho LEE shit!
That was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. EVER!

I would definitely come back.
