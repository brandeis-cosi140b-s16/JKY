Rubio's has surprised me lately, I've become a fan! They have great battered fish tacos and if you go on Tuesday night, they are only $1.50!! You can't beat that deal.

I also really like their beans, I know that seems like such a simple thing but they have tasty pinto beans on the side with yummy tortilla chips to dip.

The staff has always been friendly and accommodating no matter which location I go too. My dad raves about the shrimp burrito, it's one of his favorites!! Because of the great prices and fresh ingredients, I may find myself at Rubio's more often!
