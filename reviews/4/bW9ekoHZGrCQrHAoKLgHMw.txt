Hussong's has great food and drinks.  The El Pepino margarita is fantastic. not too strong but spicy, with jalapenos, cucumbers and cilantro.  Their chicken enchiladas with red sauce are great, and the chicken chimichanga is enormous and delicious!  Just make sure that they are using the correct meat; the DBF does not eat beef or pork, and he ordered a chicken chimi but received a meal with meat that looked a lot like steak.  When we questioned it, we were told the kitchen used thigh meat and not white meat, would we prefer the white?  That just seemed odd since we had not been asked that prior (and I ordered chicken too).  He said yes to the white meat, and in a few moments a new chicken chimi was brought out with shredded white meat just like my enchiladas contained.  Service here is very good and the place is great for groups.  We had a good-sized group of 11 on a recent Saturday night and they were able to seat us in just a few minutes.  They really kept on top of our table too the whole time we were there.  

A fun atmosphere with good service, great food and drinks and reasonable prices.  You can't go wrong with Hussong's!
