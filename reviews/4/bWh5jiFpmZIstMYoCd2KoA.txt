The meat is still not hot enough but the tortillas are excellent, the man who prepared our food was attentive and pretty friendly and they washed their straw dispenser!   Getting a little bit better now.
I would like them to help me more in the selection of my meal.  They just sort of say, "what else would you like?"  What I would like is a great tasting burrito etc.    Just put on it what you would put on yours perhaps.  Is there more charge if I ask for more meat, cheese or sour cream?
