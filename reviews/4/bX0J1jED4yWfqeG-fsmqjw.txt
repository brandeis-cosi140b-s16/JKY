Went here today while shopping at galleria mall and to my surprise the tacos were really good! I'm a taco snob and man the meat was very tender and they have so many salsas! The tacos are only $2 each can't beat that in a food court. If you like spicy you have got to try their habe√±ero salsa it was soooo yummy
