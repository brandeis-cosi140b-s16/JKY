This was the second place I found between the Madalay Bay and Luxor hotels while looking for something good to eat for under $50.  The mall between the two resorts has several nice places like this. 

The service here was very good. Again... I ate at the bar. When I'm alone I like to eat there because I can meet some folks. 

I have their Skirt Steak Chil Rellenos.  Apparetnly the bartender had just ordered this for the first time himself the night before and we both now agree. It was amazing.  The combination reall hit the spot for me.   I will probably find a way to get back here and order it a again if I stay at Mandalay.
