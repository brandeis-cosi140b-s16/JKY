Good greasy Mexican food. Just what I was wanting! Ordered the combo #1 and everything was good. Taco wasn't too greasy, enchilada had a lot of flavor and rice and beans were yummy. 

My husband had the rolled tacos and they were delicious. Will definitely be coming back when I'm in the mood for some dirty Mexican food. 

Oh and make sure you get a drink from the counter, we had the pineapple juice and it was amazing!!
