If you do not beleive in love at first sight how about second chances?

With the Aunt and Uncle in town from Alaska I thought I should keep it real in new phoenix fashion by jumping on the lightrail to hit up some delicious Mexican food (both of which you can't ride or eat in AK).   Mind you this was right after this new spot opened.  
We waited for almost an hour, were refused drinks from the bar, watched helplessly as tables were left uncleared and were finally shoved into a crappy high top.  I don't think my familia was too impressed.  I wouldn't  have visited that location again if there wasn't so many advocates at  my workplace.

In my half a dozen wonderful lunch visits since then, they have delivered the fire!  The service and food (especially the Enchilada dinner for lunch) is unbeaten and food is definitely comparable to its mother resteruant on South Central Ave.

So if you like it hot, delicious and real I would highly reccomend this great light rail ride lunch spot!
