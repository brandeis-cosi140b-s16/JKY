I eat here more than I like to admit in public.  Mainly because there is such a limited selection of vegan options around nellis AFB.  Gotta love the Ghetto and the junk food that comes with it. Lucky for me their beans are vegan. Can I get a whole foods out here please?

But back on point.  This is probably the best taco bell in the Valley for lunch.  All the tables are always clean, service is prompt, and orders are always made right if you are there when the manager is present or during lunch hours.  I know places don't have their A team work late night, and the quality shows if your getting a burrito fix after the sun goes down.

One cashier kind of rubs me the wrong way due to an unprofessional attitude, haven't seen her in a few days so she may have been reassigned or fired, but again...  It's a taco bell.  

All in all, great during the day, but quality slips later in the night, so 4 stars, rather than 5.
