Canteen. My home away from home. I am here almost every Friday. One of the first times I ever came here the night started innocently enough. Me and a couple of friends decided to hit up the happy hour we heard so much about. It did not disappoint. Next thing I knew I had 4 margaritas and about three house shots. I wake up the next day and there are about 3 or 4 bottles of Champagne and about a dozen beer bottles. My throat was hurting from all the Rock band that I played and I had the worst hangover of my life. From then on I was hooked! If you start your night at Canteen you're bound to have an interesting evening. I usually stick with the regular Margaritas and house shots. I normally don't use the well Tequila though because you can substitute any other Tequila for I think an extra $2. The tacos are delicious and I want to just rub their Guacamole all over my body because it's so good. I prefer sitting inside but you have to know where to sit. By the bar is your best bet. One of my complaints is that the music is WAY too loud. I overhead one of the servers asking the owner if she could turn up the music and I almost screamed Nooooo!! I like to be able to have some sort of conversation with the person I'm with without screaming at the top of my lungs. All in all Canteen is a great way to start your night but once happy hour is over and the Mill ave crowd starts coming in it's a whole other story. But it's a must for one of the best happy hours in Tempe!
