1st time tonight. Great food, great service!
Gourmet mexican food at very reasonable prices. The atmosphere is comfortable. They do an excellent job with food presentation. This place has good management, you can tell they sweat the details. Funny it wasnt more crowded on a friday night though.  Also kind of warm inside too, dont know if AC was a problem. 
We'll be going back.
