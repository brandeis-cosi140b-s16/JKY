So my Son comes to me the other day and says.....

"Dad, I have to go to Del Taco and buy 34 Tacos for a school project"

....I said "What are you trying to pull?!  What class is this for?"

....he says "Health".

....I laugh my ass off and ask him if he's serious.  Apparently, he was.  They were studying the nutritional contents of Fast Food and if he brought in 34 Tacos for the entire class he'd get extra credit on his project.

Of course, this was too funny to pass up so of course I agreed to do it.  So we left for school a little early this morning and I called ahead to ask the employees how long it would take to make the Tacos.  They said they'd start working on it and that they would be close to having it ready when we arrived.  10 minutes later we arrived and they were 1/2 way done with the order.  We waited another 5 minutes or so and we were on our way.

34 Tacos ($14.33).....extra credit for kiddo, priceless.

Will I return?  This Del Taco has their act together....of course!
