Great place for tacos and salsa! They give you three different types on the house and two of three are delicious which always bodes well for what's to come in terms of entrees. Drinks are a bit on the pricey size; ordered the spicy margarita and it was good and nice size but 13.50 a pop. Table side guacamole is highly recommended as well. Sketchy location on industrial road, next door to sapphire gentlemen's club. Once you get inside however, everything is nice and new, with large plasma screens. Service was good as well. Saw that they brought out sombreros for a family with kids which is a nice touch. I ordered the shrimp tacos, good dish. My boyfriend ordered the steak fajitas which was on a sizzling plate; overall good dish as well. Definitely will be coming back!
