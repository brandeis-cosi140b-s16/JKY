Took the family here last night, and wasn't expecting much.  I was pleasantly surprised, and so were my adult children.  Maybe it was because it was 1/1/13 and everyone else was still partying on the strip, but we were seated immediately and had a server (Antonio) at our table within a minute.  Food was a bit slow getting to us, but well worth the wait...and we enjoyed the chips and salsa with salsa bar while waiting.  Antonio was attentive, and I appreciated he filled our glasses often.

I'm a NON smoker, and would have liked to have been seated somewhere more away from the smell of cigarettes, but that's the only real complaint I can come up with.  Including tip, $60 dinner for 4 people is exactly what I'd expect.  My salad was fresh and HUGE, my son's steak fajitas were cooked just right and not overdone, my daughter's chicken chimi platter was also HUGE and flavorful, etc etc etc.  Everything looked fresh and tasted good too.

I'll be back, but will request to be seated in a more interior location away from the chance of dealing with cigarette or cigar smoke interfering with my meal.  The proximity of the Havana Lounge nearby may have had something to do with it too!?!
