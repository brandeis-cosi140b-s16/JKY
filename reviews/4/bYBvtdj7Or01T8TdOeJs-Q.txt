Husband had  chic tacos, beans & rice.  Loved it.  I had the best bean chalupa ever.  Well seasoned beans.  Good quality cheese especially for the price.  Excellent value.  Larger portions.  Guacamole & chips were plentiful w/ good chips but guacamole was squirted so not the thick version.  Chips and cheese plentiful and tasty.  Down side...eating off of styrofoam.  Staff accommodating.  In a strip mall.
