Always on my list when I hit Vegas, the food is really good, along with the service, 
Some times the live music is better than the rest but a real bonus.. 

Funny how may local Mexican looking ( to be PC) eat here, always nice to see it`s just not another tourist trap.

a double Kudos for some really good mexi food and a great atmosphere..
