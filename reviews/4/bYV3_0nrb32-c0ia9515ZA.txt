Cafe Rio has fast become one of my favorite places to eat. Service is fast and the food is really good. Consistency isn't always the best as portions change depending on who is serving you but all and all, the food is great. Plus it's one of the few places that offers free food for the little ones. Ask for the Nino Quesadilla, it's free!
