When you need cheap 24-hour artery clogging Mexican food, look no further than Los Betos on 24th. They're open ALL THE TIME...even on Easter as I found out tonight. The guys that work there are pretty friendly and speak enough English to get your order and answer any questions you have.

Monday - Thursday they have a combo special of buy one get one 50% off. My favorite combo is the #8 Carne Asada taco's. It comes with a hefty side of rice and refried beans and the corn tortillas are amazing! 

I wasn't impressed with the Nacho's. There was a ton of chicken, but they were pretty flavorless and didn't have enough other stuff like cheese and guac. 

Eat the hot sauce at your own risk though. If it hurts going in it hurts coming out. Don't say I didn't warn you.
