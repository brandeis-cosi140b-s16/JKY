Nicest proprietor-ever!  Ate here for the first time last night- and am now wondering why it took so long for us to go there.  They've been open since October, but I admit that we've tend to head to Laredo's for Mexican.  No more, my friends.  

Everything we ordered was fresh and truly authentic, prepared with a light hand and not oversauced/overcheesed.  Like most Mexican restaurants, the menu is extensive- they even serve breakfast!  No alcohol, I don't believe, so it's a family place.  Prices were extremely reasonable, and overall it is a great addition to our little village.  We'll be back, and will bring friends!
