I tend to eat from here more that I'd like to because my sweetie LOVES this place, so I bump up the stars for him. This is a street tacos joint so don't expect anything more. What you can expect is long lines and the smell of tacos to linger on your hands and clothes forever. A 30min wait in line is pretty standard. There are also 3 separate lines, depending on what you're getting.
The tacos are pretty good, especially if you're drunk. My favorite are probably the tongue and el pastor. El pastor fries is pretty good too. Hella messy but good. 
Expect to feel guilty after eating here too.
