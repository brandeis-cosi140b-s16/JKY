The first thing I noticed when I got my tacos was the quality of the meat. It wasn't that fatty, nasty looking crap found at other taquerias. It was lean, quality beef and pork (not perfect, but just enough fat). Other places need to take note... you can't get away with serving that nasty crap and expect people to come back.

I got the three taco special  for $5. That's a bargain, considering it also comes with rice and beans. In typical street taco fashion, each one is served with onions and cilantro atop doubled up tortillas. They could have used more onions and cilantro, but at least there was a good amount of meat on each. Both the carne asada and the adobada could have used more seasoning, but the quality of the meat made up for it.

This little taqueria has only been open for about 6 months. They're located in the same strip mall as Smith's on Tropicana and Hualapai and are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

3.5 Stars (kick it up a notch with the seasoning)
