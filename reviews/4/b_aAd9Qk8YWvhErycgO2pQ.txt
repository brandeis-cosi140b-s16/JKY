I don't know how this escaped my Yelp radar. I have been going here for years on and off. Maybe my rating should be a 5, hmm, okay 4.5.

The quality of the food, the service, the value, and the ambiance is always consistently very good. What I like is the owner remembers me to boot, and she always speaks Spanish with me. 

THIS IS THAT LOCAL DIVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR ... Yep, that's in caps for a reason. It's been owned by a husband/cook and wife/waitress/cashier for years. Just check out their lovely photos on the wall as you enter/exit. In a city marked by transiency and inconsistency in so many facets, this is that reliable restaurant that is consistent. 

I ordered Chile Rellenos - should I be so excited that I every time I order it and chow down, it's great? It is. I am. But before then, the fresh chips just kept coming, the drink refills were there, and an appetizer with guacamole just added to our selection of dips already provided. 

My friend, another long time patron, loves it as well. Although I forget exactly what he ordered, two items, the main entree, the flour and corn tortillas, all very good. 

So, having dined here at a minimum two dozen times over the years, yeah, this is the place you should go.

If there is a downside, that area of downtown is sometimes sketchy, and parking is sometimes difficult - be careful about lunchtime, and once inside, it's a little like a German beer hall. Be prepared to practically sit in someone else's lap - it's that close. But these issues also lend themselves to the experience.
