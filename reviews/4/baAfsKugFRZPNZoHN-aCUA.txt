Man oh man... Jack Daniels Sangria! I know I should write about the food, but the drinks here are great too! Impressive tequila selection and inventive cocktails support the raves reviews on the cuisine here.

On a personal note, I had a chance to chat with Sylvana (the owner) who is just incredible. Food and dining is in her her blood... literally! Her ancestors were royal pastry chefs. 

She committed to strengthening the local community through her food. There's heart behind her cooking which keeps me coming back again and again. 

Specifically, any of the seafood dishes are killer!
