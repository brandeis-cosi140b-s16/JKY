I have no idea what is with the negative reviews for this place. Sure, the restaurant isn't much to look at, but their food is excellent! I've been there three times now, and it's never let me down.

Most recently, I went and got the combination with the two enchiladas and the burrito. So good! And it came out so fast! I got the burrito and one of the enchiladas with the shredded beef and one of the enchiladas with cheese. The cheese that they use is chihuahua cheese (from cows, not dogs) so it was nice and gooey and melty and delicious.

Also, every time I've been there, the servers have been sweet and attentive. Anyone complaining about bad service is clearly hallucinating.

In short, it's a little hole in the wall with great food. It's a little expensive, but it's great. Definitely check it out
