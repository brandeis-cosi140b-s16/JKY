My first time EVER at El Pollo Loco and I didn't know what this place was even all about. Discovered all the grilling and sizzling chicken thighs after I ordered my burrito and a side salad.

I was a little annoyed by myself for not looking down but just looking up on the menu. Loved the salsa bar though and the traditional chicken burrito that I got was pretty good too. Staff was very friendly and polite. Will definitely go back to have the real stuff.
