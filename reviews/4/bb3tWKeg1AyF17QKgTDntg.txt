Get the quesadilla sampler for sure!! When we first pulled up into the lot, we saw they had a drive thru and we almost left because it looked dumpy. Im glad we decided to try it because it was awesome. Had a little bit of a wait for our food, but it was worth it! Don't judge a book by its cover on this one!!
