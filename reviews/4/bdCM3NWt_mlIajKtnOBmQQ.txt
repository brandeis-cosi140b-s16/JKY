So where can I find a taco in Madison that I can be proud to say is amazing....Habanero's!
So to get started---a little hard to find. I have been driving past the location every day to and from work never noticing it next to the Pool/Spa store on Stoughton Rd. Silly me. 
I finally took the chance after seeing the great neon lights in the window and stopped in. 
You first order at the counter, and they have their operation set up like a "build as you go". 
The choices are limited, but all the essentials (Taco, burrito, torta, or quesadilla). I suggest either the steak or chicken but you can also get barbacoa or carnitas. The tacos (if orders in corn) come in 2 shells each taco ordered. 
After ordering then you and sent around the corner and you get to pick what you want on them. 
Pico, corn, sour cream, great Mexican cheese, lettuce, guacamole, and a fine selection of salsas. 
It's quick & convenient with ample seating. 
Also, a fine selection of drinks and beers. What is not to love! 
I recently went against my current taco order and had a burrito....huge! It was also a great choice. 
If you order the extra meat for $2, you will be very happy. They pile it on, no matter what meat you decide to select.  Heck yes!
Great pricing too. 
3 tacos-$5.99
1 Burrito-$5.99 (cheaper and better than the other chain "build as you order" burrito joints)
