I like this Morenos. Haven't tried the other location, so I have nothing to compare it to. 
The bean dip is like crack!  I absolutely adore their green chili sauce they bring out with the chips is incredible.  I love it!  It's a bit sweet, so it might not be some people's idea of green chili, but I really love it.

I have gotten a bean burrito, shredded beef taco, and shrimp ceviche in the times I've been here.  All really good.

The service has always been nice.  My only wish is that the music wasn't so loud.  I'm usually coming there on my lunch break, and I really appreciate going to a place that's quiet.  Oh well.

I recommend this Morenos.  I find their food and service reliable.  Enjoy that bean dip!
