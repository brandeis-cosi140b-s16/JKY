I agree with what others have said. It's like, "Okay, it's just a Taco Bell..." - but really, the employees there have amazing attitudes! I have even been complimented going through the drive through. They seem genuinely happy to be there, and even if it's just for show...it makes me want to come back. Cheesy Gordita Crunch for LIFE!
