Had a pleasant experience at Mexx 32!

My girlfriend and myself came here the night after the grand opening. First, they have a great ambiance. Props to the person who was in charge of decor and design of this restaurant.  I went with the three tacos. Very delicious! I decided not to have any alcohol tonight but they had plenty of options. 

I would recommend to encourage the serving staff to have a little more energy! This place is brand new... Make menu recommendations.. Ask how we heard about you... Talk about specials.. This was the only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars.
