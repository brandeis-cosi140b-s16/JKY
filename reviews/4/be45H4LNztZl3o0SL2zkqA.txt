Just down the street from our house we always love to try new independent restaurants in our neighborhood, and we love Mexican to boot!   We went on a Wednesday evening, and they weren't very busy, but they were VERY friendly!  They suggested their steak fajita burrito for my husband, and I had the burrito sinaloa (chicken)...both were outstanding and HUGE.  No sides served with them, but you really don't need it!  They gave us a  basket of chips as well (they were out of their usual soup appetizer)...they were warm and crispy, but not too greasy at all.  It was overall a no frilly dining area, but they really seem proud of their food and eager to please...we will definitely be going back.  FYI their window posting had 5/21/2014 for their liquor license review, so for  now they're non-alcoholic beverages only!
