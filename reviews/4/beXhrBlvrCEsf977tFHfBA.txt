I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised! We were regulars at Agave (which occupied the space previously) and the look was relatively the same, with some nice updates - reupholstered booths, cool lanterns hanging inside and over the patio.

The highlights were the Mexican street corn and the poblano cornbread. So good! My husband had the shrimp fajitas. Although it was more like a paella with tortillas, it was awesome! I had the chicken fajitas and it was also good (not as good as the shrimp) but it was cooked in a red sauce, and wasn't like a traditional fajita. We also had the house made guacamole and that was pretty good as well.

We were there on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy (maybe 1/4 full) and service was excellent. Looking forward to going back!
