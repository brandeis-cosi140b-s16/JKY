I was actually very hesitant to try this place mostly because of the yelp reviews.  I didn't think it was bad at all.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  The food was decent.  I did enjoy the salsa.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and they were what I expected them to be.  I'll absolutely go back for a second try!
