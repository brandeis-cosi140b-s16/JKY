well to start off this restaurant is enormous with lots of character.Rand h. and i went there for there lunch buffet which was small about 8 or 9 things only.Every thing i tried i liked The only thing i thought was below average was the chips and salsa {to plain for me}.I had my mind made up that they were going get three stars but the building deserves the fourth.After all it is quite the amazing design.
