Not sure if the burro has gone downhill, or if I just hit it on an off night, but I wasn't nearly as impressed as before on my last visit. I had the shrimp diablo burrito, which I've had in the past, but this time it was just kind of meh. The carnitas tacos were still delicious however, and the guacamole is quite good. The chips are way too greasy in my opinion, but that's not super surprising since they're homemade. In the future, I think I'd stick to the tacos here, rather than the namesake burritos.
