We have tried several things on the menu, and everything was good--especially the salsa.  My favorite is the seafood enchiladas!  I hope to return soon.  I agree that the interior is laid-back, but I do not consider that a detriment.  And as close as it is to the Mesa PD headquarters and the Mesa Municipal Court, I don't think you have to worry about the area of town.
