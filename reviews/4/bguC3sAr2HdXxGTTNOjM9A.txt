Service - very nice, efficient, informative, and no pushy sales (jk).
Wait - mmmaybe ten minutes.  We dined in so we certainly weren't in a hurry.  
Food - started with chips and salsa.  Best tortilla chips ever.  Thick, but crispy so they break clean and easily but no threat to breaking teeth.  
Salsa was innocent, until you least expect it and then it sneaks up and says hello.  A nice bit of flame to lure you back for more.  I think my Mother In Law might like this stuff.
My breakfast was Juevos Rancheros and it was prepared much differently here than anywhere else I've had it.  Those other places must be fakin' it.  Crisply fried flour tortilla topped with two eggs and their green sauce, refried beans and some fantastic fried potatoes on the side along with a hot flour tortilla wrapped in foil to keep it hot.
I think I heard myself say, "Get in my stomach" outloud!  I'm so embarrassed.  
Okay, not really.  It was smelling so good and several steps from the norm, I was happy to have a fork in my hand and doing its thing.
I couldn't finish my breakfast but my son was happy to finish the task and lick the plates clean.

I enjoyed talking to the owner and the wife of the gentleman whose art graces the walls.   I enjoy seeing nice art by local talent on display, and how cool is it that he's part of the business too.

Great food and a feast for the eyes as well.
Love having another fantastic dining option.
