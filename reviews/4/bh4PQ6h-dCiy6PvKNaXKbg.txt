My friends and I love to try new taco places and since we were here in Las Vegas, we gave this place a try.

The food was delicious; very juicy and tasty. I would definitely recommend the tacos adobada, probably some of the best I've ever had. It had a very interesting and robust flavor.

I didn't care too much for the carne asada tacos, they were a bit chewy and cold. Still delicious though. 

The service was great and kind. I will definitely come back here when I visit Vegas again.
