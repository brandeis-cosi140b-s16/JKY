Whenever I'm at the waterfront I crave the huge portions of fajitas that are served in this establishment! One order is plenty for two, just order extra tortillas. As far as authentic Mexican dishes I haven't tried enough of them to know but it seems more like Tex Mex which is still super YUM! So far Pittsburgh has yet to show me the real deal.

Let's talk drinks! Lots of tequila choices or freshly muddled mojitos. The pitchers of Sangria and Margaritas are very reasonable and not made from mixes. They seem to be bottomless too! Whew get some dinner or a designated driver for the ride home. In the summer you can sit outside and enjoy the fountain and people watch. Perfect for Fajita Friday, Sangria Saturday, or a lazy Sunday funday afternoon!
