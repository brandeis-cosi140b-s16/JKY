Happy hour is what it is, decent margaritas, great service(hard to find a great old school bartender like Armando), nachos were good(more stadium style than gourmet) so we were happy, at half price happy hour really good.  LVH has many shows so we will probably make this a regular joint.  They do play motley crue vids nonstop, which is OK with us.  One negative, plastic silverware and plates???  Still going back for the vibe and cool bar.
