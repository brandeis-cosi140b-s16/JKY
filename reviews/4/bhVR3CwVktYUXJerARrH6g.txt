been coming here for many years ... since they opened in what used ti house Mcguffy's, if that tells you anything.  Anyway, it's our go-to Mexican place.  The food is always good, and the service acceptable ( has actually improved in recent months as they've hired more people).  Take a look around ... lots of Hispanic people eat here.  That's got to say something.
