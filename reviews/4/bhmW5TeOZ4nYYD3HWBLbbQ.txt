I am not a fan of chain restaurants but Arribas seemed to be a local chain so I decided to try it during a visit to Phoenix. It was the best Mexican food I have had in a long time. Some may argue the food quality but I am a sucker for large margaritas and a Mariachi band. Most Mexican places I visit on the East Coast are afraid to make anything spicy but Arriba has heat indicators listed on the menu. Try one of the 2 or 3 chili listings if you like spicy.
