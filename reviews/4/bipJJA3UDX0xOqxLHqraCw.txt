I went to dinner with my family and we got seated right away. The server was very nice and checked on us a lot. The salsa bar was amazing, the salsa range from mild to super spicy. There was also a nice bean dip. 

We had to cadillac margarita and a mojito. The margarita came with a shaker that you could take home. The entries were delicious.
