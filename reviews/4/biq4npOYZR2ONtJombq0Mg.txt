Tacos is the new religion.

Rushed in after work with the wifey, the minute we walked into the restaurant our mind were blown.  The concept and the theme was spectacular, we rushed in around 10:30pm thinking that their kitchen is probably closed but they actually ended up bringing out the full menu for us.

When you first walked thru the front door the entire dining hall opens up, the acoustic and the setting made me felt like im going to have some tacos with St. Peter himself.

Here are the things we had ordered,
1. 1893 Frozen Margarita.
2. Jalapeno Bacon Guacamole  LOVED IT!
3. Fresh Ceviche of the day (Shrimp and scallop!)

I had ordered all the New School Tacos and my personal favorite was the Chipotle Chery Steak, and the Peking Duck.  Just beautifully done, the texture of the steak just melts in your mouth.

Their Tortillas were so fluffy and fresh if i had a bed  made out their tortillas i would sleep on it and eat myself with it. 

she had the Pork Adovada, Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef and Guild chicken. She really enjoyed the Pork Adovada out of the 3 (Old World Tacos)

They also gave us 2 free sides, the Green Chile Achiote Rice, and Crispy Poblano Onion Straws.  


The service was fantastic, loved the jukebox and the restroom was pretty cool too.

I really enjoyed my experience there, and have since sent quite a few people that way, and have heard nothing but good things about it.
