I have heard about this location many times in speaking with friends, but never had the chance to go. 

Happened to attend with buddies after finishing round of golf and Cave Creek.  Was surprised to find that is just up the street.  And now wish I had found this location before.

When we walked in the door, we were lined up but a person who let us taste the different meats.  Enjoyed the Jerk Fried Rice and Jade Chicken. Only had the bowl. Will order in a burrito next time. 

I would never stop in this place given location and that it is a hole in the wall.  But having heard about and now having experienced, this could be a regular stop after golf on weekends. 

Cannot wait to try the location in Chandler.
