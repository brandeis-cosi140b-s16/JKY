Today was my 1st time at CFT.  And I have to admit...it was really REALLY good!

I love the laid back atmosphere.  The waitress was the BEST!  I work in the service industry and I always expect amazing customer service everywhere I go, and she deserves 5 stars!  I hate coming to a new restaurant and the wait staff doesn't explain the menu/concept.  She was very very thorough and so personable.  Some wait staff can be a little too personable and it can get annoying.  But she was the perfect amount.  She explained the menu very well to someone like me who is very indecisive.  And our drinks and chips were never empty (and we had a table of 8). 

I think some people may not like the salsa.  It's mainly corn, red onion, tomatoes, lemon juice, cilantro, and maybe some green peppers.  I loved it.  Nice and simple.  I had the tuna rancheros.  It was so good!  The tuna was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes were so juicy and sweet.  I had a bite of my friend's beer battered shrimp taco and it was amazing.  I regretted not getting it, but oh well, I'll just have to go back!

I will definitely be back...very soon!
