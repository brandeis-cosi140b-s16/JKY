Some of the best Mexican and it is close to my office.  I am in here enough that they know my order by heart: Pastor burrito, everything but rice, and habanero.

Food is great and consistently so. Their red salsa is not overly bitter like most Mexican restaurants and they can make your food with as much kick as you want.

Food portions are huge for the money and everything I have tasted is above average or excellent.

The decor is what it is and I've seen a few people ding them for it, but it isn't dirty as much as it is dated.
