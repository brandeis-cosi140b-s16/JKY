Beer selection: 4.5 stars
Food: 3.5 stars

This location is my favorite mostly because it doesnt seem to get quite as busy as the other locations. As with all Mad Mex's, the draft beer list is always great with a broad range of styles. Youre sure to find a beer youre in the mood for.. And happy hour is hard to beat with half off drafts and wings from 4:30-6:30pm on weekdays. The burritos seem to be a hit, but i think theyre overrated. The nacho grande is huge and loaded, and tastes alright. Wings are pretty decent, especially with their blue cheese. All in all, id say come here for happy hour to feel the full affect of Mad Mex
