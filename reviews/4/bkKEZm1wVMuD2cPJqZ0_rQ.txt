Tried this place out for the first time yesterday and enjoyed the food.  We stood back and figured out what we wanted and let some other people go in front of us so we didn't hold up the line.  Not a big line anyways when we went.  There was a woman making tortillas as we were about to order.  I thought that was cool to see that they make their own.  

I ordered two tacos with the chili roast beef.  I definitely enjoyed them and wow they are big!  I was like how do you eat these?  I wasn't a fan of the wild rice but did enjoy the black beans.  I also enjoyed the fresh made tortillas with my tacos.  My friend ordered a burrito enchilada style and wow it was so big!  She couldn't finish it all.  We also did chips and quac and I thought they tasted very good.

We didn't feel rushed and the service seems pretty similar to how you order at Chipotle or Zabas.  Not an issue for me.  The place was clean and relaxing.  I definitely am going to visit this place again.  New place is found.
