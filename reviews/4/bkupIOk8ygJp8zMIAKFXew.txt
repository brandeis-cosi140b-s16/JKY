I've been twice. First time I had very SLOW service, but the chips and salsa were so delicious I didn't  care.

They serve two kinds of salsa with their chips both are fresh and fire roasted, one is your basic (red) salsa but Oh So Good, the other is a really unique ,tomatillo blend I think, and it is served warm...WOW. Both are spicy enough without being too hot.

 I'd go there just to eat the chips and salsa!!

I also tried their table side Guacamole which I confess , I ate the whole bowl myself, it is SO GOOD!!!

I haven't ventured the menu too much because I was full from chips and guac, but I Loved the chicken enchilada, generously stuffed with juicy white chicken and covered in a scrumptious sour cream sauce.
Tasty beans and rice too.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I thought their tortilla soup was gross.
I'm a huge soup fan, I Love it and eat it all year round, but theirs just wasn't  good.

I need to make a visit soon, I must have their chips and salsa!!
