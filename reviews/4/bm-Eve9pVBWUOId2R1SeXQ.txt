One of my favorite Mexican food places in the valley. So fun to go here and eat family style. Buy meat by the pound and try a couple different flavors and fresh tortillas come with it. All you can eat Chips (made fresh) and a huge salsa bar with so many choices. Best salsa bar in town!
So I'm deducting one star because most of the staff does not speak English. Normally I wouldn't complain as many small excellent restaurants have this problem. But I have had trouble ordering, and I have one friend who refuses to go because of it. 
However, the prices are great and the food is wonderful.
