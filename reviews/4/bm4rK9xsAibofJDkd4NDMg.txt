If you live in or around Matthews ... this is a great place to go for some interesting Mexican food in a casual, fun setting!  Definitely doesn't have the sleepy Matthews vibe. More of a fun restaurant/bar that you would find uptown.

All of the tacos are terrific, as are the Empanadas, the Cuban, the Chicken Tortilla soup and just about anything that is on special each day!

When the weather is nice, they open up the 'Garage' doors so it feels like an open air Mexican Beach Taqueria. Very nice ... especially when they have live entertainment on weekends.

Another thing we LOVE about Pure is the staff!  While some of our favorites have come and gone (Maggie, Mallory and Stacy), they like to hire people that are friendly and enthusiastic, which is a big plus!  These days, ask for Olga, Zoe, Libby or Nate.

We definitely recommend Pure Taqueria if you are in the Matthews area.
