So finally ate here last night since the switch of owners. I found it to be a much smaller menu, simple to read, and seemingly more American food offered now. I don't know why exactly, but eh (kinda similar to OP). 
Got chips and salsa, still taste the same and are amazing. They still leave you with garlic breath the next morning, regardless of how many times you brush. Yum! I got the two cheese enchiladas because that's what I have grown up on (I used to get other menu items, but this seemed like the safest bet considering it's a different place). They were good. A lot more cheese than they used to. The sauce was way more mild than before which I wasn't really crazy about, but just glad it wasn't the same nasty red sauce a lot of places use. The beans were super yummy and the rice was just okay. I honestly prefer the rice that L&B used. My friend got the beef mini chimis and seemed to enjoy them. My sister got a carne asada burrito and said it was kinda basic. She was upset that the t-bone steak was no longer a menu item :P My father got a patty melt and fries and seemed to like his food. Everything was pretty good. 
The interior was all freshly painted and looked nice and service was pretty on point. Not terrible and not stellar. Overall good experience.
