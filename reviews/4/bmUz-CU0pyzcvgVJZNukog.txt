This is my second time eating here and was as happy as the first.  Friendly staff, very clean, great food.  I like the carne asada taco.  I only ordered one with some chips that we shared. The first time I had ordered two tacos (carne asada and lengua) and it was a bit much.  My husband likes the lengua taco, he had two.  We love the green sauce on the table.   Reasonably priced, generous portions, delicious food.  I'm excited to try something else on the menu next time.
