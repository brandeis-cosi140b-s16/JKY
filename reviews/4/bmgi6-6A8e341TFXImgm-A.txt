This Rubio's in Mesa Riverview is clean and friendly. The salsa bar was clean and refreshed often. I was disappointed to find that Rubio's is not yet on the online ordering bandwagon. I'm not a fan of waiting around and taking up a dining room seat. But I will say that my order was prepared and ready with lightening speed!

The seasonal langostino burrito is always awesome, and the tomatillo salsa rivals my own (gratuitous booster). The chips and refried beans are ridiculously good.  The fish tacos, citrus shrimp burrito and street tacos are excellent. Even a plain salad is good, and they will accommodate your diet; in my case adding bay shrimp and salsa only to a plain salad. Everything has been fantastic. 

This franchise is a good one in the chain, and I appreciate their wonderful customer service.
