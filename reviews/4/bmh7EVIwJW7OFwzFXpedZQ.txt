I've only ordered off their catering menu, never actually eaten in the restaurant. So that being said up front, here are my thoughts:

Called to order 1 week prior to my work meeting.  the manager basically allowed us to customize our order to get what we wanted for the number of people.  Their catering menu is very affordable and many of the deals include rice, beans, chips and salsa...can't beat that!  And they even throw in the plates, napkins, and plastic silverware...other places you have to pay for this.  All we needed were serving utensils. 

Our food was hot, fresh and exactly what we ordered.  it was ready on time too.  I'd love to go back and order off their full menu.  Their service and food were great. I'd recommend them for catering.
