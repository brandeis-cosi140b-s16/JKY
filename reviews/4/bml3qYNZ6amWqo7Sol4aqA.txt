Torture, as defined by Webster is the act of deliberately inflicting pain, which is exactly what I did Saturday.
With #19 molar in need of an immediate extraction, I came here anyway, throbbing tooth and all. Big mistake. 

The pre-meal tortilla chips were difficult to resist, igniting nothing short of a masochistic dining event. 
The menudo was white and bland as hell, but the tripe was perfectly cooked. 
My wife's flauta's were crunchy enough to send me through the rafters with each torturous, but delicious bite. 

The only thing I could wolf handily was her refried beans and some handmade flour tortillas which were too, too good. 

I looked like Senator McCain after eating here, but it was worth it.
