Love this place! Visited phoenix in March, had an excellent experience with kids and family. Second visit in July, and another great dining experience. Waiter was extremely courteous, informed us mariachi bands Saturdays @6. I had the steak fajita lunch and hubs had seafood chimi! We will visit again!
