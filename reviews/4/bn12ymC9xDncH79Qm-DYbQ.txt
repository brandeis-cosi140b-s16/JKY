Holy crap, this Filibertos is fancy!  This is the one Filibertos that is actually *like* a real rest-a-rant-ae!  Most Filibertos that I know are little shacks, some with walk ups, some with drive thru's, some with both.  This one?  Actually has TABLES and an INSIDE!  HOLY CRAP!  Amazing!

I know this place has been open for a while, but never really went to this location since there's like a zillon around town.  I came here very early this morning after doing a 3 mile walk for MS with some of my new co-workers.  Fortunately, they open early, and I was hungry!

I cruised in here and was pretty much the only person here.  Same full menu that you would get at all the other locations, but this place actually has tables and a salsa bar.  They even have an outdoor patio!  *gasp*

I ordered the macaca (I think thats how to spell it) breakfast platter and man, was it HUGE!  I mean, I'm not a huge fan of Filibertos, but they do give you tons of really good food for a really cheap price, and its filling.  I couldn't even finish it.

I like that they have this sit down location.  It's a nice change for them, and makes me feel more comfortable instead of having to carry everything out.

I will gladly return in the future when I'm in the area, and its the nicest Filibertos I've seen since living here!
