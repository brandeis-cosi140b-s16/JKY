Phenomenal!! My husband and I will definitely be back! He had G's Signature Philly Burger with sautéed onions, peppers, mushrooms, & cheese - topped with their spicy jalapeño cheesesteak. The front lady said it would be HUGE, but it really wasn't all that big. However, the taste made up for it! 
I had the Spicy Jalapeño Cheesesteak with melted cheese, sautéed peppers, onions, mushrooms, & spicy jalapeños. Boy oh boy, it was delicious!!!
The only downside is that their prices are a bit high. But well worth it. Go there! You won't be disappointed
