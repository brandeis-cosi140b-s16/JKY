I don't care what anyone says, I love Filiberto's.  Carne asada burrito, Arizona burrito, green chile, carnitas, machaca, chorizo, carne asada fries.... I love it all.  I'm not crazy about the cheese they use, so I usually order without it, or end up scraping it off. It's not gross, they just tend to be heavy handed.

Nothing beats a late-night Filiberto's stop, or a morning-after hangover buster.  And, their horchata is my favorite! If they delivered, my life would be complete.
