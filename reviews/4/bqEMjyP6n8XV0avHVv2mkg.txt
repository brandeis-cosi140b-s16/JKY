Like a island version of chipotle. Delicious variety of unique hot sauces and very flavorful. The only reason I knocked off one star is that they had no fish ready to add to my bowl. They offered me a free drink and  coconut bark to compensate. The coconut bark was the best thing ever. Great service and delicious food. We will be back. I ordered a veggie bowl.
