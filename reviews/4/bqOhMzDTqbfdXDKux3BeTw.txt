I think salty senoritas is going to be our new hot spot! The first time I met the guys there it was on a Saturday and it was a little overwhelming cause apparently it's a hawkeye bar. The fans are a little rude and out of control spraying beer everywhere, so double check to see if it's game day! But I went there last night for a company function and wow what a difference! It was packed, music was pumping, and employees were jamming! We started off at the bar and the girl bartender Ashley was great! She was hilarious and wonderful! We got 2 margs that she suggested, tequila soltice and kamodo dragon, and they were delicious! When we moved to our table we all shared happy hour apps which is such a great deal. After the meeting we went to say bye and thank you to the bartender and she informed us it was ladies night and a dj was about to start so we ended up stating and partying the night away! The best part was the manager made it a point to come by and thank us for our business! What an amazing atmosphere and friendly staff
