Surprised there are no reviews for this place!

I have to lay down my love for this little shop because it was the place where I lost my fried ice cream virginity to what is the most amazing dessert (that isn't melted damnit) on the planet. Fried Ice Cream is a ball of vanilla ice cream covered in crispy batter with Cinnamon and sugar, sat in a giant tostada and covered with chocolate sauce. It is amazing. It is sinful. It is NOT MELTED ICE CREAM. 

Chips and salsa is not unlimited though it used to be (sorry a lot of Las Vegas restaurants have been having trouble this year I think, a LOT of places closed due to the economy). Lunch is only 7.75 for a choice of like 15 different things. Nothing on the dinner menu is more than 15 except for a 12oz New York Steak. 

I really like to get Chimichangas here, they are super fried and awful for you but delicious. Full of meat, full of goodness. Great place to go if you are up in the Summerlin area, where real Mexican that hasn't been co-opted by giant Americanizing corporations is few and far in between. It's in a little plaza that can be hard to find, but worth it. It will look like you are going into Vegas's own giant old-people community -- because you are, but make a sharp turn right into the plaza before that happens -- otherwise beware the golf cart!
