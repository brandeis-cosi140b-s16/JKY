Actually, not bad. Unlike MacFadden's (the other dance spot) this place has a disignated dance floor, so you're not fighting your way through drunk people flailing their arms to get to the bar. Drink prices are better than Westgates, Carne Asada tacos for drunk munchies, and a beach-like environment... Good music too.
