My husband doesn't overly like most Mexican food so it took a lot of pleading to give this place a try instead of yet again eating at the Sundance Grill.  So glad we did. Better everything. Love the three salsas and chips. The smokey flavor of the habenero salsa is only downgraded by it not being quit hot enough. My mushroom enchilada was great. Meaty portabello mushrooms with a complimentary sauce. Have had both the Spanish style rice and the cilantro lime rice, both were good not too dry. On our recent visit we had a table of 6 with 4 needing to make a plane not long after dinner. Our server was great in not dawdling on anything while also not rushing us. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the surprisingly poor margaritas. I have twice tried the Cadillac on the rocks. Both times tasted like seawater. Others in our party went for the blended standard margarita and none cared for it. Complaints ranged from too sweet to too thick and tasteless. Everyone was very happy with their food though.
