For many years, I was resistant to the idea of fish tacos. Little did I know what I was missing! 8 years ago, I decided to try them at Rubio's and I've never looked back! On this particular visit, I redeemed my free birthday meal, which is a perk of signing up for their email notifications. Consistently good food every time I visit!
