This place has one heck of a menu.  The combination of Mexican and Asian cuisine took us a back a little bit at first, but there were so many options that everyone should be able to find something they like.  

The server told us that the format is more like a tapas restaurant where you order several small dishes.   I would challenge this statement as the dishes are by no means small.  

I tried two dishes.  The deep fried wantons and the Don't Be Jealous hot and sour soup.  Both dishes were delicious.  The wantons were like an appetizer size, but the soup was definitely like a full meal.  The only drawback with the soup is that the pork was a little large to eat easily with the little spoon provided.  I ended up looking like a slob with bits of meat hanging out of my mouth more than once, but it was so tasty, that by that point I didn't care.
