Best place for cheap greasy tasty Mexican food. Every thing on the menu looks great but I usually only have the carne asada fries or Guacamole supremea. 
Oh carne asada fries! They start out with a huge plate of fries then pile carne asada meat on top. Then next add on the sourcream, cheese, and guacamole. Oh so good. A little on the greasy side but still quite tasty. 
Now even better the quesadilla supremea, so delicious!! Large flour tortilla filled with all the good stuff. Carne asada meat and cheese layered with sour cream and guacamole. 
Everything on the menu is reasonable priced and they even have some specialty Mexican foods. But all at semi-fast food style. 
I can't wait to get back to Phoenix for some more.
