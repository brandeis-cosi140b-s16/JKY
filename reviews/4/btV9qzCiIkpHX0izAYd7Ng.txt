This location is a bit hidden in an odd-shaped shopping center in the old part of Queen Creek (near Norton's Corner and Eggs TC).  I was very pleasantly surprised with how spotlessly clean the restaurant is inside, including really clean restrooms.  Service is friendly and fast.  Food is excellent (they have a very nice salsa bar, too).  Prices are very low.  Lots of very good seating inside.
