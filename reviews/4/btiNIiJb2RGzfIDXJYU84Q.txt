Oh Del Taco, when I lived in California you were a saviour for those late night munching feasts..

And you prove to be the same for those late night Las Vegas nights on the drive back from the casino to our hotel.. I love you chicken burrito WITH special sauce and your crinkle fries.. And don't forget the Mr. Pibb! Sigh..
