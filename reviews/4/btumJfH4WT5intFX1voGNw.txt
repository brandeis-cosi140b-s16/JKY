Arturo is the owner of of this quiet little restaurant in the middle of a shopping mall right down the street from Costco on Hayden (1 block west of Northsight off Raintree). All his staff/cooks are family. We met Arturo when he was the caterer at a Super Bowl party, and he gave us his card announcing he would be opening up his new restaurant. Others may know him when he was the bartender at Maestro's on Pima.  He is getting a liquor license for the place. Many locals have discovered his gem. This is the way Mexican food should taste. It is authentic, good, and not pricey. Place is not fancy but perfect for this food. We've had them cater one of our parties too. Everyone raved about the food. He knows his stuff. Buenos Nachos with diced bits of carne asada and chunky chorizo is the only thing I order now. Try it and whatever specials they have going on and you'll be hooked too.
