Surprisingly tasty.  Who would have thought that tater tots on a burrito would work?  They do, quite nicely on the Hungry Hippie.  The husband had the High Roller and he was quite happy with the steak, but particularly the bacon was not cheap bacon, which is always a bonus.  And the hot salsa/ sauce (as it is a bit on the chunkier side) is actually pretty hot with decent flavor without singeing off the taste buds.  The space is small but apparently they deliver so if you're nearby, then you don't have to worry about finding a space in which to enjoy your yummy deliciousness.  They are open late hours, which is also a bonus.  Pretty sure when we return to the area, we'll be seeking out this little spot for a meal - good stuff!
