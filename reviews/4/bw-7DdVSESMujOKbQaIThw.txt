I came here for a margarita and stayed for two pitchers. My oh my, Diego's makes a mean marg. Plus, we got free warm chips, fresh salsa, and super-attentive service, even though we were just bumps on a log most of the night. Made me a big fan! The music got louder the later we stayed making us want to put on our dancin' pants and head out for a night on the town. Although I haven't eaten there yet, I think it'd be a perfect place for dinner and a pre-game margarita (or four) before bopping around State Street.
