I was hesitant at first when trying Fiesta Ranchera as I had been there when it was El Toro and wasn't sure that they would live up to my expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The salsa and chips are consistently good (where some Mexican restaurants have bland salsa about 50% of the time).  My husband and I have ordered a variety of items off the menu and overall enjoyed everything we have ordered.  The fajitas have been nicely caramelized; the rice is the best we have had in town.  They are flexible with ordering.  I don't care for re-fried beans and they have been happy to let me substitute for rice or in the case of bean enchiladas, for a cheese enchiladas.  

Other reviewers have said they thought the food was microwaved and I have never thought that.  Perhaps the quality has gone up since they were reviewed 6 months ago?

I only get the flavored margaritas (peach, strawberry, mango) and have felt they had a sufficient amount of tequila in them.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are half price margaritas; any size and flavor.  Well worth the value!

I have only two reasons for giving 4 stars instead of 5; relaxed service and dessert.  This is not a place to go if you are in a rush; the service is designed that way I believe.  While they get your food to you quickly, they do not rush you to finish by rushing the check.  I suppose you could ask them to go quickly; I personally never have.  In regards to dessert, we have tried to order the fried banana dessert three times and only been able to get it one time.  Once they were out of bananas; the other time they were out of ice cream.  The one time we did get it, it was fantastic however.

My husband and I have switched from going to El Toro now primarily to Fiesta Ranchera.  Our only complaints are certainly minor in comparison!
