This is another one of those, "We were walking down the street and decided we wanted a drink or two" stories. We popped in for a drink, sat down at the bar and proceeded to have a great time. The bartenders were really nice, made recommendations and would make anything we asked. They let us look at some of the "special" bottles of tequila they had even if we didn't buy a shot a drink made with it. The service we received was excellent, fast prompt and friendly. I couldn't ask for better service. 

They have drink specials during the afternoon based on a wheel they have hanging over the bar, they spin it and what ever it lands on is the drink special for the next half hour. Because we were there celebrating my wife's birthday and our belated honeymoon, they let her climb up on the bar and give it a spin. She got a kick out of that. 

I liked the atmosphere, it was relaxing. I will admit that the layout makes it a little warm during the day, but hey, that's why they serve cold drinks. It is a bit pricey, just remember you are on the strip in Vegas. We liked it so much we went back later in the week when we were passing by.
