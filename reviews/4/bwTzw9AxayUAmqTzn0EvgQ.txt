After an aborted early morning trip to another eatery, I decided to drive down Fremont to Pepe's.

OK.  East Fremont isn't the best neighborhood around.  But Pepe's was nice and clean.  I arrived at 7:30 or so on a Sunday morning.  I was the lone sober, non-Spanish speaking patron in the establishment, I think.

I stood in the short line and perused the menu on the wall.  The owners were helpful enough to place English words behind each item on the menu... i.e. lengua = tongue, cabeza = head.  The drunk, 5'8" dude with the Elvis do directly in front of me went with tres tacos lengua.  Nice.  I think I'll pass on the lengua today.

I ordered a couple of tacos al pastor and a cabeza taco.  The lady behind the counter pretended she didn't speak English, which is fine.  I don't think she liked the cut of my jib.  I threw a couple bucks in the tip jar and headed to a corner table.

I heard the lady yell SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO SETENTEQUATRO!  Hey, that's me!

I grabbed the tacos and proceeded to devour them.  Solid food...and only $1.49 a throw for the tacos.

Wish they had 24 hour taco joints in the crud where I currently reside.

Don't know if I'll make it back, not the best area and I'm the whitest guy ever and from Minnesota, so I didn't feel very comfortable.

But the tacos were very good and very cheap!
