Not as bad as last review said it is. Food was delicious and at a great price. Perfect place to go if you want to talk with a friend and not be interrupted because the service is slow! Sad to say the waiter walked past us several times while we waited for him to take the order and had to tell him we wants the check. You would think he would of brought it when we asked for a to go box.
