Yummy! I met some friends here for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  Do not be fooled by the exterior appearance.  I would not have visited if my friend hadn't already vouched for the place.  This is a hidden gem in Downtown Phoenix!  

I ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were very tasty.  Most places overdo it with the onions but this place did not.  The chips and salsa were very good.  The red salsa was very hot in my opinion so be warned.  

The service was a little slow but the restaurant was very busy with a large lunch crowd so maybe that had something to do with it.  The food more than makes up for it.
