Found this place on Yelp with my phone as I drive into AZ and I am glad it was this place. The food was great and the service was friendly. As for recommendations because it was my first time and the enchilada combo  was great. Best of all they gave me a free taco to try because it was my first time and also it was 10 mins before they close. The taco was also very good. I finish everything in less then 10 mins. Will stop by again next time I am in town.
