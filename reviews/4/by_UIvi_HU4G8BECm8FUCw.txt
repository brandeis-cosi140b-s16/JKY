Okay, so we did go back after I swore off returning.   We had an eye appointment with the awesome eye doctor there in the parking lot, and the siren song (of the olden days when Macayo's was my favorite restaurant) was calling me.  I focused on the chips and the hot sauce (which you must ask for or you'll never know the glory) and then ordered a tried and true favorite, and it was fine.  Things are a little different from back in the day.  That's a fact.  They won't acknowledge it, but it's true.  However, sticking with a reliable mex-n-match of shredded beef taco and a beef tamale, rice & beans, I did fine.  The service is marginal these days unless you get one of the "old" crew- there is a short full-figured blonde waitress that's been there forever, and she is the finest server you can have for any price-level restaurant.  I can't remember her name. But she's great.  Anyhow, it was better this time.
