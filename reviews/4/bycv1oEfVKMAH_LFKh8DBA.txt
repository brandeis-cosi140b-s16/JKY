I've been doing some work at the hotel for about 3 months now, so I've eaten at the Pink Taco about 20 times in 2012 already.  I should be a part owner by now.  I'm going to at least try to get some free guac next time I'm down there...

The good: Portions are good sized, even for a fatty-fat-fat accountant who is eating to escape reality.  The pink tacos, fish tacos, burritos, and etc have great portion sizes.  The carne asada and canitas plates are both awesome, but a tad bit expensive.  The steak tonight was amazing.  No sh*t.  Service is pretty spot on.  

The critiques: You might want to avoid this place if you're going out on a first date on a Friday night.  It can get pretty loud.  The scenery is decent.  Nothing visually appealing enough to write home about.

I'll be back.  Hell, I'll probably be back later this week since it's uber convenient.
