Please don't hate, but I like Chipotle... Sure it's owned by McDonalds, sure it's not authentic Mexican food, but still it's very tasty. Nothing special about this particular location: it looks like any other Chipotle restaurant (maybe a little nicer?). The nice thing about it, though, is that I get the same burrito that I would buy in NYC for $2 cheaper...
