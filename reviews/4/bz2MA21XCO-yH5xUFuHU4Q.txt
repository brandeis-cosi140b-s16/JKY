Lots of buzz with this place.

Felt it was a good deal for Mexican.  In a business park/industrial part of town.  Not the same feel you may get from the other locations.

You start off with two types of salsas (Red and Green)  that are made with Hatch Chiles every other day according to the waiter.  

The combinations and food was great.

Recommend:  Yes.
Go Back:  Yes.  But it's pretty out of the way.
