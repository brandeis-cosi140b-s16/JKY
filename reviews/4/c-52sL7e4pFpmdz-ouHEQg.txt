This is a great local Mexican joint..  modern priced, comfortable, good ritas and sangria and standard Mexican food done California style. I am from Los Angeles and there are a million of these sort of places here, so it was nice to have a local Mex place that was casual, consistently good, friendly, laid back and fun.

My faves are Tortilla Soup & Street Tacos.. 

I have also heard that they turn it into a Spanish club on the weekends, which is awesome.
