This place is in the lunch rotation. Whenever we decide to go
a little further than our usual lunch location radius and 
venture into Ahwatukee. It's in a mall (isn't everything anymore)
and there's always plenty of parking. You might want to come
before noon, though, if you are in a big group and want to sit
inside. The place seems to be pretty popular after being featured
in dumpsters, divers, and douchebags or whatever that program is
called. I don't like going anywhere just because some TV program
hyped it up. Might as well eat at McDonald's because you've seen
their commercials so many times. Anyway, I've tried most of their
street tacos and I'm partial to the marinated pork (Carnitas). Not
sure why they have Spanish for most of their menu but instead of
Carnitas it's "marinated pork." It is an interesting recipe - includes
condensed milk and coca-cola. That's the secret recipe. Well, either
the secret's been let out of the bag or it wasn't ever that secret
because when I googled Carnitas recipes there were hundreds with 
those same two ingredients. Whatever the case, I love that flavor
and I'm addicted to it. Is it really the kind of coke you drink or
the other kind? Whatever the case, I like it and will keep coming back.
