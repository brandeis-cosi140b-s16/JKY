2015- hit or miss here...probably as good as you can get in Charlotte...doable and passable...

$12 for four steak tacos that are not even that great. $20+ for a combo plate where the meat inside the taquitos are cold. Sides of barely there rice and beans. Homemade tortillas that taste like fabric softener. This is sub-par Mexican food that leaves much to be desired. This was the most stressful dining experience I've ever had and I left with my stomach in knots. 

Nice for the manager to apologize to us and discount our bill $2. Yeah. $2.

I cannot understand how this place is highly rated. This is not good, nor truly authentic Mexican food. What is up with Carolinians?!

PS- this is the second time we dine here. First time food was bad. We considered it a fluke...I mean with all these high ratings. Well 2nd time proved this place is not all it's "rated" up to be.
