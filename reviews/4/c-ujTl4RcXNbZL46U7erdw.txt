Excellent Mexico City cuisine, a departure from the northern Mexican food more Phoenicians are accustomed to. The restaurant is open, the service is top notch and the food is really what draws the crowds. One key difference in Mexico City food is most of the meat is grilled over charcoal. This gives all dishes a unique and flavorful taste that is much different than your average "stew it all together" flavors.

The menu is vast with many options for all palettes. If chicken is your thing, I'd recommend the Chilaquiles Suizos. I've yet to try the Mesa location; being an EV guy myself I need to get out there with the family. I've been to the Tatum location with co-workers and the experience was excellent.

You owe it to yourself to try La Parrilla Suiza (translated as 'The Swiss Grill') to enjoy a wonderful menu, and top tiered service.
