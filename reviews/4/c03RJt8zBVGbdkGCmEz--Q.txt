Fresh from the 808 I was in search of some quality and cheap mexican food. And Zef's fit the bill. 

I had the shredded beef sope for $2.50, yum! And two orders of rolled tacos, chicken and beef, $4.75 each order. I liked the beef better, the chicken was a bit salty and had this strange after taste. My husband had the carnitas burrito $4.75 which he devoured. I personally like my guacamole on the chunky side, but yes theirs is the creamy variety.

They were quick, they were yummy and they were very convenient to the house. Yup, next time I'm in Surprise visiting the in-laws, this will be my steady freddy mexican fix. 

Pros:
-Cheap 
-Yummy
-Quick & Convenient

Cons:
-Rolled chicked tacos had a strange after taste to them.
