On my way home from the baseball game I decided to stop in here and see what all the excitement was about.  I drove past it and then turned around and got a parking spot right by the door.

I ordered the dogfish shark taco and the cochinita pibil taco combo with rice and beans.  I received some chips as I left the order counter and stopped at the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo.  When I got to my table I scooped some pico onto my tortilla chip and wow, what great fresh taste!

I also had some tomatillo, jicama and chipotle salsas that I tried on my tacos.  The shark taco was good and the cochinita pibil was even better.  Even the small cups of rice and beans where really good.

I grabbed a menu on my way out and am already trying to plan what I'll have on my next visit.  I especially can't wait to try the horchata.
