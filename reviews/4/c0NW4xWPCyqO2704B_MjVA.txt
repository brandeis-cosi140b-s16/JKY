Good food!

I had their fish and shrimp tacos and they were really good. The girl at the counter was in training and really nice. 

The salsa bar was clean and the salsa was pretty fresh. 

I wasn't crazy about the corn tortilla, definitely like the flour tortilla better. 

But either way I would definitely eat here again.
