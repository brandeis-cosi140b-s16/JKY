Wasn't sure what to expect but was highly surprised with the experience. 

Service was good for starters. That was surprising since the place was packed. Atmosphere was live and entertaining with the mariachi band in the background. 

I ordered the garlic shrimp plate and a Pacifica beer. When my plate arrived my eyes lite up to the amount of food that was on the plate.  It was enough for two maybe the people to split.  Flavors of the shrimp melted in my mouth. It was so good I didn't want to wash it down with the beer but I had to or else. 

Needless to say I left happy. And want to go back.  Highly recommended
