3.5 stars rounded up. 

Food: Really glad I ordered the cochinita pibil entree. The cochinita was really well cooked and still moist, though not served (and maybe not prepared) in banana leaf. Served as make-your-own-tacos. Friend ordered carne asada tacos, which seemed fine. 

Drink: Small full bar with a medium-sized beer menu. 

Service: Table service was very attentive. Problem was with the door staff, which told us the wait was "25 minutes or less" and turned out to be a full hour. People weren't sat in the order they arrived. Despite having a good number of staff around, they just weren't turning tables over; empty tables would sit unbussed for 15 minutes. We waited on their little patio, which was fine enough, except the staff kept coming out onto the patio, staring vacantly at the street, and then engaging each other in really animated conversations about nothing. The whole thing was a bit weird. 

Ambiance: Crowded and a little bit noisy, but not unenjoyable. 

Bottom line: They've reached some level of fame on the back of their good food. Staff just needs to keep it real. Recommend going, but not waiting if there's a long line.
