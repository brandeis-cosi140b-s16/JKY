I have eaten Mexican food from coast to coast and actually lived and worked in Mexico for a while and I can ASSURE you If you like Robertos you will probably hate this restaurant.  If you like Robertos you have an anglo palate , which is fine , but i'll venture a guess you prefer Panda Express to China Town restaurants and Pizza Hut to a real Italian Pie .. I digress.

Tony's is real Mexican food .  Portions are good sized and prices are reasonable . As with any restaurant they will have their specialties, if you are not going to order their specialties then the taste might be a bit off.  I always ask the staff what is good here when I am new to a restaurant .

If you asked me what's good there I'd tell you 

Chile relleno 
Carne Asada Fries
Flautas dinner
and Carnits Burrito slathered in their green sauce ! 

their beans are very good as a side dish as well

So please ignore the Robertos fans and give this place a try .  it's not my favorite mexican restaurant but It's very good !
