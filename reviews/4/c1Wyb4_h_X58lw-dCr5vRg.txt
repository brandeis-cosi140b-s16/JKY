"Regular por favor" has become a phrase we here often after moving into the Wells Fargo 2 building.  Johnny Burrito definitely does it right in terms of customer service, burritos, and style.  How many restaurants can move a line of 30 in 10 minutes?  I also like the fact that "You're the boss for the next 8 feet".  This place is amazing.  More or less, you determine the amount of toppings on your burrito.  Even the salads are filling if you prefer a healthier meal.  Free refills until close.
