3 Stars is A-OK in Yelps definition, but I'm feeling this should move closer to Yelp's 4 stars = "Yay! I'm a fan".  

Tasty Mexican fast food at reasonable prices is what I've experienced.  Friday was $1 off Fish items and I had the Fish burrito.  Crispy fish, well portioned wrapped in a flavorful tortilla filled with cabbage and pico de gallo.  Add a soda and total was $5.33. 

Service was fast, green salsa at the Salsa bar had just the right amount of heat and flavor (I really like Salsa Verde).  
I'd say they are doing it right.
