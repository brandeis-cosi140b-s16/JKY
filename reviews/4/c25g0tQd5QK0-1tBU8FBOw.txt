Ok so I am officially a gross person. I did eat at top shelf twice within a week and a half. BUT it was totally worth it. This location is so much better than the mesa location. The chicken fajita burrito fundido was delicious! as per usual. I only gave 4 stars because the rest of their food doesn't measure up and it is too expensive for what you get. Still good though (especially with a coupon).
