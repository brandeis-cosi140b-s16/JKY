My 1st time here at my daughters request. Ordered breakfast burrito with chorizo and potatoes and it was so yummy.  Their red hot sauce is amazing.  We dined in and the restaurant is clean and very well maintained.

Definitely will be back as the gal at the register was super nice and helpful with my 1st visit.  Many regulars as she was talking to most patrons.
