Stopped by because we were checking out the venues for our 2015 wedding and we were hungry. At first I thought the prices were a bit high, we ordered some fajitas, but when we got our dish I was surprised at how much food there was on the plate.
It was also very delicious.
The service was not too bad either as its pay first then eat.
I will definetly come again.
