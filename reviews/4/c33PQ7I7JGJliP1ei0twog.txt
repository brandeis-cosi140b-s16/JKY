I have been coming to this restaurant for years, I like just about all of their food. I usually order Cheese enchiladas, and shredded beef tacos. Their cheese enchiladas are good but can be somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes not cooked enough, sometimes with not enough sauce, and even though they are supposed to have onions in them they rarely ever do. 

Their shredded beef tacos are very good but they seem to have gotten shredded beef and machaca tacos mixed up. At most restaurants a machaca taco is very finely shredded spiced beef, and shredded beef tacos are coarsely shredded beef. Here if you order a machaca taco you get a course shredded beef in a preformed taco shell, and if you order shredded beef you get machaca in a properly deep fried taco shell. Whatever, I just order accordingly. 

Red chile burros are very good. Cheese crisps are sometimes burned on the bottom. Chips are often very fresh and hot, but their hot sauce has WAY too much oregano in it. it's been consistent over the years but WAY WAY TOO MUCH oregano!

They make a MEAN Cadillac Margarita on the rocks.

My wife likes their seafood enchiladas, I can't vouch for them as I don't like seafood that much. 

One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something with out rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away.
