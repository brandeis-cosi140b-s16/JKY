Came here for lunch with the team at work - the seafood was very fresh and tasted great!  I had the seafood ceviche: octopus, oysters, scallops, shrimp, etc...and the 7 Sea soup with tortilla.  The variety of hot sauces was great and I enjoyed the "habanera" hot sauce quite a bit - no serious kick here, but spicy enough for most people.  The soup was filled with fresh seafood along with crab legs.  Not convenient to crack the crab legs with a work crowd, but a lot of fun nonetheless.  Some had the shrimp tacos, machaca beef chimichanga, salads, etc...all the food looked very fresh.  Warning: the portions are very large!  As far as atmosphere goes, well, it doesn't have any - it's definitely a "hole in the wall".  Will definitely be back for the other dishes.
