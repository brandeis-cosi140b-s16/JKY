The Place:
I'm not sure if the first review was before they opened the new restaurant ... there is indoor seating in a beautiful casita-like dining room.  The entrance is through an archway that leads to a small patio area, off to the right (still outside) it looks like they could host a band or dance floor.

The style of the restaurant is what I would call "quick casual" in that you order at a counter that is kind of hidden around the corner, then the waiters will bring chips and salsa as well as the food you have ordered.

The food:
I have been three times and can say it is an easy place to recommend to others.  The chips are fresh and crispy (a fav of the kids) and the salsa has a little heat, but nothing too over bearing.  I have tried the grilled chicken and grilled steak in burritos (the names escape me).  These meats are really well seasoned and served with pico de gallo which is fresh with a bit of heat.  My wife tried the beef tacos, also delicious.  The kids love the quesadilla and beans (they dip the q in the beans.)

The bottom line:
Great environment (if a bit "out there"), good value, great food.  It's worth a trip for sure.
