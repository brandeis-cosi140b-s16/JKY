First let me say that there are two Salsaritas in uptown Charlotte that are less that a half mile apart. One sits in the Overstreet mall and the other sits in the Latta Arcade by The French Quarter. This review is for the Overstreet Mall location. Please note that someone has mistakenly included an exterior picture of the Latta Arcade location on here. 

On to the review... 

This was my first time visiting Salsaritas so I was not entirely sure what to expect since I usually avoid most chain restaurants. Located in the Overstreet Mall, it is convenient to get to if you work uptown like me or if you happen to be visiting for the day. Admittedly, the long line almost made me move on to see what else I could find but since I had some extra time, I decided to wait it out. I discovered that despite the long line, the service is lightning fast so I ended up waiting less than five minutes to get to the counter. I got a taco salad since that was the special for the day. 

Although I am not sure if this is the case with the whole menu, I was able to pick whether I wanted chicken, ground beef or steak and then I had a massive amount of toppings to choose from. Everything looked very fresh which is a must for me. There was no brown lettuce, soggy tomato, or sour cheddar cheese. The taco salad was pretty good and I think I would have it again. 

There was plenty of seating and I wouldn't have minded eating my lunch there if I was not by myself. Still, since I was on my own for lunch I got everything to go. I was really surprised that they packed my taco salad in a huge box specially made for my meal. The box probably cost more than my entree! lol... Anyway, I was in and out with decent food. 

If you are in a hurry and want a more substantial lunch, I would recommend Salsaritas. I think that the wait to get my food was quicker than if I had gone to the Chickfilet that sits right across the hallway.
