So I finally got off my yelpn butt and made it on over to La Condesa for lunch today. I got there around 1045, so I was that creepy taco stalker in the parking lot for about 15 minutes. I ordered teh La Condesa Shrmip Burro and the Oaxacan Mole chicken Taco. As I waited, I was able to check out the 8 or 9 different salsas they had there. Great stuff, I only packed up four. My fave, by a mile, was the creamy cilantro salsa. I wanna bathe in that stuff, like now. My food was ready pretty quick and I was in and out, which is nice.The taco was great, I really liked the flavor in the mole. I decided to add some of the peanut salsa the had, which was pretty good. I do have to say the Burro did fall a bit flat for me. there were tons of ingredients in tehre, but somehow it seemed to be a bit bland without adding any of the salsas to it.  Kiinda like that girl you see at the club, and y ou get home and...well, you get the picture. It was a good burro, but the shrimp were somehow flavorless and the bacon was non-existent. Not that I'm total food snob but when you tell me there's bacon in that mug, I wanna taste me some bacon. Overall my meal was good, I'm going to go back another day and try some other things on the menu, like the dogfish taco. Two thumbs up for the creativity on the food and the salsas, it's hard to stand out in teh Phoenix Taco/Burro scene.
