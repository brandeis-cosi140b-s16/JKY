the other reviews for this place are all over the map. I came here on a recommendation and yep, it's pretty much like a filibertos. it was basically the same thing. I had a cheese enchilada, a shredded beef burrito and rice and beans. it was super deelish. the guy at the counter was super nice. just like all the other filibertos I've been to, the seating is kinda shabby, and I chuckle when there is a TV on the wall with some weird Latin game show or soap opera. but hey, that's part of the experience, so I love it. I grew up here in AZ, and can't stand most of the Mexican places in the Phoenix metro because they either try to be trendy or they try to reinvent Mexican food like they do in California. this place just as much as filibertos, really is authentic Mexican food from this region. so I don't really know what other people think is *authentic,* but until you've been a hole in the wall sort of joint like this, you don't know what real Mexican food is, IMO. I'll try it again, for sure.
