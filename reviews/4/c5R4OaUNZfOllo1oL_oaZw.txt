Zaba's is great for lunch.  I love supporting local business (when they're worth it) and this one definitely is!

The Flamingo location has a great staff and is always on the ball.  I highly recommend this place.

They get four stars because it's a little small, and frequently during lunch it's next to impossible to find a seat.  The hot salsa is also unpredictable.  You have to get it on the side, test it out, and eat accordingly.  Sometimes it's INSANE hot, and other times not so much...
