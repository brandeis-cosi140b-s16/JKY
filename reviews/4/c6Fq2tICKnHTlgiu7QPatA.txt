I absoulutely love a good mexican meal, and I loved this place. I had the enchiladas and I was so impressed by the way it was presented to me! I was also VERY happy with the prices, and will definately go there again. The service was ok, but the food did it for me. I think I put on about 5 pounds, but don't even care... I'll go to the gym on friday.lol
