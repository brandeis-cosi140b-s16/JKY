I live nearby, and my husband sends me for tacos regularly. I am a big fan of the carnitas plate. I won't pretend to be an expert on authentic Mexican food, but It is delicious and family-owned. The people are generally friendly, and they prepare the food fresh. 

Sometimes I feel like an intruder because I'm a pasty white girl ordering in English, but the food is worth a little self consciousness!

It's not really a destination kind of restaurant, but an awesome little neighborhood place amidst a serious lack of good food choices in eastern North Las Vegas.
