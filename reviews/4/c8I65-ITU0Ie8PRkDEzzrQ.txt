I've been at a local hotel for work for over a week, and was pleasantly surprised to find I had a mexican restaurant right next door.  The staff is generally very friendly, and food is fresh made on the griddle in the back. The burritos are very large, and for only a few dollars you can get a large breakfast burrito and a cup of hot coffee.  My favorite items are the adobada, aguas frescas (jamaica, horchata and tamarindo), and chorizo con huevoes breakfast burritos.  They serve menudo on weekends only, and while I haven't tried it yet it seems to be very popular.  Its the red chili version, not the white.

In short, this isn't a bad little place to stop in if you're in town. They are far from the best mexican I have had (but I do live on the border in Laredo, TX!), but Mr Lenos satisfies my cravings well enough when I'm in town.
