Potato Taco!!!! I feel as though I am addicted. It is an amazing taco. 

However, so are all their other tacos. They make it to order and the beans and rice are absolutely delicious. At work we usually have Cafe Rio Fridays, but now, we have to add Baja into the rotation. 

The atmosphere is really laid back and I enjoy reading all the signs they have up. There is always this guy sitting behind the counter when I come, not sure if he is the owner or not, but he is funny. He makes suggestions for me every time I come in. Trying something new each time. The potato taco is something I will get with every order though. It is that good to me. 

Happy hour is from 5-7 I think, $1 tacos and cheap beer, and every Friday is Fish Taco Friday which is $1 for fish tacos ALL day Friday. I do not like fish, but if you do, go for it. 

Lots of choices for hot sauce, drink selection is pretty decent, and their raspberry tea is pretty good. So far I like this place, especially the food I have had so far. I am happy that my co-worker and I have yummy Fridays!
