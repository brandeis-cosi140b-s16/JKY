Good Mexican food. 

I came here with my colleague/friend on the July 4 long weekend while visiting Pittsburgh. Decided to try the place before we headed out for clubbing on South side. 

The portions are pretty generous for the price, atleast coming from NYC feels the portions are good and without compromising on the quality. 

The sauces are pretty good. The chips we had ordered were too oily. Mentioned it to the partner/hostess and she was apologetic saying they make it fresh and the person in kitchen might not have rested it to let the extra oil drain. 

Verdict - A good Mexican place on South side. Definitely worth vist(s)
