It's a small hole-in-wall Mexican looking place, not American looking, kinda rough around the edges, it's not Taco Bell, so if that's what you want, American tacos and chimichangas and things like that, go to Taco Bell. If you want authentic Mexican food in a place that will make you think you are in a modest place in Mexico, go to El Charro.

I just ate there for the first time, after buying groceries in the past. The guy cooking today did a great job, the best taco I have had in the US, a genuine Mexican taco, not smeared with canned bean paste, but lightly dressed with salsa (not the jarred salsa, real salsa), the delicious chorizo I ordered, grilled peppers and grilled onions. Small, inexpensive, and very delicious. A couple of squeeze bottles of sauce on the table, get yourself a drink from the cooler or the fountain, and you're set. Tip: the bottled Coke is Mexico formula, not US formula, and is quite a bit sweeter, if you want an American type Coke, get a fountain Coke.

While I was there I picked up a dozen tamales to take home, and I can't wait to try them. I'll post a review about them when I try them.
