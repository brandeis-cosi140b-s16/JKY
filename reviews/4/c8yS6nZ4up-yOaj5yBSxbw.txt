Was in Vegas over memorial Day weekend and came here twice.. 

Cute place in a little shopping center.  We were working at an event nearby and decided to stop during happy hour. 

Two for 1 drinks! Yes please, margaritas were fantastic! 
I got the 3 tacos - 1 chicken, 1 beef and 1 shrimp the first day, the chicken was a bit bland, beef was ok.. BUT the Shrimp was to die for! succulent, perfectly cooked and flavored shrimp, the chipotle sauce that topped it was amazing. 
Needless to say, day 2, I ordered the tacos again, but ALL Shrimp.  Couldn't have been better
