This is relatively new, at least to us but well worth trying.  It's located in the Linq plaza near the new ferris wheel.  Lots of places to eat but let hubby pick and he wanted Mexican.  It's not Mexican in the sense of the word that we normally in the US think of that type of food.  While they have tacos and typical sounding food, it's anything but typical.

We went twice while we were in Vegas, the first night by accident, the second was planned.  First night both of us had tacos.  Hubby had lobster tacos which had a deep fried batter and came with rice and beans.  He said they were really good and since there were three of them he was a happy camper.  I had grilled shrimp tacos, yummy as well.  Knew I couldn't eat all the tacos so ate one with the tortilla and the other two I ate the filling out of them.   We also got guacamole which was amazing.  It has pomegranate seeds which sounds strange but is really really good.  Many different types of margaritas yum.  One of the best I'd had lately.

Second time we went back we decided to try enchiladas.  Hubby got pork and I got sweet corn.  Even though the tortillas are smaller than what you buy in the store and I'm thinking are home made, the dishes all come with four enchiladas and neither one of us could eat all our meal, especially since we had more guacamole.

We ordered margaritas and when they came, they literally tasted horrible.  We called the server over, she tasted one and wrinkled her nose.  Apparently the bartender who made them was new and didn't know his stuff.  She went to a different bartender and got us new drinks and said she had the new bartender pour a bit in a cup so she could taste and make sure it was all it was supposed to be.  Talk about great service.
