GOOD inexpensive tacos. They have three separate ordering lines dependent of the type of meat you are ordering. Large seating area, kept clean. We all enjoyed our tacos, we had carne, beef, pork and spicy pork along with the carne asada fries. We all devoured each bite! I would recommend this place if you are looking for some good tasty not overly priced tacos. The staff all had a smile on their faces and seemed to enjoyed what they are all doing. The Tacos are made right in front of you.
