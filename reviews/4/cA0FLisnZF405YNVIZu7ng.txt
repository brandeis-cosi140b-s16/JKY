I don't really know what to consider this place, not quite a sit down but not really fast food either. I should say I have never actually dined in we have always ordered take out but I've never seen any table service the handful of times I've been in. The food here is good, simple and fresh. However one major suggestion if your ordering take out, always check your boxes before you leave. I learned the hard way after having my order messed up 3 out of 4 times. Other than that it's good food with reasonable prices.
