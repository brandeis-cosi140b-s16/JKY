I was unsure about this place but decided to give it a try. Price was not bad, service was good, but holy crap were they busy. Took us thirty plus minutes to get seated, the place is tiny. I had the combo fajitas, no complaints. More than enough food, not stingy on the tortillas, and the taste was fantastic. I will give this a few more tries before I make a final review, as the majority of the reviewers have had inconsistent results here.
