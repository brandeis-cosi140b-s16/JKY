I've been to this little gem two times now and would love to recommend it to anyone!  The one thing I will say is that while a lot of the standard Mexican dishes are on the menu, they definitely have a different feel than most, even authentic, Mexican restaurants.  I have ordered the Huaraches and the Quesadillas and they were both excellent.  

All of their dishes are served in a green sauce, which I could see some people being more excited about than others.  Keep in mind the sauce is delicious, as is their salsa verde which comes complimentary with some chips before your meal.

All in all, with the excellent and helpful wait staff, this place was great.  The only thing that keeps it from five stars is the fact that the dishes seem similar as they all come fried and served in the sauce.
