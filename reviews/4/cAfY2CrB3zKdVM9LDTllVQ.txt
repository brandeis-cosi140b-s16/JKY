This is a great new addition to the neighborhood. I visit pretty regularly and it's one of the very few places I order new things each time. 

I have enjoyed all of the Dominican style meats and other new variations on traditional Mexican food. 

Great beer selection and the staff are always very friendly to my daughter and I. 

Highly recommend this place.
