This was my first Zaba's that I ever visited and the experience was a great one. The employee behind the counter was kind enough to assist me with ordering my first Zaba's burrito. You go through the line like you would through a Subway or Chiptole. Tell the first person in line what kind of entree you want to order: a burrito, bowl, taco, salad, or quesadilla. Afterwards, you choose the kind of rice, beans, vegetables or not, potatoes, salsa, and condiments you want to put on. My first time and possibly my usual includes a burrito with a whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, black beans, fajita vegetables, sweet potatoes, pico de gallo, corn, and cheese. They stuffed my burrito to say the least, which I have no complaints about! Their chips are actually very delicious and crispy. Not a bit of staleness in their chips and it is covered with a hint of lime. The added flavor makes the chips enjoyable to eat even by itself! They are much better than store bought tortilla chips. The best part is that they have a rewards program, one perk over Chipotle that will definitely make me come back, as well as for the sweet potato! Overall a great experience and definitely not my last visit! And also as a bonus tip, you get double points on Sunday's, so you will get two points for every entree you order. Just letting you know :)
