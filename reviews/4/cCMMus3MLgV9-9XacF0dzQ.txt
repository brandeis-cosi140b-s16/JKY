What I love about this place is that it is Mexican-INSPIRED.grill. This is a key word because they have a great mix of authentic Mexican and other Latin dishes and some that are more tex-mex. 

Here is where I go when I am craving fish tacos! They are absolutely deliciosos - topped with fresh mango bits, cilantro and chipotle sauce. Mouth-watering!They definitely kick Cabo Fish Taco's butt. Also, they get extra coolness points for having Honduran dishes such as the flautas and fried green plantains (the latter may not necessarily be Honduran but we definitely eat those like crazy...it's probably more of a Caribbean staple)! Give these a try next time you visit. The tortas are also delicious. 

Service is good and so is their decor - simple, a blend of Latin influences. They are in an interesting locale because they are connected to Kickstand, which is more of sports bar. I don't get it but it doesn't bother me. Need to remember to ask why next time I go.They have outside covered seating that would be ideal during the summertime. 

To put it in yelp's words - Yay! I'm a fan of this place.
