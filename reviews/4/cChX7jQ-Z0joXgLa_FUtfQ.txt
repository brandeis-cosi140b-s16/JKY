First off .... if you've heard the rumors that the donkey is closing, please note that it's not true!!!!!  They are alive and well.

Let's get down to business.

One of the very best happy hour joints in the entire valley with an outstanding staff, combined with aoutstanding menu.

The Cantina shooters ($5 happy hour) are sick and are so good, they need to be outlawed.

The $5 happy hour chips and salsa is close to a meal by itself and it comes with 3 different salsa's.  Delisssssh! 

The beer and wine offering may not be the biggest in the valley but believe me, it's more than adequate. 

This is not a sports bar but they do have one tv at the bar ..... hurry as seating is limited.

Give this place a try and I'm betting you won't be disappointed.

Thanks for reading ....
