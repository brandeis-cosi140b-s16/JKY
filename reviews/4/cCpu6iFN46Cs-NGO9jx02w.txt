It's been three hours since I ate Blanco and I'm still so full. It was my first time there and I can't wait to go back. I had the chips as an appetizer with salsa, mildly spiced, and delicious queso, also quite mild. The guacamole was good- although I do prefer to have it a little spicier. For my main course I had the beef enchiladas with braised short rib. It came out with an authentic Mexican presentation in a hot skillet. I had it with a side of their rice and street corn. Wow that stuff is seriously addicting. I only ate half of everything because I was beyond full. The sangria wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely added a nice touch to the meal. Can't wait to go back and try more....after I finish these leftovers!
