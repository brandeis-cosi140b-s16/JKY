I thought I have written a review already, but nope! OK, this is my 3rd trip to Raul and Theresa's. The first time, food and service was good. The second time, food was just bl-eh and service was good. Third time, both food and service was excellent. Gloria is the bomb!! Woot woot... 

I had the chimi again and Gloria asked if I wanted it with sauce and cheese on top (the first 2 times, they never asked). It was VERY good with the extras on top, WOW!!!. The queso dip with shredded beef was AWESOME!!!! I could not stop eating it. The chips just kept coming!!! Hubby ordered a steak picado with corn tortilla, he LOVED it.
