This place is the cat's ass. It's cheap, the food is pretty good, the service is great, and it's just a good place to watch a game. It is never going to get 3 Michelin stars, but it certainly deserves better than some under-21 year-old vegetarian saying that it's gross. It's a bar that serves cheap tacos, what do you expect?
