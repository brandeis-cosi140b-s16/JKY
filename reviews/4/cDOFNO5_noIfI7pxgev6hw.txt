My new favorite joint! $15 worth of food fed three people, including drinks and chips, and left me so full that I couldn't even drink a beer after wards. 
Wasn't impressed by the bean burrito, but the meat was fantastic-soft and packed with flavor. 
I agree with Paco-you're here to eat, not fixate on parking; this isn't Ahwatukee.
