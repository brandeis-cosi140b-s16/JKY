The food quality and price is much better than Chipotle who has a "take we give you and like it attitude."  I was greeted properly when I arrived, and at the order counter and thanked at the cash register.  If the beans weren't undercooked, I would have given them 5 starts.  I first tried them in Cali last weekend.  I wish they had more locations or one closer, but this was worth driving for.  With price, quality, and better customer service, Q Doba is "hands down" MUCH better than Chipotle, any day!
