Me and my girlfriend ate here again last night for probably the 5th time in the last few months. I must say they are are humming along. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the fajitas and an order of tacos. Both were great portions with amazing flavor. The service was great and the drinks tasted even better. I recommend trying their fogon Margarita or their raspberry margarita. We will be back soon you can certainly count on that!
