This place is a gem.  4.5 stars.  I have driven by many times without stopping.  It surprised me how good it was.  Very fresh and authentic, hole in the wall type of place, complete with the mix and match chairs and tables.  The menu on the wall with pictures of the entrees and hand written specials taped up all over the place.  Reminds me of the little taco shops near the border in San Diego.  
I ordered the steak chimi and it was great.  The chunks of steak were very tender and flavorful and it had just the right amount of refried beans inside and was topped with a ribbon of sourcream and guac as well as fresh chopped tomato, green onion, cilantro, and cheese....all in the right amounts.  Chips were still warm from being cooked.  Only negative was I like getting salsa in a small dish, and they hand you two tubes (one red and one green....green was best I thought).  So you basically squeeze some on each chip instead of dipping.  Will definitely be going back.
