Thank you Yelp (and Misti Y) for helping the better half and I find this place.  I don't really know "Authentic" Mexican, but if this place isn't, they are the best fakers on earth.

It was very busy at lunchtime, and we were certainly bumbling around trying to figure out what to order.  But we finally settled on the Tacos de Adobada.   They are rather small, so we each got 3.  I could have easily seen eating more if you were hungry, but we felt pretty satisfied.

They have a huge rack of Pork complete with Pineapple dripping down onto it, and it is hand cut as well as the Tortillas are being hand made right before your eyes!

I'm knocking off 1 star because for some reason we ended up with canned Diet Soda even though they have fountain Coke. Not sure why they did this to me, but I didn't notice it until it was too late.  Don't get duped.

Otherwise, seriously this place is fantastic!
