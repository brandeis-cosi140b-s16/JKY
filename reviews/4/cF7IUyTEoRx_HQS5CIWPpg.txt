4.5 stars-- why aren't there half stars??!!

C4 was really good.  I had the bacon cheese burger and it was cooked to my exact request.  My dinner guests had the chorizo mac n cheese and that was really really good!  We had the appetizer of the chips and 3 dips, this was a bit lacking in taste.  I wanted to try the crab cakes, I should have.

Dessert was the lemon TART-- let me put an emphasis on the TART part, it was very very tart.  Not my thing, but it was my guests thing, they really liked it.  We also tried the bread pudding-- this was very tasty and we enjoyed it.

Our server, Shannon, was nice.  She had obviously tried the food and was able to talk about all the items on the menu.  This was nice to hear.    We went around 6:30 and it was quiet but by the time we were done, there were many other diners in the restaurant.

After our yummy dinner we went up to the rooftop to take a look, it is really really cool!  I am so looking forward to having some drinks up there very soon in the awesome weather we are having right now.

The pool area is beautiful, it looks like something out of a movie.  

We had a chance to talk with Ben, he is personable, knowledgeable about he hotel, he was very open and honest-- we liked him.  Got a good vibe off him.

Planning on coming back and bring the friends with for some good food, drinks and atmosphere.
