Too sad that I've moved away from Roberto's Taco Shop territory. I lived just around the block from this location and hunger pangs were usually cured by Roberto's. I only ever really get one or two things from here when I go, but consistency is what I liked! The meat in the burritos are a little tough sometimes or overcooked, so I hardly get those but Roberto's is my go-to for carne asada fries. Extra cheese and ask for some jalapenos before I drive off and I'm good to go. Best carne asada fries I've had in the valley.
