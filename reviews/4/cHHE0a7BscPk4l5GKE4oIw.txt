My favorites here are the fish taco lettuce wraps, wings and bulgogi fries.  The fish tacos just taste so fresh and light.  The wings are fried crispy, juicy and tossed in slightly spicy kimchee sauce  The fries are piled high with cheese, pico and salsa and shredded bulgogi.  Service is always friendly and the latest time we went, the food came out really fast.  We could hear the wings drop into the fryer back in the kitchen.  This is a casual, low keyed neighborhood place with some really tasty food.
