We've been going here for 5 years and have never had a bad experience.  The food is good, the drinks are tasty, and as someone else described, the restaurant is spacious yet intimate.  

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is that I think it's a bit overpriced.  The prices for the a la carte menu seem appropriate for two of a particular item but you only get one.  Also, while it says "upscale mexican food" on the door, I don't think this is accurate.  We very much enjoy the food, but it is your standard Mexican menu.  Their red sauce is delish!
