was in Las vegas for the labor day weekend, arrived here
 really hungry. I was with 2 of my buddies and we all decided
 to go with the Nachos. These were probably the best nachos 
i've had in a while. Tortilla chips , with beans, Carne asada, 
Cheese, Tomato, & Guacamole . These nachos were 
enough for the three of us..we were so full after words..will 
definitely come here again. Its Cheap and will satisfy your needs..
service is fast..and OPEN 24 Hours!!!
