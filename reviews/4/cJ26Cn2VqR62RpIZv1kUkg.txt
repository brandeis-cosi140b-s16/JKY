Great neighborhood restaurant.  There were a lot of menu options; however, I decided on a carne asado burrito.  They added guacamole on the burrito which made the burrito even more enjoyable.  I was impressed that it was ready even before I filled up my soda.  I loved the burrito and thrilled that it did not have a lot of rice or beans added, just the carne asado.  I will definitely be back.
