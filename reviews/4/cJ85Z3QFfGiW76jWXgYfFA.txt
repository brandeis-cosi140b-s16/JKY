I am a HUGE fan of this place! So, let's just say this place is not fancy.  It is tacos and burritos and the prices are great.  Honestly, it is hard to find a simple, traditional taco in Madison. This place satisfies all those needs. 

The location is strange. It is in a strip mall on Stoughton. Kind of annoying to get to, BUT they are open SEVEN days a week. They are pretty quick and like I said the food is delicious and affordable.
