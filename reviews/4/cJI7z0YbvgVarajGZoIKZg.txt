I went get a few months ago and I'm sure glad I did.  It is so yummy.  I had the spicy meat taco and it was good.  Came back a few weeks later and got a burrito, it was so good and much better than Chipolte.  
My only complaint is that they need to explain what the meat it. Majority of it I have never heard of and maybe get a wider range of soda or add tea to drink.  
Overall a great and inexpensive place to eat yummy tacos or burritos and street corn. Open late
