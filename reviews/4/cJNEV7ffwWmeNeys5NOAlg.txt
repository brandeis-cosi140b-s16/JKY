It was a good lunch experience there, nice location, lots of people, and nice waitress who would suggested you to order less because of their big portion. I went there for fortune cookie 2 but changed my mind last minute, probably because of paella. So, they do have paella, but I have to say the scallop and mussel were a bit over salted.....Anything else was good, I liked the idea that they put avocado in paella.
