Our first visit to Taco Guild was fantastic. As I'm sure other reviewers have noted, the restaurant is an old renovated church with high ceilings and a classic and vintage feel. The atmosphere is warm and the servers are well dressed and generally attractive, lighting is low and the bathrooms are unique and clean. Overall the establishment is top notch. As far as the food went... phenomenal. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it's on the pricey side for street style tacos- but they're definitely more on the gourmet side and worth it for a nice outing.
