Taco, Burrito, What's that in your Speedo?  Oh wait, sorry different gig.  Simply put THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.  24/7 tacos?  I'm in love.  I wasn't looking for a big meal and found this place which isn't much to look at from the outside. 

Basically it's a trailer with a sun shade and a few benches.  Very simple menu tacos, burritos, quesadilla, beef or chicken.  I got 4 tacos (2) beef, (2) chicken.  The young lady asked me if cheese and guacamole was OK?  Damn right sister!!!  Anyhoo, they have a fresh salsa area with homemade salsa, and pico all were great accompaniments to my dinner.  Tacos were wonderfully seasoned and well put together.  

Excellent food at a great price!!!
