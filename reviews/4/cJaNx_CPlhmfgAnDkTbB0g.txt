Went for dinner here on a Friday night. Had a bit of confusion to start the evening (the hostess forgot about us) but the manager comped our appetizer for being forgotten I'm the lounge. We had the jalape√±o bean dip. Thought it would be spicier but still delicious. Next I had Tacos carbon. Very tasty and well prepared. Wife had a combo plate and she liked it has well. All in all, a solid visit. I'll be back!
