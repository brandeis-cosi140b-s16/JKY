We visited Filiberto's for the first time today for lunch.  My wife and I got burritos.... carnitas and beef.  We cut 'em in two, so we each had a 'combo plate'.  :)  It was an impressive amount of meat for the cost, no doubt!!  The burritos were VERY tasty and ... OMG.... filling!  The nice thing is that Filiberto's doesn't use rice and beans to fill the burrito, like some other places.  It was filled with tons of meat and a few peppers. 

Great selection of goodies at the Salsa Bar, too!

We will definitely be going back for another visit!!
