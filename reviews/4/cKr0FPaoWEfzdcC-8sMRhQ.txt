We went here kind of in a drive by sort of way looking for a BBQ place in Madison while we were on a short job.  The staff were SO friendly and the food was really quite good.  We had the brisket sandwich and a chicken sandwich and weren't disappointed. 
The owner came by to talk to us and gave us directions to the best custard place which was a really nice touch.
