So I tried this place today and I was extremely impressed!  I'd had tortas before at a couple of the 'bertos places and while they were okay, they were nothing spectacular.  This place was delicious.  Everything on the menu sounded pretty good, but I ended up with the cubana torta and an alambre taco.  While the tacos was very small, it was very good.  The cubana torta was very good as well.  It was humongous!!!  I couldn't even finish the whole thing and I'm a girl that can eat, trust me, I'm from Texas!!!  It was full of meat and it had lots of avocado on it, which I loved.  Let me just warn you about the avocado looking sauce on the salsa bar.  That stuff is hot.  It's good, but it's very, very hot!  Just looking at it, you would think it wold be a mild sauce since it looks like a creamy avocado, but believe me, this is not for people that can't stand the heat!  It took me aback for a second because I seriously wasn't expecting that type of heat.  I still have a bit of sweat on my brow from it right now as I type this review.  Overall, this place is very good and I can't wait to try the quesadillas because they look pretty darn good themselves.  I also have to say the people that work there are very nice and friendly as well.  Bottom line, this place is excellent and I will definitely go back in the near future!
