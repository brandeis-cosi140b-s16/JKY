Before my husband and I went to the theater, we decided to try Chinita's. The restaurant is very inviting and the servers were friendly. 
We just wanted to share a meal, so we had the fajitas. They were very good and it was the perfect amount for us. My husband loves the salsa and even got some to go..
We go out to eat a lot and thought the price was reasonable.
We will be back!
