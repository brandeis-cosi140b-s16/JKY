I love LA's Kogi truck and have been going through withdrawals looking for something comparable in Las Vegas.  Well, that search is finally over because KoMex's fusion tacos has filled that void.  And it's even better because it isn't on wheels and it is much cheaper. My husband and I ordered the beef, pork, and chicken fusion tacos and they were surprisingly very filling because the corn tortilla was exploding with marinated meat goodness.  

I also ordered the fusion bulgogi burrito and upon first bite, it reminded me of late drunken nights and midnight runs to Jose Bernstein's in Westwood.  Although KoMex serves the kimchi on the side instead of inside the burrito like I am used to- it was a burst of  flavors that melded so perfectly well.  Who knew that Mexican rice, bulgogi, cilantro, onions, pico de gallo, lettuce, and asian sauce nestled inside a flour tortilla would be a match made in heaven.  

The wait for our food was quite long (but at least we had a basket of chips and salsa to avert the grumpiness induced by hunger pains).  We placed our order "to-go", but we learned our lesson and will call in our order in advance next time...and there will DEFINITELY be a next time. Besides, I must try the chinese food on the menu too!
