Food was decent, menu is HUGE... A little pricey for Mexican but I will return. Very slow service and the restaurant wasn't packed... Our server was more concerned with cleaning and ignoring us than seeing if we needed anything....hopefully she's new to the serving world and not really that neglectful of her patrons.. Not fantastic but not horrible either...we will see how the next visit goes :)
