I'ma keep this simple.  I only come here on Tuesdays for their 1.50 fish tacos. 

fresh, delicious, and always hits the spot.

I like up dress up my tacos with their assorted sauces and sides.  Always a good choice after a workout.

They have forever earned my business with their customer service and demeanor.
