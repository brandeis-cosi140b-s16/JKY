Good place for breakfast.  I've never had a bad meal here.  It's very much on the brink of becoming a "trendy" snottsdale place.  They have good food.  They recently started doing alcohol.  The french toast is good and their bloody mary mix is VERY GOOD.  Oh, their COFFEE is like THE best coffee I've ever had.  The only downside (for me) is the hangover crowd on Sunday Mornings.  Lots of FO-HAWKS and trendy looking tools.  :)
