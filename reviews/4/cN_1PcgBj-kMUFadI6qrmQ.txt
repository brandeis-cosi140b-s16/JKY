Reviews of this place are all over the board, but I always eat there when I do my yearly Scottsdale gallery crawl. The food and ambience, a series of indoor and outdoor patio rooms, are quaint and very satisfying, with good size portions, and a very friendly staff. At least to me they are. I was last there in late November and had the days special, enchiladas in a poblano sauce which was quite good. The salsa is spiced just right.
