You know how when you were a lil kid, you wanted to go to McDonalds and get a happy meal? Well, I rather have Taco Bell instead. Weird huh? I think that I've always been a big fan because of the cheesy goodness. My favorites are the pintos and cheese, nachos supreme and chicken soft taco. Sometimes I stray and get a Mexican pizza, but other than that I keep it simple. I've never been here for dine in, but the drive thru service is pretty quick. I will be back for sure.
