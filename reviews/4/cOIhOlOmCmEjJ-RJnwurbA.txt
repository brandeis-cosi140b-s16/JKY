Oh, yummmm.  She thought the tortilla soup was delicious, and He found the albandigos soup was the flavor he had been seeking since Yuma in the 60's.  It is definitely a family atmosphere....four babies at the next table, but but good-natured and comfortable.  We will come back again when we are in the area.  Don't pass up the chocolate chimis!  Follow-up:  We did get back, on our next trip, and She had the soup again.  Great food, but that marguerita was  MONSTER....had to take a l-o-n-g walk after dinner!
