So pleased with my evening here. The ambience at The Yard is delightful. The food at Barrio is excellent- very fresh, authentic yet contemporary. For example- I had the Enchiladas Urbanas which had excellent tomatillo sauce, and had an unexpected sprinkling of pine nuts. The cochinita pibil featured melt in your mouth pork. Our server was very attentive and offered to refill my water several times. In addition, other staff stopped by to see how we were faring. Yes the prices were a higher than standard Mexican fare, but I felt it was reasonable given the location, inspired menu and quality of the ingredients used.

If you are into fine tequila and mescal, they have a great selection. If you're not there yet, here's an opportunity to expand your horizons!
