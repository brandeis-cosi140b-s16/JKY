I'm one of those 75/25 eaters.  I try to eat healthy 75% of the time and I would be happy eating at Filibertos the other 25%!  I must have Latin blood in me because I CRAVE this food!!!  I've had dreams about greasy mexican food like this!!!  Seriously, the green chile burrito is the BOMB.  And I swear, it's not even that greasy....just delicious morsels of pork in a perfect green sauce and not too spicy (I have acid reflux, so this place can create serious pain!)   Where can you get such an authentic, delicious meal for $4.00?  I know I'm a fan :)
