I was headed to the hotel next door and asked the van driver if there were any good places to eat nearby.  He recommended Tres Pesos, he said the food was great and the bartenders were hot! OK, a must check out in my book. I have been twice.  Filling is the word.  Food is pretty good. Not going to knock your socks off but it is tasty and seems fresh.  Portions are large.  Great beers, good atmosphere.  Yes actually, my two bartenders have been very pleasant to look at as well!
