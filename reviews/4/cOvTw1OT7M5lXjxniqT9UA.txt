Husband-o and I needed some cheap good eats for dinner after I returned from a business trip.  Scanned the Yelp and were not disappointed by Morenos.  Though not the absolute best Mexican food in the Phoenix/Rural/Metro Area, it is the best in Tempe.  
Started with the requisite chips and salsa.  Despite having to pay for them, they were worth the $2.49 and they brought us a free refill of the hot, perfectly crispy and salty appetizers.  Salsa had good smokey flavor and the right kick of heat.
I got the #2 combo with a chicken taco and a beef burro.  The taco was a bit small, but very similar to those you'd actually find in Mexico on the street carts.  Beans and rice were pretty run of the mill, nothing spectacular, but definitely tasty.  The burro was great.  The best part was the steak, though it was more a chopped beef than a shredded (which I personally prefer), but the right-off-the-char grilled flavor was intense and very savory.  The tortilla was better than most, but you can find better in Central Phoenix if you want to make the trek.  
Husband-o got the beef chimi and was very happy with it.  The guac was better than average.
Overall atmosphere is very laid back and Tempe-esque.  Service was great (though there weren't many patrons to serve...was Thursday at 7pm).  Looks like they had a good selection of Mexican beer and a fun variety of margaritas.
The value is great, too.  I, who rarely have leftovers, took home a box with half the meal, as did Husband-o.  Total bill was $19.
Another great asset, you can opt for table service, but can also just order right at the counter!
