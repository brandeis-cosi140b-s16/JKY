I have been going to this restaurant for a very long time. They are always a good standby for us whenever we want good Mexican breakfast or a quick dinner. They give you 3 types of salsa with your chips and always are willing to refill when you run out. The waitress service is very consistent and attentive to your needs. The eggs with green chili are my favorite with the sauce being very flavorful. I also enjoy the chili relleno, again very good flavor. This last visit, I shared the chicken fajitas with my daughter and we had more than enough for left overs. The only complaint is the the tortillas could be softer, rather than breaking apart as you try to fold them.
