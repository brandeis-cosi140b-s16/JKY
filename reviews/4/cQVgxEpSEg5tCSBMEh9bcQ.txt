Between Fuel and Fuddle and this place, I have no idea which I like better. Best time to go to avoid long wait time is to go right before the kitchen closes (around 1am). They turn on the lights around closing time which kind of kills the atmosphere, but if you're only there for the food/drinks, the later the better.

Food Recommendations:

Pepita Hummus
Southwestern Wings
Shrimp Mushroom Spinach Quesadillas - kind of on the salty side
Blue Cornbread
