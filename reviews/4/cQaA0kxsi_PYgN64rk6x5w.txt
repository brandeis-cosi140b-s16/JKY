As a native of Arizona, I have been exposed to all kinds of mexican food, good and bad.  T&M is consistently very good.  Their tacos are meaty, enchiladas are tasty, and my favorite dish, loaded nachos, are the bomb!  I oredered a couple dozen tamales at christmas, and they were HUGE, and full of moist tender meat.  The owners and their staff are very friendly, and they have a loyal repeat clientele.
