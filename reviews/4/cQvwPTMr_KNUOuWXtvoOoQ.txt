While wandering through the Shoppes at Mandalay Bay, I stopped into Lush for a few products, which my husband knew could take an hour (LOVE Lush).  While he waited, he stopped into Hussong's across the mall, and it couldn't have been a happier accident!  After finishing up shopping, I met him for the tail end of happy hour - half price drafts and half price nachos - amazing.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was dry witted and friendly, and we also saw him concoct some super strong margaritas!

The chicken nachos themselves were something that I'm going to be fantasizing about for months to come.  The chips were thick, the chicken was well seasoned, and the toppings were perfectly distributed across the platter.  We consider ourselves Mexican food aficionados, and these were the Holy Grail of nachos.  

A few friends met us the next day and we convinced them to come back for lunch, and everyone was very satisfied!  This time we split the mango habanero guac and the ribeye tacos at the suggestion of our previous bartender and were very impressed.  

Definitely a great place for happy hour and to watch a game!  This will be on our Vegas list next time we're back!
