Great food, friendly staff.  What stood out to me is when a dining partner spilled his beverage when they were bringing the food, he knocked my food onto my lap.  They promptly brought another plate without us having to ask.  

Inexpensive, but tasty.  Try the chorizo tacos.  Their tortillas are really good.  It's not a fancy dining experience - food comes in plastic baskets and a piece of wax paper - but it's a great value.
