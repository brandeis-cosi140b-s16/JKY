I was able to enjoy two nights here in the upstairs lounge after a fun-filled day at Moorea Beach. First night I had peach lemonade (too acidic) and the Quinoa Fritters which were excellent. Attention to plating and care in food prep is evident. Second night I had the Chicken Tinga Empanadas and a Cosmo. Drink was delightful and correctly balanced so that not any one ingredient was evident. Empanadas were light, flaky and not the usual "hand pies" one comes to expect. Pumpkin Seed Mole was perfectly seasoned and the appropriate viscosity to thoroughly enjoy. Even caught myself dipping a few remaining chips!
