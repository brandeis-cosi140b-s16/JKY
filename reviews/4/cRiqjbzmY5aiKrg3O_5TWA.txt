Very cute local taco stand! The workers were super friendly and made us feel welcomed. My only warning is: be careful which toppings you put in! There are several sauce choices and some are SUPER, and I repeat SUPER spicy. It'd be great if they were labeled for customers who aren't familiar with the sauces. Other than that, very good & affordable! Will definitely return.
