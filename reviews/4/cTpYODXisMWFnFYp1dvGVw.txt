This place took over what used to be Baja Taco. The food is very similar to Roberto's and the price is practically the same. The food and service is always top notch, so if you're ever in the area, stopping by wouldn't hurt. This place is basically a Roberto's with a drive-thru and their delicious signature habanero sauce.
