OK, i love the Barrio, but really it is due to there sangria an homemade table side guacamole food is good but i think it is a little pricey for what you get to be honest... it can get loud and hard to hear whom your dining with at times and if you do have to waitI pity you especially right now when it is hot...Go for a late nite sangria or 3!! an some home made guacamole, good for that, ohhh or if your into Tequila they have the BEST selection in town
