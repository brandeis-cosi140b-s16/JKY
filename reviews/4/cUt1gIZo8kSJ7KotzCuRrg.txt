Looking for some late night grub, we stumbled across this taco shop chain on Blue Diamond.  The employees seem a little tired or lifeless, but what do you expect at a 24-hour joint!  Regardless, we were content after our meal, and had a great morning sleep.

Out of all the items we ordered, my least favorite...even though I devoured the whole thing...was the taco de lengua.  Tongue lacked some flavor and wasn't tender enough. The taco was bigger (in size and cost) than what I'm used to.   

Their chicken taco (crunchy shell) was a lot better....with a peppery taste and loads of cheese.  The Horchata was just okay for me...I had better.  But why complain when the Mexican drinks are bottomless like the other fountain drinks!?

My favorite was the Carne Asada nachos, with a mountain of flavorful asada, cheese, cilantro, tomatoes, guacamole, and beans (we opted for no sour cream).  It was so good (and greasy), we ended up ordering another "mountain" to go. 
 
Up next....Carne Asada Fries!
