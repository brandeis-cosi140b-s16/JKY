The two things that keep this very good mexican restaurant from graduating from Arizona mex to authentic Mexican food are gringo cheese instead of Mexican queso & limones along side the yellow lemons on the salsa bar. These two things & using bag-in-the-box instead of brewed iced tea prevent me from giving it more than a 4 star rating.

The chili in the chili relleno was excellent. With queso panela, Chihuahua, or Oaxaca it would be stupendous. The four salsas were all very good to excellent.

If I were in the neighborhood limited on time, I wouldn't hesitate to eat here, otherwise i'd head to the Taquitos Jalisco on Gilbert Rd.  It's the real deal. If you're at the Gilbert restaurant & feeling adventurous, try their birria (shredded goat stew). It's to die for.
