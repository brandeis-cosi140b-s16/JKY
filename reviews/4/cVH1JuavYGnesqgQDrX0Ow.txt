First time here and didn't know it was restaurant week. The food was amazing. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. The service was impeccable. The reason I am giving 4 stars vs. 5 is because of the drinks. My boyfriend's margarita was all ice and very little tequila ($11). My handcrafted cocktail with Tito's tasted like straight club soda with a splash of cherry juice ($9). Both were very lame. My advice would be to stick to bottled beer or wine.
