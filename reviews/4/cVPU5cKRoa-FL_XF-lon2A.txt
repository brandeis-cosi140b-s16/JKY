There is nothing better than spending a Saturday with a good friend, good food and a margarita to spice it up! ;)
My friend Ale had never been to this restaurant so I decided to take her there. After I gave her a quick tour through the menu she decided to order the steak (rajas) which comes in a red chile sauce (pasilla and ancho chiles) with the steak, poblano chiles and chihuahua cheese on top, it was presented in a cute iron skillet. My friend liked it. I ordered my favorite one, plato caribeno (chicken), small chicken pieces with red, yellow and green bell peppers, the sauce it is sweet and tangy with pineapple undertones, the accompaniments are rice, black beans, small piles of salad with diced pineapple and sweet plantains. I loved the combination, it screams Caribbean! For me it's a piece of my dear country in my mouth because this restaurant is not 100% mexican, it has some Caribbean influences. I recommend this place, it has a homey feeling once you are inside.
