This Chipotle is in the Premium Outlet Shopping Center (near Outback, Chilis, etc.). They offer the typical beer selection along with margaritas (heck yea!). Ordered myself a steak burrito which tastes exactly how Chipotle should taste.

My only complaint is from some woman working behind the counter. One of the guys was putting my order into the register and another guest came up beside me to ask the woman for some chips. The woman, simply standing there beside the man helping me, yells at the guy to bag up some chips. He packaged them while we stood there and, as he went to hand the chips to the guest, she rudely snatched the bag from him and handed them over to the guest herself. Obviously there's some major tension there. Needless to say I was baffled that this behavior was displayed in front of paying customers. If I visit this location again and see similar behavior I'll be sure to speak with a manager.
