I ordered one of the day's specials - pork Veracruz.  It was tender, juicy, cubed pork loin with raisins, onions, olives, and tomatoes.  It was a great sauce and I wish I had some bread to sop up the juices left after everything was gone.  I finished it like I would any tasty broth.

Dessert was an order of cream filled churros.  They came with a side of ice cream drizzled with caramel and chocolate.  Delicious!

The restaurant is really a comfortable place.  Service was very good.  The man and woman helped each other and they were very pleasant and polite.  This was my first visit, but it won't be my last.

Make sure you check the specials board when you come in the door.
