Excellent Mexican food, would highly recommend.

Went on a Monday afternoon, Margarita Mondays, so the Margaritas were half price.  They were very good, strong, tasty and refreshing.  

For appetizer we had the guacamole, which they made at the table, always a plus.  The combination of spices, pomegranate seeds and avocado was excellent, a bit too much lime juice as it was kind of runny, but was still very tasty.

For the entree, we had the 3 tacos for $10, and went for the pork, which came highly recommended by our waiter, who was very good.  Carnitas were excellent, chorizo also dynamite (we actually had the chorizo with a fried egg on top, awesome) and the brisket was also excellent.  Fish was good, but not as good as the pork or beef, stick to the pork or beef when you go there, they are much better.

For dessert we split a churro, which was incredible, came with a caramel dipping sauce that was to die for.

Overall the food was excellent, price was reasonable and service was good.  Only thing preventing this from getting 5 stars was that the Guacamole was a little bit runny and the service at first was slightly slow, other than that, dynamite.  I'd definitely go back.
