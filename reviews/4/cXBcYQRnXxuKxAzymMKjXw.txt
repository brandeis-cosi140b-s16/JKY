This place seems virtually unknown, but I'd say it's a hidden gem.  

My only complaint is it's very tacky inside, but I can overlook that part.  The staff is super friendly and attentive--almost too attentive.  (I felt like I was a Martian for so often not needing anything else when they asked.)

I've been a couple of times.  The standouts are a very tender pork with green chile; chicken mole negro, and a chile relleno with Mexican white cheese and a spicy cream sauce.
