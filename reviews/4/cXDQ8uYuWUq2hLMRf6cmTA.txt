Oh Rio! You are delicious. I really enjoy burritos, quesadillas, salads with tortilla strips, and yada yada. I could spend forever telling you the food is delicious.  I know this place is a little pricey, burrito + drink =9.99, but their portions are monstrous. I cannot pick up my burrito and eat it like your suppose to. Nor would I even want to sit next to someone who tries to eat the whole burrito from here without cutting it up in pieces. They give a good amount of food for the price they charge I think. Their process of taking your order too is pretty efficient. When I first came here when they opened, everyone was excited to be there and they answered all my questions about "Whats that?", "Whats this?, etc.  They were patient and the staff is usually still excited to be there. During lunch time I would never go, unless your dead serious about having Cafe Rio right then and there. Only because everyone and their mom is there at noon. I usually go around 2pm and get out in 5-10min. You can sit outside and in, and a massive favorite of mine is their ice. They have Sonic style baby cubed ice and I love that! Its my favorite kind of ice! :) 

The one bad thing and it could totally be just me, but their enchiladas kind of suck to me. I have had better. But their quesadillas are my favorite so far.
