The Mission is a great place to come for a fancier Mexican meal. The atmosphere is trendy and fun, there are a ton of drink options, and the food is quite good. I had:

- Tableside Guacamole: Rather overpriced at $12 for 1 avocado's worth of mush but perfectly delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and it had the prefect amount of citrus, garlic, cilantro, and spice. 
- Butternut Squash Tacos: Yummy! I was nervous that the squash would be too sweet but the flavors ended up working very well together and it was a satisfying savory dish. This is the only vegetarian entree, but I don't think vegetarians suffer with this delicious dish. It isn't all that big so definitely order an appetizer or additional side.
- White Bean Puree: Super delicious and kind of like an awesome mexican take on hummus. 
- Espresso Churros with Milkshake: Awesome dessert. I hate coffee flavored desserts and thankfully this one didn't taste a thing like espresso. The churros are warm and soft and taste good on their own or paired with the milkshake. The milkshake is basically a vanilla version of mexican hot chocolate with strong notes of cinnamon and other spices.

I definitely recommend the Mission as a place to bring a date, your girlfriends, your parents, basically anyone you like.
