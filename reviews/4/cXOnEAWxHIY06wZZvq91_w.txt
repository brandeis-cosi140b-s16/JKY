This place is awesome. Bartender was cool too. He served us our margaritas with beer. I didn't want the beer so he put two In my boyfriends margarita. We definitely used the groupon deal so make sure you do that. The mai tai was the best flavor! We didn't try the food but the place is just right inside the mini mall area but open environment.
