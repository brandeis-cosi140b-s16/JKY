Some things in life are all about timing... same goes for Johnny Burrito in uptown.  If you hit it at the right time, you are in and out in no time, otherwise there is a rather long time for the eats here.

Located in the College Street Shops, you can either enter from the College Street or most likely take the escalators downstairs from the Wells Fargo Atrium.  The shop is rather small, but every inch of space is used... You can tell they have been serving lunch uptown forever since they have it to where the line wraps outside of the shop and you make your way to the register, pay for your burrito, chips, what-have-you and then move on down the line to have whatever your heart desires or as the clerk at the register says, "You are the boss for the next min or so"  toppings glaore:  beans, meats, salsas, hot sauces.

If you get a drink they encourage you to come back and get yourself a refill, but since there isn't really a "close" place to eat your burrito or nachos, I am unsure on how many people actually take them up on their offer.  They also close at 3pm.

Time it just right at 11... and you are good to go... other wise you might as well wait until 1 or 2 to get your Johnny Burrito fix.
