When I lived in Arizona ( from age 5 to 30), I ate at La Parilla Suiza a lot, at several of their locations. This is the one closest to my childhood home, and I think it was the prettiest of the restaurants. My mamma and I used to eat lunch there. My dad and his third wife liked it too ( but not with my mom, of course).... anyway, ahem.

I love their melty cheese and mushroom appetizer, their chips and salsas, their tamales and enchiladas.. and the fajitas. 

In college a Latino friend of mine took me to eat fajitas at the one in Tucson near the U of A campus, and I was busy forking chicken and peppers into my tortilla ( daintily, like a lady) when he took my fork away, put a tortilla in my hand, and said "no, LIKE THIS!" and demonstrated how to grab the stuff in the tortilla.

 I have to admit, it was faster and more fun. 

The fajitas are typically really really good, across the board. 

I miss LPS and as much as I try to emulate their fajitas in my home, it's not the same. they do a great job. If you get to Phoenix or Tucson, give it a try. MMM. 

Oh, and the tortilla soup, to die for. Really.

P.S. They catered my dad's wedding to his wife, and the food was fabulous.
