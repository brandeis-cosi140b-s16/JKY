Mexican food has to be so-so because it is in an off strip casino right?  NO!

Since I can remember, I have had Mexican food all over So Cal and enough food in Mexico (away from tourist traps) to say that I was surprised at how good it was.

The service and the place itself is standard.  As far as the food, the flavor and freshness of the ingredients starts with the complimentary appetizers and goes right through all the dishes.  The fish tacos I had were delish, the side dish stuff--beans and rice, were good by themself.  The carnitas was absolutely delish.  Massive portions and with good flavor.  I have had them made in La Puente CA were they were great eventhough they were cooked in lard (lard makes it Hell for those on a diet, but "true" to its Mexican origin, and does a lot for the taste in a good way).  This did not have that deep fried coating--more like it was pressure cooked and tender, but still had the right pan-cooked taste.  It was just good with a nice flavor profile.

For the price, you can't beat it.
