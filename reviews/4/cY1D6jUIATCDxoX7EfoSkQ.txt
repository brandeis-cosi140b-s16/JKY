I freakin love the taco meat and fresh ingredients here! I go during lunch quite often for a mini burrito and have never had a problem other than dry chicken, so I switched to the ground beef and thank goodness I did! Order the beef burrito with amazing Mexican white cheese, and freshly sliced avocado. I get onions and sour cream too.  I also love the fresh, soft, chewy tortilla! Oh and I just tried the chips and salsa today and I love it! The salsa reminds me of the good stuff at Laredos or Casa del Sol. I have no idea why there's never a line at the drive thru. Which is why I'm yelping!
