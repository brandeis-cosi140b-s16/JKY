3.5 Stars.....Rounded up to 4....but....

I was so looking forward to trying this place as I have not found a really great Latino restaurant here in Charlotte. Well I'm not sure if I have yet....but I'll say that sone thibgs at Sabor Latin Grill are quite good....others....meh.

The good: Saboritas! See related pic. Basically this is a crunchy taco sandwich. It so reminded me of the Mexican street fod I had growing up in a Mexican neighborhood in my hometown of Chicago. I had the steak and it was covered in a delicious cheese sauce with onions and other spices. The steak had a great flavor. This really is Latin Street food! Highly recommend this dish.

Also the chips were fresh and their salsa bar had some nice choices. But BEFORE your tongue ventures into eating any of the habanero dips get some SOUR CREAM to put that fire out!

Guacamole was very fresh and delicious! 

The not so good: Quipe. This is basically a ball of deep fried meat. It's decent tasting but after a few bites I was like, ok....next? The accompanying rose salsa was reaaly good....reminded me of a Mexican version of that Japanese Yum Yum sauce. Very creamy and yummy....much better than the meatball.

Another MAJOR GRIPE is that the girl takung my order new very little about the food being served! Really? And half of the menu was not even available....no Gorditas nor Arepas! That's what I really wanted. Guess I'll try those next time.

So I'm still on a quest to find a truly GREAT Latino restaurant in Charlotte. Maybe Sabor is it....but the food has got to be available for me to even try it!

But their steak in any dish is really excellent!
