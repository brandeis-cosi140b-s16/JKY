I've been eating here for several years.  The food is always consistent and quality.  The salsa is fresh and they have several choices.  Their beans are great even though they don't use any lard, the same for the tortillas.  They offer wheat tortillas as a healthier option which actually are good.

I have had several dishes off their menu and have never had anything I didn't like.  I would definitely recommend the mexican pizza.  Its a lot of food and can be split between two adults.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the salpicon salad is awesome.   I prefer it with shredded beef. It comes served over a tostada shell smeared with beans, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, crumbled cheese, sour cream and guacamole.

I give this place 4 stars because the bathrooms at this location are small and a little janky.  They have outdoor seating, which is nice.  A couple of the guys that have worked here for years recognize me and my family and greet us every time we go here. 

A great, healthier alternative to the common "bertos."
