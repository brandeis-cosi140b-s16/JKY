La Fonda is my steady Mexican food joint in town. The best (Bar None) Chips and salsa in town..hands down. You will gorge yourself on the chips and salsa. The best red chili con carne. I never deviate from these two items..thats all I get. My wife likes the breakfast burrito, and a buddy swears by the albondigas soup. 

The margs are tasty but get the premium tequila (Patron). A pitcher is what I recommend.  If your into looks then this restaurant is not for you. I wouldn't be surprised to see things running across the floor. Its not fancy, some would call it a sty, but its all good in my book.
