Cool concept for a bar/club in Old Town Scottsdale. The Spanish Fly has a pool surrounded by a couple bars and cabanas. We ended our San Tan Brews Cruise here, so I haven't been on a regular night. It's really pretty, good music, and I believe they're open during the day as well for lounging and day drinking. It seems to cater to a younger "see and be seen" crowd if that's your flavor.
