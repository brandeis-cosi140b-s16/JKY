This is my casual quick and cheap go to.  It tastes SO GOOD.  Always consistent. I don't like other places similar to this one. I order the pork burrito, no rice, with sour
Cream, guacamole, and extra pico de gallo. The pork has a hint of sweetness. Everything tastes clean and well balanced. You can also get a stamp card of you frequent often. The one thing however I noticed last time.  The glass, the sneeze guard, was very dusty.  Should be mindful of that and clean often.  It's the one thing that customers are closest to and see right away. Everything else is pretty clean.
