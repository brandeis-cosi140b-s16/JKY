We had never tried this place, though it's close by, and I'm so glad we did. The food was delicious, light and fresh. Chicken enchiladas were packed with meat and the green rice with cilantro and bits of vegetable was out of this world. Red sauce a bit fiery for my taste, but the green sauce was just right. The decor is very lively and there was live Mexican music, which my husband and I like on occasion, a friendly server who explained the menu. We'll definitely be back.
