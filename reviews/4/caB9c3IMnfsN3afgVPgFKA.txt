Ahhh, cheesy goodness! This place has the best around. I could eat the cheese dip with a spoon. Service is always great, food comes out super fast and it's very affordable. I have been coming here for years and every dish I have tried has been awesome. If you're a huge fan of cheese like I am then I recommend ordering a vegetarian dish. Instead of meat on the items they replace it with a ton of cheese. =) They also have drink specials almost every day and of course you get unlimited chips and salsa.
