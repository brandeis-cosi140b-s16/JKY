We were here for AZ Bike Week. We stopped by about 9 PM and there was still a good crowd here. We had an excellent server who made good menu suggestions. The Margaritas and the Fahitas were excellent. I am surprised this place does not get higher marks. It was our first time there, but I would certainly return when back in the area.
