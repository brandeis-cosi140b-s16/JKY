The hubby & I go there very frequently now...addicted to the margaritas!  We've tried more of the menu and it's ALL been great.  We like to share the giant burrito (yep, it's huge) that's loaded with only with a really tasty shredded beef (I hate rice and beans in a burrito) and covered with a delicious red sauce. We always sit outside since the inside is so blah, but it's so hot right now, we'll have to wait til it cools off a bit.  We'd get it to go, but we HAVE to have their margys!  The guys behind the counter are awesome and very friendly.
