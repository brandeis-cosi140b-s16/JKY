I was VERY pleasantly surprised with their Mexican food.  I ordered the combo lunch with a beef burrito and carnitas street taco with cilantro rice and black beans.  The burrito was huge and so was the taco.  Way too much food for just me, especially when you factor in the the salsa trio and Queso Fundido (a glob of cheese with charizo mixed in...YUMMY!) we ordered.  I suggest them all.  And the Chile Crusted Mahi-Mahi street tacos...I sampled them off a friend's plate & wish I had ordered them too!
