Food is amazing!!!! Like every food item we ordered melted in my mouth. 

not a fan of the table layout - all the tables are very small and only 1 ft away from the next table...so if you get stuck to someone annoying they will become a part of your meal...not cool

portion sizes are tiny - so you wind up ordering 3ish items per person which is ok but doesn't work well when you have such a small table
