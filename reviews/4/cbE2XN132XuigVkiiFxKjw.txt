I've been anticipating Vitamin T opening for a few months. Since relocating offices from downtown Tempe to Phoenix I've been missing Chronic Tacos. This place is exactly what I expected-which is a good thing. It's a taco stand on steroids. The ingredients on their tacos are above and beyond what is on your basic protein in a tortilla. Just the right texture and combination of flavors to hit right spots in a compact package. The cinnamon rubbed barbacoa is excellent! At $7 a three pack, to me this is a great new lunch option.

I don't really write reviews, but looking at those posted so far I wanted to offer a counterpoint. I want this place sticking around. I'm sitting out here in the burbs now craving that barbacoa again!
