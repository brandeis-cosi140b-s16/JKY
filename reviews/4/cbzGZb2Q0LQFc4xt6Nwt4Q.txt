Fuzzy's is not only some of the best Tex-Mex in Tempe, it's also the most affordable. Taco varieties are varied but you can get away with a decent meal for about $8 top to bottom, including drink and tip. 

However, Fuzzy's offers deals on every angle. Come on Tuesdays and tacos are only $1.75 each. Buy a large drink and the reusable cup gets free refills forever. They occasionally have "Dollar Taco Days" which are as awesome as they sound. 

The service is as fast as can be expected, but the place tends to get noisy at peak hours. You come to eat, not to chat. Thumbs up for Fuzzy's! See you on Tuesdays.
