$2 Sangria... Hola!  If you know how much of a sucker I am for this refreshing, spirited thirst quencher, then you can understand my excitement this past Saturday at approximately 5pm.  I have heard about the margarita special, but didn't know about the sangria.  Both the white & red were yummy; perfect for a mid-day break after a day of shopping (or in my case, working).  Service at the bar was decent.  Granted I now realize we didn't get any chips & salsa... hmmm.  My friend and I shared an order of the fish taco; the tilapia was plentiful (half a filet for each taco), plus rice & ranchero beans made this a good size meal for about $8, which is cheaper than some of the appetizers.  I do have to say it took quite some time to get our food, and it's during odd time on a weekend when there's no many patrons, I hope they're faster during rush hours.  

In short, I think this is a solid place for the price and location.  Considering my office will be moving closer to the mall area in May, can we say "dangerous?!"
