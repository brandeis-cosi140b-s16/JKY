On a hot summer day, three high school friends ventured to try Gran Agave at the waterfront, and boy were they happy! 

We needed a place to catch up, have some great food and enjoy the atmosphere we were in, we decided to go to Gran Agave and see what the hype was all about! 

I must say living in Pittsburgh for all of my 26 years, I don't think I had Mexican food that I felt was just so goood! It was authentic, delicious and scrumptious! 

The moment we walked in we were greeted with a kind and courteous staff, we immediately were attended to with drinks and Delicious HOT and crispy chips and salsa. The salsa is not like your regular chi-chi's salsa you get at the grocery store either, it is savory and has a little bit of a kick to it! 

We ordered the cheese dip to go along with our chips and the cheese just melted in your mouth. It didn't taste processed or had many preservatives. 

We also decided to split the Chicken Quesadilla and boy I am glad we did because the portion size is huge and we were definitely full after doing that! 

What a great place at the Waterfront!
