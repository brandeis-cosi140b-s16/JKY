I've been here twice before and I've gotta say the salsa and chips are THEE BEST!!! It may not be the normal hole in the wall good Mexican joint but this place can run with the best of them. I got the half sized nachos with beef... And I thought they were the full size. Pretty cheap. 

If you order the nachos, leave the onions and green peppers off. I think this contributed to the weird flavor; but all in all it was really good. 

Service was good. I left my usual 20%.
