Skip all the other Mexican places in Madison and go right to Los Gemelos.  The food is tasty and cheap and the service is good.

Los Gemelos has an unassuming interior and exterior.  The plastic booths and cheap decor might make you think that you're going to get shitty food, but slow your roll.  The food (even though it comes in plastic baskets) is made to order and very, very good.  I consider this place to be a Madison hidden gem.  Hopefully the owners will decide to update the interior to match their above-average food.  Some might find the portions small, but the small prices makes it easy to get a big meal for $6-$10.  I ordred two quesadillas and couldn't finish the second one.

The service was fine.
