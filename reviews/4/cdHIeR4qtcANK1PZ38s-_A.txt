First visit. Carne Asada burrito was very good. The tortilla had the freshly homemade taste, like nana use to make. You Mexicans out there know what I mean.  The meat was tender and marinated very well. My boy liked the quesadilla, but how can you mess that up right?  My other son got the machaca burro. He said it was good. It must have been cuz the next thing I know, it was gone. The red sauce was okay...a little watery for my taste.  I'll be back again.
