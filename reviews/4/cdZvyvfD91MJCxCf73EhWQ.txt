I have been wanting to leave a review and Reviewer on 4/20/2014 hit the nail on the head with exactly what I was thinking. Food was good, staff was nice, place is a little hard to find and I had to debate whether or not I would actually go in. I went here because of my pregnancy craving for enchiladas and have found none since being in Madison for a year. The chicken enchiladas were delicious and exactly the authentic flavor I was looking for. I also had the flautas which were just as tasty. My husband enjoyed his tacos. He had more filling than he expected and had enough for leftovers. Definitely good food if you are willing to give it a try. It really reminded me that places like Qdoba and Chipotle are like "fast food" and missing that good authentic flavor that I loved about my favorite restaurant back at home.
