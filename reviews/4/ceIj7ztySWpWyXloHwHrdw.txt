Great late night vegan gluten free spot!!! Vegan nachos with wheat free patty or tofu and vegan cheese. Huge serving...really too huge, but if you're hungry or sharing, you can't go wrong. Last call is about 1:20ish every night and sometimes even later. 

Drinks are good and each night they have different events including dj, live music, movie night, etc. staff is cool and service is good and fast. Located right in heart of Fremont Experience, but just slightly off the path...
