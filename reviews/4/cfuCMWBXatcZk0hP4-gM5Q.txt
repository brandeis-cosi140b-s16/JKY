Best things about Chipotle:  its cheap (under 8 bucks), its fresh, fast, and has ridiculously awesome guac, and they're consistent. 

I'm not gunna lie - though not exactly "mexican" food, they have great food and one of my favorite burritos anywhere.  This location is one of the best I've been to, as the food is awesomely fresh and hot and the wait is small.  It also has a lot of seating, both inside and out, but the backs are wicked uncomfortable in the benches.  The rest of the "ambiance" is pretty normal and not exciting. 

The sizes are huge, from burrito to salads.  The chicken is moist and flavorful, the steak is good and not overcooked, and you have different options for beans (even though I dont eat them).  I love their white lime-cilantro rice, the sour creme is not bitter, they have a great pico, and I have a love of the cheese they have.  My favorite things here are the burritos and taco bowls - with LOTS of guac - with chips and guac on the side, topped with their yummy house lime-salt. Also, they serve Coke products here, a big plus to us diet coke fiends.  

If you like big burritos and americanized mexican food, you've gotta do yourself the favor of checkin this place out.
