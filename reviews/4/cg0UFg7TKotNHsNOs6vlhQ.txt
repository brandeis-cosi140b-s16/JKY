Just got a quick bite from this place. A no frills, down to business, 24 hour  taco, burritos, enchiladas, chilerellenos... the staples. 

I got the enchildas and chile rellenos combo with a side or rice and beans. I had the pleasure of watching the person who took my order also cook my food, and not even bother to use a pair of gloves (minus one star). But the food was slightly greasy but really really good. The restaurant was otherwise clean, and they had a condiment bar with green and red salsa, pickled red radish, carrots and chilli's with fresh lemon wedges.    Perfect compliment to any meal. 

This is a fast food joint, and they did a fast, and good job with the food.  I'm going to try the heuvos rancheros next time I'm there.
