Cool and overcast day, perfect for people watching on their patio.  Their menu board offers lots of ways to customize your meal and since I felt like having a protein based dish, the Zaba Bowl sans rice worked for me!  Carnitas, black beans, fajita veggies with all the toppi gs.  Quick and easy in and out, nutrition to get the energy up to get the shopping done.
