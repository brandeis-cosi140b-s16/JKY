I really like this place! Saw it on Diners Drives Ins and Dives even though I don't really like the show, I still gave it a shot. I'd been craving some better mexican foods because everything I've tasted was... sad. I was pleasantly surprised that this family owned shop was delicious. I love the bombero burrito because the sauce is spicy but still yummy! A lot of hot sauces are just spicy with no yummy. 

This has officially become my mex spot. :D
