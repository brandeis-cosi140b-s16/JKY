I liked the carne asada cheese crisp and ceviche a lot. I ordered the carne asada chimichanga enchilada style (meaning they put some sauce on top). I thought the sauce was good, but the meat itself was only ok. I was generally satisfied with my meal though. The service was very nice. Also, the portions are huuuuuge, so come hungry or be prepared to take some food home afterward.
