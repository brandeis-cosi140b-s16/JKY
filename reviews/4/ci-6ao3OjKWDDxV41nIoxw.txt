My first experience going here wasn't positive. I was shopping and came lunch time and heard about the taco shop. I decided to give a shot. I was looking at the menu and when I finally ordered, the employee said, there was no al pastor ready. That seemed odd since it was about 11:30 am and one of the signature items. Does McDonalds run out of cheeseburgers?  He could have told me when I was waiting there that they were out of a menu item. . Unhappy, I went somewhere else to eat.

My next venture was more successful (just recently). I ordered 3 al pastor tacos. The tacos came out fresh and flavorful. There was a bit of a wait, probably 7-10 minutes to get my tacos which was a bit disappointing.

I also enjoyed the crushed ice that the fountain drinks are served with, much better than cubes. The only problem I was very thirsty and drank most of the soda while waiting for the tacos. Refills are extra, bummer.

I would head back just for the el pastor tacos as that is something that is not easily found and when you do find it, not always good.
