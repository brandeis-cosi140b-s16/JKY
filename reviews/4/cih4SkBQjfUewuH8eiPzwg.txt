I have hit this place up many times over the years. It has been here for 20 years or more. Probably one of the best places inside the airport.
It has gone down hill a bit over the years.
The food is still really good, but it used to be a lot better!
Chicken Delight is my favorite, but everything is good here. 
You can get it to go or for the food court area.
It is very inexpensive especially for the Airport.
 Always hot and fresh. The hot sauce, is really good. I always enjoy it, and I think you will as well.
