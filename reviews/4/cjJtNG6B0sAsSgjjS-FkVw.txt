You don't come here because you are looking for authentic Mexican food.  You don't come back here because you think to yourself "oh wow that chimichanga was the best I ever had."  You come because:

1. They have random fake birds hanging all over the celing  
2. They have $1.99 margaritas made from a mix with the cheapest tequila.
3. They put an entire tub of sour cream on your chimichanga
4. They give your kid balloon puppies upon entering
5. They are family owned and always smiling (not even sure how this is possible)
6. The chips are always stale and they keep them coming
7. The salsa is above average and makes those stale chips taste even better
8. You can dine with random cardboard hotties

So, just keep drinking those margaritas, eating those stale chips, looking at random birds and eating your sour cream on top of a very deep friend chimichanga because nothing else matters in life.   And most likely you will find me here because this place is just plain fun.
