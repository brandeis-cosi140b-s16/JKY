Ate here last week for the first time and was surprised.  I had the pulled pork tacos and they were some of the best I've had.  Very similar vibe to Pink Taco here in Century City.  The prices were a bit high, but not too bad for being in Vegas.  The service was ok, not great.  I was really impressed with the taste of the food.  The others with me ordered different meals and everyone was very pleased with their plate.  I will definitely come here again.
