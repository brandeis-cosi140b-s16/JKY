Not sure what was wrong with me, I noticed that I gave La Barquita a three star.  I apologize for such a low review.  There rice is great, and the food is nothing but quality.  I get the soup, I suggest for those colder days or sick days to try it out.  I"m glad so many other people tried this Mexican restaurant its not an easy place to find.
