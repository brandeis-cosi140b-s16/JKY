How many La Bamba's are there out there now?  I dunno, but this was the first one!  It all started here ...

From a drunken-college-student-perspective, this is good solid food at 2:30 am, after a long night of drinking and dancing.  I kid you not, a friend of mine once ate two La Bamba super burritos in one sitting -- each one BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD!

But, from a hey-I-graduated-fifteen-years-ago perspective, I still think it's good food.  Granted, I haven't had a La Bamba's in years, but I recall that they had exceptionally tasty hot sauce.
