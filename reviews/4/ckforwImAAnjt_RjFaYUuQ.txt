Veracruz makes an effort to distinguish itself from the standard big burrito or Tex Mex chains, and these efforts  pay off.

Chorizo, barbacoa, and al pastor double wrapped tacos are now on the menu, as well as other authentic Mexican dishes like chilaquiles and sopes. Authentic Mexican food is a rare find in Oakland (let alone Pittsburgh), so these tasty dishes make Veracruz worth a visit. 

If you're unfamiliar with the aforementioned foods, I suggest you dive in and try them regardless of your personal reservations. Otherwise, Veracruz is simply average in terms of Americanized Mexican fare, such as nachos, quesadillas, and burritos. I actually prefer nearby Chipotle or Qdoba for Ameri-Mex. On a positive note, anything with their earthy, smoky chicken chili is decent, their guacamole is fresh and light, and their homemade red chili and avocado salsas are zesty and tasty.

Relatively cheap prices and a student discount is the icing on the cake (or the guac on the nachos, I guess). Service varies highly depending on who's taking your order.
