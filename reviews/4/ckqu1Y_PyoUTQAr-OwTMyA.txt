Someburro's kicks ass.  It's a nice middle ground between the standard *Berto's and the more sit-down experience.

Pollo Fundido and Borracho Burritos are awesome.  Service is quick. Beaners are bean-y.  There's nothing spectacular about this place, just really good, solid food served hot and quick.

Dig it.
