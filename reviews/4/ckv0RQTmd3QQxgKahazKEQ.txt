Came here during the halftime of the football game I was watching next door at All-American Pub and was surprised at how fast they took my order and served it to me. Real fast service even while they were busy.

I simply had tacos which were good. 

I ordered, ate, paid, and was able to get back to the game in time to watch the rest of the game so that worked out really well. Can't ask for more

Fast service, good food :)
