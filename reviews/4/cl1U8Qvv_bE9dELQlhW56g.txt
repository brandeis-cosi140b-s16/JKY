After landing in Phoenix around 8pm, I yelped some places near our hotel in Scottsdale and stumbled upon this place - thanks Yelp!!

It was pretty empty by the time we got there since it was so late. And it's quite dark inside, haha. But the food was GREAT!

We ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer - YUM. Definitely get these, you won't be disappointed. We also got the Fresh Snapper Tacos (nothing special, but the fish was really really good) and the Stacked Enchiladas - SO GOOD. It was so dark in there that I didn't realize it had a fried egg on top...a really nice surprise :)

We also ordered the Flan since all the reviews said it was good. But it was just okay...too thick & rich for my liking. But overall, great place! I would come back again.
