Panchero's is my go-to late night dinner. The food is made quickly, consistently, and is flavorful. It is very similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, but I would say I prefer to eat here rather than the other similar options on University Ave. I appreciate that they make the tortillas straight from dough rather than heating up old tortillas. This prevents the edges from getting undesirably tough. I usually get the carnitas tacos, and they are always delicious. 

My only complaint is about the atmosphere. Whenever I go to eat there, I am the only customer. It doesn't really create a good vibe. However, in their defense I do go there around 10 pm so not many customers are to be expected.

I definitely recommend going there if you like carnitas!
