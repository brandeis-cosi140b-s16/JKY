I'm starting to like this place but stay away from the tamales....they are all masa and no meat.  I love their tacos, enchiladas, burritos, and the margaritas will get you drunk very quickly.  I like the atmosphere its very casual and clean.  The salsa bar has about 6 different salsas and the chips are great too.
