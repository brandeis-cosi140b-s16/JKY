This place place got a great review in one of the local papers so we tried it out. Really good Mexican food! The empanadas were delicious and the tamale (I got the last one they had) was amazing. Very moist and it had some really interesting spices. Yum! Carnitas, excellent. Pastor, excellent. I'll be back to try the other items on the menu.
