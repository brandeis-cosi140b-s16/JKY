Dinner was great!  Went for a business meeting with our insurance agent who is from out of state. I try to take him someplace new and different every time he comes into town.  We started with the guacamole, and weren't too sure about the cranberries at first. So we only got a little of them.  Wished we would have gotten more!  

Sherrie, our server, recommended a couple of great dishes for us. We got the Cochinita Pibil and the Chiles En Nogada, excellent!!  Of course I had left overs for lunch today!!  No room left for dessert which is unusual for us.  

I would have given 5-stars but I didn't see the receipt until today and noticed we were charged for five margaritas and only had two each. I didn't pay the bill or I would have noticed last night before we left. 

If you go, ask for "Sherrie"!  She is awesome and very informative.  Great service!!
