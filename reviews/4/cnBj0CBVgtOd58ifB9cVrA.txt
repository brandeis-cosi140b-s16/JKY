Food is pretty good for bar food, and you get a lot.  We go during the day with our kid and avoid the crowds.  Kids eat free when you buy something for yourself & its not a problem if she runs around the dinning area a little (the actual bar is situated separately) Plenty of room so its not a bother to others.

we would also recommend going for happy hour,  we never go anymore but we would if we had the time, energy, and a babysitter.
