Typical Mexican restaurant- bright colors and tacky decorations.  A projection big screen showed ESPN Deportes (in Spanish).  Decent service, plentiful good food, and fair prices.  We ordered the combo chicken & beef fajitas to share.  While waiting, we received the setups (lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, rice), then waited another 15 minutes while the rice got cold until the fajitas came.  There was enough for two more meals.  My son's quesadilla was exactly what he ordered/liked.

We'll definitely go back.  Parking is poor, so if it's busy, good luck!
