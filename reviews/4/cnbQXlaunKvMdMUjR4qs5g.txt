Conclusion: The only reason I'm placing it 4 stars because I would have to check it out again second guessing myself if the food was really that good!  I had their breakfast stuff and it was absolutely awesome but I want to refrain on a total analysis once I try the non-breakfast stuff.  The fact that they honored my $10 for $20 voucher as I literally got it 5 mins before I got there is cool in itself.  The breakfast burrito was quite delicious  and lack of hunger lasted until dinner.  Damn near 10+ hours.   You have a lot of options to add with rice, refried beans, guac!, avocado, mild or hot salsas, queso y mas!  I would definitely check this place out again if in the area.  Saborr is down with TeamPortions!
