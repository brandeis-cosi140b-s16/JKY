oh the kitchiness of the dessert... the walls are covered in one dollar bills.  all are signed by patrons and passers-by.  the bathroom has painted women (old west attire).  the bar has saddles that you sit on instead of stools.  

moving on to the food.
the water had a chlorine/salt taste to it.  their dr. pepper didn't taste much like dr. pepper, i think the soda water must have been fizzled out since there was little carbonation.  
they had a cheese crisp on the menu for $7ish.  it is a giant tortilla, covered with cheese, another tortilla, more cheese, and green chili's.  i peeled the chili's off, the flavor left was nice.  the cheese was a bit thick,  there was nothing all too exciting about this appetizer.
i got a burger with fries.  it was cooked well, which i like, but didn't ask for.  the fries were not too thin, mostly soggy (which i like).  not wet soggy, just the not crisp kind.
the chicken strips were larger than normal.  the cheese enchiladas are wonderful according to the one eating them.  as if they made the sauce themselves.  the blt was minimally built, very little bacon, considered "eh."

the waitress was nice, but flighty.  she wasn't direct with us, just kind of there.  when we asked for bbq, or refills, she never looked at us, but responded as she walked away.  didn't listen to our orders completely.  it was asked that chili's be put on half the crisp, but was on all of it.  i asked for just pickles on my hamburger, but it was naked.

the drive there is pretty.  i wouldn't see how anyone would be driving through here on a road trip, but if you are, it's not bad, but not wonderful.
