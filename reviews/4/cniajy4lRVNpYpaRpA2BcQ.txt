I have nothing but compliments about Senor Tequila. Delightful food, and with the remodel, there's a lot more seating indoor and at the bar. I loved the bartender, who seamlessly poured massive margaritas, cervesas and those old-guy-in-his-50s mixed drinks.

In terms of vegetarian entrees, I yield to the "Chiles en Nogada,"  which is essentially the lunch special chile relleno masquerading ever-so-successfully as a dinner portion. Every bite is amazing and it's a disappointment to finish!

My husband went with the "Ropa Vieja." A Cuban dish to die for. (Or don't, since you'll definitely want to go to Senor Tequila as soon as you can!)

Weekend dinnertime can be crowded, and for good reason. Take my advice: go during off-hours and enjoy a margarita the size of Rhode Island and indulge in the most delicious chiles rellenos known to mankind.

Please, don't thank me. Just enjoy a true South Charlotte gem.
