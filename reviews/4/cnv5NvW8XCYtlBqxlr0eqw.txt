I was excited to see Sonoran hot dog on the menu.  I was disappointed that it was drenched in everything and didn't taste good.

I usually get the California burrito and Adobada (similar or the same as Al Pastor) at every taqueria.  This location has flame broiled tasting carne asada and adobada, which I think is great compared to the usual grill fry.  There is fat on the meat, which some will not appreciate, but I truly prefer compared to the super lean of other taquerias.

The red and green condiment sauces actually has flavor and texture compared to the Armando's on Deer Valley.  The DV location is very very watered down.

There's one problem at this location that has been consistent since it opened.  The WAIT.  I've been here about 10 times since it opened at different days of the week and different times of the day.  Even as the only customer in the drive-thru, my usual order of 1 California burrito, 1 Adobada burrito,1  Cheese quesadilla, 1/2 order Super Nachos, 1 Chicken chimichanga always takes 25 minutes.  Last night I ordered the usual over the phone at 6pm and she asked how long will you be here, and I told her about 10 minutes since I only live over the hill in Tramonto.  She said OK.  I didn't get the food until 6:50pm.  Wow what a dinner rush.  It would've been nice if she said it will take 45 minutes.

It's great that I do not have to drive to the DV location anymore.  And I think Roberto's in Anthem is overrated and slightly overpriced since it was on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives - except it was the 7th Ave location at the Shell gas station.
