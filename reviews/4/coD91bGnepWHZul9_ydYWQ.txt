Fantastic Mexican food!! Very unassuming restaurant in a little strip mall  on Old Monroe Rd. You must find this place & give it a try next time you're in the Indian Trail area. The chorizo quesadilla was top notch. Hell, anything chorizo gets my vote! If there is a downside, it's that there is no alcohol served. I can live with that. Highly recommend this place!!
