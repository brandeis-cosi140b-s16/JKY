Holy Apache tacos! Was pleadingly surprised at how good this taco joint was. Tiny hole in the wall. Decided to check it out for lunch. I tried the enchilada plate, which was tasty, and the bf got the carne asada burrito. The carne asada was marinated in some delicious sauce cause the flavor was on point. Only weird thing is they are a little stingy with the salsa/hot sauce bar. There's a giant sign that says 'one serving only' haha. Weird, but good.
