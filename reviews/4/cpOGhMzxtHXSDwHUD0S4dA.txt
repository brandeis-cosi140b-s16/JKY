Randomly driving through bloomfield, my wife and I saw our friend chuck at a bus stop and picked him up. Chuck was heading towards the Beehive in south side so we gave him a lift and on the way stopped for a quick bite at Emiliano's. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised with everything.

 Decently priced, and Delicious. I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanas, and the mole sauce was amazing. At only $9.99, it was definately on par with what I would expect to pay. My wife's fish tacos were also really good, and with the sides it came with was way too much food, always a good thing.

 The only complaint was our waitress, she was not very involved with our table aside from the occasional refill. She kind of disappeared til it was time to pay. Other then that everything was great!
