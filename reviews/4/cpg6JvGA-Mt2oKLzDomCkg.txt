I've always hated Roberto's, but now that it's the closest Mexican option, I've found a few dishes I love. Service at this location is great, and it is a much nicer Roberto's than others I've visited. The same guy seems to be working 24 hours a day, and he never forgets my order.

I'm addicted to the three rolled tacos with guacamole, bean tostadas, and enchiladas. The only problem I ever have is that they sometimes give me beef rolled tacos when I request chicken, but it's not really a big deal for me. Otherwise, I can't get enough!
