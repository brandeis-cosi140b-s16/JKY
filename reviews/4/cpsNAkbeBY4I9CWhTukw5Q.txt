You would think that since this Carl's Jr. is next to a new In N Out Burger, that this place wouldn't stand a chance.

I thought so first at too, but let me tell you -- Carl's Jr's variety in their menu sets them apart .

Their chicken sandwiches are hard to contend against.  My all time favorite (because of taste and healthiness) is the Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich!

Only 510 Calories, 17g per sandwich.

Combined with the Light Minute Maid Lemonade it is an awesome and low calorie meal. 

The shakes are also top notch!

Food is a 9/10.

Service is a 10/10.

Cleanliness is a 10/10.

This is going on the work lunch rotation list!
