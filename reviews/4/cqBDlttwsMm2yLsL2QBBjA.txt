It's been over 2 yrs since my original review, time to update it....this place has been a solid, consistent restaurant since I moved to town a few yrs ago.  

They should be recognized for their consistent delivery of good food and solid service.  Their employees are always friendly and welcoming.

It can get busy here for lunch and on the weekends....the one knock on it is the small parking lot area...it can get full fast.

I'm addicted to their Steak Burritos....especially when I top it with Spicy Salsa from the Salsa Bar.
