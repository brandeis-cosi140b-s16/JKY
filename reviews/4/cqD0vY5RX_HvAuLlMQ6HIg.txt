our last stop on the san tan brew labor day pub ride....quite inebriated by now, but it was only 7pm. it was smaller than i expected. but the cabanas were empty so we had a place to sit and chill. 

the servers were all very pretty and i'm sure my wife noticed the man candy lounging around. it was entertaining to see men wearing designer shirts and sunglasses replete with the ubiquitous sleeve tattoos deathly afraid of getting their perfectly quaffed hair wet. i live in old town but the club scene nor it's population has never been my cup of tea.

staff was friendly and the music was pumpin some great tunes. my pecs or my wallet  aren't big enough to visit here on a regular basis.
