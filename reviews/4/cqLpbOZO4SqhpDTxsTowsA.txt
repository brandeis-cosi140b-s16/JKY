First, I want to say Yelp needs to provide instructions on how to review, and impose a limit on how long the review should be because there's no need to write 1000 word essay raving about a place, and then deduct stars for some mundane thing like price or a mistake on a bill that was corrected with a smile. Anyway, my experience was excellent, the food was very good, drinks were delicious, service was amazing-all of the suggestions were spot on. I can't remember the names of everything I had but it was all delightful, and I have no complaints.  Eat here!  it's yummy!
