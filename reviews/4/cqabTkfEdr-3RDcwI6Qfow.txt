We are Mexican food fanatics and this place impressed us.  Granted, we are "gringos" from the get-go, but in our combined 90-something years on the planet we've eaten a sh**load of Mexican.

Ordered the combo appetizer platter and everything on it was great. Especially enjoyed the quesadilla with authentic Mexican cheese (sorry, I forgot what it is called) oozing forth from it's homemade tortilla blanket.  Great margaritas at $6.50 each.  We each ordered a combo plate for our main meal ... Chili relleno was fabulous and the chili was not overcooked, beef enchilada was chock full of shredded beef, chorizo taco was quite well balanced with the spicy meat and cooling lettuce and chopped tomatoes.  House guac is above average, but El Sombrero on Main St. still has the best I've ever tasted. My husband's combo with carnitas burrito, cheese enchilada and chicken taco was excellent too.  

Service was prompt and friendly. Highly recommended restaurant and do NOT pass on the homemade tortillas.  You have a choice of flour or corn, but I asked for a little of both and they happily accommodated us.  Oh yes ... FYI, they also have one of those roving mariachi duos, if you'd like to be serenaded while you dine.
