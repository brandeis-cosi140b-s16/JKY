We have driven by this place a dozen times and finally stopped in. We walked in at 5pm on a Wednesday, the place was empty, but during the hour the place started to fill up quickly.

Tony, the bartender is terrific.  Excellent margarita, excellent service.  I really liked the salsa, good flavor and not too spicy, and then there is a salsa bar, my husband picked a hot salsa off the bar and he really liked that. 
I had a combo, cheese enchilada and steak taco with rice and beans.  Defiantly having that taco again, delish.  Enchilada was different than I am use to but the flavor was good.  Absolutely loved the re-fried beans. Not usually a fan.  Most of the time they are thick and dry but these were creamy and delish.  Having those again also.  We have been to several Mex .rest. and so far this is the one we have agreed we will return to.  
Although I will add, I did not like the guacamole.  Not the best
