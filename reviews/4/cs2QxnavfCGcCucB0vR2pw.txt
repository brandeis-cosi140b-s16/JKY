Ron is super friendly and nice.  He takes his business and all the reviews on this site and others seriously... but maybe a little too personally.  But it's his livelihood so I can respect that.  

I've been here a few times and I'm a big fan of the fries, the pork taco, and the Nate dog.  Everything has a good, fresh flavor to it and if you need to make it spicy, the siracha is right there!  The Nate dog is already pretty spicy, though.

Plus he's been great about hosting food truck events in the parking lot, promoting other food trucks that may or may not be lesser known.  He's not afraid of a little competition. :) From talking to him, I think he's worked out the kinks in his service system when big groups show up for the food truck events.  Basically, you'll just wait in line long but get your food faster, like how Slider Truck operates.  Ever notice how the order guy for Slider Truck disappears for a while each time after taking an order?  He's managing the tickets so the nice gentlemen cooking the food don't get slammed.  Hopefully now that Ron is wise to that technique, things will go more smoothly when the crowds show up.  It's great that he's flexible and willing to learn and experiment with both the food and the service.

All in all, a great food truck and it's nice that he has a consistent location so I don't have to track him down.
