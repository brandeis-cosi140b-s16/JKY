Found another fast lunch time place I can add to my list, and I secretly have to admit I am a fan of Chipotle, my gawd have you had there guacamole? I can't get enough of it! You can get a bag of chips & a side of guacamole for like 2 bucks, and that right there is a bangin deal and an excellent eat! 

Went with some coworkers at high noon, the place had a lil line going, but I can safely say that even though there was many in front of me, the line moved in a fast fashion, and when I made it to order my food I saw the line was just as long, but I got the feeling of being rushed by the servers, like you know how at some places when they are busy they half ask you what you want and you tell them and  1/2 way though it they are messing up because they are already asking the next person what they want?  No I don't get that feeling here, I told the guy what I wanted and he made it happened and didn't take his attention away from me before he made sure I was on track with my order, then he helped the next person.   I like that, the non-feeling of being rushed!

For this trip I ordered the chicken bowl with white rice, black beans, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream , I also asked for a side of their hot sauce,  the chicken bowl was just what I was craving!
