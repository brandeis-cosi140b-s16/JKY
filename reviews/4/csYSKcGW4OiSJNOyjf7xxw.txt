Charlotte was that waitress who you remember, as a kid, was liked by mom, dad, and even your brothers/sisters, too!  She had a 6-table station rocking, and didn't miss a beat with my daughter (hand-made chocolate milk), son (half lemonade, half H20, soda topper), & me (monster beer) while keeping the hot chips and flavorful salsa coming.  Daughter's Chicken Strips, oddly enough, are by far the best tasting, highest quality, great portioned meal (along with generous helping of steak fries) in any restaurant, MExican or otherwise.  Son's taco combo and my own salad both absolutely solid in their selection.

This was our second straight great experience at Manuel's on Bell Rd.  They also have cheap Dos Equis (everyday!) and frequent F&B specials, they stretch my $ a bit, so I can see returning again soon.
