Love this place, interesting take on Mexican food (hard to describe, but not your normal Sonoran AZ style), kick butt margaritas, and may I suggest the "Classic" which comes in a shaker.  Best part, family owned and run, come a few times and you'll feel right at home.  Our whole neighborhood comes on Fridays, kid and all (definitely kid friendly), you should too!
