I had Cabo's bookmarked forever and finally got to try it for a late lunch one Friday - I was truly sorry  I waited so long, as it is relatively close to my home.

Located at the back of Carmel Commons, off of Carmel Rd, the parking spaces seemed a bit narrow, so I parked at the end of the lot as to not get my doors banged up.  On a Friday around 2:00, there wasn't much of a crowd at all and I was quickly seated and then almost immediately greeted by my server.  My drink order of a Coke Zero was brought quickly and kept filled.  I really enjoyed the complimentary salsa and tortilla chips.  The salsa is a well blended mix of tomatoes and other ingredients, which is what I prefer to the chunkier salsas.  It was also not overwhelmingly cilantro'ed, which I was very happy about.  An order of cheese dip came quickly to the table and it was delicious.  Creamy and well flavored, and the tortilla chips were perfectly salted and held up well to the queso.

My lunch order was a steak Chimichanga - shredded beef in a flour tortilla, covered with queso and served with rice and beans.  The rice beans were both mexican restaurant standard issue, though better than most.  The beans were a good consistency and the rice wasn't a dried out mess.  The meat inside of the chimichanga was well seasoned.

Though I had to unbutton my pants, I did finish my lunch and it was very good.  Service was excellent.  Price was average.  I will definitely return to Cabo's.
