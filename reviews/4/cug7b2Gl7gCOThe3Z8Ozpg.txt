I was pleased with my first visit to Manuel's Mexican Restaurant!

The chips and salsa were addictive and the waiters did an excellent job of giving us more when we ran out.

The food came out really fast after we ordered it which surprised us. The cheese crisp was quite good! I liked our tacos and our chimichangas as well. The service was good for the most part.

The only criticism I have is that it does seem a bit more expensive than it should be, but they served a good meal nonetheless.
