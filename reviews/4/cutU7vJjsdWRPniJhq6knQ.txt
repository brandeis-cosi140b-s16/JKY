Margarita....check
Cheese dip....check
Kabobs....check
Taco salad....not so much
Staff....check for courtesy and politeness, not so much for attention to detail. One item we ordered never came and they never realized it.
They were very busy and so we will come back because we feel the food is very good on the whole.
