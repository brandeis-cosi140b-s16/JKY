Good choice to grab something quick and affordable. Came here starving from walking around the strip. Guacamole was freshly prepared for us from Haas avocados. Ordered enchiladas pork, shredded beef and chicken. Would recommend chicken, while pork would rank last.
Overall good food, very good service and great prices.
