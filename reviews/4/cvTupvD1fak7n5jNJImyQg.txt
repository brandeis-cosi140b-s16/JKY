So we finally tried Espos. We had a chicken burrito, enchilada-style with red sauce. We also took home chips and salsa, as well as some cinnamon crisps. 

The prices were good, the service was fast, and the owner was super friendly, even offering a large bowl of salsa for our takeout order, which I think they normally charge extra for.

The salsa rivals Carolina's in terms of taste and quality. The tortilla that my burrito was wrapped in was also excellent. Chips were ok. Next time we will skip the cinnamon crisps.

I was a little worried about cleanliness issues, especially after I read the review about cockroaches. I opted against getting a drink, but everything appeared to be ok at least near the checkout area and the half of the kitchen I could see.

This is a much better alternative to the Filiberto's, etc. in this area of the Valley. Much more authentic.
