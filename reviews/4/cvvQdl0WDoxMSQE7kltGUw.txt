Wow!

Glad to see the good reviews, I made my maiden voyage in March '07 and thought it was fantastic, but I was DDDDDD-runk.  Made a follow-up visit in December '07 and was happy to find the food to be just as good when sober.

Delicious food and cool atmosphere, although  I could do without the Carlos Santana blaring at 90 decibels.  I like my Carlos as much as the next guy, but it was a bit much. 

I've tried both Mexican and Cuban entrees, and you really can't go wrong with either.  Inexpensive, tasty food.  Great service.  An economically diverse clientele.  What more could one ask for?

Mr. Santana takes it down from 5 stars to 4.4 stars for me.

Don't walk any further east, it's kind of dangerous, especially at night.  But Mamacita's is a must if you're hungry and on Fremont - it's a required stop for me on future visits.

Update:  March 2008

They've turned down the music.  Thank you, God.  I enjoyed the same Carlos Santana videos, but at about 50% of the volume of my previous visits.  Food is still very good!
