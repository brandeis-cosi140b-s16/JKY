We were a little skeptical after all the bad reviews we saw on Yelp, but quite honestly, this place beat our expectations! The guac was fresh, good consistency, and had plenty of cilantro. The appetizers we ordered (several dips, and the chorizo-cheese plate - forget the name) were all well-prepared, uniquely seasoned, and great. The margarita was stiff and sweet, probably came from a mix, but not outrageously priced. Our sever was Ando and he was really pleasant and eager to help! Would definitely recommend.
