On the advice of Yelp we went here.

It did not disappoint, everything was excellent.

All three of us had something different. 

The chili verde, it was amazing, nice tinder and with just the right amount of heat! The portions were sizable!

Tamales, wow, hand made greatness. I can't say anything bad about these other than the fact the spicy sauce wasn't ordered with them.

The carne asada torta was also great! Nice tender beef, nice amount of avocado good bread and quite nice.
