I have to write a review to stick up for this place. We arrived around 230p at the bar, (about 30 minutes before happy hour) but the bartender gave us the drinks at happy hour price! He was awesome. The yard drinks are buy 1 get 1 free, there was three of us so the fourth one our bartender split the drink into thirds so we can all drink it. It was another plus! I don't know about these other bartenders but we ordered a "Frog Buster" & AMF, holy strong! We definitely felt it after we finished all of it. The music was amazing! They played everything from Bel Biv Devo to Drake, we were all dancing and having a good time. We did drunkenly make the mistake of paying for the other price shirts. The next day we realized they were $30! Over all the drinks were strong, the music was good & bartenders were friendly. I am definitely coming back next Vegas trip.
