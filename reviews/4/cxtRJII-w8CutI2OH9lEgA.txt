While visiting the Mesa area, I went here for their $4.99 lunch special 3 times in 1 week. Need I say more since if I think a place is just okay I rarely return. 
This is real Mexican food, the authentic goods, not fresh Mex. Real retried beans - but no lard so safe for vegans like me ( even Baja & Chipotle's pinto beans aren't vegan). Plus I could get the burrito sans tortilla since I'm also gluten-free. I do wish the guacamole was chunkier, it kind of reminds me of the Wholly Guacamole at the supermarkets. But the rest is just fine. It is about impossible to find a restaurant that I can feel satisfied & not hungry for $5 & that would be without the included drink! I'll miss this place when we head back home.
Owners are really nice, friendly & helpful.
