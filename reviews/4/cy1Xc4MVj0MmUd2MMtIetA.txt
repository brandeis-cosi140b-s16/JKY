Friendly staff, fast service, fair prices make this fast food burrito bar a winner in my book.  When you walk up to the counter you can watch them making fresh tortillas.  They don't use microwaves or freezers.  Lots of tedious, hand preparation goes on here with large bins of fresh avocados, tomatoes and limes visible to the customer.  I'm not sure where how they came up with the name Cafe Rio as to me it appears to fall in the Tex-Mex category.  Pork barbacoa is terrific as are the tamales.
