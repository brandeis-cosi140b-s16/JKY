I always order a chile relleno when trying a Mexican restaurant for the first time. Right or wrong, I use this one dish I like to decide if I'll return to try other items. It was one of the best I've had in some time. Served with rice (okay but not great) and spectacular beans, the relleno was simple and tasty.  I will return. Small but comfortable place.
