Delicious Ceviche, crispy tortillas, generous lime wedges, and two sauces were provided upon arriving--a very nice touch. The entrees were sized just right, were prepared well, and tasted fresh (which is sometimes difficult to find with seafood). The service was acceptable. Would go again just for the ceviche alone!
