I go here for the cheap happy hour beers and the company. I usually sit at the bar. The seating has gotten better but when they put the backs on the chairs people would lean back and almost break them. The cushions fabric on the chairs make you sweat badly and the concrete bar table will burn your arms in the summer and they are in the shade. The food is good and cheap. The bar waitress are good but sometimes you get that "one" who won't pay attention to you at all. I think she is more concerned about popping out those fake boobs at everyone. The parking isn't that great.
