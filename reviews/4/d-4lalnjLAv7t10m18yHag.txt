Always came here for lunch and never left disappointed, last time I went it was  for dinner by myself and sat at the bar, I was quickly greeted with their house chips and salsa, atmosphere was kinda non existent (maybe bc I came to have dinner at a Mexican restaurant on St Patrick's day) nonetheless my food was tasty (I had the Tampico chicken... stay away from this dish if you're lactose intolerant though lol). Service was okay but my food came out super fast.
