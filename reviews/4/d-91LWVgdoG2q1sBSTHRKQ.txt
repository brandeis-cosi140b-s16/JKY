No line at 11:25am on a Tuesday.  Friendly staff, fresh ingredients, and decent prices make this newest addition to downtown a good one to put into to-go lunch rotation.  

Cityscape is poorly designed, in my opinion, but at least Chipotle received one of the best locations- highly visible from Washington Street.  

They've recently added brown rice and it's just as tasty as their white rice.  I love that they offer so much variety, it helps when trying to keep your meal as healthy as possible.  

Welcome to the neighborhood, Chipotle!
