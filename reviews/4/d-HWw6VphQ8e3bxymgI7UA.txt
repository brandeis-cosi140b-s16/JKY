An upscale, 'Gourmet Mexican' restaurant with a very comfortable atmosphere - dressy but not 'snooty'. 
For the Tequila drinker, they have a very well stocked bar with many premium Tequilas. 

We found service to be very personable, our server was very friendly taking the time to make sure we understood the menu items and made good conversation while making some  of their 'top shelf' guacamole table side. 

Gourmet Mexican is a good description, if your looking for an overstuffed burrito soaking in a bowl of melted cheese and refried beans, go somewhere else. Our dishes were very flavorful and nicely presented. My wife enjoyed her Carnitas so much she never bothered with the accompanying tortillas.  Prices were reasonable for this level of cuisine. 

Having moved down South several years ago, our favorite Mexican restaurant, Rancho Tia Rosas, in Mesa is a bit of a drive now, so we were glad to find Cantina Loredo so close to home. Will it replace Tia Rosas as our favorite, no, but it is a worthy alternative close by.
