Quick and fast... great for lunch!  This place is located off of Harris, but a little hard to spot if you aren't looking for it.  The parking lot can be a bit of a krap shoot since it is located on the end and everyone seems to try to take the spots closest to the door.

Has great lunch specials and it is super fast (so you can enjoy your lunch without having to watch the clock too much).  Chips and salsa were kept on the table - The salsa has a medium kick to it (just right) and I can pretty much down a whole basket of chips myself (SAD, but true).

From Harris, the place doesn't look that big, but it really opens up inside and they have some pretty wicked decor inside.... some of the booths have a false thatched covering over them and the decor always seems festive.
