This place is better than any Roberto's I have been to. The staff is friendlier, and their carne asada is leaner as well. I don't find my self having to spit out fatty pieces after every bite of their burritos. The "salad" bar is always fresh and tidy, and the inside dining area is always clean. Minus 1 star for only being open until 11p and making me drive to Amigos Tacos for my after clubbing drunken Mexican food fix.
