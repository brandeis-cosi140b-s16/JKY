Great breakfast option in the United terminal. They offer build your own breakfast burritos, burrito bowls and breakfast quesadillas. I opted for the breakfast quesadilla (aka quesadilla con huevos.) I added chicken, which was actually pretty tasty and the portions were HUGE! I would definitely recommend getting a breakfast burrito here over the grab and go across the way at Coffee Bean.
