Best burritos in Madison. Hands down. Think Chipotle or Qdoba... only privately owned and better quality.  The set up is a bit like a Chipotle or Burrachos; and the choices are endless. You choose your base (ei: burrito, quesadilla, tacos) and then all of your ingredients.  I'm a burrito type; with rice; lettuce; guac; pico de gallo and salsa verde. The burritos are MASSIVE.  It's a quick place to get lunch and I am never disappointed.
