This place has never let me down as far as the quality of food goes. Only reason this doesn't get a 5 star rating is because some of the employees are... let's say... distractable. If I didn't say "hey that's my burrito you're about to give that guy" or "hey, I ordered chips", I probably would've been hungry with no money that day. The rest of the time though, every one's chill.
