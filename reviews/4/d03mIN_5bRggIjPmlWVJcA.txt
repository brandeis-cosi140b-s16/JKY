Came here for happy hour to try out the place.  I think your experience at this place will be based on how crowed it is.  I can see during peak times this place being not so great service wise.  That being said, we had a good time here, easily got a table near the bar and nice view of the pool outside.

Had the Rib-eye skewers medium rare, and it actually came out medium rare with a nice spice level.  Cheese quesadilla was very tasty, simply prepared flour tortilla with cheese, but came out hot and nicely toasted.  Side of guacamole was tasty, though expensive extra ($3) for such a small amount.  White fish ceviche was just ok.  Nothing special.

Drinks were tasty, though in plastic cups.  Not sure if that was because it was happy hour or normally like that because they have a pool.

Service was friendly and very attentive by our server, Rachel.  Over all we had a nice time and even when the place was getting full in the bar area, it didn't seem too full.
