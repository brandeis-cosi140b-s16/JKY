I thought it was fresh, delicious and "authentic" (as far as i understand the word in relation to Mexican food).

The Mendoza Dinner Enchildas were three corn tortillas stuffed with spiced shredded chicken and topped with a tangy tomatillo sauce and diced tomatoes and lettuce.  I'm a fan!  gimme more!

next time, will go for dinner so i can thoroughly pig-out.

weird location in a suburban strip mall.
