I had lunch at Monterrey on a Saturday.  The place wasn't too busy and I was seated right away.  The salsa and chips appeared quickly.  They also had a second dip, which was ranch, mayo and seasonings.  It was different and good.  I ordered the mole poblano which came with beans and rice.  My food came out in a reasonable amount of time and there was a lot of it.  The chicken grilled and was very tender with a nice smokey flavor.  The rice and beans were pretty standard.  I haven't had mole much, but this was pretty good.  It complimented the grilled chicken well.  The service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend Monterrey to others and will be back myself.
