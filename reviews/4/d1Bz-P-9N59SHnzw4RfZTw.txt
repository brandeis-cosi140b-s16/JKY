Tried for the first time at the Ellis Island Smash Up and the Green Chili Mac and Cheese and the Sloppi Dog were excellent!  The credit card machine was not processing and she gave  it to us ..Gave her five bucks cash...(Didn't realize I would need cash at Food trucks...I am a newbie) then ran into her at Tacos and Tequila and paid her back and ate again  a redburger and tacos YUM!  I think I am now addicted...Cannot wait for the next time...My hubby too and my 7 year old loves the tres leches cupcakes..
