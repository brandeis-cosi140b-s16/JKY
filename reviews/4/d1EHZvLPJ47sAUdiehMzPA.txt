Been here a bunch of times, especially for Taco Tuesday! I love their new remodel, it makes the place way nicer than before. The food is simple and they have a variety of traditional dishes. I am pretty simple when it comes to Mexican food- Carne Asada anything and tacos galore. I love their breakfast burritos with carne asada (Of Course!) and I like that it is served all day. You can't go wrong with getting the green salsa. With that being said their tacos are good, but not amazing- worth it though on Taco Tuesday when a bunch of them are only $1each . If they are really busy it is likely they might mess up your order especially if it is tacos and even more so if it is also Taco Tuesday. Overall a good go to place to get good Mexican food at a good price.
