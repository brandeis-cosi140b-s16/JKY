The fire factory, as I like to call it, is now open on Sundays for Sunday Funday. It's too bad this location is the only one open on Sundays. 

Los Dos Molinos takes spicy to a new level. Some of the dishes here, even for a native of Phoenix, are so hot they are inedible. I've had everything on the menu, multiple times, and my favorites are the Mexican Pizza, Carnitas, Garlic Shrimp, and the Red Beef Burro Enchilada Style. The Jalapeno green salsa is incredible as well. 

They serve up some great margaritas, though for the best margs, visit the Washington Street location as they seem to be better at mixing. There is a reason Los Dos has been around for as long as it has, and has received all of it's national press.
