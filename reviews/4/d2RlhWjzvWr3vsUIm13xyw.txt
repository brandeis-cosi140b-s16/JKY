Just EAST @offthestrip at @TuscanyCasino this place is nice & quiet, no lines,no wait and great comfy atmosphere.

We used the 2 for 1 coupon out of the newspaper. Service was very ffast & friendly serving up cold drinks,chips salsa & bean dip right away.

I ordered the Steak Picado which was only on the menu as a Wednesday special but the made it no problem.

The wife enjjoyed the 2 item combo with a cheese enchilada & crispy beef  taco plus rice & beans.

Typical Tex-Mex, large portions, cooked well and quite tasty.

BEST part the check 2 people for $20!!
