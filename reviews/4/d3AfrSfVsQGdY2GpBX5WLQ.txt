Staying at the saguaro and honestly didn't expect to find such a nice restaurant there. Prices are fair and the portions are large. Tried both the pescado and the carnitas and both were really good but one must try the guacamole with crab, absolutely great! I've also tried the breakfast and it didn't disappoint nice omelette with some toasts with a really tasty pumpkin butter, as a swede this reminded me of christmas which was perfect :)
