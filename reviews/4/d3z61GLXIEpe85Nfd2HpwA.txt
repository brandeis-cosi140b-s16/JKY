A random stop by while checking out a brewery nearby. We ordered the nachos and carne asada tacos (3). Both were very filling and exceeded expectations. The nachos with green chile was delicious and not too spicy. I wish they allowed us to pack some of the toppings at the buffet bar but it was for dine in only. If there is a next time, I shall get fat with multiple servings of chips/salsa!!
