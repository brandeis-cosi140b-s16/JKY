Food is very good, not your standard Mexican fast food like Chipotle in the taste department. A suggestion, several of the meats they have are strange, like intestines, cow head etc. they are all listed in Spanish, so I googled them.they have a great condiment counter, self served. I had a brisket bowl (Suadero) with rice,pinto beans, guacamole,and pico de gallo,  and marinated mushrooms, husband had tacos
