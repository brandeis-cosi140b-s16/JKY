From a Mexican girl, who adores exploring all that Mexican cuisine has to offer, I felt as though this place was an excellent place to experience Mexican cuisine.  I went with my brother and his super fun girlfriend one night and had a very nice evening!  What stood out to me was the kind of food they had to offer.  The regional reach this restaurant has was very gratifying being that in my family road trip travels through along the eastern coast of Mexico to our destination, and my birthplace, Veracruz their nostalgia laden menu stirred me inside.  What was particularly satisfying was the fact that they had some dishes like the fried plantanes (platanos machos) with the sticky sweet condensed sweetened milk to compliment the caramelized fruit.  They also had "frijoles rancheros" or ranch style beans, a black bean soup dish that is starchy and satisfying and brought me back to times of being served the frijoles rancheros by my abuelita, may she R.I.P.  The decor was very nice, and so were the wait staff.  I really enjoyed this place and I have a very soft spot for it in my heart because of the type of regional dishes they serve and their ability to bring my memories of childhood dish delights to my current self.
