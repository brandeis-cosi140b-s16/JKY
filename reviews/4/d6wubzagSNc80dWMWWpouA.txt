Love the outside and inside of this location. Parking lot for the store is not that big but since its in the complex that PV Mall is in you can really park anywhere close to this store. Employees were nice and you don't have to talk loud at all for them to be able to hear you which is always nice. Seating isn't that big, my mom and I went on a Sunday around 2 to eat lunch and there was about 2 - 3 tables left to eat at which would have sucked if there were no seats left. They gave us a paper bag to put our food in to take it home if we didn't eat it all and the bag ended up ripping because the bottom of my burrito bowl was wet so I had to carry my bowl by hand back to my car. I got steak in my bowl and it didn't seem cooked all the way which ended up leaving me with a bad stomach ache. Also they hardly put nothing in my bowl since I didn't get rice which I thought was weird.
