The overall atmosphere is awesome! It's a very fun place to be. The food and food selection was very good, along with reasonable prices. The only area that could use improvement is the service. I went during a very slow night and our waiter often disappeared for long periods of time. Another waiter served our meals and it was 20 minutes until our original server came back to check in. I will return to this location but I hope the service is more memorable.
