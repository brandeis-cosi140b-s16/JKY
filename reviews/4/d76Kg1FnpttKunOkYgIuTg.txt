This is my boyfriend's review since it's his favorite place.

I just love the carne asade burritos, that's what you come here for. I mean the enchillads are ok and the tacos are nice but it's all about coming here after work and grabbing a big burrito. Plus i used to come here after going to clubs and what not since it's open 24/7
