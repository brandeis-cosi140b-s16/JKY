So we were on yet another hunt for some fabulous  Mexican food and Found it! chips and salsa were fresh, the frozen mags were good.  I had the steak fajitas and wow I was in heaven!   The veggies were cooked and seasoned to perfection and the steak was mouth watering and tortillas hot and fresh.  And the serving size is huge!  Yum I will be back!
