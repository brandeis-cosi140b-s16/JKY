El Burro is a welcomed addition to the North Side. I stopped in on Saturday and tried the Carne Asada burrito and loved it. Though they were a little heavy handed on the guacamole that was fine by me because the guacamole is fantastic. The burritos are smaller than what you would get at Chipotle and I personally like that, I don't need to eat a football full of rice and beans. I'm looking forward to becoming a regular here.
