I'm a huge fan of the veggie burro it's got these super yummy mushrooms in it!  They also have a great mushroom and pepper taco.  Always happy to see places with some vegetarian representation!    

Service is always quick and friendly even when it's packed.  

You'll definitely pay a little more then regular fast food, but this like Chipotle is so much better then regular fast food.
