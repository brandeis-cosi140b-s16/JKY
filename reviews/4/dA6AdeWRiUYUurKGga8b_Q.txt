Ok this is how my evening started:My friend Katy and I walked into Aunt Chilada's restaurant At Squaw Peak on 6/28/2014 to have a awesome dinner. The place had a few parties going on, but as usual it seemed under staffed. So my friend and I sat down and we were given chips and salsa and a bottle of water. About 5-10 minutes later a family came in with small children and after about another 5 minutes or so,  all of sudden a waiter comes out and looked me right in the eye and went to the other table and took their order. Turned around and went back in to the kitchen. Of course this pissed me off. We got up and hostess saw me I explained what happen she said it was her fault. That did not make it OK. The waiter should have said something to us and didn't. So we left Aunt Chilada's in discuss and went down the road to Ajo Al's for a awesome meal and great service..

So now we are at Ajo Al's for the first time and I was speechless when I walked out. The service was outstanding our waitress was Theresa who was very professional & friendly. And the food was excellent. As another Yelper  - Steve V was right about the Cheese Queso Dip it was very tasty.

I will be going back to Ajo Al's again soon.
