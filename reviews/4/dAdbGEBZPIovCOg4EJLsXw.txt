Went with my husband to Richardson's/Rokerij for the first time. He raved about this place. We went on a Wednesday night, with no reservation. The wait was about 1 hour. Luckily there were 2 bar seats that became available, so we took them. We ordered the 3 cheese flatbread appetizer and it was delicious. I had a large salad for dinner which was perfect, as I was not very hungry. My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good. The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal, but it was worth the wait and service was excellent. While waiting, we chatted with several people at the bar, and one couple offered us a taste of their appetizer. We returned the favor, when flatbread came. One more thing, do not leave without getting the decadent truffle dessert. Heavenly, but not over done in any way. All in all a great experience. I do recommend reservations.
