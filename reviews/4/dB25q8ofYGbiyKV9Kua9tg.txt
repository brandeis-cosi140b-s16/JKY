Rubio's is one of the best fish tacos you will find.  Sure, it's a chain, and some may call it fast food, but it has been a staple in the Southern California area for years, and has always produced the best fish taco.  And if it is fast food, then I am fine with enjoying this fast food.  Any fast food that serves me a Pacifico with my meal is my kind of fast food.  

Just like most restaurants, at Rubio's, it's all in what you order.  Don't veer away from the classics.  They didn't become popular because they make great carne asada and chicken tacos.  They became popular because of their fish taco.  Their Original Fish Taco is the best thing on the menu.  Lightly beer-battered Pollock (Cod), fresh tomatoes, chopped onions, white sauce, cilantro, cabbage, and served with a fresh lime.  For many Southern Californians, fish tacos like this are like comfort food.  

If you really don't want to get the fish taco, and there is, for some reason, no possibility that you can force yourself to get the best thing on the menu (the fish taco), then you should get the Mahi Mahi Burrito.  They grill Mahi Mahi and serve it in a flour tortilla with salsa, white sauce, cilantro, and lime.  I usually get it without rice and beans in the burrito, but they usually also have rice and beans in the burrito.  This is a very good fish burrito, one of the best you will find, but I still suggest you get the fish taco.  

Also make sure you order a Pacifico or Bohemia with your tacos!
