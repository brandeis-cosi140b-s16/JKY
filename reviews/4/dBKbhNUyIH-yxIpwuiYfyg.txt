The food is delicious - not super authentic it's more Americanized Mexican than anything but that's ok. What really struck me was the staff; the service was great! We actually won a 4 foot burrito - which we had no clue as to what to do with so we gave it away - nevertheless it is an interesting concept to give out prizes at a restaurant/bar. 

We came back another night to party and the bartenders were fun and knowledgeable. The drinks were delicious but the music could use a little variation. The music was primarily Spanish which is fun but not for the entire time.
