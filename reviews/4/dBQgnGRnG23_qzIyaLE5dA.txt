Stopped here for a drink with my mom and we both had a bulldog, which is a margarita with a corona pouring into it, slowly. If you don't know what a bulldog is, you really need to order one asap and give it a shot. 

My only problem is that they didn't automatically salt the glass for us, so I would make sure to ask for salt and the bulldog on the rocks. The decor inside was southwestern chic, and it looked like an upscale modern mexican dish type place. I might go back for dinner sometime, but I would recommend to management to make sure to ask customers if they want salt when they order the bulldog.
