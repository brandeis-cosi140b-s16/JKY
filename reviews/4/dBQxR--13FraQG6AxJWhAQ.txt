My ratings for Chipotle don't vary very much. Either it's a 5 star or a 4 star. The food is consistently good, GMO free, and tastes way better, and is just honestly better than filling your belly with mystery meat at Taco Bell or Big Macs. 

This one is the closest to me currently. The location has much to be desired, but hey, it's a Chipotle, what can you really bemoan about? Also, the restaurant is one of the smallest Chipotle's I've been in as well. I've eaten in, I've taken out, it's been good and enough to make me return on multiple occasions.
