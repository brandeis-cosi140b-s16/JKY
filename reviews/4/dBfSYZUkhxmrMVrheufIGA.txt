I always get the chicken chimichanga platter and I'm never disappointed. It is now my go-to place in the middle of the night instead of Don tortaco, which I am sad to say offered very wet, soaked dribbling burritos the last few times I was there. Cleanliness is OK. Service is pretty good. Doesn't take long to get my food.
