Let's be real, this place has one of the yummiest tacos! From their salsa bar, to their mexican sodas, it was all a thumbs up and a must come back for me. The staff was NOT the nicest, but I can see past that. And it was also too bad that they don't serve alcohol, but for being a 'backyard' taco joint, it serves it purpose and can't wait to come back! Definitely try their chicken tacos, you won't regret it.
