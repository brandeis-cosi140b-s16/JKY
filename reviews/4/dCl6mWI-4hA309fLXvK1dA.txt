I've been to the first location several times. People complained there about the building, the lack of ventilation and all that. Here they don't have those issues as the building is very large and open. 

The food is great, not as good as I remember the same food being at the other location but I wasn't as hungry this time either so it may have just been me. 

This place gave us tortilla chips and hot sauce when we sat down. I jokingly asked my wife where the potato chips were like we had at the other location. Later when I got my torta I got my potato chips and laughed about it. The guacamole was good but spicy. Most other places don't have spicy guacamole. So remember if the hot sauce is too hot eating guacamole to cool down your mouth will just make it worse. 

The place wasn't very busy and the waitress was very nice and attentive. The food came quickly and you could tell was freshly made. I'll be back as this location is much closer to work and home.
