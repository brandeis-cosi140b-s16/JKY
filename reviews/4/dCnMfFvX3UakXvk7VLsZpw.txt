Great little neighborhood-style Mexican restaurant that I never would have found without Yelp. The food is delicious and there are lots of choices. Comparable to my favorite taquerias back home in California. I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5, though, because I feel they are a tad expensive. You want chips with your meal? Pay for a basket. Want sour cream and guacamole in your burrito? Those are extra, too.
