Had a very nice dining experience here.  The menu is a few notches above the average Mexican restaurant, for sure.  Lots to choose from.  I had the short ribs which were deliciously tender and savory.  My husband has the pork carnitas which he also enjoyed.  We both had the spicy slaw as a side--and, yes it was spicy.  Kids chose tacos and burritos and both plates were demolished.  Lots of margarita choices.  Mine was okay--no matter where I go I find them a bit too sweet.  Server was good and knew his stuff.  Always bothers me when servers can't explain items on the menu or don't know what's in a dish.  The adjacent shopping area looked like a good place to spend a few hours but we were there later on. Sunday.  Def recommend.
