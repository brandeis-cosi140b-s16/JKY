This place isn't bad. Despite being a busy Saturday night, the service was pretty darned good. We had our drinks refilled regularly and our food came out promptly (and was hot). 

The food overall was really good. The beans were creamy, as was the guacamole. I love their guac. Their fried ice cream wasn't too bad. The selection of food to pick from is wide which is also nice. 

My only complaint is that the food is a bit greasy. Even the chips that they give you have a thin layer of grease over them, which you notice more and more as they cool off. 

I definitely would come back here again.
