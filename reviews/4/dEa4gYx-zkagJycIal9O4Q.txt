My husband had been craving Chipotle after Snowmaggeden began on Tuesday. Luckily after breaking out of the house Friday we had Valentines day dinner at Chipotle. Although not romantic, the food was great. They were out of chicken, so we traded up for the steak. My husband got the steak bowl with black beans, corn, salsa, and sour cream, while I got the steak quesadilla. 

The quesadilla is technically only on the kids menu, but if you, as an adult order one, they will make it accordingly. Also the adult size is around $6. I thought it was very good, and I tried some of my husbands bowl which came with a side of guacamole. You could tell the ingredients were fresh but my husband was a bit disappointed for lack of chicken.
