We've been eating here for about 10 years now and it has only gotten better!  Mario always takes time to visit with us and now that they have become wireless the service is very good plus they now have a full time bartender so that eliminates having to wait for one of their tasty Cadillac Margaritas.  The Chipotle Shrimp is our favorite but their Green Chili Pork is quite tasty too!
