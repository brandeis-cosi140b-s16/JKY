I have only been here once and I came on a Saturday night so I can't and won't comment on the food service/quality but the actual nightclub or whatever is a lot of fun! As soon as we got to Mill we weren't sure where to go cuz we had never been there before and we saw El Hefe and wanted to go but we also saw the line and at first said no. After going into a couple of places we decided to bite the bullet and wait in line. They absolutely had the BEST music (out of the 3 places we went) and the best atmosphere. I was in jeans, a shirt, and combat boots as was my friend and her bf was in jeans as well.....idk what people are talking about a dress code cuz we had no problem at all. Idk if they have changed their rules since we went like last month or what but we experienced no problem getting in. We are all 3 100% Mexican, and you can tell, and got zero dirty looks or remarks. Again not sure where race or color came into play with other reviews but I only know MY experience. 

The drink service at the bar was pretty quick for being so packed the only thing is we didn't like our drinks but we were experimenting with drinks so maybe they just weren't our taste. Moral of the story- we're coming back this weekend.
