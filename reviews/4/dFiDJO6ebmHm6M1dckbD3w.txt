Not bad by any stretch but it didn't rock my world either.

I would normally give this place only 3 stars but I was wowed by our waiter when the pitcher of margaritas I ordered for the table came to us as a full pitcher in addition to every glass being full as well. Most places just don't do that and it was a very nice gesture to make up for the extra few minutes we had to wait for them to make it. 

I don't know if this kind of behavior can be expected per se, but I am definitely grateful for that added touch and they found a way to differentiate themselves from the hundreds of other Mexican food places in phoenix...for me anyway.

They deserve an honest shot in my opinion. Don't know if I will rush back, but I am glad I tried them.
