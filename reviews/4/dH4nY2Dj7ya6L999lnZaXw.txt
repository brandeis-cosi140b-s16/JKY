The other reviews are spot on.  This is in a food court at Plaza Fiesta, a Latin themed mall (the old Crossroads Outlet Mall) next to Carowinds.  Regardless of the location, the food is fresh and delicious.  You can see them making their own tortillas and nothing comes from a can - not even the beans.  The avocado is amazing.  The menu is in Spanish and English, so you should be okay when ordering, though they may call your order number in Spanish.  Oh, Mexican Coca-Cola too!
