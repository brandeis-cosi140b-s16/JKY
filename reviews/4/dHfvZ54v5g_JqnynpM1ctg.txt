Been to Padres twice now and I have enjoyed both times. Last time I went I took a colleague from work and we sat at the Bar. They have a really cute bartender who was super nice. My first time there I had the lazy enchilada's and wasn't overly impressed. The sauce was too mild for my liking. My wife had the carne adovada and I was a ready and willing to help her finish what she couldn't eat. 

The last time I was there with my work colleague we shared some appetizers: the bacon wrapped scallops and the lobster quesadilla. Both were really stellar. To help wash this down we had some patron margaritas which I found to be very good. I wonder if they make their mix their as it was just right.

We ordered and both of us got burritos. I have to tell you that no matter what your political affiliation I strongly recommend the Obama burrito-yum. I also find their fried ice cream to the best around.

I enjoy the bar area and would recommend this place. If you're looking for hole in the wall sonoran style Mexican food this is not your place. The menu is diverse and borders on eclectic but not as eclectic as Barrio caf√©. Definitely worth a stop, and Padres has been added to my Mexican-Latin rotation. The only improvement would be the chips. If they could make these to order it would be perfect.
