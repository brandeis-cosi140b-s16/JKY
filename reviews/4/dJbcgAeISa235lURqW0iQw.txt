Can't go wrong with a restaurant/bar with a huge pool... pool was very clean and so refreshing. The wait staff was nice too... perhaps a little slow at some times but hey, we were enjoying a relaxing evening by the pool so we didn't even mind. The happy hour deals are good and it lasts from 3-7. Didn't have much of the food so I'll have to update my review next time when I get a chance to go back. We went on a week night so it wasn't very crowded but I can see how this place can get busy on Friday and Saturday.
