We live in Old Town and have been on several occasions over the last month. Great happy hour with freshly made guacamole. I guess the management listened to your reviews because the servers have been readily available and happy to help. The cheese enchiladas are delicious and the menu has many taco choices. Wish they had beer on tap, and the house margaritas are special. Ask to sit in the courtyard, it is a sliver between two buildings with a great atmosphere.
