Nice atmosphere, very friendly and knowledgable wait staff.  Loved the smokey, spicy pozole and the fresh guacamole.  Had the torreados (a variety of blistered whole chiles) as a side dish -- some were perfect, medium spicy and others were knock-your-frickin-socks-off, scalp-sweating hot.  The butternut squash tacos on fresh homemade tortillas were good, but got totally lost after a few of the torreados.  Over all, very good dining experience and would definitely try it again.
