Pleasantly surprised! I take my mexican food serious and I was impressed with the quality of food at this place. The family and I are here on a Saturday night on the patio. It was beautiful outside. The kids had taco meals and my husband and I split the two tacos and two enchiladas combo. When then good came out, they had already split it on two plates and gave us generous portions of rice and beans. We also ordered a fish taco- we will pass on that next time- Too rubbery and super salty. We didn't even finish it. Overall a great place with great atmosphere.
