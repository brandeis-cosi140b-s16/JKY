Maybe it's the heat but the strawberry and coconut raspado is flat out amazing. Didn't order food this go round but being open six months they don't have a menu. They said they offer a variety of tacos and tortas and rumor is they are great. Very friendly. They have piqued my curiosity. I will be back soon to check out the rest of the mystery fare.
