Fun place for the family during the day  I wouldn't recommend kids after dark. This place can get pretty rowdy but also fun. We enjoyed the corn holing game and there's pool tables inside if that's money our thing. Great patio seating but can get very warm during the summers down here. The mini chimi's are very good.
