This is my breakfast place I go to 2 to 3 times a week. 

The staff are always friendly and courteous. Luisa is the morning manager when I go and is always nice and pleasant to talk to when ordering.

Food: I try to be nice and stick with the lower calorie foods on the menu. It's pretty simple and straight forward for the soft tacos I order. Sometimes they skimp on the lettuce and it doesn't look as they normally do. 

The friendly staff is the main reason I keep returning to this location.
