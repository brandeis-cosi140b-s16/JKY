We made it here for happy hour which offered some pretty good deals from 3pm-6pm.  2 for 1 margaritas...although I wouldn't call them margaritas technically...more like Tropical Smoothie w/ tequila..but who gives a crap at $2.50 a pop???  1/2 off nachos and 2 for 1 puffy tacos which is basically a pita made of cornmeal then deep fried w/ all the fillings of a taco.  They also had 5 coronitas for $4 which is a great deal too.  I may have to ride a bicycle here the next time I come.

The tamales were awesome.  $4 a pop but 2 would fill you up fine.  We also tried the chili relleno which was only ok.  The atmosphere is nothing special but the staff is supernice and Espee herself greeted all the patrons and was really sweet.  I hope this place is successful.
