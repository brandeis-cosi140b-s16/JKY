I've been looking for a Mexican restaurant in South Scottsdale and after reading reviews I decided to go here. It was very authentic, servers were nice but we had a communication barrier..We ended up getting through that and I ordered two tacos-pork..Had chips and salsa-they have a little salsa bar-like set up-the salsa was awesome. They had a habanero salsa that was soooo good. It was hot and had a good flavor. Had the tacos and they were also good. It was very reasonable and I would definitely go back!

The place is very small so if you are taking a large group..it can get a little crowded...
