Loved it! 

I had a hard time finding this place for some reason. Didn't realized it was on the side of a night club? I think that's what it was. LOL. 

When I finally found it, I thought it was a cute little place. Was pretty quiet, ordered a carne asada burrito without guac. The wait was approx. 10-15 mins? Not a long wait. Took that baby home and honestly, SO GOOD. The steak was juicy and tasted so amazing ^_^. Definitely going to be coming back more often. They open 24 hours, so if you ever have the late night munchies, this would definitely be the place to go to for something fulfilling, cheap, and delicious!! 

Oh, also had an horchata here, was pretty good too. :)
