I had the carne asada burrito fully loaded and my wife had the chicken burrito and thought it was better than any burritos in the area.  I moved here from California 8 yrs ago and have been in the search of a good burrito since.  This is the closest yet.  I also like to judge Mexican food by the chips and salsa and the flavors were good in that area as well.

The decor in the restaurant is appealing as well.  Two big fridges full of beers, two big screen TVs and a nice all around taco shop feeling.

Definitely will go back.
