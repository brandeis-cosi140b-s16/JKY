Update:  They don't have a clue what gluten free is.

Great Value!  I highly recommend!

This was formerly a Taco Del Mar which I stopped going to because of the price.  

I had lunch there today before going into Sprouts.  Today is a Saturday.  During the week they sell very reasonably priced lunch specials which I have never had, but if they are anything like the $3.00 chicken tostada that I got, they are an excellent deal and very tasty too!

Environment: The huge menu is lively with colors and easy to read.  Over all, a comfortable place to have a quick meal.  For "groups" I answered no because it is a small place and the largest table I think sits about 4.  The only think that didn't work for me was the Hispanic music played in the background, but that is to be expected.  

Staff: Friendly and helpful.  When he asked me if I wanted beans on my tostada, I said just a little and that's exactly what he did.  I even got extra cilantro and a few wedges of lime on the side.

Food:  Very good.  The plate is full and appealing to the eye.  They use romain lettuce as well as iceberg which I was impressed with.  Seasoning and temperature of the food was good.  They use good quality plastic plates which I was impressed with.  However, the to-go container is a one size fits all.  They might want to get some small ones as well.

Price: Excellent.  On the way out the door, I noticed a large poster laid out on the table advertising a new $5.00 meal deal.  So, looks like the good deals on this tasty food is soon to get even better!
