Last night I visited for the second time.  The first time, I say the service was horrible and so was the food, but didn't want to give it a bad review off one visit.  Well last night made up for the my first visit.  

I came in with a friend and we sat at the bar.  There was only 2 other people up there and the bartender acknowledge us right away and said he would be right with us.  Drinks were served fast and once we figured out want we wanted to eat, our order was taken promptly.  While we were sitting waiting, the bartender was nice and chatting with us.  Definitely makes sitting at the bar a plus.  My friend said he would come back just to sit at the bar and hang out with him.

The food, I ordered carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  The carne asada was so yummy with great flavor.  It only had onions and cilantro on top and that was really all I needed.  My friend had a chicken burrito, enchilada style and after one bite he was all about it.  He cleaned is plate!

I will definitely come back now that I have had better experience!
