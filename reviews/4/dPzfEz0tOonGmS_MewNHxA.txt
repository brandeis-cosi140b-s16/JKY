We needed lunch after a round of golf and I knew there was a Mexican place nearby that had been Yelped in a good light, so I dug through the phone app to find the name of the place.  Whether I got it exactly right or not, Habanero's was the place we were going to hit - it had positive reviews from most everyone as well as my friends.

The menu is simple - "we have these ingredients - in which form would you like to consume them?" was the basic jist of it.  We both had the steak burrito and were not disspointed.  The flavors popped - I was very satisified with the taste and the large portion.  Basically, it's the same format as Qdoba or Chipotle, but tastes better.  

I wouldn't mind trying the tacos next time - I saw them being made for a gentleman in front of us.  They were a bit messy (but a GOOD messy!) and I wasn't ready for that sort of committment, so I opted for the easier-to-eat burrito...  I won't chicken out next time!
