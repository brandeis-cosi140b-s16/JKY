This place is great, the food taste fresh, the ingredients are all good quality, portions are huge, everything is flavorful, and the tortillas are delicious.  

I usually get the shredded pork burrito enchilada style and it's awesome.  The pork is in a sauce that reminds me of mexican BBQ sauce and the burrito is huge and the 3 enchilada sauce choices are all good.  Shredded chicken with the green sauce is a good combo too.  Try the chips with cheese, you get a big ol' cup of cheese sauce that has some great chile flavor but isn't to spicy and the chips are good.  The tostada salad is also tasty.  

I am from northern california and on every corner there are mom and pop burrito places and SOME of those places make a burrito that is magical, I have been missing that for years in Vegas.  While this is not the best burrito ever it is hands down the best burrito I have had in vegas so it gets 4.5 stars.
