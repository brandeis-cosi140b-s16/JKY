This is indeed a hidden gem. I don't really care for the grocery store, but crawling all the way through to the back, you'll find a quiet and small restaurant. 

And boy can this small restaurant serve the most amazing and authentic Mexican dishes ever! And cheap, might I add! My first time at this place, I ordered 5 things on the menu, came out stuffed, and yearning to go back again. Whatever cheese they use must be fairy dust. Whatever taco shells and starch wrappings they use must be magical runes. 

Do not let the looks of Tienda Los Gemelos deceive you. Because if you do, you will surely miss out on the magic carpet ride.
