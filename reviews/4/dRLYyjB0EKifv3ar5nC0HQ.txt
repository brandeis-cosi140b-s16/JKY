Good for drunks, teenage boys, or people who suckered friends into a full day of back-breaking yard work but are too cheap to repay them with sushi. Need a filler, fast, and fo' cheap? Fausto's! There are other reasons to go to Faustos. Like, tonight, I simply wanted to overeat.

I recommend the chorizo burrito. It's  $3.75. In a moment I'll add a photo which demonstrates how this burrito is about three inches longer than a cheap, plastic fork. It's 2/3 as fat as a Chipotle burrito. The chorizo, eggs, potatoes and cheese are tightly wrapped in a fresh tortilla that's slightly doughy. Usually it's served in a wrapper with a small pool of orange grease, but not tonight. I planned to eat the whole thing but am proud of myself for leaving almost half of it for lunch tomorrow.

On other occasions I have enjoyed the carne asada burrito, which may be better than the chorizo. But I always get  chorizo because steaky foods are a dime a dozen.

The environment is very clean and designed very well for drunks, teenage boys, and friends who....etc.

I feel like Fausto's deserves five stars because, in its realm of eateries, it's my favorite. But that might diminish the value of my very favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas, Molcajete.
