This location just opened and had to grab a burrito before going to the movies. It was great as always. They're forgiven since it's a new location, but they really need to learn quick how to speed it up. I waited 20 minutes. No pork carnitas right now because of an issue with their supplier. But $7 for a giant chicken burrito? I'll definitely be back!
