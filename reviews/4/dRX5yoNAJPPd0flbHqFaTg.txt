If Chipotle is considered fast-food (and they are fast outside of the lunch rush) then they are one of the better fast-food options out there.

In general their food is solid, but the thing that i miss when I dine at other similar establishments is Chipotle's carnitas!  They have better carnitas than 80% of Mexican restaurants in town...and they go so well with their sweet corn salsa!
