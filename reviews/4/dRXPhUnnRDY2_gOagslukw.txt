Tasty salsa, great prices, quick service. 

If he wasn't so amusing, I might have been put off by the frazzled older guy who was our waiter. He seemed to misunderstand my friend's margarita order(he ended up with a mondo sized one), couldn't quite grasp what I was saying when I said that we needed another set of siverware...but he did swiftly refill my beverage--no matter if he gave me water, when I was drinking Diet Pepsi. We all got a laugh from that(including him). He brought me a replacement fizzy beverage, but left the glass that now looked like dirty pond water. 

My Carne Asada was overdone and lacking flavor, but the other items in my platter were okay. Next time, I'm trying that Fajita Quesadilla, that Heather T. was lobbying for. Looked great!
