Love the location of this neighborhood taco shop. Their menu is huge, and there's lots of different things to try for me each time I visit. I ordered the rolled tacos and the carne asada burrito with guacamole. Being my first time here, I didn't know how much food that would be, but for $7 or so I couldn't resist. My girlfriend ordered the veggie burrito. 

The rolled tacos were excellent, perfectly fried, not too greasy. The salsa bar had a good variety of green and red sauces with varying spice levels. My carne asada burrito was huge with lots of meat and beans. The guac was just ok. The veggie burrito was much better in my opinion--I'll have to order it next time. All in all, a nice place with something for everyone. Price was right and they even had happy hour in the afternoon with great specials on beer and food.
