Having lamented the lack of solid Mexican food in Pittsburgh, I was pleased to find Fajita Grill.  Though they don't satisfy my Californian craving for Mexican street food, as one other reviewer put it, this is pretty solid higher quality Mexican fare.  

Dinner started off with salsa with chips, which were good.  I personally didn't think they tasted as though they came out of a bag, although they were cold.  I just took it to mean that they had been made earlier, which is fine.  We actually liked the salsa quite a bit.

My husband had the black bean soup, which he liked.  I tried their Tortilla soup, which was solid (but a bit small, for my taste).  Would have liked it with some sour cream too, but they served it with some cheese, which was nice.

Highlight of the evening was my main entree, the garlic shrimp (al ajillo).  It comes with a salad, which basically consists of lettuce, some bell peppers and carrots, doused with spicy dressing.  It was a little too spicy for me, but I appreciated that the entree came with it.  The shrimps were absolutely fantastic - perfectly cooked, lots of garlic and just the right amount of spice.  Combined with the seasoned rice with beans, and I couldn't stop eating it.

Will definitely go back again.  Try this place not for the usual Mexican stuff, like tacos or burritos, but go for the big ticket specials.  Yeah, it's a bit pricier, but I'm guessing that's where this place shines.
