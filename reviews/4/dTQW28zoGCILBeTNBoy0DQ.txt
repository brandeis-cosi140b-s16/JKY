we found this place wholly on accident, looking for lunch after doing some shopping at the vegas outlets. outside, it is a run down strip mall. inside, it feels like an authentic, eclectic mexican restaurant. it isn't fancy my any means, but it is comfortable with a wide selection of tables and chairs that don't match -  a hodge-podge of pub tables and standard tables with various types of chairs. 

we started with chips and salsa, both notable. like teri c., they happily refilled them for us. a beef quesadilla was next - an overstuffed, cheesy, beef-y version served with sour cream and a little veggie garnish. yummy! i had tamales (1 pork, 1 cheese-jalapeno), served with rice and beans. i loved the tamales, eating both in no time flat. i normally love spanish rice and beans, but here i felt they were only so-so. he loved his beef tacos, proclaiming them sonoran style, and cleaned his plate - including the rice. service was thoughtful and quick, and our meal was well-timed, which lately is a big deal to me. prices were reasonable, including $3 beers. the quality and portions were a good value. there were various lunch specials and non-specials were fairly priced. maybe i was having an off day regarding my rice/beans evaluation, so i'm awarding 4 stars. the food really was excellent.
