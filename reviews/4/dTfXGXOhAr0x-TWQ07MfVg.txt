Same wonderful food as the old school South Phoenix location I know and love, but the attempted recreation of the quirky atmosphere misses the mark.  We felt like the servers were a bit less attentive than at the original as well.  

Bottom line:  Order something off of the "House Specialties" section of the menu or the Special board, specifically anything with Adovada ribs (I just tried a special of soft tacos yesterday....YUM).  If you order a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito, you're going to get a run-of-the-mill taco or burrito.

Los Dos gets extra points for serving yummy beans too....I'm not a fan of refried beans because of the weird texture; these are left whole with some sauce and have tons of flavor.  And that green salsa?  I'd drink it with every meal if I could.  Awesome, awesome!
