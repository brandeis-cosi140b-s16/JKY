Can't go wrong with The Crazy Chicken, really.  Their marinating sauce is unique and tasty.  When I have family in town I always get a meal with some sides and everyone ends up happy and stuffed.  They have sweet potato fries which are much better if you ask for them well done.  The burritos are excellent if you don't feel like making your own chicken tacos, and their selection of sauces goes perfect with any of their meals.  I could eat here once a week.
