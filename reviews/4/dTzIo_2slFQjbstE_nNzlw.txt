Come here as often as possible. This is a great hole in the wall to meet friends, have some great food, where the kitchen is open to the restaurant. Staff is very friendly and the place his dimly lit, but warm. The bar, and tables are made from split trees and the rustic floor just adds to the rustic, New Mexican feel.
