We tried dining here once before but the wait was too long, so this time we came a little earlier in the day (around 5pm) and were able to be seated right away. Now I understand the reason for the wait...because the food and service is great! Everything we ordered was delicious. I could've made a meal out of their complimentary (and generous amounts of) chips, salsa and hot bean dip...which, by the way, is ahhhhMAzing! 

Will definitely be back for more :)
