The food is good but not amazing. Decent sized portions to where, as usual, I eat half and have a full meal for the next day. I would not say I loved the food though. The service was pretty decent, nothing extraordinary. The prices are very good though. My husband and I spend $25 with tip on 2 meals. I have seen all kinds of coupons floating around in those little clippers as well, so keep an eye out! Buy one get one free. This is more of the kind of place where you are hungry but not starving and craving Mexican. They are close so we will be going again, but I wouldn't drive more than 10 minutes to get here.
