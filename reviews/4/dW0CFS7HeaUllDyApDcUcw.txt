Ok let's be honest I'm a white girl from Detroit, which means I don't know a ton about Mexican food. What I do know for certain however, is that the food I was eating at Vitamin T was very, very tasty. I've had the chicken tacos...which are nearly nirvana with a little sour cream on there. I've also tried the veggie torta. Word to the wise: tortas aren't the neatest of all dishes so maybe get a lot of napkins. The veggie torta was so good, I felt like I couldn't eat it fast enough. Picture petite me, sitting on the delightful patio in my jeans and a shirt amongst a bunch of business suits, literally wolfing down this torta that is messy to eat to begin with. I think I polished that off in about 3 minutes flat. I only stopped once during my meal to realize that I wanted rice with it so that I could unlock the wonderful protein benefit of the black beans. After I ordered, the place filled up quick and I was glad I got there around 11:45 instead of noon. 

Another great thing about Vitamin T? You get to play chef for a minute. Oh yes. Vitamin T offers you a salsa/condiments bar so that you can alter the flavor of your dish however you like...hence there should be no complaints of bland food. The salsa bar is a great idea amongst a city of micro-managed office types. This way, Vitamin T gives their customers the ability to take back a little control from their micro managed lives on their lunch break. Don't get too crazy over there at the salsa bar though, lets keep it clean people. I also see postings for some very happy, happy hour specials. That's a win.
