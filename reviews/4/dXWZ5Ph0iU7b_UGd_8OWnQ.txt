When trying a new Mexican restaurant I always order their Mole to gauge if I will return for anything else. Rancho's Mole is the best I have had that wasn't made by someone's grandma! This has become one of our favorite restaurants, but their service standards are recently on the decline. I wish their service staff was as exceptional as their food. 

We will surely return for their outstanding food, but probably order it to go.
