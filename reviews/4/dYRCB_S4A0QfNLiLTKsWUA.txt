This was one of my best kept secrets; I'm surprised it just now made it to yelp.  La Tortotota  is a very friendly authentic Mexican Food restaurant that features  a large selection of "Tortas" (Mexican Sandwiches served on rolls). On my first visit I tried the "Cubana" (pork, cheese, and ham). I must say I was definitely hooked and have been back several times. My second time I tried the Hawaiian torta which has pork, mozzarella, ham, and pineapple.  I was very pleased with my selection because of the unique combination of flavors. I am looking forward to trying out other tortas and venturing out from my usual Cubana. I would recommend going on an empty stomach or sharing because these toratas are big and delicious it hard not to eat the whole thing. 

I would have given them 5 stars if they were not CASH ONLY.
