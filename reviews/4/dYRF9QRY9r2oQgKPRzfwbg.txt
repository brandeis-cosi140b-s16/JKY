Competition surrounds this place but because of the high reviews and raving remarks of the fellow yelpers, I went here..

For a place like this, considering the location, $3.00 a taco seemed a bit steep. Then I saw some tacos being served in front of me.. Oh, they are not those skimpy little tacos, actually pretty big (piled with meat). 

I ordered 2 Carne Asada Tacos with 'everything' (includes their pico de gallo, beans, cheese, sour cream and guacamole). I thought, beans that wasn't typical in a taco i'm used to.. Well, bring it on!! 

Then I experimented with 1 Cabeza Taco because I was convinced by a couple feedback I read and then the cashier sealed the deal. She recommended to have it with just cliantro and onion, so I tried it. Damn, it tasted like the meat was marinated for a year. It looked like beef brisket/finely shredded. It honestly was a Life Changing Experience! Enough Said!..

2 Tacos were enough for me but I left the Cabeza for last and had to taste it, just one bite. My plans of saving the rest for later went out the window after that first bite! Yes, I finished it but was stuffed to the rim.
