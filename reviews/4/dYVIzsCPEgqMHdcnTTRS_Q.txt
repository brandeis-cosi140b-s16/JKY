I like this place. I've been here twice now with the wife. And both times we really liked the food. Elmer's is pretty much right next door. This place seems much cleaner, organized and professional. They have great tortas too. They have Sonoran hot dogs here... Fair warning...I've never had the original from Tucson...but these babies are pretty good with everything on them.
