Now that it's starting to get hot outside I get the burning desire to swim, eat and drink!! All an amazing combination when in order!! The Sandbar brings that sensation to life, well... sort of!! 
I love the misters they have for their patio and that's the sole reason why I agree to sit outside. I also love the sand layout they have with the illusion of a small body of water that to resemble a pool. So that touch is nice!! I also like the happy, upbeat service they offer! 
This place has always been super friendly!!
 As for the food, that is simply okay. Nothing to go crazy for, nor brag about. However, I will say that this place is a good spot to relax and enjoy a good time, and that's easy to do since It has a very joyful decor, and party feel to it!! 
:)  Hope you enjoy it!!!
