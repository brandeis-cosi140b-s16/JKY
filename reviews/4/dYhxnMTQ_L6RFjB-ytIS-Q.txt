Was a fan, still a fan and still eat here. Typical mexican restaurant. Broken english and damn good down home cooking. 

Tacos - uhmaaazing. Real tacos. tongue, carne, chicharron and corn tortillas.
Enchiladas and other staples - was good, still good
Caldo De Res (beef stew) - My favorite. Excellent tomato, tart beef broth. Some kinda water plant squash, corn on the cob, potatoes and just damn good flavor.

Oh and not to mention they are incredibly nice and affordable?
