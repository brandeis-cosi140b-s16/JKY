Pretty big menu, cheap prices and a super fresh salsa bar make this place awesome! 

Not really much about this place is that interesting, except that you order at the walk up bar, they call your name and you pick up your food.  When picking up our order the guy at the counter told us we pay after we're done...well, some pretty lively conversation and a few beers later we promptly ran out on our tab (by accident).  After a few hours my friend realized we hadn't paid and went back to settle our tab.  TaCarbon, just a suggestion, get your payment at time of food delivery!!!!! This place is run sort of like a cafeteria - there's no reason to think you have to go back after you're done eating!

Anyway, the food was tasty! We had the lingua tacos, the pastor plato and Tecate - made for an awesome lunch! They have outdoor seating and some pretty sturdy heaters for the patio - it's a good thing because it was packed inside with a crowd that included a lot of kids~
