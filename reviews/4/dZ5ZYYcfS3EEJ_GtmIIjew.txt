A big rock star owns this place, I forget who, my friend knows.  The biggest draw of this place is that you can eat while you look out on the strip, so the view is fantastic.  That makes this really worth it.  Food is also good.  I recommend a salad (forget which it was but it was chopped and had avocado...) and drinks of course aren't bad at all.  It's a great stop off before going to a show in planet hollywood other nearby casinos.
