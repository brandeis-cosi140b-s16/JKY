I miss this place. The east side is not as good as this location was. I hope they bring it back. A waitress said that the guy who owned this location is looking for a new place, but no idea when he'll buy one. They had a really bad manager back in '11, but I think they got rid of him. The fresh tortillas were the best, and often the whole reason I came here. The other food is pretty good depending on what you get. The pork tamales were always good though. I love the margarita specials on Tuesday.
