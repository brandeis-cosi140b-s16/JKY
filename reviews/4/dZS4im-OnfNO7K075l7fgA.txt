I think I'll be eating here every time I come to Vegas from now on.  My brother took us here because he had a Yelp deal he bought for it but we'll return in the future, deal or not!  

My wife, who is Mexican, was in the mood for chilaquiles for breakfast so that's what we set out for.  Sure enough, they were on the menu and at a great price.  I think most of the items on their breakfast menu came in around $4 and the portions were huge.  We easily could have split one plate, but we ended up taking home leftovers and they did not go to waste in the fridge!

The chilaquiles had great flavor.  They weren't very spicy but surprisingly, my wife didn't seem to mind.  I got shredded chicken on mine and it was delicious.  My wife pointed out that they didn't have any eggs on them but I was too busy scarfing them down to notice.  She just made a mental note so that she orders them with eggs next time.

We liked the bean dip and the salsa that came with the chips.  Actually, chips might not be the best description.  It's more like a basket of tostadas that you can break into chips.  They were definitely fresh and authentic.

The only thing that kept it from 5 stars was the speed of the service.  It seemed like there was only one server, but there was only 4-5 tables occupied when we were in there and I didn't see her checking on their drinks either.  Unless she was the cook too, she was slacking.
