By the time I managed to eat here, both of us were fully in the throes of a airplane-caught cold. Our waitress was so friendly, and so eager to help us find anything to feel better- she brought hot tea and blended margaritas (ice and salt help a sore throat, right?) and when we finally decided on Nachos sounding like a decent lunch, she was more than happy to get us a piping hot meal. 

Sadly, we could only eat about a quarter of them- not because they weren't delicious0 They were!! But we both we just so ill that we paid and left. I wish we had been feeling better, the whole place seemed like so much fun. Definitely worth a stop if you're staying on the south end of the Strip.
