Fabulous, I don't are care what anyone says.  We were seated promptly, our waiter was sweet, funny and gave great recommendations when asked.  I went for the Quesadilla Estilo del Rey con Bistec (Quesadilla with with cheese, sour cream, green salsa, cilantro, onions and steak).  I wouldn't say it was stuffed with steak, it was only a few pieces, which was a let down as it was delicious.  Their sopas are excellent--instead of the kids ordering off of the kids menu, they each had a sopa and were full.  The flan--meh, I make better at home.  Over all, I would go back to have their nopales and to try other delicious items on their menu!  Everything looked so good!
