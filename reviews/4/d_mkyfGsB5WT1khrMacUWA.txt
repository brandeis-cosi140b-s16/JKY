It's not often that I'm this far on this side of town, but one night we were and we decided to stop in to Don Pedro since we have been to the one on Independence a number of times.  I'd have to assume that they are run by the same folks, based on the menu and selections offered, even though they don't look anything like each other.

While the Independence location is in a massive - even cavernous - building, this one probably offers the same amount of seating, but it's in a more traditional arrangement and you just don't notice it because the booths are in separate rooms rather than one big one.

The portions are good-sized, and as Nick mentions, you get free chips and salsa (a common thread among American-Mexican restaurants in Charlotte), and the taste of the food you'll get is fairly similar as well.

Service at both this location and the Independence location is friendly and quick, and the food is served quickly to boot.  While it isn't anything fancy, it's definitely a place that will come in useful if you have a craving for Mexican that needs to be satisfied.
