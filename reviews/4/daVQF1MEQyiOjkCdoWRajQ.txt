My spouse and I are in town visiting and were looking to go somewhere for dinner. I looked on yelp for reviews and we decided to come here. WOW. This place did not disappoint. The staff is friendly and on their A game. Our waitress suggested a few things we tried, all of which were delicious! 

Chips and salsa are brought to your table. The salsa has the perfect amount of a kick to enjoy while conversing and waiting for your order. 

We started with the machaca and avocado cheese crisp, delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The portion is that of a large tortilla. We didn't finish it so we could have room for our dinner. Hindsight, we could have ordered this and split it and it would have worked perfectly.

I ordered tacos. It doesn't say it on the menu but our waitress told us you can mix and match if you would would like to have different kinds and not three of the same. Which is exactly what I ended up doing. Carne Asada, was wonderful and probably my favorite. BBQ slow roasted pork, if you like BBQ sauce you'll like this. I wasn't expecting the sauce and it came off far to sweet for me. However, with the roasted corn, pickled red onion, red jalape√±o... The flavors and textured combined are really good, just not what I expected. The third I ordered was the Machaca because of how much I enjoyed it on our starter. 

The red sangria was a bit tart and my spouses classic margarita tasted like a glass of mixer with no tequila. (both of them)

All in all a very good dining experience. If we fly here again we would come back.
