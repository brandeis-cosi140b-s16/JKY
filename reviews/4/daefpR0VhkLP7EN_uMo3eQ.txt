THis is one of my favorite places.

LOVE the food,  even though I always just order the same thing, cuban sandwich. and love the long strips of plaintains instead of fries.

the drinks are good.  service at the bar is better than table waiters.

on Fri and Sat nites,  LATE like after 11pm,  the music rocks and after 12 gogo dancers come out, (surprising i know, but adds to the fun atmosphere).

I found the prices fair for the size of the portions.  

still waiting to have the discounted lunches.
