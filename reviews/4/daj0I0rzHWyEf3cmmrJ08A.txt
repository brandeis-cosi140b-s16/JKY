Excellent fast mexican food, and the staff is super friendly. The Super Burrito is the equivalent of the Carne Asada plate wrapped in a tortilla. My wife ordered the Machaca plate; it was tasty and she was unable to eat it all..as for decor,  it's basic but very clean.  We will definitely eat here again.
