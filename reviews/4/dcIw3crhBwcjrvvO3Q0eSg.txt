This place is a mix between sit down dining and fast food.  There are servers but plastic utensils and plates.  Super casual and really great food.  The barbacoa sandwich is amazing bit don't order it if you are with someone you want to impress because it is messy to eat.  Great margaritas... A good stop for a semi quick bite.
