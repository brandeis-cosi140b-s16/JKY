I have been searching diligently since moving to AZ to find great Mexican food, and I have yet to find it. However, this place is GOOD. I too embarked upon an empty parking lot. My friend and I entered the restaurant to find it completely empty. After walking around trying to find someone to seat and serve us the hostess appeared out of no where and stated he locked himself outdoors and did not have his key to get back in.  Any who, we contemplated leaving due to the "lack of service," but I had completed my Yelp homework and saw that this was the norm. We were seated, our drink orders taken and left with the menu to make our decisions.
The food...
The shrimp cocktail was wonderful and full of shrimp although a tad bit sweet. I added more lime juice and this helped. The carnitas was flavorful, beans and rice were not bad at all. My friend had enchiladas and a tamale both of which were tasty as well. This will be my new spot for Mexican food. It is so true when they say, "don't judge a book by its cover."  This is by far not the best Mexican food that I have had but it will definitely suffice...
