I had been here many years ago and just loved it! This time I had the Chili Relleno and taco combo. So delicious. I didn't really pay attention to what everyone else had but they all loved it. Service was great, chips and salsa were always full and so were our drinks. Take a day trip to Wickenburg and go eat here!
