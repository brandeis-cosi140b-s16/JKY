PROS:  The food is amazing!!!!  The sizzle is delicious and the sauce outstanding!  Everything is fresh, homemade and delicious!!!

All of the staff are super friendly and helpful.

CONS:  The restaurant is very small and the staff if ill-equipped to handle spurts of business that may occur during a lunch rush.  I noticed a table's order get lost today.  I was there on my lunch break and would have had to leave without eating. Fortunately those guests were not on a time crunch like we were and we received our food in a timely manner.

Additionally, I found a small piece of plastic in my food while I was dining.  I have worked in the service industry and understand how this happened and I am not mortified that it happened, however it is another indicator of the poor management and attention to detail that needs to be happening in a successful business.  

I hope they get it together because the food is AMAZING!  and I will keep going back for the food.
