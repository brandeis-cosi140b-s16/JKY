This is exactly like chipotle, well not exactly, but it's very close. I'm a huge fan of burrito bowls and the ones at Qdoba were pretty good. One thing that I do like about this franchise over Chipotle is that the ingredients taste like they have less sodium, which is very good from a health perspective!
