Hello Rocky Point tacos!  That's right, I was driving by this place looking for a used car in a tougher part of town and could not pass trying out their carne asada tacos.   It was just like street tacos.  The service is normal, the atmosphere is what is expected (see picture), the food was pretty cheap.  Don't take your date here but if you are having a craving for street tacos you should stop by.
