We have taken many friends here for an afternoon drink and apps.  I just love their loaded nachos.  They have delicious pulled pork, a red and green sauce that is wonderful and then loaded with cheese, a little sour cream and some fresh jalape√±o slices on top.  What's not to love?  I keep wanting to try other things but get tricked into ordering those nachos every time!  Try them, I'm sure you'll love them.  I love the patio in good weather.  I've never eaten inside because it is Arizona!!
