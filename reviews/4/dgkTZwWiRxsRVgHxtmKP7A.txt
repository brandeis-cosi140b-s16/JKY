First visit back on May 10, 2012.

Food looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.

$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.

The guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions ("what's the vampiro?" "the 'vam-pee-roh,'" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.

There's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.

The asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.  Give this place a shot if you're staying on the strip, it's on the right hand side as you drive down Las Vegas Blvd, right around the time you hit Circus Circus.  Tip: learn the side streets (i.e. Paradise Rd), and avoid the terrible traffic.
