It has been awhile since I've been to Qdoba because I've always been a Chipotle fan. However I came across a Groupon for 2 Entrees, 2 large drinks, chips & queso for $14. Normal price is a little over $26. 
My hubby and I decided to go for lunch. I ordered 3 soft tacos for my entree. My hubby ordered a Smothered Burrito. My tacos were good. I asked for chicken, mild salsa, a smidge of sour cream, lettuce and cheese. My hubby got mild salsa and guacamole with his burrito. He also ordered their hottest sauce but said it wasn't very hot. The chips had the right amount of salt and they were warm. 
The restaurant and the bathrooms were clean and the employees were friendly. I like that you can get nachos and quesadillas here because you can't at Chipotle. Since Chipotle has been going down hill we'll probably be heading to Qdoba instead.
