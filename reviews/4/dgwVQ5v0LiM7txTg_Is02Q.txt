My wife and I splint an enchilada plate (one chicken, one beef). There was a lot of flavor in everything on the plate -- although it was light on spice. The salsa that came with the chips was pretty spicy so I spooned a little onto the dinner plate. It was exactly what was needed. Terrific meal that hit the spot.

Service was good. Atmosphere is a bit hole in the wall -- which is high in my book. We'll definitely do that again.
