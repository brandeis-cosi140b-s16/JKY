Finally tried Viva Salsa last night and boy am I glad I did. It was hella good and cheap, too!

For $5.95 plus tax I got 3 giant steak tacos (which I ate the guts only), chips and salsa and a drink. The bonus is the salsa bar. They have three different mouthwatering salsas to enjoy and also beans! From experience do not even attempt to put the HOT as hell beans in the tiny salsa cups provided. If you are like me you will burn yourself. Be smarter than the beans (and ding dong over here) and put them straight onto your plate. 

Overall I have to say this is a smokin' deal of a meal in a clean, little nook of the casino. Friendly and fast service, too. I will absolutely be back for more.
