This was my first time at Frank & Lupe's.  I grew up in So. Cal. So I have been in my share of some great Mexican restaurants.
The atmosphere is of a charming old style Catina...nothing fancy but very relaxed feel.
The four top signs of a good Mexican restaurant are...
Salsa
Chips
Beans
Rice....they all were great!!!!
The plates we ordered had good flavor.  Love to be able to taste fresh spices, onion, and cilantro.  
Our server was Michael and he was always there at the right time.
It is the kind of place you do not want to be in a big rush to eat.  Sit back and relax on the patio!!!!  I would recommend.
