Its Del Taco.  
Better than Taco Bell by far, and really good.

This location in particular, is awesome.  They are always fairly quick, and have never messed up an order...and we do a lot of "special" things, like "no special sauce" on one taco, and sour cream on another...

I love the value menus...this is a great location.
