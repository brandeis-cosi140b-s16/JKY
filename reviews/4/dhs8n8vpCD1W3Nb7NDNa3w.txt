This place has the best taquitos ever. I work nearby and come here every other week for their hand-rolled chicken taquitos for lunch. It's hard to describe, but their taquitos are flaky and crisp on the outside while juicy and delicious on the inside. It comes with a bunch of lettuce, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream on top, but I always request it plain because I don't want the condiments overpowering the flavor of the taquitos. 

This place also serves a variety of authentic tacos, tortas, burritos, empanandas, and seafood dishes. I've also tried their tacos and burritos and have no complaints, but the dish I come to this place for is their taquitos.
