My hubby and I visited this new place today for lunch. We got there at lunch opening and it was not full at all which was great for quick seating. It did full up around noon. Patio seating available which would be a nice option when the weather is cooler. Nice decor and ambiance. Casual but also good for lunch during work week. We heard that chef was former chef at house of tricks. So we wanted to try it. We ordered the revival burger and steak salad. Salad came with fries. Portions on both were good. Both entrees were great. Nice flavor on steak and burger. We couldn't stop eating the fries. The women's bathroom was clean and nice but i found it weird that the toilet paper was just sitting on the back of the toilet. Couldn't spring for a holder?? Other than that all was good with this place. Definitely would come back.
