We are back!!!  We ate here on a regular basis a few years ago and then the place and food declined to where we said never again!  We went back again this past Friday (5/31) and although the place still needs a good cleaning and paint job...the food was so what we remember!  I had the carnitas and my partner had the enchaladas and we also had chips and salsa.  No complaints...only full and happy customers!!!  Can't wait to go back for green chili...looked fabulous.
