My only sorrow is that this resturant is at the polar opposite of where I work downtown.

With that being said when I do manage to eat at Mexico City it's always a treat. Everything comes to the table Hot Hot Hot. 

The shrimp diablos is so good, I have never had a dish like it at any other place. The shrimp are large and the sauce is dark red and smokey.  

This is one of my favorite resturants and they give a student discount that my friends is a double win.
