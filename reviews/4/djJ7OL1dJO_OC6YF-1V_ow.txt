Mickey's Hot Dogs is a slightly gritty Taqueria during the week. Ironically, The guy with the mesquite and the grill doesn't show up until Friday! Sonoron Dogs rock! I have to be the first to confess that mayo in a squeeze bottle DOES wierd me out a little, but the bacon and cheese thing is pretty yummy! If you come during the week for the taqueria, be prepared for everything from lengua to barbacoa etc. Really down home, good salsa but not fresh hand made tortillas.
There is really no atmosphere. It is a little gritty. The food is worthwhile.
