I am giving this place 4 stars because it is unique. The night we went it was crowded...but we went because of all the hype on Yelp and my quest for Fish Tacos. The service was good. I tried all the salsa's and only liked a few. And as for the tacos...they were ok. The Shark Taco needed a better sauce and I would have enjoyed it much better. Truthfully, I didn't find the shark tacos as great as everyone else does on these reviews, but then again, I am new to Fish Tacos. I also tried the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, I found this flavor strong (unlike other Mexican places I have tried), so that is good, but I didn't really care for it.

The bad, my son ordered the steak Quesa. He didn't care for it at all, I did like this, but then the waitress took the entire thing away when we weren't done with it and Dave didn't even get a chance to try it. So that was a bit disappointing, given he didn't eat hardly any of it. 

Overall...I am glad we went.
