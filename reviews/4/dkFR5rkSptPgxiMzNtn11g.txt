We tried this place for the first time last night and big were we pleased. Since it was a nice day out, we sat on the patio. Our server brought us chips and salsa. Their chips are huge, btw, and the salsa is addicting. Our server was very attentive about refilling our salsa. We also ordered the frozen strawberry mango margarita swirl, which was very refreshing and delicious. 
My husband ordered the baja which is an enchilada, with chicken stuff avocado which is battered and deep fried and is amazing!! I had the $12.99 combo meal which comes with a soup/salad, entree and dessert. I got the tortilla soup, which was delicious, the grilled chicken fajita and we both shared the brownie sundae. Everything in our meals was perfect. All in all we had a great experience. We will be back to try more stuff but I don't know if I can pass off on the brownie sundae, knowing it's so good!
