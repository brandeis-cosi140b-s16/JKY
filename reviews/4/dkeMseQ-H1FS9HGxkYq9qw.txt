The atmosphere very nice and friendly. They have a Mariachi band on Friday and Saturday evenings.  The food is very tasty and the service great. The combination plate I got the two items tasty, with a chicken tostada and a chicken tamale in the husk, served with rice, very yummy and beans and a bowl of soup. One other thing I like are the specialty sauces you can order in addition, as well as the very hot but good toriados, deep fried jalapenos.  enjoy!
