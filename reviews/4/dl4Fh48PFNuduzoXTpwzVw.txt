I have two major issues with previous reviews.

1) This is not an "upscale" or "pricey" mexican restaurant. Yes, the decor is nice and the building is pretty cool. That does not make a restaurant "upscale". Sorry but it doesn't. Camarones never changed the decor when they switched from "Gardunos" to "Camarones". So previous owner decor doesn't reflect on current owner's level of fanciness. lol

You can get a 4 item dinner combo for $14. Pricey? I don't think so. But mabe that's just me. 

2) They DO have a happy hour. Look at the website. It's M-F 3-630pm. 10oz house margaritas are $3 (refer to part 1 of this review) Hornitos 19oz are $6. 

As far as the food goes? It's a typical mexican restaurant...it's not a Barrio Cafe or an upscale cantina in LA/NY/Vegas (refer to part 1) it's just a really good mexican restaurant. 

I really don't understand all the negative reviews. 

Actually...I'm kinda craving some enchiladas now..Maybe I'll go there tonight.
