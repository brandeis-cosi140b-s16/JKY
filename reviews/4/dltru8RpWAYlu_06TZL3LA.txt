Los Amigos is the best Mexican place around Green Street. They're not amazing but way, way better than the other fare. I have had only tortas and burritos but their meat is very quality; the chicken burrito I had today was pretty perfect, just the right balance of juicy chicken to avocado, rice, sour cream, and beans. The chorizo isn't amazing and I really wish they had carnitas; Fiesta Cafe is like the only place in Chambana that has it.
The only problem with this place is that it's sort of expensive, relative to how much food you get (the burritos are maybe 30% smaller than La Bamba's, say) and the room itself is crowded and uncomfortable. The last couple times I've been there it seems like their air conditioning is broken. I would either order pick up or just get food to go.
