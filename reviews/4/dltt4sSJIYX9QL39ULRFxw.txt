Massive, fresh, tacos. Massive, fresh, burritos. Awesome pastor and carne asada. Tasty horchata. Good prices AND they don't charge extra for sour cream, guacamole, and extra salsa! This is my go-to joint for quick tacos and burritos.

Update: So apparently they changed things a bit since I was there last. They now charge 75 cents for guacamole, which is a bummer. Other than that it is still the same old deliciousness.
