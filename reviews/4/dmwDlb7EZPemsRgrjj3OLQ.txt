We were excited to see a new Mexican establishment open in Southside. Not a fan of the current chain restaurant I'm South Side.

Upon walking in, there is not a whole lot of decor, which is disappointing for me. I love Mexican establishments, not just for food but for ambience. (They just opened, so hopefully this will change.)

The waiter brought chips and salsa. The chips were crispy, which I like, and the salsa was tasty. Had just a little kick to it.

We ordered the choribacon cheese fries as an appetizer.  I could eat these all day long. Fries, bacon, chorizo, and cheese....how can you go wrong?

We ordered the enchiladas mexicanas and the molcajete fajita as our entrees.  The enchiladas mexicanas consisted of 6 enchiladas (2 beef, 2 cheese, and 2 chicken), beans, rice, guacamole, and pic de gallo. Every bite was as good as the next. Half of each enchilada had the red sauce and the other half had the green sauce.  It was heaven in my mouth.

The molcajete fajita consisted of steak, chicken, chorizo, and shrimp cooked with pineapple, peppers, and tomatoes. This entree also came with beans, rice, guacamole, and poco de gallo. Again, every bite was delicious. Everything is seasoned to perfection. 

It was lunch when we ate and I'm not sure if the bar is open, but we will be back to try the bar. With the food being so tasty, I can only imagine what a margarita will taste like. 

Aside from the lacking decor that I deducted a star for, this place is a must try!
