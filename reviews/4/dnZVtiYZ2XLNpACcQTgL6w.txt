I never thought I'd be writing a food review of Dos Gringos. The spot, with four Valley locations, is known more for being a raucous bar in my circles than a dining destination, yet after I ate lunch at the Chandler location recently, I was very impressed with the food the spot offered. 

First off, the portions are massive and are a great deal for the price you pay, since entrees were only around $10-$12 apiece.

I splurged on the deep fried bean and cheese chimichanga smothered in jalapeno cream cheese and sour cream. The burrito was absolutely massive and was served with rice and beans. After chowing down on a generous serving of chips and salsa, it really stuffed me.

My friend got cheese enchiladas, and her meal was also huge. It wasn't gourmet Mexican food or anything, but it sure was delicious.

I had never considered Dos Gringos as a spot I'd go out of my way to eat at, but after that experience, I'd recommend it to people looking for some good food during their happy hour-or as a place that has awesome food to soak up some of that alcohol you've been drinking, since the kitchen is open until last call.
