Frank & Fina's is bomb!  As much as I like hole in the wall Mexican joints, sometimes we want to get away from the barrage of "combo plates" and just get some good food.  The service here is excellent.  The waiters are super nice and very attentive to make sure you have water and complimentary chips and salsa.  Frank & Fina's is also decorated very nicely except this halogen light near the bar area....kinda ruins the well decorated eatery.  We've been here twice and one time I ordered the steak torta and also have eaten the steak burrito enchilada style.  The steak torta was so flavorful and I would have to say that it's going to be my staple at Frank & Fina's.  The steak burrito was a little to saucy and cheesy for me.  But, I was trying something new.  My wife had ordered the Chicken plate.  It comes with a quarter grilled chicken, rice, beans, and some tortillas.  This was delicious and I would recommend it to anyone.  They have a bunch of different Mexican deserts which we opted not to have since we were so full.  If you haven't been to Frank & Fina's don't hesitate because the food is awesome and the services is 110%!
