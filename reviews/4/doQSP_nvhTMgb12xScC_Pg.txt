Arriving in Scottsdale on a Saturday morning, we chose this restaurant based on a desire for Mexican, the Yelp reviews, and the fact that few other restaurants seemed to be open.

We were delighted with the food. We started with the complimentary salsa - the tomato version was ok, but the green chile varietal was excellent and we ordered more - and a generous portion of guacamole.

My wife ordered the tinga taco, which is chicken in chipotle. The chicken was outstanding; I've never had chicken so tender. I had the lobster taco (lobster, fried, and servied with coleslaw) and the carne asada taco, with a hint of lime. Both were delicious.

Service was good and all of the staff were very friendly towards our sleeping baby. 

Would definitely go there again. No complaints whatsoever.
