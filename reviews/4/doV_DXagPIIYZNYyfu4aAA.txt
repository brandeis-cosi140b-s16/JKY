So I can only review one item at Qdoba, because there's only one item I've eaten there since my freshman year of college in Madison... vegetarian nachos.
I love them.

Which is why I was so glad to find out a Qdoba was opening up in Tempe. I'd tried the one in Central Phoenix once in a while, but it was really too far for me to drive to get nachos.

I'm not really a fan of other fast food Mexican food unless I'm really drunk. But Qdoba is different. Because of those fabulous nachos. Black beans, wonderfully flavorful cheese sauce, cheese, corn salsa and a side of guacamole... mmmm..... love it, love it, love it. 

On lunch trips with coworkers, my friends don't seem to be as impressed as I have been. But I don't care. I'll go alone.
