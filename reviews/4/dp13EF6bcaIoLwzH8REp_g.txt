I love this place for their mini tacos. They're just like the street tacos you can find on the border.  The carne asada fries are the best I've had. They use freshly fried crinkle cut fries and you can change the meats if you want. The last order of fries I got were half pollo and half al pastor. The selection of agua fresca includes freshly made horchata, watermelon, mango, and others. Very good stuff.
