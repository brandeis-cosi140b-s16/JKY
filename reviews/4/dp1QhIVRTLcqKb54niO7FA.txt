This place is not bad, at least it is way better than Federico's and to a certain extent filibertos. The chorizo burrito is great just has a little too much tortilla for the amount of filling you get. The chile relleno plate was also pretty good, you get one more chile relleno than I am used to getting in texas. The only problem was that the plate was covered in lettus, so much lettus I had a hard time finding the chiles. I was also not happy with the prices, a little high for a fast food mexican place, it might just be the Arizona economy changed since the 5 years I've been gone. Other than that, it's a pretty good little mexican place plus it's only half a mile from my home so I got that going for me.
