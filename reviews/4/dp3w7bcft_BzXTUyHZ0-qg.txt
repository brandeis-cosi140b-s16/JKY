After not being able to get a table at La Salsa due to the Mexico vs. Argentina WC game, we went across the street to Diablo's and were immediately seated for lunch. 

Our waiter was nice and attentive, and helped us figure out the daily specials (they spin a wheel every 30min., we lucked out with $5 patron shots). We checked out the menu, and both decided on the shredded chicken burritos, one wet, one dry *tee hee*, and some drinks. IT was really busy with the game going on (a tad loud if you ask me), but we got our food rather quickly, and for $60 bucks (2 entrees and 2 drinks), it didn't feel like a HUGE rip-off, just a regular Las Vegas investment.
