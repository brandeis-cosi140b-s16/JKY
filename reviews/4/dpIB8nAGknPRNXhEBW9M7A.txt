I was a little skeptical at first because I am accustomed to good Mexican food coming from California. The grilled chicken salad was delicious especially topped off with the tomatillo dressing. Green & creamy is the one you want. The staff was friendly and even hooked it up with a free drink since they put pulled chicken in my salad when I wanted the grilled.
