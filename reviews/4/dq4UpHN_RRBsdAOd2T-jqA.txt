I went to this place for the first time and wasn't expecting a whole lot after looking at the outside.  I figured it would be good though because we went there for my bosses birthday and I know he has the money to find good food.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the inside nice and roomy.  No overcrowding and it was clean.  
The food was great, I had the machaca beef chimichaunga enchilada style.  The serving was enough to feed me for two meals and I only added a little bit of salt, the flavoring was excellent.
