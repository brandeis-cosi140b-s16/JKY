I go here for lunch almost Everytime I'm in Vegas and it is consistently good.  The corn: amazing. Ceviche is pretty good, but I found the need to add a good amount of salt. Service is on point though, always very attentive and friendly. Will always look forward to their chips and salsa after day drinking ;)
