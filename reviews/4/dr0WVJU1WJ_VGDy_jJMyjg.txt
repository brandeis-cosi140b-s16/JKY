Mi Pueblo is a small place tucked into a strip mall off of 7th St and Union Hills. It has been there for at least 6 years that I know of. 

I wanted something Mexican ish for lunch today and needed to try a new place. 

I was greeted by a nice girl and looked around a bit. They have 30 combo lunches/dinners pictured on the wall. I did not see any other type of menu. I asked about the Green Chili and she said it was good. 

They offer a chip bar with 2 types of salsa and the carrots in hot stuff. LOL The salsa was a fresh tasting red salsa and a roasted chili green type both were good and complimented the chips perfectly. 

The burrito was a generous size and was covered in green sauce and cheese with sour cream on the side. The in-nerds were flavorful and plentiful, the pork was tender and nice sized chunks. (I did have one fat hunk) The beans were good and the rice was OK. It tasted like a nutty taste some how. ?? 

right around $7 and I could not eat it all.
