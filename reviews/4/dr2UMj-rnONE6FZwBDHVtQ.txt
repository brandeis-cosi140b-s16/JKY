YAY!! The new location is open on the north side of 10 on Litchfield Road (the old Ichi-ban location) and the food was just as good as the south side of 10.  OK so the building doesn't have quite the same "character" as their original location, but that's OK.  The staff is just as friendly, the food as good and they kept 3 of the old Ichi-ban tapenyaki grill stations for fajitas grilling and tortilla cooking  .  We will certainly be back, but you do miss the old building a little, but this is now 1/2 way closer to our home!
