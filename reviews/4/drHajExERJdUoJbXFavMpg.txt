It's not just a bakery. You can get freshly made tortillas and the best breakfast burritos in town. They're open Tues-Sat early. Lot's of Gilbert police officers eat here, so you know it's good food for a good value. 
My favorite is the potato egg and cheese burrito. 

Whatever group owns El Zocalo in downtown Chandler also, owns El Sol.
