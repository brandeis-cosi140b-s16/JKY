I am pretty picky about guacamole, but I do enjoy their tableside guac. Only complaint is that sometimes I would like a little more bite & a little more tomato in mine.  The chips are always fresh & salsa is tasty. 

The last couple of visits, I ended up getting a ginormous salad with iceberg & romaine letttuce, diced chicken, tomatoes, jimaca,  black beans, garbanzos, guacamole, tostado shells, etc.   

Did I mention how ginormous this salad is?  Seriously, it is huge  & I cannot eat it all. 

I also enjoy their enchiladas here...although, they recently changed the menu and I can no longer get my fav enchilada so that was a bit of a bummer. Oh well, plenty of other options here, so it's not a deal breaker. 

On our last couple of visits, our service has been fast and friendly.
