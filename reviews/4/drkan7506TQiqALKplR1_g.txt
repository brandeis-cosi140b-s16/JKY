This hidden gem is worth finding.  The ambiance does not tell you anything about the food.  It is very simple, no frills and not much to look at.  But the food...  that is a different story.  The menu is similar to other taco shops,  but the taste is authentic and the best part is that the food is relatively cheap.  I am not an adventurous eater, and only had the quesadilla and rolled tacos; both outstanding options.  Those items and a large drink cost a fraction of Roberto's or other Mexican venue's.  If you're in the area and don't judge a book by the cover, say hola to Santa Rosa Taco Shop.  You won't be disappointed.
