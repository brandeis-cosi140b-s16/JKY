I stopped by with my family to watch the Brazil v Germany soccer game as we were in a rush and leaving Vegas soon after the game. We all settled for Mexican food and the only problem was that the game wasn't on any of their TVs. After asking one of the employees, she gladly changed the channel for us. 
We got the deluxe nachos are a pre game appetizer. It was delicious and it works as an appetizer for 2-3 people. The shredded beff quesadillas are decent enough and the chicken soft tacos are excellent. 
The prices were reasonable, but not the best.
My only complaint was that it took a while for the food to come out, but there were quite a few people there so it's understandable. 
Overall this is a great stop if you're at Circus Circus and in the mood for Mexican food.
