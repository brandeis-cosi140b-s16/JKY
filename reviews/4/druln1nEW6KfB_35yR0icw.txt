I love Baja Fresh. So good. Their beef and chicken are hormone free which is plus. Fresh food and great prices. Not the friendliest or best service/ staff there, but what can you do? Its close to be fast food, but fresh fast food. 
I usually get the nacho burrito, which I saw about 10 other people order while I was there today. I was with a friend. He ordered a 2 taco plate. They forgot to put his order in. Eek. Bad, Baja Fresh. Disappointment!!! He got coupons for next time he visits. Good save there, Baja Fresh. Otherwise this review would be very low. I despise bad service. 
I hate chains usually, but this place is always fantastic. I like the fresh food, always delicious.
