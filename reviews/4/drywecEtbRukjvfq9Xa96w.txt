Napolitos is awesome, and one of my most frequented dining places.  They have a chicken mole plate here that I'm just addicted to (the mole enchiladas are good too).  The Tortas were also awesome in the past, but I'm gluten free these days, and the Mole dishes with corn tortillas hit the gluten free mark for me.

The place is small, and in a pretty basic strip mall, but they've done some remodeling / refreshing lately, and it is nice and comfortable for us.  Not fancy, but plenty comfortable. 

I'll agree with other reviewers, the chips aren't the most awesome, but the salsas are plenty good, and the staff knows me well, and are always highly attentive and pretty proficient.

Bottom line, this isn't a fancy outing for me, but I love this place, and it will never fall off my list of regular dining venues.  At least once a week I'm there!
