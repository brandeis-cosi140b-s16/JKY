Mess load of Nachos(carne asada) came jam packed with lots of toppings, meat, guacamole,cheese, beans and were a great deal for 7 bux. Carne Asada burrito for 5 bux was simple and tasty, not enormous, but def more than enough food. Don't expect a neat and clean restaraunt, as no one was cleanin tables, but hey its a taco joint so we weren't suprised.
