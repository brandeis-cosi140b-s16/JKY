I'd say what distinguished this taco shop from others that have a comparable menu are the little touches. 

They have a little sauce bar with about 3 or 4 types of sauces (my fav is the tomatillo sauce, so tasty!) with little to go containers AND lots of lime slices. People just don't seem to get the importance a fresh squeezed lemon or lime on a taco, BUT THIS PLACE GETS IT :) YAY! 

The flautas come with guacamole AND fresh Mexican cheese sprinkled on top, not mozzarella. 

Prices are very reasonable. I ordered 2 small carne asada tacos, 1 order of flautas & 2 large horchatas (rice drink) & it came out under $10. 

The location is small, but it's nice, casual & clean. They have a TV that was on a sports channel & guessing by the big Cardinal plaque in the middle of the room, they are probably cardinal fans :)
