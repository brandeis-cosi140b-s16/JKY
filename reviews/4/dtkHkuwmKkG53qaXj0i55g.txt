I like Rubio's and this one is fairly close to home - so I go here often. Tonight I decided to have the Grande Bowl with Blackened Mahi (and no rice). Honestly, this was probably the best thing I've ever had at Rubio's! It was just excellent. The staff was efficient too - a great fast-food experience.
