My parents live around the corner from here and it's a pretty regular stop for me when I'm up visiting them. 

I've gotten a few things on the menu and have enjoyed all of them. However my absolute favorite is the Grilled (not fried) Fish Tacos. They have the perfect amount of fish with delicious pickled cabbage and green sauce. With a corn tortilla it's perfect!! I have to admit I have not found better anywhere in Tucson...though I'm looking!

One major criticism is that their classic margarita is awful. Way to sweet. 
This would normally be a big problem but the tacos are so good that it only takes away one star in my book.

I've only gone for lunch but service has always been great! Their takeout is also wonderful. Just as good as in house!!
