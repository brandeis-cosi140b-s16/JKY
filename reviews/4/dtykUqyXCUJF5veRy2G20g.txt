Had a wonderful dinner last evening at Barrio Cafe with hubby and a friend from Seattle. We can all recommend the Guacamole, made fresh, table-side, and the "real" margarita's -- Tequila, agave nectar, lime juice -- none of that rancid "sweet and sour" stuff, thank heavens! I enjoyed the Tacos de Pescado (fish tacos), Bob had the Pescado del Mar (halibut w/a shrimp, scallop, lobster sauce), and Ron had the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork). This ain't no Taco Bell, folks! Fantastic, fresh authentic Mexican food! We finished with a digestif (sipping tequila) Don Julio AÃ±ejo - YUM!
I would give this place 5 stars, except there needs to be more appetizer and entree choices for those of us with soft shell seafood allergies -- Yes, I know everything can be made without certain ingredients -- but if you take off the shrimp or lobster or crab and are not prepared to make it differently, I feel a little "cheated" on the experience (not to mention, price).  And please, do NOT remove the choices you have now as my husband and friends LOVE them! ;)
