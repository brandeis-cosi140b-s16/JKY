I was ecstatic when I saw this location was opening, as I was a fan of the now closed Huntersville location. 

Food-wise it is just about as good as the other location was, with a few minor differences. The tacos are large and served either in soft or hard shells with your choice of the typical fillings and toppings. No complaints here. The flautas used to be my favorite but here they aren't as good as I remembered. I think part of the problem is that they were very sparse with the toppings, such as lettuce, onions, etc. What little there was was under the flautas instead of on top, so the heat (and grease) kind of wilted everything. The tostadas were the same way, with very little in the way of toppings. The chips and salsa are outstanding, to the point of it's worth getting an extra order just to take home with you. Don't get me wrong, what food I did get tasted great but just not exactly as great as I'd hoped.  

Service is fast once you order. You order at a counter and then they bring it to you. The order takers have been very friendly and accommodating to any order modifications each time I've been. Here's a hint...if you're a teacher, military, police or fire, you get a 10% discount.

I almost forgot the hot sauce bar. They have about a dozen kinds for you to sample and little cups with lids for you to use if you're taking out. It's pretty cool. 

I'm still a fan. It's on my way home from work so I'm sure I'll be hitting them up for takeout quite often.
