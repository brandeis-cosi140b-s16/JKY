Cash only. My only issue.

I love their red sauce. Just love it. A large bag of chips is $3 and comes with 12 oz of the sauce. A small bag is $2 and comes with 6 oz of the sauce. It's the best red sauce I've ever had.

I love their carne asada, but my girlfriend doesn't like their cheese so I go myself now.
