Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.  
Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list.
