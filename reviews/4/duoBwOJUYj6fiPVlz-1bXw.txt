I sure like this place.  It's the "go-to" Mexican restaurant for meeting friends in Las Vegas.  I've been four times.  It's been excellent every time.

Service is outstanding.  Quick friendly seating, attentive waitstaff, and an eagerness to get everything right.  I once had a dish that wasn't as hot as I wanted and they fell over themselves to please me -- getting it exactly right the second time.  I don't eat onions.  No problema.  I want extra sauce, or sauce on the side, or extra jalapenos.  No problema.

My latest visit, with my good friend Andrei, was typical.  I had a monstrously large Caldo de Pollo (Chicken Soup) as a dinner.  Wonderfully ample white meat chicken -- at least a breast, maybe a breast and a half.  The cilantro was fresh.  The other spices delicious.  My friends garlic chicken was similarly spectacular -- even without the red peppers he's allergic to.  All the chips, salsa, and guac that you could want.  And a price that left money for our main purpose -- playing poker.

I love variety.  And Las Vegas probably has more Mexican restaurants than any city, including Mexico D.F..  Even so, a trip to this city always includes a trip to this restaurant -- so sure am I of getting a high quality, reasonably priced, delicious meal.
