There happy hour is pretty good. The tacos are cheap and they have some other rather affordable options. Sorry to say I don't remember the exact prices. Beers are also affordable and the happy hour food options are both satisfying and filling.

The happy hour prices are only available in the bar and the seating is somewhat limited, so unless you're willing to wait for those seats or get there right when happy hour starts you might not want to try it.

Service is prompt and helpful and I have been pretty satisfied every time we've been.
