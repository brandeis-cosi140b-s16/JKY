They should have wet wipes instead of napkins, and I mean that as a compliment.

Despite some incredibly enticing flavor combos in specialty selections, I had an "ordinary" cheese burger with a slice of green chile. I say "ordinary" with quotation marks because, in addition to the standard lettuce, tomato and special sauce, it came topped with cucumber and pickled onion (which were awesome!).  

These burgers are THIN -- you get 2 2oz patties that are still pink inside. That's a quarter of a pound when you're done with it FYI. 

We happened to go on the night their Diners, Drive Ins and Dives episode was to air; so, of course, I looked forward to tuning in and comparing notes! ;)

You know what they totally missed!? Besides these kick ass burgers they have this freakishly awesome, no-doubt-addictive seasoning on the seasoned fries. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM! First, I thought my boyfriend's "brûlée" bun got on our fries and then I felt the heat followed by a mild tang and I realized: that's the seasoning!! OMG! 

If the burgers don't bring you back (and I suspect they will) then these fries DEFINITELY will!
