Cantina has pretty fantastic Mexican food. I love their guacamole, and have never had a bad dish. My office had our Christmas/holiday luncheon two weeks ago. We were given a semiprivate room behind the bar & had a really great experience. I hate that I don't remember our server's name, but he was uber responsive and managed a crowd of 15 like a champ. He kept our drinks and chip baskets full and the food came out quickly + all of the orders were correct! 

You honestly can't go wrong with Cantina... the only reason I haven't been back since is I'm on the paleo diet and can't resist the temptation of chips at Mexican. Once I'm off the diet wagon again, I'll be back :)
