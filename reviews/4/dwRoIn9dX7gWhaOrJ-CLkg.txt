This is a nice alternative to a sit down restaurant. I actually appreciate getting my own chips and salsa! I recommend the machaca burro, and my husband loves their chile relleno. The price is reasonable, and the staff are friendly. I would like to give it 5 stars.
However they switched to paper plates, which sweat, and they no longer have their great margaritas. Try this little place, worth the trip.
