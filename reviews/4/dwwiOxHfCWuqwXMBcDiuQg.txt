The bf and I wanted to check this place out for a while, we had even gone once on a Sunday, but sadly it was closed. 
So we went back last week, and it was delightful. It reminds me of a little place you might find in Venice beach. We both had the three tacos. He had some kind of meat and thoroughly enjoyed it, I had the black beans. Fresh ingredients, yummy salsa, and flavored blended lemonades (try the pineapple! Mmmm), made for a great lunch.
