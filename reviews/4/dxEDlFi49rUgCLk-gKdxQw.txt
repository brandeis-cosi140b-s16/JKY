We had an Entertainment Book coupon and checked their ratings on yelp so we decided to give La Barquita a try. The place is a dive and was pretty much as expected after reading the reviews. It was clean and the servers were friendly and helpful. We decided to try the combos and that was a good choice. There was plenty of food and it was very fresh and cooked properly. The salsa was very flavorful but a bit mild so we asked for some hotter salsa. The waitress mixed some of the Habanera in with it and it was perfect. Their Chili Rellinos were some of the best I have had. Overall it was a nice meal and I would recommend their food to anyone just realize the place is very divey but overall enjoyable.
