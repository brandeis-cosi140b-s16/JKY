I had the Pollo Torta...and for $7, it is an insanely large sandwich with mounds of fresh chicken and delicious condiments (like the black bean spread or the fresh cabbage).  You've gotta ask for the "avocado crema" to be added to whatever you order!  I was thoroughly satisfied, and am excited about its great location downtown!
