Another consistent visit at OTB.  I had the queso chicken this time and it was really good.  Big piece of chicken with some really yummy lemon cilantro rice and veggies!  Great birthday dinner out with a group of 9 with no wait on a Sunday evening.  Great servce with Chris and everyone seemed please with their selections except for my sister who had a citrus salad that she felt like would have been better if the chicken was hot and not served cold.  

Of course had to do the obligatory swinging of the napkin while the crew sang...but I did get a brownie with ice cream that was ok...brownie was a little too cooked for me, but a nice treat nonetheless.
