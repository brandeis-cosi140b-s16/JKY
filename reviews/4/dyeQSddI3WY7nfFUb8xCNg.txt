Was looking for somewhere to eat with my bf and saw this place and decided to try it out. My bf loves burritos so it wasn't to hard to sell him on this new place. 

I personally loved my super burrito, so fresh and cooked just right. The guac was tasty and the salsa was not overpowering the flavor of the carne asada. I enjoyed the tortilla also, as it was not thick like store bought ones. You got a little side of chips with the burrito and wish I would order more, next time! They where real tortilla chips and not overcooked. Maybe try some nachos?! 

For a drink we both order some horchata. For us it was not very good, it had way to much cinnamon in it which just made it taste unappealing. Next time just go with a fountain drink. Also, that atmosphere was quiet and not very appealing to sit and eat in. I may just stop here on my lunch break and take it to go. 

Overall definitely a place to visit more often around work.
