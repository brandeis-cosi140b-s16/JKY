Probably the best breakfast burrito known to man! I had the egg and potato add pollo asado.  From the fresh handmade tortilla to the juicy chicken this is a world class burrito.  Their salsa has the right combination of flavors and spice to compliment the excellent food. The only drawback is the wait, but food this delicious is well worth the wait.
