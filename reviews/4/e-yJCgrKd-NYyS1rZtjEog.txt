First, let it be known that this is another Phoenix establishment that I have been eating at for all of my life, with the exception for the past few years while it was (sadly) closed.

I really, really, really like Don Jose.  It's simple, no fuss and very affordable. And it's TASTY!  The staff has always been friendly in that "neighborhood restaurant" kind of way.  They hand you menus on the way in and tell you to sit where you like.  The glasses are cheap and brown and plastic, but thanks to the efficient bus staff, never empty.  The salsa (ahem, hot sauce), and chips are simple but yet it's impossible to stop shoveling them in, meanwhile insisiting that "I'm going to stop with this one, so I have room for my dinner."  And then, there's the quesdadilla - flat, thin, crispy, cheesey and delicious!  Is this the BEST mexican restaurant in all of Phoenix?  Maybe not...but what they do, they do very well!  So glad to have them back!
