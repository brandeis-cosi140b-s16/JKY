Of the non-chain Mexican food places in my area, this is the closest to where I live but it took me a few years to finally try it out. That's because it doesn't have the flashy signs and banners that the other places have, and because the small, somewhat run-down building fades into the background of the countless business and food establishments in the area. But while it serves standard small Mexican food joint fare, the food here is good; not exactly fast food, as it took a while for me to get what I ordered, but the quality is a tad above that of the ubiquitous 'Berto-type  restaurants of the Valley.
