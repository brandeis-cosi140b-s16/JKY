This seriously is one of the best Mexican restaurants in town. The food was delicious, my husband had the Rico burrito and I had the chicken fajita burrito both were excellent. The chips and salsa was also really good. We loved the decor, service was great. It is a bit pricey though. Overall, great experience.
