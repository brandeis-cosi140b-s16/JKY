We went to the "friends and family" opening of Maverick Rock Taco tonight and I must say, I can't wait to go back to try the regular menu.  Tonight, they had an assortment of chips and salsas and guacamole. In addition, they had shrimp skewers, chicken wings, sliders, and sausages.  I am not a huge fan of chicken wings, but theirs were really good.  I also loved the pineapple-mango salsa. Delish!  To go along with the light bites, they were serving up various Mexican beers and yummy white sangria. They also had a DJ spinning actual vinyl... too cool!
