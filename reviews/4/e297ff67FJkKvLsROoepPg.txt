The Sampler with carnitas was a winner. Tender chunks of pork love.

Chicken en Rojo, chicken breast was a bit dry, but had a great sauce. I adored the half cob on a stick, sprinkled with a creamy white cheese. 

The mashed potatoes with a ladle of queso was delightful. Hey, that's not green onion, its pablano with a slightly noticeable heat.

If you appreciate good service, ask for Amanda's station.
