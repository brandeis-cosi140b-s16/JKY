I went to the Mission this weekend for the first time in a couple months.  (My wife and I generally find ourselves there at least once a month--it's our favorite spot in town).  But since I hadn't been in a while, I forgot how great it is.

Ambiance: Couldn't get any better.  Candlelit and romantic.  Music is always hip--tends to get pretty loud on the weekends. 

Service: We've had probably 5 or 6 different servers.  They are always friendly and full of knowledge about the menu, and great at making recommendations. 

Food: Amazing.  I had the green chile duck this time.  One of my new favorites.  My wife always gets the peruvian stew and the black cod.  Perfect. (We never skip out on dessert.  The pumpkin bread pudding is to die for.)

Drinks: Eclectic wine selection--mostly stuff I don't know about, but we had south american pinot noir that was delicious.  Also, take a look at the tequila flights! (if you dare...) The margaritas are supposed to be the specialty here...Love the blood orange and their "skinny".  Did NOT love the ginger and spice one...

Experience: My only issue is that the meal tends to be distracting, as the tables are quite close together, and there is ALWAYS hustle and bustle in this place, so I wouldn't necessarily use it for important nights (i.e. proposals or something).  But for a night out on the town, and to see some of Scottsdale's prettiest people, I wouldn't miss it.
