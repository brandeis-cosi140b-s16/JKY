Fun vibe and great staff. We came for happy hour and sat at a booth in their indoor/outdoor dining room. Free chips and salsa all night long. Drinks ranged from good to great. Love the $5 mini-pitchers. I forgot how much I like the San Tan Epicenter, which I used to order from Postino next door.  Some of the cocktails were a little sweet for my liking but they offered good pours. The aguas frescas tasted good too but I had to ask for some extra kick from the not-as-strong liqueurs. Can't say anything about food other than it seemed overpriced. Irrelevant side note: I really enjoyed the wheel knobs on the bathroom sinks.
