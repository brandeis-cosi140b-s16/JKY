This place is a solid taco stop. A huge step up from other fast food Mexican/taco shops, but the prices are so affordable! I tried the chicken enchiladas and would order them again for sure. The pepper/salsa bar is a nice touch for customization. Also, I love that they serve their breakfast all day as I'm a sucker for chorizo, and I'll have to try the breakfast burrito next time!
