My boyfriend has been raving about this place and that it's possibly better than Dos Reales.  Uh. Burrito King? Yes, the name is terrible and it sounds really shady but I wanted to see for myself. I have to agree with the previous review. The menu at Burrito King is very similar to Dos Reales, and they have same drill of greeting you, taking your order, and throwing some chips and salsa at your face... lovely. I thought the place wasn't too bad. It was a little cramp but hey, it's Green Street. I thought the mexican rice was flavorful... I didn't really touch the beans but my chicken chimichangas were pretty tasty. Maybe it's because it's a deep fried burrito. I mean,  anything soaked in fat is tasty. Anyways, I wouldn't mind going to Burrito King again. Plus it's a nice walk from campus.
