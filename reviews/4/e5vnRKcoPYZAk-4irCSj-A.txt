I'm slowly but surely finding some of the good local(ish in this case) business in the northern Phoenix area.  Two Hippies is one of the winners.

First impressions - man this place is small!  A total of five tables is barely enough to hold the lunchtime rush - in fact, people were standing all over the place.  We were lucky enough to snag a table while waiting for our food and we felt like VIPs.

The first impression I had was that the menu was really diverse.  Tacos, burgers, and hot dogs is an interesting combo; but even within those food groups there were a lot of different choices.

Tacos were $2 each or 3/$5 - a great deal given how big they are.  There are a lot of options including chicken, fish, a few types of beef, and even cactus.  The hot dogs included things like feta and pesto mayo.  

I ordered the chicken and fish tacos, and to be a little adventurous threw in a cactus taco.  All of them were way bigger than I thought they'd be, and the cactus was amazingly good.  It was sprinkled with some Feta cheese and various other veggies.

Two important things - CASH ONLY and no tax!! $5 is $5 when you rock the Hippy palace.
