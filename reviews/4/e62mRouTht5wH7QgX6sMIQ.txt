Walked in at  8:45 pm, floor clean, Tatiana greeted us at the front counter the daughter to the owners, my friend Raymond and I, ordered the California burrito and I had the breakfest burrito, I feel the bacon could have been a bit more crunchy, but still delicious.  We will be going for the Wednesday chicken tacos for 99 cents.
