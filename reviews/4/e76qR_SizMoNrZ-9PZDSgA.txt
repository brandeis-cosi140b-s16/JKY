We passed this restaurant by a couple of times and after looking at the other restaurants available, this menu looked the best.

The pricing was great. The portions were filling and the service was good as well.

Chips and salsa are usually a hit or miss at most Mexican restaurants.  It was a hit here. The guacamole was fresh. I did wish the salsa was a little more spicy, but i guess we need to keep it 'PC," right? Both dishes we ordered were fabulous.

And you can't beat the gondoliers (is that even a word?) passing by singing their hearts out.

I'd go back in a heartbeat.
