Not realizing that you cna make reservations we walked in and they said it was a 1hr 20 min wait so we sat at the bar which took less than 5 mins to find an empty table. If you go be sure to make a reservation or call ahead. I ordered the shredded pork dish and the other person ordered the shrimp taco. Both dishes were good and a lot, I ate maybe 1/2 of mine and so did the person I was with. The prices are good for the amount of food you get. It's the drinks that are pricey! We had ordered 2 of the margarita flight specials which we only liked 1 of the 3. I agree with Brett R.'s review, for $15 you're better off getting a full drink.
