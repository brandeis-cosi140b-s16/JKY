I have to start with the playlist in this joint --  beyond impressed!  Every song was alternative favorite of mine; and I am hard pressed to find a place that plays literally one after another of every great alternative song that I love. But more on that in a minute....

Mexican Grill that serves up fresh Mexican fare in the form of burritos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas.  Had the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and it was excellent!  The pork is on the sweeter side, really fresh and slow cooked in a yummy savory sauce.  Love this rendition so much better than the spicy stuff they serve at Chipotle.  Actually, I would probably choose this place over Chipotle -- the food is just as fresh and has more flavor, and they don't just cake the toppings on.  The staff is awesome too!  They sing and dance and provide a convivial and friendly atmosphere for the patrons.  And did I mention the best part -- the playlist!  This place has a better playlist than most bars and restaurants I've been in -- some Weezer, Everclear, Blink 182, among others alternative favorties, and to top it off -- wait for it -- Journey's Don't Stop Believing! I'm sold on.
