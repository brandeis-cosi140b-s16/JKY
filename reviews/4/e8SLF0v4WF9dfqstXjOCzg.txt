Amado's is Bien
By The Rue

Amado's you are bien,
I am not afriad to say so,
You're not quite muy bien,
But no one has to know.

The Amado's platter,
Is a lot of food and cheap,
For breakfast it doesn't matter,
Eggs, burros or a bag of peeps.

Before when you spent eight,
They gave you a free burrito,
The prices are still great,
Some might even say paquito.

Even though Fili B's is across the street,
It's you who I prefer and choose,
Even though your prices can be beat,
With you my stomach will never lose.
