Went here on a Thursday night with a group of about 30 people.  The service was prompt and friendly.  Our wait staff made sure the everyone had drinks shortly after being seated. The Mojitos were delish as were the Margarita's according to my companions.  I had the Burrito Tequila, which was huge and scrumptious!  The rice was fabulous and the guacamole chunky and mouth watering.

This place is definitely on my list to revisit.
