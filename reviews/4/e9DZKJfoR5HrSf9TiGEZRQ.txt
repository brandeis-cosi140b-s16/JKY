Fun bar, def laid back and staff is legit. 

I usually start at this place when I hit scottsdale. Dress is casual so it makes the night easier and more comfortable personally. I'm not a fan of getting dressed up.

They have a decent size patio which is nice for outdoor day drinking and food is pretty good.
