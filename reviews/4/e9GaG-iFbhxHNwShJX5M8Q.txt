We were introduced to Mi Pueblo by a friend and were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food. The d√©cor is nothing special, but the food is good. My husband always gets a chimichanga and I love the veggie burrito. They do a nice job with pick up orders-- our food is always prepared and ready when we call ahead.
