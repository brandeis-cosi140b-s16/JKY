When you get your meals, I would ask for the sauce on the side (just so you can try it before it gets smothered all over your burrito, enchilada, etc).

I get number 11 (taco, burrito, and enchilada) all beef.   I also get it without the sauce (I really do not like the sauces they put on the burrito and taco) and order a side of large cheese sauce and just dump it.  It's so yummy!  Also get their sweet tea and fried ice cream!  Definitely get the cheese sauce (under 'Dips') and use it for your chips and meals.  

The service I had was also awesome.  Quick, friendly, efficient, and generous.
