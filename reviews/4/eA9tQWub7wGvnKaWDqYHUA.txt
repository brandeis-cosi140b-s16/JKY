We came here on a Tuesday afternoon and ordered 
1. 1 dozen tamales (half chicken and pork), 16.99
2. 2 Beef tamales with rice and iced tea, 9.49
3. free cookie with yelp check-in
for $7 (Used $10 LivingSocial deal valued for $20)

- Great taste! Just like abuelita. haha. But probably more meat and less corn dough.
- I recommend the beef over the chicken and pork. 
- Great service! We asked for no beans, all rice only, and when we got our lunch special they put beans! haha. It was okay though, because they ended up making the lunch special again with the 2 tamales and rice! We scored 2 extra tamales for a mix up in order! nice. 
- Cookie is a bit doughy, but no real complaints. Nice dessert after the meal. 
- We asked if we can get uncooked tamales and just store them in the freezer since a dozen is a lot, but they couldn't do that for us. 
- Not much seating. When they said hut, I think that's what was implied. Table a bit high for chairs. 
- If you think about it, WinCo sells 10 beef tamales for $9. If you have the LivingSocial deal, 12 beef tamales are 20, but actually 10, so it's way better and cheaper to get them here!
