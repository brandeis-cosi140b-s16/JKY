It's a Del Taco, so just remember that going in. You can't really expect anything extraordinary, but this facility is pretty good.

Clean inside, clean and stocked restrooms, and fast service. They readily get you whatever you need both in the drive through and in person, so it's a quick, pleasant, and crunchy experience. Would definitely go back.
