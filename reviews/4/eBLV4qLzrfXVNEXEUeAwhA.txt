Couldnt wait for TF's to open, was soooo disappointed with Longboards, what a waste of good location. Am a Dilworth native and used to think Wads was large as a kid, surprised that TF seems much smaller. 

Have been to TF's 3 times now and really like this place!
As others have commented, the hot sauce bar is great, from left to right, mild to hot, some really interesting flavors to discover. The staff is great and is what will keep me coming back again and again, well that and their Tuesday special Taco Tuesdaze, 2 tacos, chips & drink for $5.  

Cant brag enough about the staff, you can tell they appreciate everyone that comes through the door, and their attention to detail, should keep everyone coming back.
