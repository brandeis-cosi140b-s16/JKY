The hot new place in downtown Pittsburgh!  We had a hard time getting a reservation and for my birthday dinner was sure to call about  3 weeks ahead of time for a reservation-yes  reservations are needed for any day of the week.  Once we arrived we had to wait a bit to be seated but it was cool hanging out in the front watching the master chefs at work (they have the kitchen enclose by glass at the front entrance  For our drinks I went with the red sangria which was delicious-the perfect blend of sweetness. My date got a Mexican beer-they beers are reasonably priced at $5 and my sangria was $8. The margaritas are $10 and not huge. For our appetizer we went with the made to order guacamole. There is so much to choose from so we went with the regular house guc and added a cheese-well what we thought was queso but their queso was some sort of shredded cheese. Not what we expected but very tasty. The chips are great as they are not greasy.  For my entree I went with chicken tacos which had big chunks of avocado, cheese, and salsa. The chicken was grilled to perfect and had the best flavor. You get 2 tacos and I wish it was 3 for the price but they were one of the best tacos I have ever had. My boyfriend had to order 2 types  since the portions are small and went with the steak and pork shoulder. The pork shoulder came with grilled pineapple which added the perfect mix of sweet flavor. The steak taco was a really nice cu of sliced steak grilled to perfection.  This would be 5 stars if not for the price & small portions but so tasty I can't wait to go back.
