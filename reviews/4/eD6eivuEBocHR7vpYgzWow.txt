I won't comment on the specials, but I will say that this place COMPLETELY shocked and surprised me in the best of ways.

We had a large party of 10 but called ahead and a hour later we arrived and were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter was  very nice, attentive and patient (we were a little rowdy!).

Fast forward to dinner and I got the shrimp tacos - WOWWWW! Delicioso mucho! Between the ample serving portion, the ranchero beans and the endless  chips and well spiced salsa, I have already made a few plans to take my family, and meet friends here again in the future - even if the $5 menu item deal ends!
