We've frequented Elvira's since they were a little dive, and have enjoyed our meals. In spite of all of the negative reviews here, we have consistently experienced good service, server attentiveness, and good food. We've been to the new version of the restaurant about 4 times, and have had chimichangas, tacos, enchiladas, shrimp, tostadas. The chips and salsa are good, including the spicy salsa, beans and rice are average but good. We've never had a bad, cold or messed up meal. 

I think of this as good GringoMex, not authentic Mexican food. However, it is still good food, and we apparently are in the minority for enjoying good service.

We do love the bright, colorful decor, it is quite attractive and festive.

I recommend you give it a try...perhaps not during their busiest hours.
