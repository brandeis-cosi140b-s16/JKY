I eat here monthly and have been even before they moved from their last location back in 2008. 

Pros: Absolutely love the food. Fantastic taste and great prices. The people working are kind and hospitable. I've never had a negative experience with a server. I recommend the chicken fajita burrito.

Negatives: Ordering out is a pain in the butt. Every time I call the line is busy and a few times I haven't ever been able to reach the restaurant. I've spoken to employees about this and they think they only have one phone line. There has got to be a change at Geko Grill. Either get a couple other phone lines or get really fancy and upgrade to online ordering. You'll defiantly get more of my business if you do! Also I often use coupons and have to wait for a manager to approve it each time. One time he manager was no where to be found and I was unable to pay for about 10 minutes until the manager emerged from the bathroom.  A cashier/server should be able to approve simple coupons to ensure fast service.
