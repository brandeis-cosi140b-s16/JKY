After visiting my new grandson my wife and I decided to stop in Chipolte for a meal.  Since I am a vegetarian I thought I'd have to get the usual of all non meat products, I.e. Beans, rice, chips, salsa.  I was pleasantly surprised that they had a product called sofrita which is a tofu based product.  I had this in a burrito with rice beans and guacamole.  It was tasty and filling meal.
