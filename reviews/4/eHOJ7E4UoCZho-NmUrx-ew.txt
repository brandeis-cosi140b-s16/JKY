We went here for a work lunch. I loved the vibe. 

I had the chicken burrito. Its quite a different flavor but it was very delicious. We received unlimited chips and salsa before our food arrived. I mixed the salsa with the habenero chile sauce to make it spicier and it was delicious. I actually made the sauce too spicy but it was soo good I kept eating it.
