When I think of Chipotle, I think of fresh ingredients, traditional cooking methods (with minimal processing), and sustainable food practices - at least they try! I love their burrito bowl with rice, beans and chicken/steak. The fresh guacamole, which they prepare every day with cilantro, onions and trace of jalapenos, is absolutely delicious - creamy, a little lumpy, zesty with a beautiful green texture. Their menu, just like their ingredients, is very simple and lets you customize your burrito/rice bowl in many myriad ways. The only problem with Chipotle's menu is that it seriously lacks any novelty - I mean their menu hasn't changed over years and they don't even have seasonal items. 

This particular Chipotle has a very friendly staff and they work very efficiently during the lunch hour.
