Several of my Phoenix friends recommended that I try this place.   They were right.     Very good and different.

     We ordered the Jen red pork, pollo Diablo, BBQ pork, jerk fried rice and pork fried rice.   All were very good but the pollo Diablo was extra delicious. Not as spicy as advertised (the girl said it was like a 7 on a 1-10 scale). I would call it more of a 5 but it was very tasty.  
       The different flavors of beans with fried rice and the spices on the meats made for an excellent combination.   They serve beer, as well, which was perfect with this grub.
       The only bad part were the cookies to finish.  Not a very good end to creative cuisine.
