Wow, this place is a real find!!  Without Yelp We never would have found this little gem.   It's in a lower end strip mall, but don't let that fool you, the food is excellent, the staff are attentive and friendly, and the value can't be beat.  I am always on the search for great chili relleno and I found them the day we stopped in here for lunch.  We are snowbirds in the area and have been back to this "treasure" many times.
