I came here last night with Donald for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos after 2pm). There were quite a bit of people dining inside since they had the special going on, but there wasn't any line at all, so we got our food right away. We ordered 3 fish tacos each, which was more than enough since they were pretty big, and a small fountain drink for only $12.26. Now that was a cheap dinner! The fish was cooked well and the cabbage was fresh. The only thing I didn't really like was the corn tortillas because they were pretty thick and broke easily, but that wasn't a big deal. i just wish there was a Rubios closer to my side of town!
