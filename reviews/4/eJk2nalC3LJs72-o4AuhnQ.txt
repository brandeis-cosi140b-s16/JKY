The food was amazing. Even down to the chips and salsa. I highly recommend the giant stuffed quesadilla. It's enough food for 2 and is ridiculously good. Wish I could say the same for our server, she looked like she wanted to be anywhere else but at work. The food is pricey $21 for that quesadilla but you get what you pay for!
