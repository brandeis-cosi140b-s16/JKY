My family was on the west side of town yesterday and since we don't know that area quite as well we wanted to try a restaurant that had a track record, as we didn't want to take a chance on a local-owned shop.

I certainly wasn't disappointed. The restaurant is clean, as were the restrooms, and I loved the island theme - it give the place a coastal feel, which is nice if you live in Arizona!

I had some kind  of combo burrito that was good sized and gulped down every bite. I was in the restroom when my wife ordered for me, so couldn't comment on the friendliness of the staff.
