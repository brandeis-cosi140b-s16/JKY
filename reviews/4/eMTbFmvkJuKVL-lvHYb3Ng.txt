Really good food!

When I showed up, I was a bit skeptical. It had decent decor but there were hardly any people at 10:30 for breakfast.  

The breakfast menu options were, in my opinion, fair. They had huevos rancheros, chilequiles and a Sonoran dish where the eggs are covered with a garlic cream sauce. I've always been the type to try something new, especially since I've never heard about it, so I chose a plate with three eggs that are covered with three different sauces (red, green, and garlic cream). It was delicious. The cream sauce alone is a little weird, but when mixed with either chiles, it is phenomenal. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the potatoes were cooked in chorizo fat that added a little kick, and the beans were decent and topped with contija cheese (which i thought was an added bonus)  Over all, I'd give the food an 8. 

The service was also decent, even tho I once did have to ask for a refill on my coffee.  But this was because the restaurant suddenly filled up..  

Kudos to the chef, who was able to make restaurant food taste as though it was made by my very own grandmother..  :-)
