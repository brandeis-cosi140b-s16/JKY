I went on a Tue night. The place was crowded but the line moved along fast enough. The employees were friendly - smiling and greeting and working hurriedly at serving each customer. 

The place was clean and the food was as good as can be expected. Nothing extra here. Nothing wrong either. But a very popular corner where people hang out.
