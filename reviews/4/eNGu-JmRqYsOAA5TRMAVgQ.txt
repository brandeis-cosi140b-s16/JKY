Yet another fine meal from Chipotle, I am now convinced that this cannot be called Fast Food. It's just Far To Good to be categorized with Mac Donalds or Taco Bell
The grilled chicken burrito is always great and is HUGE!  It's always two meals worth of food.  Service is always quick so we are always in & out Lickety Split! What more can you ask?
