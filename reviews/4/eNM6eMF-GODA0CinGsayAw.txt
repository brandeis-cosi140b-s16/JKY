This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I think it is the best one in town.

Here's what I like:

The House Guacamole - Heaven! I always order this, and the last time, we had a table side preparation, a clear demonstration on how fresh the food is here - another thing that I love about this place - the abundance of fresh food. In all its simplicity, it's perfect.

The salsa - I've disappointed all over Madison with other Mexican restaurant's salsa, and even for that matter, all over the Midwest and parts of California. I've had the best salsa here - again very simple, but very delicious - and isn't that what matters? Food should be delicious, especially food at any restaurant.

The chips - so good, so delicious. Yes, seems so silly to rate the free chips, but again another sign that this restaurant cares about how food tastes and only serves the best of ingredients and food.

As mentioned above, the abundance of fresh ingredients, especially fresh vegetables, in all dishes.

As for the other entrees, I've never been disappointed. Take your pick - they're all good.

This restaurant has actually moved, and is no longer located on University Ave. They are now on Allen Bvld. I think they have settled in to their new place, and service is back on par.

Bon Appetit!
