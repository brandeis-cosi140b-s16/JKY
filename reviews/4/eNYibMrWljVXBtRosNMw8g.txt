Azteca is rad for a number of reasons: huge portions (come here for lunch, they have 4-5$ specials!), super-sweet waitstaff, and great decor. There's a smoking lounge here that's a mix of villa and sports bar, with high-backed booths and hanging fake foliage. Classic.
Veggie fajitas are awesome, but odd- stir-fried with a teriyaki-style sauce, the flavors aren't super-authentic. The same can be said of most of the menu, although admittedly, I'm missing a lot of it, being vegetarian. But for comfy, ameri-mexican, this place is tops. When they seat you, make sure to ask for the tomatillo sauce-- it's tasty and authentic, and if you're feeling the need to nosh on an over-sized bowl of pickled jalapenos with your meal, it will only run you a dollar for the side.
