We ate here awhile ago and the food was 3 star good.  The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is because of this dessert.  I don't remember what's it called, but it's like a little pillow of dough that is kind of like a pita.  But, it's sweet.  And when you drizzle some honey on top of it, it's even sweeter!  And not just sugary sweet, but Eric Cartman "Sweet!"
