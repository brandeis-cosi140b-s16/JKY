This is a cute little restaurant.  My fiance and I used to live in Texas, so we're pretty hip to authentic Mexican food.  This may not be quite what some are expecting or hoping for in that regard, but their food is pretty delicious.  The service is always good and the restaurant is clean.  Good enough for me!
