Pretty decent burritos, I know they have a pretty big following that loves their breakfast burritos. This is not a fancy place by any means but it is clean and delicious.  Personally, I think that their location on Alma School and Elliot is is little bit better, but that could just all be in my head.  I would recommend trying a burrito if you have never had one before.
