This was my lunch today...

The primary issue that will kill this place's business is there is NO FREAKING PARKING!  Show up with a handicap placard and you are front row, but the rest of us... 1/2 mile during the lunch hour!

Baja Fresh is the exception to my rule: Don't eat anywhere that has a drive thru!  The establishment is very clean with attentive and friendly staff.  The service is actually quite impressive for a "semi-fast food" joint, because they actually have an Expeditor that does his job!  I really enjoyed watching 'the machine' pump out lunches at break-neck speed.  On to the food...

I ordered the Smokey Queso Fundido (appetizer) and Steak Tacos.  The Smokey Queso Fundido is basically tortilla chips and a saucer of a cheesy dip.  It was quite flavorful and rather economical.  While not listed on the menu, if you ask for Pronto Nacho's they will provide you with a 3 oz. version for $1.49 (vs. the $3.49 menu size).

The steak tacos... ehh.  True to their name, all of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful.  The steak, however, was a touch on the dry side.  I found myself putting salsa, which was stellar in its own right, on the tacos just to "juice them up" a bit.  I did expect a little more moisture... and seasoning for that matter as it seemed kinda bland as well.

All in all, I would absolutely return.  If for no other reason than because their receipts have $2 off the next $8 order or $5 off the next $15 order if you take their survey.  I have no problem reviewing food  :-)
