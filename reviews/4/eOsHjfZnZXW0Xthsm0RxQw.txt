I've tried several gringo favorites here, and this food tastes like home-made.  They also have non-gringo food like tongue and head meat.    Many of the recipes are from the owner's family.

Price:  Average for the volume of food ($6-10/lunch)
Service:  The order takers have always been pleasant, and so has the people who deliver the order to your table.
Taste:  Everything I've tried has been AWESOME, and their red sauce is great on everything.

It seems strange that it would be buried in a strip mall, but the food is definitely worth your time.

The Al Pastor meat is awesome!
