MEXICAN? CHINESE? CHINEXICAN??! W-H-A-T? 

Ok, now that I've figured that out I can say that this place was amazing. I've heard great things but honestly I never let comments affect my opinion before I eat somewhere.

There were a few meals that were definitely family sized including both the 20 vegetable fried rice(a must have) and the noodle/soup dishes. The tacos themselves are very different and each has its own unique taste/texture. Duck tongue taco? Yes please!

There was a problem with one of the dishes and it literally came out about 10-15 minutes after we were done eating so we no longer wanted it. Service was a bit poor and inattentive aside from the food mix-up but the food was so tasty that I barely wanted to take off a star.
