This is pretty much my second favorite Messican Seafood restaurant in town, behind Mariscos Playa Hermosa. 

I usually have the platter of fried fish pieces - Snapper Chicharr√≥n. 

It comes on a bed of salad, with an order of shrimp-stuffed yellow Anaheim peppers soaking in a soy-sauce-based concoction.  Hard to describe, but easy to LOVE.

As another reviewer said, their little orange, creamy, chipotle-flavored sauce is indeed SUPER DELICIOUS.  It's good on just about anything.

My one minor qualm:  The chips and salsa are not great.  The salsa is watery and thin, with not much flavor.  The chips are forgettable.

If you can get past the sub-par chips and salsa, this place is great.
