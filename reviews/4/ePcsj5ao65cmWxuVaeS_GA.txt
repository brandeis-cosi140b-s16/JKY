This place is almost stereotypical for the Americanized Mexican fast food, but as it isn't a chain and since the food was quite tasty I feel that I am wrong if I don't promote it. 

I had the pastor burrito, that come with a decent amount of nice tasting pork - and they have coupled this with some kind of pineapple sauce that is way tastier than it looks. As I will not drive here to catch my lunch, I will stop by here if I am in the neighborhood.

Food is good, everything else is kind of a minimum effort - but I appreciate a local business over a franchise any day. So, for what it is.. it's good!
