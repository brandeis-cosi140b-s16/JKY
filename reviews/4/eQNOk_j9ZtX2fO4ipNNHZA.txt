Tried this place after a friend recommended it.  The food was good, the service was decent.  The diablo steak and their chimichangas are really good.  However, I didn't liked the fact though that in order for you to get anything off the happy hour menu, you have to sit upstairs in the bar area which I felt was inconvenient and inappropriate taking a small child to.
