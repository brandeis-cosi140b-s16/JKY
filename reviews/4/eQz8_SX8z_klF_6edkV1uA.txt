We recently ate at the Gecko Grill because we had a coupon in our Entertainment book. We were surprised at how popular this place was! And its no wonder, because the food is really good. They have a combination Mexican/BBQ menu. I had a chicken burrito that was delicious. 

The only drawback of this restaurant is the absence of alcohol on the menu. A nice, cold Corona to celebrate the end of the work week w/ my Mexican food was much needed and I was disappointed. Also, because it is so busy people are forced to wait outside, and in the Arizona heat that is no fun w/out at least the ability to order a soda to sip on. 

Overall though, the food is excellent, the service prompt, and the people friendly.
