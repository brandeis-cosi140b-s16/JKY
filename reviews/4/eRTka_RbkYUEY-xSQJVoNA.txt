There used to be a time when I would have given Two Hippies five stars, but their prices have gone up and quality has gone down (only slightly) since then.

I am still enamored with their carne asada and cactus tacos, as well as with their ginormous tortas. For the minimal price and speedy service, it is a huge step up on the scale of "Mexican Fast Food." (I'm writing this review with the thoughts that Two Hippies can be judged alongside Taco Bell, Berto's and Del Taco as a more-or-less Americanized fast-food taco joint.)

If you understand portion sizing, the portions are perfect. A torta could easily be split between two people (at least, two young women who aren't voraciously hungry. Men, you could probably get your own and finish it.) Two tacos with your choice of main filling plus cabbage, beans and rice is enough to fill you up pretty well. 

You can tell the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The cabbage is crunchy, the hot sauce has a nice kick, and the beans are seasoned perfectly.

If you're looking for a sweet treat to go with your tacos or torta, take a sip of the prickly pear lemonade that they offer, or buy one of their "special brownies."
