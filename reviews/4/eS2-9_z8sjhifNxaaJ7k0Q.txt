Well I just moved from the West Side and found myself missing Raul and Theresa's. A newer one opened in Goodyear and that is where I started going for Mexican food once it opened. Much better ambiance then the older one. Anyway I never ordered machaca and eggs normally but this is the best. After my husband ordered it a few times I had to get my own plate. It's delicious and they serve it for lunch as well if you ask. We miss it. The service at the Goodyear location is better too!
