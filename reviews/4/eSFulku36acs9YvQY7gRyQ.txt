Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials, they have good posole and beef tacos, and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch, throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man.

Like someone else posted, you have to know what to expect.  Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food.  and yup, the food's gonna be a little oily, but their salsa is nice and spicy :)

My buddy from El Paso loves this place cause he says the food is pretty authentic, like what his grandma would make when he is home.
