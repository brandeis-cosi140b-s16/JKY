So from the outside this place doesn't look to appetizing but get past that and check it out.  I have been on a ceviche kick lately and I stopped in to cure a taco kick and ended up getting a great ceviche tostada.  The menu has many south of the border options for street tacos (real tacos).  The price was great as well.  This place is a must if you like street tacos or ceviche also they serve 7 seas soup which is amazing.  Check it out if you haven't been.
