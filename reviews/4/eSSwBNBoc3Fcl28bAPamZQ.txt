This place opened up in the old Jack in a Box location attached to 7-11 on the corner of Arroyo Grande and Sunset.  I wasn't sure what to expect, so I walked in to see what they had to offer.

The place was dead.  However, I don't know whether that was a function of the time I came in.  It was SUPER clean.  You could see how much effort had gone into cleaning the equipment and counters.

I ordered the carne asada nachos to take home.  The price was $8 for a container that almost couldn't be closed.  When I got home, my kids turned their noses up to it (too much good stuff).  So, husband and I rolled our eyes and dug in.  I enjoyed it all.  Sometimes, it's hard to make sure that there is enough good stuff throughout the nachos, but these were pretty consistent.  

I would like to go back with the kids in tow and let them pick out their own items.  Yum!
