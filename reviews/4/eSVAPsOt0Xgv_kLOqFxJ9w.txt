I stopped in tonight with a girlfriend, and was pleasantly surprised:-) Our server was friendly and attentive and yum did I mention the chips & salsa yet lol. The chips were so crisp and delicious we finished the entire bowl before our meal came! May I suggest when it comes to the salsa ask your server to bring you their 'hot' or 'chunky' salsa it's sooo good but doesn't come on to the table unless you ask for it. I personally like to mix the 2 together, delicious! 
The food came out nice & hot and was also very good! I had the chicken flautas, and my friend got the # 7! My meal included guacamole & I'm so glad it did because it was also delish! It was actually made with fresh avocados, & let's be honest that's becoming more rare these days with the local mexican restaurants! So all that being said, if your looking for a truley authentic mexican meal this spot is definitely a must try!
