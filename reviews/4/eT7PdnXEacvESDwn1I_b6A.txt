My first  impression of this place was, wow, it's a lot cleaner than robertos. I ordered the California burrito and my bf ordered the carnita plate. The California burrito was really good compared to other places I have tried. It tasted fresher and the meat was better than other places. The condiment bar was a lot more cleaner and fresher too. The haberno sauce that they have is kind of weak. Lol. When I think of habenero, I think of burn your bunghole off, but it wasn't spicy at all for me (you got lucky my butthole.. Until next time!!) my bf's carnita plate was okay. The pork was a tad burnt so it was just average. The reason for the 4 stars is because of cleanliness, friendly staff, and fresher ingredients and my burrito was way delicious and better than other places. Minus 1 star for the burnt carnita.
