I really enjoyed the service. One of my favorite things to eat is enchiladas. But here, they're inconsistent. Last time was amazing. This time,the sauce tasted burnt, Which is typically how the sauce tastes to me.but I'm not just writing this review based on my experience, my daughter absolutely loves this place.
