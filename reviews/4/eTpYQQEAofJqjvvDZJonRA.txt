I have dreamt about the chilaquiles for a year now. This clean, casual spot is within walking distance from my friends house where I spent a couple of days last summer.  I walked in one day just because it is close and I love local Mexican joints. The ambiance was pleasantly surprising and it is nicer inside than I had expected.  The food is classic taqueria fare with tortas, tacos, enchiladas and my beloved chilaquiles. After several very good meals here I have thought about it for the past year while I was on the east coast.  Now I am back and it is as good as I remember. 

Meals tend to run between $6 & $8 and there are lots of Mexican sodas to choose from for $2 or less. The salsa and condiment bar has also been pretty consistent except there are only a few choices.
