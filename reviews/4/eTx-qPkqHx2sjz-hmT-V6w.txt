been to a few valley locations & this one is still my favorite.
a little bias review since we come here so often the staff recognize us as soon as we walk in. but, whatev. =)

ham&cheese breakfast burrito with green sauce, SO YUM!

sometimes the self serve bar area is completely destroyed but the staff is pleasant enough that if you ask for something not so iffy looking, they most always help you out.
