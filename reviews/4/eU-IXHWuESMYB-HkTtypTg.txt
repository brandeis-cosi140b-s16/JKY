OH MY GAWDDDDD The food here is ENORMOUS and INEXPENSIVE and REALLY GOOD.

Do not go here if you are a burrito-phobe. They advertise "burros" that are easily 12" long, and I doubt sincerely that this is false advertising.

Holy guaca-mole!

I figured this place would be a super-dump cheap taxo-rheeah and I was very impressed with their food. In fact I asked if this was the only location in town since I believe they need to be everywhere like another establishment whose name I shall not mention (Robertos) on this review.

I would pick Baja Taco 3 times a week for dinner if my cholesterol/waistline could handle it... the prices are so good my wallet can handle it 7-21 times a week. For those of you who have challenges with math, that would be one day a week to three times a week.

The enchiladas are fabulous, cheesy, quick fried tortillas ENGORGED with cheese and then SMOTHERED with red sauce that really satisfies your desire for CHEESE and RED SAUCE.

The salsa here is one of my favorite taqueria salsas in town.

I don't want to let the gato out of the bolsa... but PLEASE eat here, you will thank ...me?!!!!!!
