The best value next to cheap bottled water on the strip and a good place to ground yourself back to reality after paying up the nose for everything else...but I'm not so sure that makes sense since Chipotle as a whole has always been a tad more expensive than other tex-mex fare. Oh well.

A burrito bowl here was cheaper than in NYC and it was centrally located.
