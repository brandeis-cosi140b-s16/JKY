I always get the same thing at Eri-b's, Fili-b's, et cetera, and I've learned my lesson. This is the only one that make my burro as delish as it is. 

Potatoes, cheese, and guacamole.

I know, carbfest 2007, but it's just amazing.

They use some gelatinous guac, which we won't talk about, but the taters are freakin french fries! It's not even really that Mexican?! It's a great choice, and the cheese is beautifully greasy. The guys handing you your food are almost always stoned, so they know a good burrito when they're making it.

The "salsa" is also top notch, verde and red sauce.

They only get 4 because of the regret I feel in the AM.
