Chipotle is my life! Haha! They are extremely great at this place! The customer service from the moment you walk in the door is on point! I don't live in this side of town but will be training in the area over the next several weeks! I decided to hop on YELP and look for some food in the area! Low and behold chipotle comes up! Yummmmm! So I always get the bowls and depending on the location from my experience.. You may or may not get a decent portion of whatever meat you choose! Personally the Baracoa is my favorite but so is the chicken! I came here on two separate occasions and the chicken was probably the best! They were super cheap on the barbacoa so I had to ask for more! Other than that they were very clean and delicious! My experience shall keep me coming back while I'm in the area training!
