My husband continually bugs me to hit up a Mexican food place wherever we visit (yes, even in Japan) so when we visited Vegas for a weekend we had to go to Roberto's. My brother lives there and he always goes here for his fix. We ate Roberto's twice in one day. We picked up three breakfast burritos for $12 bucks. The bag the burritos were in felt like it weighed 10 pounds and for the price pretty worth it. We went there for lunch before we headed on an airplane for a 6 hour flight. I had two carnitas tacos and my husband had the chile relleno plate. The carnitas tacos had guacamole and pico de gallo on it and the green salsa they have tastes amazing. The carnitas meat seemed to be charred on the edges which made it crispy. It was really tasty. My husband loved his chile relleno plate and seemed to drink the red hot salsa they had as he poured it over everything. Anyway, even though Roberto's is a pretty big chain in Vegas, the food was pretty good and they are open 24 hours!
