I don't know why this place only has 2 stars but I really enjoyed my tacos. I got the taco trio and it sure is tastey! It came with an al pastor taco, chicken and carne asada. It came with salsa and a verde sauce. They are the size of street tacos and is the perfect meal. They have one of those cool Coke machines that have different flavors of every Coke product. I came here on a taco Tuesday and it wasn't too busy, which was awesome, for my one hour lunch! I will definitely come back again.
