This place reminds me of visiting in Mexico. Upon entering its kind of worn down and relaxed.. the staff smiles at you through the smoky air. The smoke lingering is from the fajitas juices hitting mesquite charcoal as they bring them to your table. Heavenly!

Now Ive been here many times of the years as it's very close to my work. When there are vendors in town we usually take them here as a nice alternative to all the chains that they seem to prefer. So over time Ive tried many dishes here but my favorite is what's called a Pechuga.. breast of chicken with melted cheese served between two flour tortillas. For me this is so good because of the trio of salsa's they bring to you after your sat. They make a green, a red and a pico de gallo so the Pechuga is the perfect platform for all their tasty salsa's. The #15 comes with the Pechuga as well as 2 beef tacos.. the taco's aren't served in those greasy hard shells but in fresh corn tortillas.. Mexico City style! Another great crevice to pour loads of salsa into! Mmm!

Salsa and crevice.. what a great combo!
