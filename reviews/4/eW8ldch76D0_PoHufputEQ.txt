I moved here from Iowa, and yes Pancheros is huge there unlike Chipotle. I do agree the customer service isn't up to par but I still enjoy their homemade flower tortillas and their queso sauce. People are right on here that isn't much variety but I drive 35 min for a burrito from here than Chipotle. Im not saying I dont like Chipotle, it's just it wasnt popular in Iowa.
