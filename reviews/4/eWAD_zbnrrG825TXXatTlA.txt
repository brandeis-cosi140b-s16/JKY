As a Mexican and an avid taco eater, I really recommend this cart. The meats are very good, and well prepared, salsas are also good and they have a variety of great choices, from tacos to alambre, quesadillas and tortas. The only downhill here are the tortillas, which to some people are very important to a good taco. In this case, the tortillas they use some times feel still refrigerated, and usually that wouldn't work for me, but their meat is so good that i let it slip. Other than that, I can honestly say that any street taco cart in Mexico has got nothing on this cart. I personally enjoy the alambre, its a blend of plenty of meats with cheese and easily feeds me and my wife. So, if you feel like some fine mexican street tacos, this is definitely a great option.
