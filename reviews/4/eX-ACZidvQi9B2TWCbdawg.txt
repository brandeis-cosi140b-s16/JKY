Thee best tacos and salsa bar in Phoenix, hands down. Service, not so much. I went about an hour before they closed one night, completely full house cleard out about 30 min before closing. With 30 min till closing they started cleaning up, turned off music and brought us the check. Kinda irritating to feel kicked out after I spent money at your establishment....but ill just have to go earlier I guess.
