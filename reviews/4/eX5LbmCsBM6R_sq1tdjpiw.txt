Okay, so I'm over my abhorrence of Mexican food, since it looks like the only way I can stay with my Mexican food crazy wife for the next 38 years is to succumb to her desires for the cuisine every so often.  So I've found a few things I can tolerate as long as I have lots of margaritas to go with it!  So Teresa took care of me first with a large frozen one, and my wife had two on the rocks with her meal.  We finally made it to our western destination, which was Chandler, and were glorying in our arrival.  I had nachos with jalapenos, green onions and shredded chicken covered in white cheese sauce.  My wife went for the more traditional pollo rico, a chicken burrito with cheese sauce served with rice and beans, as usual.  A very nice welcome to two weeks in Chandler!
