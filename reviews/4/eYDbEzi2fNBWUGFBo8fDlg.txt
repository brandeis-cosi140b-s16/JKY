I've been going to Vegas for a long time and finally a family friend asked why we've never been here?  That was the first time I had heard of Dona Maria's.. Boy what a great surprise?  Food was delicious.  Now this is definitely a planned stop every time I'm here.  Recently went with friends and it was our first stop.  Food good as always.  Shared a pitcher of Midori margaritas to start the trip off right.  They were good!  This place has not disappointed.. I highly recommend.
