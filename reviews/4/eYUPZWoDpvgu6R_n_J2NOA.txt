Don't get me wrong, the Enchiladas are very good, but the menu item I will dream about is called Linda's Homemade tortilla soup.  Now as some may know, I am a soup lover.  This soup is more like a spicy chicken soup, although I think you can choose any meat to add that's on the menu.  Topped off with a bit of Jack cheese and crema and you have yourself quite a meal for $3.95.  Be advised, they get busy for lunch and you may wait awhile.  Service has always been friendly as expected.
