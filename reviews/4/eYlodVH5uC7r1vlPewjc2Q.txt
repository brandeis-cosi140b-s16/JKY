Went to this place for lunch with 4 Latina co-workers.  I was the only gringa in the place.  It's an order at the counter and they bring the food to your table joint.  I got the enchiladas, as I usually do.  At $6.50, they seemed reasonably-priced.  When the food arrived at the table (really quickly), I was amazed to see 3 fat enchiladas, rice and beans on a large oval plate.  Everything was delicious and tasted homemade.  Service was super-fast and congenial.  Co-workers also ate beef gorditas and steak ranchero, which also looked amazing.  Not a fancy place, but great food can be had here!
