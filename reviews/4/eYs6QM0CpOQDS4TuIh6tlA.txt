My friends are in love with Mexican food and brought my husband and I to Casa del Sol.  My fish enchiladas were amazing - I loved the sauce!  I also really loved their chips and salsa served before the meal.  The chips come with slices of carrots - sounds weird, but they are delicious!  We requested more carrots and they brought a little bowl out for us.  The server was friendly, but not overbearing, so that was nice.  I gave it four stars instead of five for two reasons: 1) unfortunately the chips were a combo flour/corn, so my husband who needs to eat wheat-free couldn't have them, 2) the raspberry margarita was delicious, but not much alcohol, so that could have been better
