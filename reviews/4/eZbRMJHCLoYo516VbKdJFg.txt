There was briefly another, different mom-n-pop Mexican joint in this spot that I liked and was sad to see close down. So when it re-opened as El Burrito Loco I had to check it out and see if my dream of a legit Mexican joint close to home would once again come true. I got a tamale platter with a couple of chicken tamales, mole sauce, rice & beans. It was good. 

So I'd say, generally pretty legit Mexican food with plenty of menu items to choose from. I think it's run by a family--mom working the register and running food out from the kitchen, and her two sons cooking. At least I think so since the counter lady said "mi hijo" ("my son") to one of the guys in the kitchen. 

So yeah, go support my neighborhood mom-n-pop (mom-n-sons?) Mexican joint!
