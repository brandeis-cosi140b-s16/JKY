Wanted something different  and I got it  not your everyday run of the mill burrito I ordered the double meat  pork verde burrito and it was spiced right and I didn't want to stop eating it! Full of flavor and a little sweat to go with it. I ordered rice and beans and the rice was interesting it had carrots in it.The refried beans were not runny and had a good flavor

Make a run to this boarder!
