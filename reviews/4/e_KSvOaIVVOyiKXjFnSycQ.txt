The service was great! Walked in, saw empty space at the far end of the bar, went over to find that the space was empty because there were no chairs there but within seconds one of the guys/manager(?) was carrying over 2 chairs for us to use!  Then within seconds of sitting down we had someone delivering chips, salsa and bean/dip.  Then came the friendly bartender service (Adam), who informed us of their happy hour and 1/2 price happy hour app specials, etc.   We ordered the chicken/steak combo fajitas and added a cup of the tortilla soup to it. The soup came out first and was hot and had lots of chunks of chicken in it! We were not disappointed.  You can't beat that for an extra $2.50! The fajitas came out sizzling (just the way we like them) and were cooked perfectly. There was a lot of meat - more than you usually get on combo fajitas.  We really liked the atmosphere and with service and food backing it up - we'll go back and tell our friends!
