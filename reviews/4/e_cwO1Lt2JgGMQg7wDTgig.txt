Really nice decor and very friendly staff. Came here on my way home and when I walked in it was dead... Didn't quite understand but I went to the bar and was helped right away (maybe cause I was the only one there lol). Order the steak fajitas and it was good. Ordered a drink and talked to the bartender saying on the weekends more people come by since they have karaoke. I'd come by there again before I leave Vegas.
