The veggie tacos were phenomenal, and probably the best I've had in a while.  Minus one star for the Margarita, as I don't think they should be served without a salt rim.  

Service wasn't great, but I don't think that excellent service is what you should expect here.  Loud, busy, and at the Epicentre.  

This is a place I'll always go if I'm craving tacos, and queso and chips.
