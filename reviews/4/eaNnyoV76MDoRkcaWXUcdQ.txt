After my brother in-law had endorsed this place we had to try it.  I typically don't travel this far for tacos but, the fusion of Korean, Mexican, American, and Chinese... come on you gotta try it.  The owners of the small restaurant are husband and wife.  The wife was super nice and was always attentive and shared stories of how they started the business.  And, the husband does all the cooking.  Anyhow, business was good and people that were in and out were on a first name basis with the owners (that's always a plus).  We started our meal with chips with salsa and guacamole.  With the chips we were also given Chinese Zodiac place mats....only at KoMex (gotta love the quirks).  Skimming the menu I started with a craving for the fusion tacos (Korean/Mexican) but, then I wanted a plate of noodles...LOL when does that ever happen if you're not at a buffet.  We ended up getting 5 Bul-gogi (Beef) tacos and a rice plate with Daeji-gogi (pork).  We were going to order more but the owner recommended that we didn't even though she could of just let us order.  And she was right, the quantity was more than enough!  On to the quality...the Bul-gogi tacos were filled with green and brown onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, lettuce and your choice of sauce.  They brought a smile to my face.  Also, the Daeji-gogi was so delicious!  For me I have to have KimChi on the side as a pickled garnish.  Anyhow, after finishing our delicious Korean/Mexican meal we ended our visit with a sliced orange and fortune cookies for desert.  The only thing that I had an issue with was the location.  I just wish this place was a little closer and they would definitely have a regular customer.  My brother is coming to town at the end of the month and I love trying to impress him with food spots they don't have back in Chicago.  This is one of the hole in the wall places that will definitely make an awesome impression on his taste buds.
