I'm suprised there aren't higher scores because I'm usually the one who rips places. In a nutshell, this is a better version of your standard Phoenix Americanized Mexican restaurant (Macayos, Los Olivos, Ajo Als, Abuelos, Chevys etc). It's Americanized Mexican food but the reason it's better is all the little things are executed well. The chips were not stale and chewy but fresh out of the fryer and crispy and hot. The beans were hot and had melted cheese nestled in it instead of your typical dry refried bean paste (Macayos). The queso dip was not microwaved Velveeta that got cool after 3 minutes, it was stringy and melted and pieces of onion and pepper in it that had almost a fondue texture. The plate was piping hot to the point that the sauce in the plate was boiling. I hate when Mexican food is served cool (Macayos) and you can see that the cheese is still partly in shredded cheese form (Arriba). The service was also friendly and timely. We were not abandoned, our drinks were refilled.

So what's lacking...flavor. Although the food was hot, the cheese was melted and everything was executed well, there was nothing about the food that made you crave it like Los Dos Molinos. The Margarita was not served in a margarita  glass which I thought was a little weird and it was a little too tart. The hours of operation are weird. The place closes at 9 PM even on weekends!

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's a better executed version of a lot of the Americanized Mexican restaurants in the valley.
