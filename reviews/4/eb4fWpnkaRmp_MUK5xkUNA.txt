If you're looking for a man, this should be your next destination. Men love this place. (A coworker of mine met her fiance eating lunch here and now lives in Tampa, so if you're in the market for a burrito and a cross-country move, you might want to give it a try.)

My favorite? I love the spicy Barbacoa soft tacos (3 per order), in which they use shredded beef braised for hours and saturated with tastiness. Their meat is all naturally raised, if that's important to you. C'mon, not a fan of injected hormones in your meat? Pfffff. But, in all seriousness: the toppings are fresh, crunchy and delicious. Go fajita style, if you're so inclined, the carmelized onions and sauteed peppers are tasty. Tip: If you're a burrito type of guy (or, less likely statistically, girl), they come standard with rice. If you're not a fan of starch, ask them to skip it.
