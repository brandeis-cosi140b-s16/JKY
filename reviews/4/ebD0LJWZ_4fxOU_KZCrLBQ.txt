Hard to find, but worth the search. Had the chile relleno taco plate. Switched out the tamale for a chicken enchilada. The only disappointment was that this combo didn't come with rice & beans. Margarita was excellent. Victoria was attentive & friendly. Salsa could have had more zip. Chips ample & crisp.
