This location is not closed. It has been recently remodeled. And I have to say it was probably the best Taco Bell I can remember eating. Everything was hot! What a concept! I just got a Combo Burrito with no sauce or onion and it was great. My boyfriend's food was equally good. And the fountain drinks were not watered down like every other Taco Bell. The Mountain Dew tasted as it should. I also liked the new dining area. Several seating options with cushy booths, high tops, and regular tables. Very impressive, Taco Bell. Keep it up!
