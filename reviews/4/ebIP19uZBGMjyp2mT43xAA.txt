- doritos locos
- chalupa

I love chalupas so we stopped by randomly to grab a quick bite to eat. It was a weekday afternoon and the place was totally dead, only one other customer there. Decided to try the Doritos locos as well and it was good but my sauce totally overpowered any Doritos flavor.

Quick, cheap, tasty meal.
