Inexpensive and delicious. I had the carne asada quesadilla and it was to die for. 
The place is also spotless as in very clean. The staff is super friendly  and the food comes out in no time. Overall, I am very pleasantly pleased with this chain.
My friend had the three tacos and it was plenty of food for one person. The quesadilla was humongous with plenty to take home and enjoy afterwards.
