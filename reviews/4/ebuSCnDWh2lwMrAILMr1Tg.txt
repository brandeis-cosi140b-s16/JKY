I love this place for quick bites. I first came here when I had a groupon, but that was more than a year ago, and I haven't been back since. Why? I love a good deal: coupons, specials, sales, etc. however, zaba's doesn't offer any of these things (to my knowledge), so it took me a long time to return and pay full price.

Speaking of full price, their prices are pretty hefty for a fast food joint; I spent about $17 on a chicken salad and a massive shrimp burrito. 

Each of the items were large and filling. My sweetie pop and I shared them both and still had leftovers. The shrimp was cooked fresh, but the chicken tasted a bit old and dried out.

All of the other fresh ingredients that you can add (think Subway) are both healthy and delicious. Of love their sweet potatoes, black beans, fajita mix and brown rice most of all.

Overall, I was quite pleased (and full), I just wished they had some coupons! This is feel good fresh Mex that won't make your tummy say %$!&#! after you've eaten here.
