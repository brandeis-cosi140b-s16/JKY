La Perla is one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in Glendale! Now having eaten this food for a long time this is where i wish i could give half stars. Some of the food has changed and prices have gone up so i would lean more towards a three and a half rating. Yet this should not put you off its still one of the best Mexican restaurants in Glendale. Its real Mexican food I love the Salsa and they serve one of the best Albondigas in Arizona. You can eat at the restaurant side or head towards the bar to listen to Mariachi music or play pool. If your in Glendale i say give it a try.
