Excellent food!!!  Great friends and the sangria is so yummy!  Caution:  chips and salsa are pricey.., so avoid them,  Secondly---Be sure to stay away from Jennifer the server as she is extremely rude & beyond snotty...,, (this was our third run in with her-- three strikes and your out!!) .,,,so we opted to change severs and Renee took excellent care of us!!!  Thank you Renee you are awesome! 
As for the food be sure to order the carnitas guadilaria (sp) ..,, super yummy!!!!!!!
