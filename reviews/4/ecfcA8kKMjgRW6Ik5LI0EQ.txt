Good food, best to go when they're inbetween meal rushes.  This way you're not getting pushed through the line and miss out on specific items or extra helpings. Ingredients are a bit better than what you may expect at other chain burrito cafeteria.  

Manager has tendency to penny pinch the extra salsa requests.   If you see him, try to wait until he's distracted.  You'll be able to identify him by the way he hovers over the other staff.  Otherwise, the employees are usually really friendly with special requests and aim to please.

Sometimes items mix when serving, so if you have allergies pay attention to what they're scooping onto your order.

Restaurant is kept clean.
