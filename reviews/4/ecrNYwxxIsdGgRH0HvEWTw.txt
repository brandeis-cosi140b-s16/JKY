Wednesday is taco night; tacos are one dollar. Their hard shelled tacos are a perfect combination of crispy but tender. They break easily when you bite into them, but they aren't chewy. The chicken tacos are very large and taste better than the beef tacos. I like to come here on Wednesdays. I've tried a few other things on the menu and the breakfast burritos and crane as ads burritos are also very good. I don't know if the horchatas are made on site or not, but they're pretty good.

The only thing I tried that I didn't like was the fish burrito. I tried it because it was echo mended to me by a friend, but it just wasn't good. I think it had tartar sauce on it. Also one Wednesday they "ran out" of chicken tacos. I'm not sure how that's possible, but it happened at 7 pm with no one else buying anything there. Tat only happened once in 20 visits there, so it was probably a fluke. Also I don't think they are open 24 hours anymore. 

Better than Filberto's. an excellent choice for good Mexican fast food.
