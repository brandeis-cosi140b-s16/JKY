My husband and I wanted to try a new Mexican restaurant and this was our choice! We loved it!! The Bean dip, chips and salsa were great! We had an awesome waitress (she did say she was new) but fantastic job!! The refried beans were authentic, husband loved the rice too!! The meals were a bit salty for my taste, but otherwise amazing and we will most certainly return!!
