Stopped in with my dad after a lunch time matinee at the movies - he is a big fan of their cheese quesadillas, so we went at his suggestion.

First of all... I live near Stonecrest and frequent it often, but for the life of me, I could not find this place.  I had the address thanks to my phone, but the buildings are not marked very well.  I assumed it was near the chunk of restaurants but you cannot see if from driving through the parking lot (you can see if from Rea Rd, but generally I am trying to merge into the turn lane while dodging tiny soccer mom's in giant SUV's who are battling their ill-mannered children while trying to maintain their lane).  This Qdoba is in the same building as JoJo's and Miro's, but it is on the Rea Rd side.  Parking can be a bit of a pain during peak hours on busy weekends, but you'll find a spot.  

Staff was nice and expedient.  The restaurant was quite clean with seating inside, as well as outside around the fountain or in the quieter courtyard area.  We ordered our quesadillas, got our drinks and were seated.  Shortly after we received our quesadillas which were hot and oozing with cheese.   Served with sour cream and salsa (I believe... I may have requested both, but I honestly don't remember).  The meal was quite good and reasonably priced.  Dad was happy, which makes me happy, so Qdoba gets a thumbs up!
