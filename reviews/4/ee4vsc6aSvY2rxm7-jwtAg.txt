Hot and new, Jaburritos lived up to the hype on our first visit for dinner last night.  

I created my own Jachos with taro chips, ebi shrimp, crab, guacamole, pico de gallo, and had the nacho cheese on the side.  Wow, those taro chips are amazeballs!  I could have eaten another serving and plan to very soon.

The b/f created his own Jaburrito with salmon, ahi, brown rice, and chips and was also tempted to get another creation, but the line became super long as we were eating our first go-round.  Word is definitely out on this place.

Sometimes new spots disappoint because those expectations become unreasonably high, but Jaburritos did not; we'll definitely be back sooner than later.

*TIPS:
Our party of six arrived around 6:15pm on Tuesday night and we were lucky enough to snag a table for all of us.  However, it wasn't too long before the place got packed.  It's new, so patience is key.  Check out the menu online so you have an idea of what you'd like to create or try one of their own Jaburritos.
