I tried Nando's and liked it.  My favorite items were:  guacamole - tastes like the kind of guac I grew up on in El Paso, beans - taste fresh and not full of lard, rice - simple and fresh recipe, not loaded with MSG, corn tortillas - some of the best, most flavorful tortillas I have eaten.  I would like to try them buttered next time I visit.  Chips were also very good.  My least favorite items were:  pico de gallo salsa had flavorless tomatoes, red salsa - not much to it.  Overall, I enjoyed my visit and would like to try them again.
