Tradicionnes rocks.  Sure it has some compromises, but I consider them compromises in the name of authenticity.  The things that make it rock is core mexican food that is absolutely awesome, a couple of mole dishes that rock the casbah, and a physical building that makes it feel like you're in downtown San Antonio.  The service is usually good, especially for Sunday lunches when we usually come here and order from the menu.  Chips are always refreshed, and the tea stays full.  My one pet peeve is that we never get silverware if we sit on the porch.  It's hilariously consistent!

But I stopped in this Sunday, and it was closed.  Bummer.  I called tonight, and there is no answer.  Double bummer.  Are you open Tradicionnes, or have you left us?
