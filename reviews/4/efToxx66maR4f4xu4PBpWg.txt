Hands down the strongest margarita I ever had in my life. Good when you're only having one and chatting it up with friends. Bad when you don't know when to stop and you find yourself stumbling to the bathroom, not knowing whether you want to throw up or order more guacamole (made in front of you at the table-delish with extra jalapenos- dirty look to those wusses I have gone with who have opted for less spice). 

The ambiance is just right: dimly lit, comfortable booths (happy hour is only at the bar or at the tables surrounding the bar though), and friendly staff. The happy hour is great for the drinks. The HH appetizers, however, can be a little on the skimpy side, so go for an entree if you're famished. I made the mistake of getting the appetizer ceviche, which came with a few lonely anorexic shrimp that I wanted to feed instead of eat. 

My favorite dish so far :The cilantro chicken salad (I subsitute steak for chicken, and ask for an extra little side of their amazing dressing).

Great for a date or just to meet with friends to gossip about dates. One of my regular spots that is worth trying out.
