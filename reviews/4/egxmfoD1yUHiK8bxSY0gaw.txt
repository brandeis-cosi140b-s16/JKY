Met my friend for lunch here the other day.  Neither of us ever heard of it, but since we were in the area, we thought to check it out.

We sat outside, something that I never do.  The furniture was extremely dirty (we sat on some patio furniture), but that really is my only complaint.  Food was really good...I have been in the mood for grilled cheese lately and theirs was wonderful. (Bacon, tomato, avacado) My friend is a vegetarian and really could get the veggie wrap for a sandwich.  She enjoyed it but the sandwich was huge!

It was a great place to hang out and catch up... :)
