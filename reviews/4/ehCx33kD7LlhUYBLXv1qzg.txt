Today I hosted a fiesta in my mouth with the cuisine at Taberna. And it's a fiesta that I wish could have continued on forever! Taberna has certainly sizzled their way into the Valley and all it takes is one taste of their food to know why. 

With so much anticipation and excitement to try out Taberna, I rejoiced when it turned out to be everything I expected plus a bag (or bowl) of fabulous chips! So let me start with the chips. They serve plantain chips, yes plantain chips! They also serve crispy blue tortilla chips. The salsa is spot on and they provide a green and red salsa upon arrival. I ate my way through the meal by starting with the Tortilla soup. Holy Moly I love this soup. I could probably eat this soup all day every day and be happy. It's a cream-based tortilla soup oozing with cheese, avocado and other Mexican spices. It's warm and spicy and delicious with every slurp. And yes, I was slurping it was so good. I couldn't get enough of the presentation either. It comes in a dainty little black kettle topped with even a lid! For my entree, I heard the steak tacos were to-die-for so I went that route. Verdict? Yes, yes they are to-die-for! They are mini but filling and they are fresh topped with tasty sauces. 

So until next time Taberna ... and trust me, there will be many, many, many more next times!
