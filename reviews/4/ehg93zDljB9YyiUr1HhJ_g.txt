The burger was really good but I must say because of it's location and fact it has such limited parking and gets so crowded it makes it really inconvenient. We got there right around 11:30am knowing the lunch rush would come shortly and I'm glad we did. A line formed minutes after we sat down and it got packed, the Dining room is small but they have some outdoor seating in the patio. The burger was delicious juicy and well seasoned with fresh toppings, gooey cheese and their special stand sauce which is basically like a 1000 island type sauce was very very good. I scarf my burger down in minutes! The fries were really good and looked fresh cut and seasoned with both salt and pepper which you don't see often, that was a plus! My husband also ordered a short rib taco, very good the beef was super tender and the toppings and salsa were very fresh. The banana stand shake was bomb with fresh bananas and banana pudding mixed in and the salted caramel shake was delish also. Bummer on those were they didn't come until we were almost done eating, guess a large order for shakes came in at the same time. I slightly compare the burger to in n out although they use fancier lettuce and their sauce is a little different. I did enjoy this place and the staff and service were great I'm 
Glad I got to try it but the annoyance of it's location, limited parking and fact the cars using the drive thru basically blocks your ability to exit most likely will prevent me from returning, besides I don't live close and there is also no bathroom! I had to scarf down my food so I could hurry to find a bathroom elsewhere but not the end of the world. Definitely worth trying but be patient and know it's a small place and gets packed, I suppose that does show you they have quite a fan base.
