I like the idea of a Hawaiian twist to Mexican food! I had the 3 tacos with huli huli chicken, beef and fish. I liked all three of my choices. I chose the pineapple salsa and the tomato  with onion. My favorite was the pineapple. The only thing I didn't like was the choice of my taco shell. I think next time I would like to order soft tacos instead. The hard taco shell was really bland. 

We couldn't leave without trying the chocolate coconut bark! It was good but since I'm highly sensitive to salt I couldn't eat so much. It would be cool if they had some lightly salted selections.

I definitely would love to go back and try some of their bowls!
