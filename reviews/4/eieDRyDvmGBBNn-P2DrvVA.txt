The Caldo De Res, a very hearty beef stew, after squeezing on lime, it was heaven.  The street taco's were just ok for me, but my daughter loved them.  I think the price is higher than most mexican restaurants that are sitting in a strip mall but if you really like something from there, then it is worth the cost. The people that work there are sweet but they don't speak much English.  I don't mind, but I am sure it may be a little bothersome for others.   I will be back for the Caldo when I am being lazy and don't feel like cooking.
