My kids love this place.
They're pretty consistent service and quality wise.
I think for a semi-fast food joint they are above avg. in service, and overall dining experience.  

We've tried most of the menu items and the burritos are a favorite. 
The place is clean and well kept, service is polite and pretty fast. 
The Gilbert Rd. location rarely has a long line or wait, except maybe weekday lunch hour.
