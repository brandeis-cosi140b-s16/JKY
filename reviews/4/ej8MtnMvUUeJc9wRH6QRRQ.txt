This review is based totally on the food, I haven't actually eaten in the reasturant, we've always had it delievered with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com or picked it up.  But the food is good.  It's not the best mexican food in the valley but it's yummy.  The only thing I don't like is it's not really consistant.  Some nights the food is fantastic some times it's meh ok.  I order the fajitas a lot I love them and they aren't the least healthy thing on the menu lol.  Some nights the are full and yummy some nights it seems like a lunch portion or something becaue it's half of what I usually get (which for me is enough for two meals).
