Great food, nice atmo...They always give you more than you can handle. Almost any entree is started w/ soup...Fideo.... I have fond memories with friends at this place...It almost takes me back to the time before I had kids & we could sit at the bar drinking Corona's till they close. 

I have a bad habit of ordering the same thing...
Fajita's... 
I guess 'cause I know thier good & I am a definate creature of habit.
highly recommended I would have given 5 stars but I guess i'm just picky that way.
