Dear God,

Thank you for letting La Bamba be a thing. I don't know how many times I've needed a super burrito with steak to kill a nasty post football game or Dells hangover. Thank you for allowing the staff to be kind enough not to judge my friends and I today for being so sunburned we couldn't move.  Thank you for letting them serve the best hot sauce on earth. Thank you for somehow rigging things so I had to stay at the shitty Best Western across the street for a week while working in Madison. I don't hold the 10 pounds I gained eating here every night against you. 

              Good luck with heaven and stuff,
                                     Kyle K

P.S. If you are as cool as Billy Graham says you are you'll let a La Bamba open in Milwaukee.  If you do I just might stop making the spaghetti monster joke about you.
