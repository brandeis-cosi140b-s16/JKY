If Crescent Ballroom isn't cool enough to make you want to stop by this place, their restaurant, Cocina 10 should be. I will now find any excuse I can to head here just so I can eat. Not even joking. The most frequent reason is trivia on Sunday nights, which is pretty epic.

Most of the food is Mexican faire, and the guacamole is not to be messed with. That shit is serious. Additional bonus points for non-tomato based salsa. Way to branch out and avoid the common! While I've had many items here, including a hamburger to die for, I usually end up loving the al pastor burrito the best, though it's so giant I can rarely finish it.

The drink menu is also great, with a selection of wines, beer and amazing cocktails, such as the Honey Badger. I would input some don't give a shit joke here, but that's old.

The only downfall is that service can be pretty slow. It always takes me a while to flag down someone for a refill, check, etc... but the food comes out pretty fast. The food is so good though that even slow service can't keep me away. I'm a fan.
