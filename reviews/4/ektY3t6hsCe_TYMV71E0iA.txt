I had driven by this little taco shop a dozen times never bothering to stop until today and Im glad I did. Not only are the prices very reasonable but the food is great and I love their free salsa bar especially the red chili pepper oil. I ordered the Carnitas Burrito and went after the hottest stuff they had in the salsa bar and found it to be one of the best sauces Ive ever had on a burro. Wow - hot yet great flavor and unlike any sauce I have seen before basically oil on top with red pepper congregated on the bottom. The atmosphere is plain yet clean and the menu is very large. I asked and they recommend the surf and turf burro or shrimp burro so I will be back for that however I brought home some of that tasty spiced oil to try on my next meal. I will be back again with the family.
