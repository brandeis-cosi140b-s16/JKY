I am from Chicago and my wife and I had terrific authentic Mexican food there.  This restaurant is as close as we've found to that experience in this area.   I ordered 2 tacos and a side of beans.  While we waited we really enjoyed the salsa and chips.  The salsa was really nice with notes of oregano and the perfect spice level.

My tacos were very nicely prepared.  The corn tortillas were very good.  I had the barbacoa and the chicken mole tacos.  The mole was very good and the chicken was perfect.  Both tacos had a large quantity of rice, very spicy rice.  It's the first time I have experienced this and would have to ask them not to do it next time.  It tasted of cayenne and really overpowered the barbacoa taco entirely.  The mole should have come with onions instead in my opinion.  Both were very tasty and I really liked them, nonetheless.  I ordered a side of beans and they were terrific. 

I will definitely go back and try some other dishes on their menu.  The staff is friendly and service is very good.  I liked the authentic Mexico City vibe of their place as well.
