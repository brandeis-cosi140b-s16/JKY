New place. The staff is still learning. They forgot to make my order and I had to remind them who I was (with a 30 dollar order). So the food service communication still needs some work BUT... The burgers are pretty damn good. They are pretty much  In and Out burgers on steroids. Good burgers, good fries, good shakes. It is a little pricey for what it is. Considering you can get a double double for 3 bucks at in and out and the comparative burger here is almost 6 bucks, the price is a little steep. 

Also the only other complaint are the tacos. The taste is great, but the portions are sooooo small. The menu is also little deceiving, it has "Short rib tacos" listed which would lead you to believe that for the price you get 2 tacos, but in fact you only get one and it is relatively small for the $2.60 price tag. They taste good though, so all is not lost. They just really need to work on the pricing, especially with all the other options out there to choose from.

I am glad that there is a local option now though, and I really do hope they do well. I will be a return customer and hopefully the prices go down a little bit. It cost me 30 bucks to feed Me, my wife and two small kids (5 and 3 yrs old).
