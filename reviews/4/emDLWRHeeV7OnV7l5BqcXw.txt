Been to a few locations in town & this has a college-esque atmosphere since it's by CSN Charleston Campus. The chairs are not the most comfy so go on the bar stools. Lol. Good lighting by the bars too if you're an Instagram Foodie who likes to take pictures. Haha! Anyway, it is ridiculously clean & very friendly workers too. Place is spacious but I can imagine it could probably get packed during rush hour too.

I love the Barabacoa Bowl: White Rice, Pinto Beans, Medium Salsa, Corn, Cheese, Sour Cream & Lettuce. The chips are yum too, I usually add that on for a buck & some cents.

I'm torn between Chipotle & Zabas, honestly. I love them both. :)
