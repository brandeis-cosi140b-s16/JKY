Not to mimic a lot of previous reviews, but..yes it is similar in menu and presentation to Roberto's. And yes cleaner than most of the Roberto's locations I've visited. 

Nevada burrito was very good.  I've give it a thumbs up over the CA burrito. 

Chicken tacos for a buck each and not skimping on the chicken. A great deal for a dollar. 

Fish tacos for $2.85 were a meal in themselves.   

Not sure if this is better than Roberto's but admittedly this was our first time visiting Habanero's whereas we've been going to Roberto's for years.  

We'll be back for a second visit.
