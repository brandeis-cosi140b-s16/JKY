Loved it! So Rich and flavorful. Not expensive. I got the burrito in a bowl which is different than a burrito bowl because the burrito in a bowl has pinto beans and no rice. I got take out and ended up adding rice to the bowl when I got back to my room. My fault not theirs. Definitely delicious and worth multiple trips. I will be back
