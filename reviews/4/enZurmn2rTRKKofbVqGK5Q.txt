We stopped in here while on a road trip and all loved it. The service was exceptional and the food was tasty. Their bean dip that they serve with chips is AMAZING. I had their enchiladas, which I didn't care for, but everyone else loved their food.

I just have to praise the staff: a hostess was by the door, opening it for everyone who came and went. It was 112 outside, and pretty warm inside as well, but the waiters were running around and working hard to make sure that everyone had everything. Like I said, the service was exceptional.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because both my step-mom and I felt sick that night, and the food from this restaurant was the only thing I ate all day. However, I was fine the next day.

I definitely recommend this place.
