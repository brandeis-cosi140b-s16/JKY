This is a duplicate review to the Brookline one since the only difference with this one is easier parking.P ossibly thing the miss most from living on the west coast is the abundance of taco trucks. This storefront taco stand is among the best I have had in Pittsburgh. Is it better than Reyna's Tacos (Strip)? Does it matter? Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.

You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies. Simple right? Yes Simple!
