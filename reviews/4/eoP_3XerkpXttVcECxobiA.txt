The first time we stumbled in here was simply an accident. It was storming in Charlotte on the day that my parents had decided to come for a visit, and the power was out all over town. After a failed attempt at Chili's, I told them that I thought there was an Olive Garden right down the road. Now, don't ask me why I thought it was an Olive Garden...but we ended up at Mi Pueblo and since we all three could eat Mexican for every meal, decided to give it a shot.

So today when they made a surprise visit again, we wanted Olive Garden, but none were nearby and we weren't backtracking to the one in Pineville, so we decided to venture back to Mi Pueblo. Now, we couldn't even remember the name of the place, and honestly the only thing we did remember was that we were freezing from being soaked from the rain and under a vent while we ate. But I did remember us leaving and talking about how amazing the food was.

I am so glad that we randomly ended up there because of my poor memory because it is some of the best Mexican I've had. Tonight I had the Hawaiian Chicken, which reminded me of a dish I had at a place in Anderson, SC that was so good I could have slapped my mama, so I thought I'd see if this even compared. Yes. It. Did. And holy moly! $11 and I can make 3 meals easy off of it. My parents both got chimichangas, one beef and one chicken, and thank the stars I made off with their leftovers so I'm in Mi Pueblo heaven for the rest of the week. I also had to get a round of sopapillas before we left since I am a freak for them. No disappointment there. And only $2.80 for a heaping plate full of that goodness.

For the amount of DELICIOUS food you get, the prices are actually really cheap. If you think they are expensive, you need to go back to the 50s.

Oh, and the HOMEMADE salsa is some of the best you will put in your mouth. I just hate that you have to request mild and you just get a little bowl instead of a full bottle.
