I go to Roberto's much too often, haha. I have only ever tried their carne asada fries, for obvious reasons. After recently introducing a friend to this magical concoction, we pick up an order together on a weekly basis. Carne asada fries are the perfect meal after a very long and busy day and they are great to share with a friend and chat over because each order is a very large portion. Like many Roberto's locations, this one is open 24 hours, a great plus in my book! This is Vegas, after all.
