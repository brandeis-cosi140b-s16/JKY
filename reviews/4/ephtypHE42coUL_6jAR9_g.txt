I am so not a tequila person.  (Long story involving training police officers, shots of Hornitos and throwing up on a room mate).  Point being, even margaritas can be painful for me.  Although I make an exception for this place.  I don't go often (again because of the Tequila issue) but when I do go I go all out.  The food is good, more Richardson's style than say Garcia's mexican style.  The margaritas are huge.  $10.00 for two good pours.  A fun place to go with friends and sit and catch up.  There is generally a long(ish) wait but well worth it.  It's even worth braving the tequila monster.
