I just had my second trip to Nacho Daddy a couple days ago and love this place. 

Me and my friend and elite yelper Allison came here with her hubby for lunch. There was no wait and were seated immediately. The waitress was prompt in getting our drink orders. I ordered just water and she got diet. The water tasted just like funky Vegas water, not filtered. 

I got Mexican corn as an appetizer and Allison ordered bottomless chips and salsa. I didn't know what to expect for the corn, but I was seriously underestimating it. It was so flipping delicious! It had cheese, cilantro, chili pepper (?), and lemon. Oh man it was worth EVERY penny! It comes with 2 smallish cut ears. The salsa for the chips and salsa is tasty. I liked the flavor of the mild better, but the spice to the medium is perfect.

Allison got the bbq pork nachos on my recommendation, as that is what I had last time. Joel got a chimichanga (I think chicken). I wanted to try something different so I got the Buffalo chicken nachos. The bbq pulled pork nachos are so good, that when our food arrived I was having buyer's remorse. However, the Buffalo chicken nachos were pretty good. There seemed to be a little too much Buffalo sauce on the nachos, so my nose was running and that's all I could taste. The nachos also have white queso, but again it was drowned out by the Buffalo sauce. The chicken was well cooked and plentiful, so I wasn't wishing there was more. I love the added celery garnish on top. It was very fitting.

For my appetizer and meal with no soda/alcohol was just about $14. The lunch nachos are around $7 so not too bad. Overall, I love the food here. It is a different take on traditional nachos for sure. The only change I would recommend to the restaurant is to invest a very small amount of money into getting filtered water. Vegas water tastes nasty! It is low cost and makes for happier customers. It is a large restaurant and plenty of room for larger parties. Come here and try for yourself.
