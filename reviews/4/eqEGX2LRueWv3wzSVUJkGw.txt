Alright, so I have now experienced several different items on the menu (this has become Mr. Tyger's FAVORITE restaurant, so he requests it almost daily *smh*...variety is NOT a dirty word!) 

While the rolled tacos were yummy, I have to take a moment to highly suggest the chicken tacos...as a valid option for hangover food. Not that I would EVER get hungover *glancing upwards to see if lightning is going to strike me again today*...but if I were to do so, the grilled yumminess of their chicken taco is enough to calm my angry innards and outards so I can buffer the tylenol/aleve/aspirin/advil cocktail before passing back out into delightful oblivion.  Mmmmm tacos.....zzzzzzzzzz....
