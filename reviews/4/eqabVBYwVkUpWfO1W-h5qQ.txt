I was a bit hesitant to return. My last visit left me feeling a bit cold.
(A new-ish girl working the outside bar was giving a LOT of her attention to a particular patron, and drinks, food, etc. was slow coming)

Marvin was our server tonight. He's got LOTS of energy.

Had a carnitas chimichanga. Delicious, as always!

Love the flour chips, and the hot salsa.

I will be back.
