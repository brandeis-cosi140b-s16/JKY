I have been here a few times, and I really like it. This last visit I got the bean tostada. I was surprised at how filling it was. There were a lot of toppings, and not all lettuce. There was a good amount of beans, some lettuce and cheese. 

I love that they have a 'salsa bar' there, complete with to go containers. There are salsas, vegetables and even sliced limes. Limes are a must have in my opinion, as they really make the flavor pop.

My husband got the al pastor burrito, as he had been craving this for a few days. He was really pleased with the flavor. The burrito was also very filling. 

Great value for the money. Love the salsa bar.
