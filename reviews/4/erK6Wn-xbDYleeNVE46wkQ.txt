Chipotle's my default healthy-ish fast food option.  They make a big deal out of how they source their food, and if you get your burrito bowl-style and leave off the cheese, you can actually avoid blowing through a thousand calories on your lunch break.

This particular location is very close to my apartment, so I go there fairly often.  The staff is usually polite and they usually get my order right.  That's really all I ask when I go to a chain restaurant, since the food is (or should be) standardized.

Also, Chipotle is leagues ahead of Qdoba, Salsaritas, Moe's, etc.  This is an Adam Fact (TM).
