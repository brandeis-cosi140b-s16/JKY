Very rarely do I find a restaurant that does not change it's taste and menu over the years. Macayo's must know a good thing when they have it, I have never had a meal that has been removed from the menu and if you need something changed about it they are more then willing to fix it to your liking. The endless chips and salsa are always great but their sauces make their entrees better then ever! Yay for baja sauce! I will continue to go back for years to come!
