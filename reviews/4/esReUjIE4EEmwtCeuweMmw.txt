Seriously, you might be a little weary coming here but for the love of all things good just go inside and try it! If you can find somewhere to park that is.

You can definitely tell the crowd here is diverse and there are some regular patrons. This place was packed around lunch time and the staff here did an excellent job of keeping the line moving. 

I ordered some random combo that came with a taco and enchilada and tried a bit of the chicken quesadilla... freaking delicious. I now know why people come here. Not sure what they're putting in the food to make it so good - could it be love? Haha.
