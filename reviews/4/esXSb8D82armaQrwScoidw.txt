We decided to try this out tonight for this first time and we were not disappointed! The carne asada burritos are delicious and could easily feed two people. We got the #14 combo plate that comes with rice and beans. My kids loved the beef tacos and the rice and beans as well. My husband's only complaint was the salsa. If they had some more authentic salsa to go with their foods I'd give them 5 stars :-) It's a little  more pricey than something like taco bell, but you get much better quality food.
