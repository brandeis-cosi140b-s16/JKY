My friend and I were famished and craving Mexican food on our way back from a day trip to Death Valley National Park, which is beautiful but doesn't have the greatest restaurant scene.

Middling-at-best Yelp reviews steered us away from the Mexican eateries in Pahrump, and we initially stopped at another Mexican place that advertised being open but wasn't at 5:15 p.m. on a Sunday. I'd expected I'd have to settle at Roberto's, but I can't imagine anything else we'd have visited would be better.

The size of my chicken burrito surprised me, given that it costs less than $4. The chicken wasn't too dry, yet the burrito wasn't greasy or otherwise overly filled with fat. The restaurant has one type of red salsa -- a really spicy one, which I liked. I ordered a bean tostada, not knowing that the burrito alone could have been divided into two meals. The tostada, too, was a great value at less than $3. 

Our food was served quickly; it no doubt helped that we were the only two people in the restaurant. My only quibbles with the place are that a.) the styrofoam cup I was given for my water was tiny, and b.) the only napkins available are the ones you're eventually given with your food. I spilled on myself at the salsa bar and had to wait to clean up.

Roberto's is open 24 hours, which would have come in more handy for me back when I worked nights. It's good to see there's a quality option for those who do work different hours.
