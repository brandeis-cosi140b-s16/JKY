I went there with some friends and family and had a phenomenal experience. We started with the queso, which was delicious, and perused their extensive list of sipping tequilas. Everyone at the table was pleased with their meal, from the enchiladas to the chimichangas. Everything was great. Even the rice and beans were not your run of the mill standard. Our server was extremely attentive and knowledgeable as soon as our entire party was there (it took him a few minutes when there were just a few of us). I will definitely be back.
