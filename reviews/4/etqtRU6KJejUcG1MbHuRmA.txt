Slaving away at work...I forgot my lunch and began to crave some good quick Mexican food. I have come to count on Tacos de Juarez for its speed and consistency providing authentic Mexican food. 

This trip I did the 2 crunchy tacos lunch special. They had already provided my chips and salsa even before I ordered. Both salsas were just as good as always. I was in and out in under an hour.
