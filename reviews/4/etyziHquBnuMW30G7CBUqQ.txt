My husband and I love to come here for drinks and tacos after work on Friday.  It's also a great lunch time spot.  I order the same thing every time: strawberry margaritas on the rocks and the ancho chili mahi tacos.  So delicious.   They are not shy with the alcohol, either.  Two margs and I'm done!  There seems to be some haters who yelped... I don't know what you thought when you walked up and saw a bunch of college flags outside, a huge bar with cabanas, and servers who don't wear much (well, the girls), if you thought it was a fancy restaurant or a place like macayos, you're WRONG!  It's a bar with yummy bar food.  Bottomline: This place is for the young AND young at heart!
