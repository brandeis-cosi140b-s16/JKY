I've had a Chipotle a couple of times, particularly at this location. This location is very clean every time I do come in. My boyfriend is a regular, so some of the staff already knows his order. They are also very welcoming when we do come in. The portion sizes are fairly large depending if you get the burrito or bowl. I always get the kids meal taco kit and that's good enough for me.  It includes what ever meat you choose, and two sides like guacamole or mild salsa, chips, and a drink. My boyfriend GTE's the bowl, you have a choice of two different types rice, meat, sides. The guacamole, chips, and meat are always prepared fresh. There's nothing really bad I can say, it can be busy at times, and if they're new workers they can tend to be slow with your order.
