After reading the other reviews for Maria Maria I had reserved myself to not being impressed with this place. Maybe that is the key... set your expectations low and you won't be disappointed. Well that is true for just about anything, but definitely is leading to my favorable review of Maria Maria:). 

my observations... 
* upon walking in i liked the decor and the patio with the enormous ceiling fan was very cool. 
* loved the chips and salsa! 
* service was attentive and friendly 
* I should have stuck with the lunch combinations because Beef Chivichangas was f*ing enormous! but still pretty good. I do not like beans in any kind of burrito unless it is just a bean and cheese burrito but still enjoyed this. 
* I will probably come back again!

Hope this helps:)
