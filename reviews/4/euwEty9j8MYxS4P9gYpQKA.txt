Local rumor is that landlord vs tenant dispute is what caused Carefree Station to close.  However, owners of CS had recently signed a lease on another venue down in Scottsdale (they would have been opening their 3rd establishment, Scottsdale Station), and those plans are still on.  So I guess we'll just have to wait for them to open the new place (hurry!) or head on over to Prescott Station.
