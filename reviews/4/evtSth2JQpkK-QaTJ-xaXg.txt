I love all the food, shrimp burrito, fish tacos, shrimp tacos, soup, but the reason I don't guve it 5 stars is because they are really cutting back in their portions and their prices have gone up. Usually the fish tacos have the fish sticking out on both sides of the tortilla but on fish taco Tuesdays the piece of fish is about half the sizr barely covering the middle of the tortilla with an overload of cabbage, the same with the new lobster tacos mostly cabbage anf a few pieces of lobster! On the shrimp burrito it takes about three bites before you get a bite of shrimp. Now I think twice about going there with the family.
