We get food here about once a month.  This location has always gotten our orders correct, they package their food correctly, and have friendly staff.  I usually get a taco salad, and it has been fresh every time with the hot stuff hot and the cold stuff cold.  (BTW - if it isn't out of your way, visit this location, NOT the one @ 107th & Indian School.)
