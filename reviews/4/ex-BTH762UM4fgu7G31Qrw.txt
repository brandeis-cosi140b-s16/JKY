Love the grilled chicken.  You can walk in and see the grill covered in chicken and see and smell the flavors in the air.  You can buy combinations plates or by the piece. My husband and I enjoy getting an 8 piece with sides, and love those tortillas.  The condiments bar has fresh cilantro and two types of sauces.  Really like the food.
