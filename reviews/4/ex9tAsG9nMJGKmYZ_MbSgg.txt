Just got home from dinner.  There were 3 of us.  We had fish tacos, chimichangas and chili relleno.  A+ on all except the relleno, as it was a bit doughy.  Really like the restaurant, nice  atmosphere, great service, very prompt but way too noisy with the live music.  If we come back, it will be earlier or when weather is warmer and we can sit outside.  Just to hard to chat and the guy wasn't that good.
