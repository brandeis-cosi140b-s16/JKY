I just moved to Las Vegas 3 weeks ago, and have been in dire need of a good Mexican food fix.   Leticia's certainly fit the bill for it!

I had the chile Rellano stuffed with Beef.  It was quite tasty and much what I expect from a good rellano.   The salsas that were brought out with the chips were also quite tasty and the fresh chips were muy bueno!!!  

My server Dulce was very pleasant and friendly.   It was quite busy when I got there, but I was seated within 10 minutes.  The staff was all very friendly and pleasant.  I will definitely be trying this place again.
