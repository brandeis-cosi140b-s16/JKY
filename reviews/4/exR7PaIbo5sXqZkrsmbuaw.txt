One of my high school friends took me here once with her family. It is hidden in old litchfield area and it is a pretty decent mexican food place. I loved their beans and rice. OO Don't forget their complimentary chips and salsa. Their pico was amazing! I actually got it togo a couple times when I was eating there.
