I watched the Sonorian Hot Dog  throw down in Tucson on the travel channel and was craving a sonorian dog.  There happened to be one right around the corner from us so we decided to try it.  

Surprisingly the Sonorian Hot Dog at Moreno's was very good!  $3 worth of goodness!  It's a must try, I'll definitely be back.
