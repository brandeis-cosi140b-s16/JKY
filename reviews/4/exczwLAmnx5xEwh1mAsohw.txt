The prices are fair and I'm always full and disappointing in myself for eating so much when I leave so that means I'd go again. I'm just not sure how they're doing these days, I hate to say it but I worry if they don't much enough money their quality and cleanliness might fall and I'd rather assume that and not go then hope it doesn't and get sick. Over the years thanks to ASU West I've gone half a dozen time and I don't think I personally ever had an issue, I always get the super nachos.
