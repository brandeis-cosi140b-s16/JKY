I finally went there to have a quick drink after a long week at the office. I walked in there and the decor was everything but traditional Mexican. I read some people comparing it to Dia De Los Muertos; somewhat a stretch, but it was cool nonetheless. The coolest feature I found was the beer tap on some of the tables, which gives me an idea of where to take my friends for a night of drunken debauchery. Anyways, I didn't get to eat that time since I already had dinner waiting for me at home,  but the tacos look like the ones I've had in Mexico and the guacamole looked like it is really supposed to look like. I decided to skip the beer tap and ordered a "Corona Familiar" , which is a 40 oz  bottle of Corona that until recently it was only sold in Mexico. Anyways, my grand total for my big ass beer bottle; paper bag and all, was $5.00. I will say that I will like to come back for HH, only this time I will make sure to order some duck tacos... Salud!
