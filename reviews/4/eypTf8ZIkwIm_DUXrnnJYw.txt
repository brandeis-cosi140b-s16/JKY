Somehow their food seems fresher, possibly cleaner?  I do see flies buzzing around all the time though..

I've tried their shrimp tacos - kind've on the spicier side which was unexpected.  The burritos are grilled.  They're about $6 which is kind've hefty for what it is.  Their nachos are actually pretty good, but the containers they use (or something) makes the chips soggy and feel stale.  Do not order a Coke or Pepsi beverage if you can help it - its just a can...  unless you get one of the fancy bottles on display.

All in all, its slightly more for seemingly cleaner/fresher Mexican food.  Not sure why they give you all those salsas, I really only like 1 of them...
