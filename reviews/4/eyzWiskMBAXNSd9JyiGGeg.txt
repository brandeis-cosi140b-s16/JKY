It's Taco Bell, people. Don't go here looking for the best meal you've ever tasted. For what it is, though, the food is decent, and the staff has really improved on remembering to make and bag all ordered items. Not perfect, but like I said, a definite improvement. 

The staff is super perky and positive. They always thank me for choosing Taco Bell, and in return, I always drive off with a smile on my face (and maybe some hot sauce, too...lol).
