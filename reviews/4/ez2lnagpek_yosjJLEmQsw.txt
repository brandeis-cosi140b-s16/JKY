I have eaten here twice and both times I have enjoyed the experience. I had the same thing - combo with tamale, taco, and tostada. The service was friendly, the food was good, and the service was fast. This is a small building next to the Chevron. It is nestled back just a bit from the street and easy to miss in an intersection with two other Mexican restaurants. If you want a small, authentic, and personal touch don't pass building by.
