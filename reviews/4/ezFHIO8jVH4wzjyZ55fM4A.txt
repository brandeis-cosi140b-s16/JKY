Upon parking I was walking toward the door, and noticed a great smell from the restaurant, which made me very excited! I was seated upon arrival and offered chips & salsa and my drink order was taken, margaritas on the rocks were the drink special. While I reviewed the menu, I noticed a lot great menu options, but typically like to base my 1st visit to any Mexican restaurant on their fajitas. My waiter arrived to take my order and he indicated the dinner portion, typically available on Sundays, b/c their lunch specials are through Saturday, was very large. I asked if they could offer the lunch portion, and he immediately accommodating that question and said it will be $.99 more. I was fine with that. While I waited, I enjoyed the chips & salsa, which the salsa was great, b/c it had a nice kick, but the chips could have been a little better. The restaurant was not too crowded, but I loved the service & how clean and nice the restaurant was. My order was served on a steaming hot plate & I was very satisfied. The fajitas were served with onions, peppers, and tomatoes, and accompanied by rice, beans, lettuce, guacolmore & sour cream. Perfect portion, great service & and an enjoyable lunch experience.
If the chips were a little better, they could be 5 stars. I look forward to getting back :-)!
