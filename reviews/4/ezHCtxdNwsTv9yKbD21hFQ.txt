Is it too "cheesy" to say this is "nacho" typical place?!? I take my nacho eating very seriously: OK....All clich√©s and dorky phrases aside, I'm impressed with the creatively thought out twists to simple food.

The good: 

*Super cozy atmosphere reminiscent of local Seattle pubs I'm used to. Cute decor includes separate bar and dining areas. Small retail items such as t-shirts for sale a smart idea for tourists. Funky coffee bar a nice touch.

*Music, diverse crowd, diverse menu and awesome cocktails make me want to camp out during Happy Hour and people watch.

*Everything I have tried is pretty good. I suggest splitting everything so you and your group can try more items.

*Vegan menu amazing!

*Restrooms are clean and funny (just ck it out in men's urinal pic).

The bad: 

-Any expert nacho maker will tell you to put some toppings on bottom. We were disappointed no meat or beans under first layer. If I'm gonna pay $17 for nachos "placement" is important! lol...I'm a snob I know.

-Meat can be a bit dry, maybe if stored in its own juices it would lock in flavor.

-Parking only on street at meter's.

- Small and dimly lit. If you need personal space then don't come here at night.

My questions: 

Would I brave the scorpion cocktails or the Thai or dessert nachos? Not sure but they look cool. 

Was the rancho sauce really homemade? It was awesome and waiter said yes but I wonder...?

My answers:

1)Put the queso on the nachos instead of plain cheese.

2) Get there before noon for lunch.

3) Don't be in a rush.

4) Expect to walk a ways if street parking is full.

I most certainly will be back.
