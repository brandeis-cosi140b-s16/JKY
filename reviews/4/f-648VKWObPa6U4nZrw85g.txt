This place never disappoints when it comes to quick fresh food. I never feel like a disgusting slob full of grease leaving Wahoo's. They have a dish for everyone including vegetarians. The Decor is really cool with the walls being covered in Action Sports memorabilia.  There's also tv's everywhere for the sports fanatics.
