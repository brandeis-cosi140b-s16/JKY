I love me some good Mexican food.  And this place didn't disappoint.

We must have been here on an off night.  Place wasn't too crowded so that meant we got stellar service from the moment we walked in the door until we left for the night.  For not being here before, the staff were patient enough to take time and point out a few suggestions on the menu before I opted for the Pollo Queso Burrito.  The poblano/chocolate salsa that came with it, amazing.

As we waited for our food to arrive, I browsed over their drink menu and decided to go with their take on a classic, a margarita.  Typical margarita with the top shelf stuff, the first sip made me feel all warm and fuzzy, so I knew that meant the rest of the drink would do me good.  

The wait staff were totally on point.  Never faulting when it came to our order, even when I requested no salt on my glass rim for the Margarita, she took it back and got me another.  She even had some time to chat with us as we waited for our food.  Even when we were done with our food and requested to leave it there as we stepped outside, she was fine with that and ensured that it would remain there until we got back.  

There was just one downside.  The table.  I mean I liked the way they looked, rustic and unique.  But cleaning them has to be a difficult task.  I only say that because when I put my hand down on the table I somehow got a piece of glass stuck in one of my fingers.  But our server came to the rescue almost immediately with a band-aid in hand.

All in all, it was a great experience and I'm sure to return again.
