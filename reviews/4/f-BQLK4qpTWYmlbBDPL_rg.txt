First time there last night.   Clean place.  Food was good and well priced.  Had a band, but the place was slow until 10 pm.  Then the place was packed.  Music was good... people were friendly, much like a neighborhood place.   Had a blast.  The place had everything I like about a night out.  I will be back.
