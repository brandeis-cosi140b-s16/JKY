mmmmmmmmmm. These guys have good salsa!! dont get the standard one, you have to ask for the habenero one! I had the pork street tacos and they were good. I give them a 4 out of 5

Service is ok but theres always good looking people working.

They make a ton of margs but I've only tried the standard. They have a full bar but its mostly Tequila. Good selection, my favorite was Cruz Tequila. The bartender recomended it and knew quite a bit about all the other tequilas.

I would go back again for drinks and chips and salsa
