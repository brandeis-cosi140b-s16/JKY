Glad I tried this place!

We are always craving Mexican but have a hard time finding a place that isn't greasy or too busy. Gave America's Tacos a try and so happy I did. 

Chips and salsa were fabulous to start. Carne Asada deserves the award it won in 2008 because it was good! 

I will be back to this location.
