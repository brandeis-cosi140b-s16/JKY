Had a good experience during my debut at this place. I still had thought it was called Revo, but it has a new name and new look, but the same owners and some of the same food. My favorite creamy white rice is still there and I had a pretty good fajita bowl with that rice and chicken and peppers to go. It could perhaps use  a bit more seasoning, but still a solid choice. The highlight of the hour long visit was getting a fancy drink for free that was being photographed for a magazine shoot. Also, the owner Lenny is a nice guy and he let me try two beef tacos for free. Those were served on semi-crispy shells and were good quality, but now they mostly have fancier tacos on corn tortillas and slightly higher prices. Change can be good and this place has the potential for another long run.
