This was the best fish taco I've ever had!  I've never had a fish taco before, but it probably will remain in the top anyway.  It was a flavor explosion of beer battered fish, crunchy cabbage, guac, and two sauces mixed together.  One was red, and one was white.  I have NO clue what they were, but they mixed together to create a delicious flavor explosion that made my taste buds dance with appreciation.  

The side of pinto beans is pretty esoteric, more soupy than you'd normally get, and with the chips you get access to the complimentary salsa bar, which has lots of options.  

I will be back for sure.
