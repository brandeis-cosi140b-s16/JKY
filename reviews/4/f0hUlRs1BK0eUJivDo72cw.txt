Jeremy was our server and he  was exceptional. sitting out on the deck with friends was enjoyable. Small outdoor patio, family-friendly, but being outside you have the proverbial attack of the flies. Of course we could've dined inside and skipped mother nature's friends. We started out with The macaroni and cheese fried bites which were very crispy and a side of sauce for dipping pleasures with a quantity of six. Happy hour offered a wide variety of appetizers and drinks which we took advantage of. Our server was very conscientious of the timeframe before happy hour expired and kept us apprised of the time limit. Our dinner consisted of the steak fajita quesadilla which was fabulous. We also enjoyed chicken quesadilla and their nachos which could've fed a family of eight. For dessert we had the fried ice cream which was a caramel base ice cream with caramel drizzle & corn flake outer crust. On a 1 to 5 for the desert I gave it a one only because I did not care for the corn Flake outside crust. To me it was a little tasteless but my guest enjoyed it immensely. On a scale of 1 to 5 service was the five , food was a five ,drinks were a five, as well as appetizers. Again my opinion of the dessert was a one but I believe my guess rated it as a five with one abstaining with a three star rating. I would recommend this place A five and would return in the future because of the wonderful staff and ambience of being outside. Bon app√©tit
