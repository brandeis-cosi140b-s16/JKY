I live near this place and have been here several times.  It's not the best Mexican food in town, but its consistently good.  I've had the enchiladas with red sauce and all the tacos. The fish tacos aren't amazing, but are decent.  The chicken is good as is the pork.  Other people at my table had the fajitas and burritos and everyone left happy.  We got the table-side guacamole too and that was pretty good.  The margaritas are good quality even with the house tequila.  So overall its somewhere around a 3 or 4.  I gave it a 4 just because I feel its better than average. I don't think you'll be overwhelmed, but not disappointed either.  Its fine for kids and groups.  May be a wait on weekends as lots of people go here pre-movie theater.
