If a place's title has to say they are 'real', then that's always a red flag for me but boy was that thought easily changed for me. Friends parents come here twice a month so decided to check it out. 
They had me at HANDMADE TORTILLAS!! Drool...

We went the route of ordering the meat by the pound which includes 10 tortillas. We got pork adobado and corn tortillas. Then add on the sides and condiments you want...rice beans guacamole. The meat comes to your table on a sizzling plate. Yum!  The tortillas that came with were no small soft taco ones. They were a good size. You could make a small burrito. Although they were a bit soft for my liking (I prefer them denser), they held up well considering how much meat, beans, etc we piled into it. They didn't fall apart like many street tacos do that aren't cooked right. 

Yes, salsa bar is great. I love that they have cilantro and onions separate. They even have cucumber slices!  

Highly recommend. Now I see why the parents come here as often as they can.
