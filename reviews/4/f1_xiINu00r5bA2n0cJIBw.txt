We've been to Cien countless times since my initial review of the place over three (!) years ago. Food is always consistently good and service can usually handle any issue/crowds. We dropped by last spring during a gigantic street fest and even though we were wedged in a corner on their top floor, we still received food and drinks with prompt service.

BUT, what gave me pause on our most recent trip is a new addition to their menu: BOWLS. ("bowls, bowls, all types of bowls...chips and mints and seashell bowls") 

More specifically: The Beats by Cien (cute) bowl. You guys, this is a freaking treat, and one you wouldn't expect to stumble upon in a little taco shack in Old Town: roasted red and gold beets, grape tomatoes, grilled corn and chimichurri are all mashed around in some avocado and served upon a bed of shaved sauteed-warm Brussels and dried cranberries. The flavors and textures are outstanding. I think my beloved papas con queso tacos have competition in my heart, and it's this meal.
