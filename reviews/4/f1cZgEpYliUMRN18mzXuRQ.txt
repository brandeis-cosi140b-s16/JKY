I love this place, it has excellent food, great selection for spirts. Overall one of my favorites to enjoy the environment to have  drinks and good laughs while eating food. 

I will say if your a couple that is just coming in to get a quick bite to eat I dont think the service is quite what it needs to be. 

Totally a different vibe for thoughs that can enjoy themselves. I rated a 4 only because the service lacks to get a full 5. Awesome cantina hope this helps.
