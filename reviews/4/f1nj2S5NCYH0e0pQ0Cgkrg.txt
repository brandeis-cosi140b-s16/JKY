My search for the perfect torta continues...

Heard a lot of talk about this place, so we went for lunch. Decor is cute, clean, colorful. Rainforest murals, lots of hanging flags. Service, awesome, language being no issue. Lunch specials hover at 5-6 bucks, combos 6.50. Comprehensive menu, 4-5 soups, fajitas, even saw oxtail on there. Lots of breakfast options, with no hourly limitations. 7 tortas to choose from.

The one I wanted wasn't on there (huevos y queso) but special ordering it was no problem. It was out in a jiffy, and huuuuge. Huuuuge. I wish I'd stuck a quarter in the pic for scale - easily the size of both my hands, side by side, open. Eating it wasn't gonna happen without slicing it into fourths, which I did. I'd declared my love for jalapenos and was brought a small bowl of (methinks) homemade carrots and peppers, for fwee, which I ate like deli pickles. Yum.

STILL not the sammich I'm searching for, but good. The bun tasted like a really good, really fresh hamburger bun, covered in sesame seeds. Instead of oaxaca, cheddar cheese found its way into my torta (sigh). Still, a tasty rendition. 

Huevos Rancheros - basically fried egg soup. No rice, so you're going to be wrapping what's hidden under that (tasty, tomato-y) pile of Ranchero sauce up in your tortillas, trying to eat the whole thing before it squeezes out onto your lap. Not the best thing to order if you're a messy eater and wearing white.

Salsa is served warm. This was a first for both of us.

Kitchen isn't that well ventilated, so if the smell of charring beef turns you off, you might want to get take out. 

All in all, delicioso! We'll be back.
