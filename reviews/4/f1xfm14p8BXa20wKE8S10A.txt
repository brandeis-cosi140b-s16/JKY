Chipotle is one of my favorite quick serve restaurants, but this is not one of my favorite Chipotles.  Because it is right next to the movie theater, it was convenient to stuff the burrito in my pocket  and eat it while waiting in line at the theater for a screening.  It was fast as usual, but the burrito size was smaller than I'm used to from the one by my work.
