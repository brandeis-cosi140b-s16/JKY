I only stick to the tacos because I'm not into the monster burrito stuff. They do have some of the best shredded beef and it's great in their tacos and taco salad.   The one thing that sets this place apart from the rest(besides the great meat) - the salsa.  Their Habanero salsa is outstanding - tasty and spicy.
