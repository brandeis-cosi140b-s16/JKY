When in the Phoenix / Tucson area, this is the place for Mexican Food ('Tex-Mex' for you sticklers). It's a small chain of restaurants that extend to San Diego, CA. I wished they had one in L.A. They have hearty and generous portions and low prices. The food is great, too! The two locations that I've been to are very humble settings, but the staff are friendly and efficient. Very fast service! Just keep in mind that the portions are huge.
