I wanted to give five stars but I couldn't.  Lack of consistency and stingy up-charges are in the way.

The weekday lunch specials are always the same five items in the same sequence.  Tuesday is enchiladas verdes.  I ordered the special.  I substitute rice for all beans on the side.

They charge too much for extras.  Carry out costs and addition .30, that is 5% hike on the special.  I wanted extra verde sauce on the enchiladas but they wanted another $1.  That is over 16% price increase.  Most other places will give you some extra cheese, sour cream, or sauce for free so long as it already comes with the entree in some quantity.

I eat here every week and the quality differs greatly.  Two weeks ago the chicken enchiladas had huge chunks of unseasoned chicken, this week is was orange with seasoning but very stringy.

I wish it was a bit more consistent and that they didn't charge you for all the extras (carry out being one of those extras).  They have coupons but you have to buy two drinks so in the end it is basically a coupon for free drinks.  You will never save a dime on your entrees.
