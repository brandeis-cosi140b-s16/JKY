Don't let the rustic decor (and the fact that the restaurant is in Gila Bend) fool you!... The food has homemade flair and is simply great. Homemade tortillas and the burritos are enormous!

Rode my motorcycle out there for breakfast last week with friends, and the staff knew we were there from out of town, and went out of their way to say "Thanks."

The interior of the restaurant is quite small, but they have covered picnic tables outside...

I will definitely be back!
