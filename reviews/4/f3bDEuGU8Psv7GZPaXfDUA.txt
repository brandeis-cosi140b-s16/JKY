If you want to try one of teh best home-made mole negro dishes in town, this is the place. The food is outstanding. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a tiny hole in the wall that tends to be crowded and very noisy at peak hours. If you like great, real Mexican food, though, this place is hard to beat. So are the prices, by the way.
