This place was the bomb!
Stopped here after getting into town, and boy were we hungry.
We were seated after a very short wait. The environment is casual and the decor is warm feeling.
We were greeted by a nice waiter, and given some delicious black bean dip that would make you smack someone's momma for it. Fresh corn tortillas were baked for us to chip away into our own bite size peices.
The menu is fresh, and unique but not so much you can't pick an item off the menu with ease. The infusion of flavors was great. 

We chose the tacos and you must try:
Ths sweet potato taco
The crunchy shrimp taco
The carne asada taco
The yellowtail taco

All of these were cheap, and you can get a few different ones to try out.
Two will fill you up but three will take you over the hill!

My only issue was the lack of ability to have options that did not have garlic in the foods or marinades. Don't come here if you need accommodations.

This is a great place to get some authentic food.
