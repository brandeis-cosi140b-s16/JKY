Great food, affordable, friendly staff and prompt service. I ordered the chicken taco and mixed ceviche. I gave them 4 stars because I didn't know there was octopus in the ceviche and it was not written in the menu. I didn't end up eating it. But overall I was pretty satisfied and will go back again.
