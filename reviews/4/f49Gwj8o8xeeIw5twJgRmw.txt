After days of eating high cost restaurant food, i was happy to finally have something a little more down to earth. Chipotle saved the day. I ordered the usual burrito with beef. Talk about huge burrito, fresh lime flavored rice, lightly toasted flour, fresh salsa, fresh fajitas, fresh etc. It was yummy. You can never go wrong with Chipotle. They were located next to Panda Cuisine. Great great pairing of fast food places that make food on the FRESH! High quality and great taste. I ordered a grapefruit IZZE for my beverage.
