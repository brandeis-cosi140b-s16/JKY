They have some great margaritas!  The cocorita was delicious. We also ordered the fajitas for 2, excellent flavor and generous portions. Plenty of seating for small or large groups.  We went on a Friday night, party of 6. Only complaint is I wish they had faster service, hence the 4 star.  Would definitely dine here again.
