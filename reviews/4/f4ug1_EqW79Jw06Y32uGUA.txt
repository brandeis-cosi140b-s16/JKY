Post New Years Eve is the THE TIME to hit Vegas up for some deals.  At Yolo, we are talking happy hour $5 deals.  $5 drinks and $5 bites. The street tacos (had both the chicken and beef) were well worth $5.  You get two tacos stuffed with surprisingly yummy meat.  Since you get 2 tortillas per street taco, I suggest breaking them up into 4 actually bite size tacos!  I was salivating over the sizeable plates of $5 tequitos and $5 quesadilla, but trying to maintain my figure I worked so hard on before Vegas, I abstained. 

Lots of $5 margaritas were flying out of the bar, but since I can't drink tequila, I stuck with the quite passable $5 white wine.  

In the evening, house drinks jump to $10, which isn't too bad.  Especially when they come with a side of karaoke.  *sings* Total Eclipse of the Hotel California, Wanted Dead or Alive, a Sweet Caroline.........you totally just thought "Buh buh bah" didn't you.
