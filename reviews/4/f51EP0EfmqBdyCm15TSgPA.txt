Diablo's is just one of these places I love coming to over and over again. Every time I visit Vegas, I can't wait for the late afternoon to come so I can hang out at Diablo's.

The location is hard to beat. There's a great vibe sitting at table by the sidewalk or sitting at the bar watching the people do there thing out on the street.

The bartenders are always fun to talk with while people watching. They have seen a lot of stuff on The Strip, and have plenty of stories. They pour a damn good drink also. There seems to always be some drink special or something going on. This last visit, people right outside the bar are giving away tons of 2-for-1 drink cards, any beer or cocktail. And if it's not on the drink menu, bartenders will make it for you, just tell them what is in it.

And the best surprise; the food here is actually pretty damn good. They have the normal bar stuff, plus a few extras you wouldn't except. The serving size on some of this items are unreal. Huge bowls of guacamole...a very large pile of nachos with everything stuffed and stacked on them.

Prices pretty good for Vegas, especially considering the view and the location.

You don't have to twist my arm, I'm already looking forward to the next trip to Vegas.
