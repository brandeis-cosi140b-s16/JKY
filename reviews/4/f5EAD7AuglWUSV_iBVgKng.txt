I finally made it out to the Rokerij's infamous happy hour and it didn't disappoint. My girlfriend and I had a couple of the small plates, the mushroom toast and stuffed mushrooms (both amazing! but I REALLY loved the mushroom toast) and some wine. The inside is really unique to Arizona and completely relaxing. Our server Eric was super nice and chatted with us a lot about the restaurant and the menu. 

We will definitely be back for half priced bottles of wine and happy hour very soon!
