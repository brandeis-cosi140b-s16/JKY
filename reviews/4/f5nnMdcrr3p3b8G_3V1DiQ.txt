I waited until my last day in Vegas to try this spot because I knew I would pig out. I was so excited to eat here. I was hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait because I was starving! 

The place is right next to Encore. Towards the end of the strip. There is a red rent outside for outside seating. When you walk in there are several lines. There's a line for asada and adobada fries. A line for carne asada tacos and Mulitas and a line for adobada and al pastor Mulitas and tacos. Then a seperate line for anything with buche, suadero, and tripa, lengua. This was the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. I would rather just order my food and have them call out my number when it's ready. But in a way if works for Vegas craziness. 

The prices for the tacos are a bit higher than usual. Tacos are about $2. Mulitas $4, fries $10. 

I tried the adobada fries and these were delicious with a decent amount of meat topped with sour cream and guacamole and cheese.

2 al pastor tacos. Topped with onion, cilantro and guacamole. So delicious. Perfect size too. 

I also had a Mulita with tripas. So delicious. The Mulitas are small but since I had tacos tok I was satisfied. 

This is a place you need to come to while in Vegas. The food is great and it's also affordable compared to other places on the strip. The food is also very authentic. 

Besides the different lines just one other thing to complain about... The soda machine ran out of ice and it took a really long time to get ice.
