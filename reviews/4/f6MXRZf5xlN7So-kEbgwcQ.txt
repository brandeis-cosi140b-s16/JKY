Decent burritos that are large and inexpensive.  I tried the shrimp burrito ($5.50) which had a lot of fresh vegetables, rice, and lettuce in it.  There were a lot of whole pan fried shrimp in the burrito, and they were cooked perfectly.  I also tried a large horchata ($1.89), which was decent, but a bit too powdery/chalky for my taste.  However, I did like that it wasn't overly sweet.
