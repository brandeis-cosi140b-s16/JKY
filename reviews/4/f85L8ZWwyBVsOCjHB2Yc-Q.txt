I came in to dine solo and the bar tender served me.
I had s bit of a cold do I decided not to drink alcohol. I requested the coconut fizzy limeade! It was refreshing and delicious! The server followed up with another on the house.
I ordered three small plates.the duck, shrimp cocktail and a cheese and chorizo! The shrimp was pretty tasty but slightly scarce in the sauce. The duck was great. The cheese was really good. The food is spicy and intense. 
I was sad the menu had no desert ! Would have gone for it if I was offered. 
The seating and ambiance is relaxed and the music is really good. Will be back for sure
Will surely be back
