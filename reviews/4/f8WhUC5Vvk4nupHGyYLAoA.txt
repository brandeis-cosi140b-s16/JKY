Okay so this is probably like my favorite Roberts to go to!! The carne Asada fries are like a forbidden fruit to me.. I know I shouldn't be eating them but I get them.. And eat the whole thing! Terrible! But oh well it shouldn't be so damn good! The service is always very fast and friendly! If it gets to the point where they know you by name then.. Yes you are officially a Roberts taco shop addict like me :-) anyways if You are in the area and want a quality Roberts to visit this is your place! My only thing is that these particular items on the menu have went up and they will definitely nickel and dime you for all of the normal things that should come on a burrito or whatever else such as sour cream, guacamole, cheese etc! Your lucky if you get the damn limes and lemons for free! Other than that it's awesome!
