I remember growing up going to Garcia's, so I don't know if it's all nostalgia or not but the chips and salsa here are the best! If you feel like you need to actually order something but don't know what I suggest Olivia's Sampler for a  few different options.

It's a little strange going to an Embassy Suites to eat while not staying at the hotel, but not strange enough to keep me away.
