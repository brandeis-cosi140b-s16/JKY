Another great spot in central Phoenix. I've only been once - on a Wednesday evening to check out my friend's flamenco performance.  The food is AMAZING and they have a great wine list as well.  

If you do go on a Wednesday to check out the show, be sure to arrive early to get a seat.  It fills up quickly! Also, the music is very loud, so I would not recommend Wed night if you want to have a conversation with your company.
