I love Ricky's. The food is high quality and very fresh. I'm a very picky eater and if you ask for a custom order, they're amazing about it! I basically make up something different every time and they just say "yep, we can make that!" And they do, and it's glorious. 

I'm a vegetarian, and I LOVE their refried beans. They are made with butter instead of lard, and they're creamy and amazing! 

Portions are huge. Burritos are bigger than chipotle. All my meat eating friends love the tacos. 

It's always very dead in the day time (I've only been in for lunch), but I've been told they are a pretty big night drinking hangout place. 

If you work in the galleria and haven't been in to Ricky's yet, give it a try! Ricky's doesn't disappoint.
