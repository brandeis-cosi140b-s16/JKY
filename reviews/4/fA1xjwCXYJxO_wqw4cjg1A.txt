I used the taco cart for catering a birthday party for 50 people. They arrived on time,  set up quickly, and were all super friendly. The food was amazing!  I got chicken,  carne casada, and carnitas. Everyone at the party raved about the food and many have already asked for the contact info to use themselves.  I plan on visiting the restaurant for lunch as well. The service is easy & convenient since they bring everything they need,  including plates,  utensils,  and napkins, then clean everything up before they go.  You also get to keep whatever is left over. I researched several companies before choosing Taqueria Guadalajara and picked them from all their positive reviews. I'm so glad I chose them!
