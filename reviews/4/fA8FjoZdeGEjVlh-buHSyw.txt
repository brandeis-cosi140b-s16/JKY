This place looks like a whole in the wall but Very good food, very good atmosphere, very good service. Waiters were very attentive and funny. So far my favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte. My family is from the west coast and this is the closest taste to it. The one thing I can't get use to is all mexican restaurants in charlotte use ground beef instead of shredded beef. Because of that I gave them 4 stars. Please make it an option even if its at a higher cost.. It really makes a difference. Overall great place.
