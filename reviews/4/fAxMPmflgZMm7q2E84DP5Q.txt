Is it tacky to turn "Om nom nom" into a review? Because that's my review of El Sol: Om nom nom.

There are lots of great comments here about their (admittedly delicious) breakfast burritos and other foodish Mexican food, but the best part of El Sol in my opinion is the part in its name: the bakery. 

Tons of tasty baked and otherwise pastry-based goods. I would kill for their empanadas. Maybe not literally. But figuratively, without a doubt. They're always perfectly done and have a crust that's just right. And they're available in nearly any flavor you could want. I'm totally jonesing for an El Sol empanada now after writing this.
