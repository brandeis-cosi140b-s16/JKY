Seven of us dined at the newest Carefree restaurant for lunch this week. I love this little place. It has some "new restaurant" growing pains but the food is outstanding. Everyone at my table gave their dishes 5 stars. 
Pork Belly Tacos with goat cheese and black beans
Fettuccini Alfredo with chicken instead of shrimp
Meatball Sandwich
The House Chicken
Chicken Quesadilla 
Soup and Salad
Vegetarian Lasagna with Zucchini
and more! 

Two disappointments - The  Spanish Rice side dish needs attention. The cook needs to work on this dish a little. Too dense and too spicy. And they need to invest in a soda dispensing machine. The canned soda doesn't work. 

The menu is eclectic and fun. The place is cute and it looks like a great place to just hang out with friends. I think it will develop and grow into a wonderful restaurant as the servers and staff learn to deal with a growing clientele. I will definitely return and see how things progress. The food is well worth it!
