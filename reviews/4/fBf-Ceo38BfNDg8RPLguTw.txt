They have one of the best carne asada burritos.  It isn't as good as King Taco in Los Angeles, but I am a fan of this place.  They have a special hot habanero sauce which isn't really that hot to me.  If that sauce was hotter, I would have rated this place a 5 star.  If you're a heavy eater, try the challenge.
