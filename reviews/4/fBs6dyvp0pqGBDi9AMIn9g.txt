It seemed like we drove for quite a while from Old Scottsdale for some Mexican food. At least it was very busy, so that was a good sign. We were greeted and seated within seconds while our drinks and free chips with salsa followed soon after. I can't say I love the flour chips mixed in with the corn chips but the salsa was quite good with either of them. We lapped up the small dish they gave us and asked for more. They brought a huge bowl and we ate it too. We also ordered pico de gallo for the chips. It was very good as well and I found myself mixing the two on my chips. 

We had the Carne Asada which came with vegetables and rice. I had a side of re fried beans because Carne Asada seems to go with re fried beans for me. The steak was a real steak, no skirt steak here. It was quite good and it had all the "Mexican" flavor that I was hoping for. Cooked to order and seasoned deliciously, this steak is worth coming back for. The beans were ok, just re fried beans and not worth ordering as a side. The vegetables were just that, but it was all worth every penny because of the steak. 

The waitress suggested the honey flan with caramel sauce and whip cream as it was her favorite. I'm not sure I've ever had flan but it was delicious. The dessert was kind of like a thick pudding but I loved the texture and I loved the taste. I thought I was too full for desert but I finished this. 
The service was very good and it was very quick. The whole meal for two came in at $45. Nice place to eat.
