This place was delicious! My husband and I were trying to find a good mexican place because he is obsessed with mexican food, and we came across this place. 

Evironment is really nice. The waitress that helped us was nice as well.

We both wanted water so they gave us a full pitcher at our table thay was very convenient.

The food was tasty. I myself don't favor mexican food, but I enjoyed my meal and would go back anytime.
