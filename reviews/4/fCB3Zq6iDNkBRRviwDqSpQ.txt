I love how they give you coupons with almost every order.
I always get their bean burritos, mmmmm mmmm:)
They have the salsa bar, with cucumbers, green sauce, red sauce and jalapenos.
I find the service to be okay, I don't expect them to be amazing or anything.
But when I go through the drive through, I can tell they get kind of annoyed when I ask for extra sauce, but oh well.

If you want cheap mexican food, go here.
