This has always been on my "must try" list. I can't even imagine how many times I've walked by here and thought, oh yeah, I want to go there sometime! But alas, there are SO many great places to grab a late lunch (hello Kaya, Thin man, Little Bangkok, etc!) in the strip that I just never made it. Well, we finally did. Had a craving for some tacos and, voila, here we go! 

Let me first of all say, I like tacos. I've had some amazing ones over the years and the things that makes them amazing are the freshness of the ingredients, the quality/tenderness of the meat, the imaginative combos, and the double wrap homemade tortillas. And yes, Casa Reyna has all of those!  And they were cheap! Got my belly full with 4 "mini" tacos,for $9. Two carnitas (very good) and two tinga (excellent chicken option). I also sampled my wife's el pastor and that will be my next choice for sure. That one was fabulous. Lots of salsa choices makes for great chip dipping. I am such a fan of that! Didn't try the margaritas since I was driving but at $12 each I assumed they would be huge. At least I hope so. 

Now when I'm thinking I need tacos, I know,where I'm going.
