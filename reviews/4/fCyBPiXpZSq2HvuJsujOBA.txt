Lunch break with the boys today took us to Oaxaca.

I tried the Chicken Picado.  The chicken and peppers were cooked perfect.

The sides were also great.  I'm not a huge beans guy.. but they sure were tasty.

Chips, Salsa, Tea, and Waters were all refilled fast with our server.. Wish I remembered his name.. he was great.

Good lunch spot!

We will be back!
