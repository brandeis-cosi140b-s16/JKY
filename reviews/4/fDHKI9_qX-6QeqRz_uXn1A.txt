Tee Pee was one of the first places I went out to eat as a freshman at ASU in 2002 and I'm still going back to this day.  My favorite is their chimichanga.  The prices aren't great but this meal comes with a load of sour cream, guacamole, and chips & salsa and is delicious.

It's an older building and the booths are anything but comfortable but the service and food are great.  They also have a bar attached to the restaurant and speedy take-out service if you don't feel like dining in.

Their small parking lot is often full but it shows how good their food is.  I have never had to wait for more than a few minutes for a spot and there is street parking if the lot is full.
