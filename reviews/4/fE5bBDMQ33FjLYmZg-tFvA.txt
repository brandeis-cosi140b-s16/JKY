Thanks to Michael's review I decided to check this place out. Gotta say that this place is pretty darn good. The salsa is bland as Michael says but adding salt doesn't change the heat. What you want to do is mix it with their hot salsa!  Bingo!  And why would anyone put beans in a chimichanga anyway?  That's not a "chimichanga".  So of course bistec sin frejoles. Lol. Also. The best Spanish rice I've had in the Phoenix area so far.  Â¡Deliciosa!
