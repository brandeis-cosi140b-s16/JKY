I will admit Mims serves up some seriously good food BUT the place is really small and super ghetto. You have to walk through a screen door then open the front door to get in like your walking into someones house( in the ghetto of course). When you get in its hotter inside than it is outside and it does NOT smell good. I walked into the bigger room on the side where the the games are and it smelled like a cat was living back there! I ordered a chili dog and french fries with an iced tea. They put real shredded cheese on the chili dog not the artificial cheese and the french fries were crispy and tasted great with ranch. The food makes up for the poopy atmosphere and if you eat here make sure you place your order to go.
