It was my first time eating here and hostess was nice and cheerful. Our waitress was very polite and funny very good customer service.

I ordered the surf and turf which consists of crab fajita, grilled chicken soft taco and Mexican rice with grilled steak, it was amazing! 

Great atmosphere for a Mexican restaurant, it feels like a Mexican tgi Friday and oh yeah there's a bar section as well.
