I normally don't hang on this side of town WHATSOEVER but what the hay... gotta live a little! Lmao :-) I ordered a Carne asada burrito and a large Horchata to go, and I'm not sure if I was just hungry due to fasting and trying to eat a little less nowadays, but man let me tell ya, it was soooooooo delicious! I took the whole thing down in around 7 minutes. I asked for my mean cooked well, so it came out crispy just how I like it. The cook back there must literally be from Mexico because only they can make it taste like your actually south of the border. The service was good, I didn't wait too long for my order either. The only reason why it's not a full 5 stars is the price. Plates are about $2 to $3 bucks more expensive than other places like this. Even other Pepe's around town are less than this location. I'm not complaining tho, just making an observation is all. STILL great food. If I'm ever on this side of Vegas again I wouldn't hesitate to grab a bite.
