i've been raised on macayo's so i maaaayyyy be a little biased, but i really enjoy their chips and salsa and anything they put the baja sauce on.  the enchiladas are also really good and the cheese crisp is (usually) perfect.  i've never had an issue with service at this location that was noticeable one way or another.  my favorite macayos is still the one on 19th ave and thunderbird, but this one is a close second.
