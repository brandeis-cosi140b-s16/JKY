I've only had their tacos here, but it's delicious.  It's much better than the other taco places in town that people rave about, i.e. Taqueria Guadalajara.  I haven't tried El Pastor yet but I'm not sure I need to anymore.  

Their tacos have a variety of meats such as asada (steak), lengua (tongue), chicharron (pork skin), tripa (intestines), pastor (pork), chorizo, and pollo.  I'm a fan of carne asada tacos and so I order that each time I go.  Their carne asada is well flavored, not dry, and served on top of corn tortillas and topped with cilantro and onions.  It's delicious.  I also enjoy the lengua and chorizo tacos.  The lengua is slightly more tender than the steak taco.  The pastor is also good.  It's slow cooked with pineapples for a bit of sweetness.  I'm not a fan of pineapples in my taco so I usually pass on the pastor though I still enjoy it from time to time.  The tacos are also incredibly affordable given the amount of food.   

Their salsa bar is extensive with 6 different salsas.  They have the standard salsa verde, but also a jalapeno avocado one, one that's got a pronounced smoky flavor.  It's fun just to try the salsas, and I like that they don't skimp on the spice.  

Their chips are also delicious, freshly fried and salted.  

This place serves up delicious tacos that satisfy my cravings.  I don't care what their burritos or quesadillas or whatever else they have on the menu may taste like.  I will come here just for the tacos.
