So, I always have mixed emotions with this place but the moment I eat the Al Pastor Tacos, I end up LOVING this place again. The only down fall is that occasionally, our order is incorrect, whether it means they added guacamole or they didn't give us 10 tacos. For example,  We had ordered 10 tacos the last time and the order came out to be $30!!! Without questioning, we paid, left, and felt ripped off. Come to find out, they had charged us for the "bigger" tacos that we never ordered versus our usual order of the 10 "small" tacos. The only harm done was in our pockets. Our stomachs and taste buds, however, were quite satisfied.

As far as Carne Asada Tacos, they are fairy good. The only reason I go here is for their Al Pastor Tacos... although, they always right down Adobada Tacos, so I am unable to confirm what it is I'm eating, because the menu says they have Al Pastor tacos. Nonetheless, these tacos are amazing. 

The place is like the usual little Mexican Restaurant but the food is definitely a bit superior on the food chain.
