Definitely like others said, try the breakfast burrito! They are definitely worth it, they are huge and can fill you up. Looks can be deceiving, because they look small on the menu board, and they will look small when you get it. You may order two because you feel hungry, but trust me, you will barely be able to finish HALF of one! They are very fulfilling at all times of day, especially when you're  just looking for something quick and cheap.

The minute you order, they will immediately begin cooking your order in the back, which means, yes, there will be a little bit of a wait. But the wait is worth it. 

OTHER THINGS I RECOMMEND  YOU TRY OUT: 

Rolled Tacos- DELICIOUS
Nachos
Carne Asada w/ beans!
