Location:  not the best of neighborhoods, small strip center dominated by a pawn shop and the restaurant.
Service:  A little slow but not excessive, friendly staff
Food:  Cheese and Onion enchiladas, ground beef taco and rice and refried beans. Enchiladas were very tasty and hot although a little shy on onions; rice cooked well but a little bland; beans average.  The salsa and chips were very good, not overly spicy and chips crispy.  I will return.
