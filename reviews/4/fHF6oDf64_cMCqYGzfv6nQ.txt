So I have been here twice now and both times I got a burrito. I can't remember the which kind I ate the first time but the second time I got the Surf & Turf burrito. THAT thing is a beast filled with steak and shrimp, as well as your usual interior fillings. The burritos here are so large that it is really hard to eat the whole thing plus any chips or drink. They are decently priced, I think my burrito came to a total of $9-$10 which isn't terrible since it filled me up to the brink. The staff seems friendly and the owner likes to drop in and make suggestions to people in line which is a nice touch. I definitely plan on going back when I'm on that side of town again. Just dont go in there and expect to eat light.
