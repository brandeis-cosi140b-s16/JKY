Quick, cheap, & yummy! I saw a few reviews of people complaining about service, just want to state that this is not a sit down service type place. You order at a counter, get your drink from a soft drink station, get your own salsa, and they bring food out to you, not a whole lot of service to be had. Nothing fancy but when I need a quick, cheap meal this does the trick!
