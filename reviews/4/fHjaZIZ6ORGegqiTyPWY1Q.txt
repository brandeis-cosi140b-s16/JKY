Food is good and the portions are huge.
Warning: if you are with a group of light eaters, order less one or two plates, you will get filled up fast.

The food is very fresh, service is good. And its always nice to have the chips to munch on while you are waiting.

I like to bring foreigners here for a Mexican themed place, that while might not be super authentic, the food is very good and palatable to most people and it is always clean and well kept.
