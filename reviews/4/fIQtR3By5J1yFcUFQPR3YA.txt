I love the fresh juices! Try watermelon. 

The nachos are very good. The restaurant was clean and the staff was super pleasant. This restaurant might be conducive to those that have quick lunch breaks. It is conveniently located in close proximity to Spring Valley Hospital. I was on a quick lunch break today.

At Frijoles & Frescas you place your order and pay at the counter, the food is made then delivered to your table. You get your own fountain drink and utensils. 

The nachos have steak strips, tomatoes, beans, guacamole, sour cream, and jalape√±os. This is well worth the money. I followed this with a taco, which had a double soft shell. The taco was priced at $4.50 for just the one taco. I had been informed it was a super large taco for that price - but, it wasn't.  I am not sure I will spend that much for one taco again, but I will definitely try some other things next time I am in the area on a lunch break.

The burrito's are great! I had the chicken burrito on a subsequent visit.
