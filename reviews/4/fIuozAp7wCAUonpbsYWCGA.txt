We have tried most of the restaurants reviewed here but keep returning to Maria Bonita - and it's because of the fajitas.  Still have not found any Mexican place that has the seasoning and spices that Maria Bonita has.  Also, the salsa that comes with the chips changes each time we go as it is made on site, and almost all of the time it is fantastic.  Lunch prices are very good compared to the $8 an $9 dishes most South Charlotte places charge.
