I had breakfast here - a chorizo quesadilla - and it was just great.  It was way too large - I could have been happy with one-third of what I was given.  I ended up leaving over half of it -- so maybe smaller portions could be offered.  The service was fine.

What I want to tell Barrio Avion, if they read these reviews, is that the signage is highly confusing and makes it hard to order.  I suggest:  1)  increase the type size on the signs (it's small and really hard to see), and 2) show some photos of the food.  

I would surely go here again - no doubt.
