The crowd here is totally not my scene, but you have to appreciate great ambiance and incredible food. It's a haul up to this place from where I live, even when I lived in north Scottsdale, but totally worth it. There are few cooler places to be in the Valley than a warm night on the patio here.

The inside is very New Mexican, with a totally rustic full bar that has been packed every time I've come in. I even skip my usual drink of choice to order the Scottsdale Cocktail (yup, friggin' awful name, but the citrusy goodness in this glass is just too hard to resist). 

The food? Some of the best carne asada I've ever had. It comes with an avocado tomatillo sauce that is literally blissful. The honey glazed salmon is also a delight, with an interesting mix of sweet, tangy and just a bit of kick. Though it's kind of BS that they don't bring chips and salsa to the table -- shouldn't be surprised in this neighborhood, but still -- order the chips and salsa trio anyway. It's worth the extra cash for this trio of awesome sauces.
