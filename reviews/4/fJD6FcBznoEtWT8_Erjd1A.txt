Great, authentic Mexican and Honduran food. The best I have found after touring the South Boulevard corridor. The lunch specials, 11-3 including weekends, is a steal. The portions are a crime... Take some home!  Ordered a tamale ($2) and plantain empanada (also just $2) as sides... Both were outstanding.
