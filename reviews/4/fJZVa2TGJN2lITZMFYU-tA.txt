Love this place!!! Came here for lunch yesterday and I about inhaled the entire bowl of chips and salsa :) BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! I was on a quick lunch break so I ordered off the light lunch menu and had a chicken quesadilla, which had carmalized onions and gave it a sweet taste. I will definitely be back! Yum!

4 Stars due to the fact that we requested 2 bowls of the salsa, but additional chips were never brought to the table. Maybe a good thing as I couldn't keep my hands out of the bowl :)
