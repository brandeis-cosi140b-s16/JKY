I went here for the first time because of a group 5 for 10 deal.  I have to say the staff was really friendly.  Prices reasonable.  The quesadilla I had was awesome.  I also ordered some nachos but ended up having sour cream and guacamole on them which I couldn't eat.  I definitely will be going back.  This takes the lead for my cheap taco spot in town.
