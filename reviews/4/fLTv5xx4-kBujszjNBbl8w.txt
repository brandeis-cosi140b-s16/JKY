We came here and got a sampling of food.  The quesadilla's, touted as phoenix's best by the New Times were more like a smothered crispy taco with some cheese like you've never had inside.      A bit too much deep fried flavor for me though.

The rellenos were served in a bowl, smothered with a red sauce which was unique - not like you would find in the AZ/NM area.  Lot's of breading on the rellenos.  Not the best chiles. Meh.

Salsa.  A++.

The green stuff they bring out with the chips is eeeeexcellent.

The habanero from the salsa bar made me come back for a second time.  If you can stand the heat, make sure to try it on some of the tacos.  Al pastor and spicy chicken were the meats we chose.  Muah.

Unfortunately, the salsa cooking in the back made us leave the first time.  AHawk though she was having indigestion or something, but then starting choking and coughing.  Serious stuff here.
