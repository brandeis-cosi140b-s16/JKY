Haven't been in for a while, but I had to get one of their new Smoky Red Chile Hand Battered Shrimp Tacos...it was really good. The sauce is sweet with a hint of heat, very nice. Had to get a Fish Taco as well, always a favorite of mine. Love their Chipotle salsa. Staff is always friendly, helpful. I think their food is worth the price, I'd rather eat here than a fast food burger joint.
