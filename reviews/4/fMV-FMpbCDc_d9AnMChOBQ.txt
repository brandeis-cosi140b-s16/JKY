The salsa and bean dip with chips at the beginning is really good.

We came here tonight for $9.99 endless tacos or enchiladas (avail on wed or thurs night) and bottomless margaritas and flan for dessert.  

I chose the chicken enchiladas and had 3 margaritas (yummy), My dinner was very good. Service was average. I had to wait for more salsa that took almost 10 minutes to get. 

I think this special is very good and I would absolutely go back again.  I was actually surprised that their margaritas were really good (choice of traditional or strawberry) and it wasn't just watered down or anything. Even the flan was good.
