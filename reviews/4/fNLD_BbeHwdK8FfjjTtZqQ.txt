I've been here before and just had an appetizer (which was great), so it was nice to come back and check out their actual meals. First off- if you're limited on time, you probably should plan accordingly. I've been there on a Thursday and Friday night, and it doesn't matter. It's just busy all the time. Because it's so busy, it's loud. Can't really hear yourselves talking, so not recommended for intimate conversation. 

But the FOOD- excellent. Had spinach enchiladas and it was top notch. It also helps that I'm a cheese-a-holic. If you like cheese you will not be disappointed. I have also never been much of a fan of Mexican rice, and I loved their rice. You get a ton of food for the prices, very worth it. Our server took great care of us when we told her we were in a bit of a rush. I will definitely eat here again, I think Nando's just replaced Serranos as our Mexican food place when all the back east friends and family come to visit.  Though I'm thinking take out, to avoid the crowd.
