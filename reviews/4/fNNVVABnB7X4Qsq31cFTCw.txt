Yes I know Macayo's is a chain....but I like it...so sue me!  They do a good job with the classics and it is fairly consistent.  I go there for happy hour once a month with a group of people, and we always get great service.  The salsa is addicting and the half price appetizers at happy hour are a great deal!  The mini chimis, the spinach con queso and the cheese crisp are my favs.  I usually just end up getting a cheese crisp with a side of beans...and it comes out to like $6!

I also really like the Baja Shredded Beef Chimi....the meat is really tender and flavorful, and then it is covered in the creamy baja sauce...heaven!  

I like to go for lunch during the week too because they have great lunch specials....I am a fan of the Tostada Grande...which is basically a tostada the size of a dinner plate!

So if I am in the mood for a classic standard...Macayo's fits the bill.
