Okay, this is no 5-star restaurant but it's awesome in it's own right.  We landed on Fremont Street for a night of debauchery, and just wanted to put a little food in our bellies first- definitely NOT a night for a buffet or that much food!  Did I mention there were 10 of us?  I drug the group to this place with my fingers crossed that it would please everyone and it did!  The Chinese was outstanding given that it was tasty, cheap, and quick!  The staff is super friendly, sampling their food, and generally overall just giving off a positive vibe!  Some folks got the pizza as well, and said it was awesome!  Try the Bourbon Chicken and Orange Chicken combo, YUMO!
