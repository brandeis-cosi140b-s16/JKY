We have been here a few times and never had any issues. We only come here when we are in the area. Not to confuse this place with the Original Garcia's further south on 35th ave. This location is very good, I have been to others that have not been as good. 
I have had there nachos, tacos, grilled chicken. Everything has always been good, kids loved it last time, and wife has no problem coming here. The service has always been great, never have to ask for anything. Seems like every time we come here they have their nite club going on. So it can get loud up front.
My two favorite mexican restaurants are Rio Mirage in Surprise, and The Original Garcia's in Phoenix. However, this location is right up their with them.
