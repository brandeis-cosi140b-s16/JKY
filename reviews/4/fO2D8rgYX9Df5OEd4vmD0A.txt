I was so glad to know that wahoos had come to town. As a former OC resident I don't have to make a trip to California to get my fix. 

I walked into the separate bar area and had a beer. The staff was friendly and quick to service your needs. I ordered some food and ended up meeting a friend there. We had a great time catching the end of the Thursday night football game on their nice new tvs. 

We would definitely be back for the service, cheap and tasty food, and food atmosphere
