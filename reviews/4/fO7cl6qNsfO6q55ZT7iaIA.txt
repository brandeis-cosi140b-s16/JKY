Reading about all these tacos my friends are eating reminded me of my own well kept secret taco joint!

I'm so addicted to this place that it's not even funny. The four stars is because they don't speak English and they can be pretty abrupt and rude most days. OTHER THAN THAT, these are the best, most authentic tacos I've ever eaten. They make me so happy!

Okay, to be very fair, I only get the carne asada tacos with onions, cilantro and green sauce. Mmmmmmm...green sauce. They are small, but pack a mighty Mexican punch! The meat is always tender, never chewy and they always, always use two corn tortillas so you have something to hold your filling in. Those one corn taco places ensure you'll end up with food in your lap every single time! Not here!

I also love their beans and rice. The generous serving can be shared by two! 

I can get out of there with three tacos, beans and rice and a drink for about $5. Not bad, not bad. 

These are best eaten drunk or hungover. What? It's true! But, I happen to think all Mexican food is best that way. Then sober, next. Then every day. But you get the picture.

This building will scare you, it's doesn't have a working speaker at the menu board so keep driving to the window. Also, CASH ONLY. 

If you have a few dollars in cash to spare, get over here fast! For location info: it's close to the Stratosphere, next to the Burger King. 

Just drive up and say 'Tacos, por favor' to eat the best you'll ever have!
