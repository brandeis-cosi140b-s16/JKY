Qdoba..Qdoba oh how I've missed you! I am an absolute fan on this place! It has yet to fail me! I use to eat here at least 3-4 times a week a few years ago! I relocated out of Las Vegas and wasn't never successful in finding another Qdoba! Chipotle is good but over rated and although they have pretty much the same concept I love how they aren't cheap with the portions of meat! I came here today for lunch and tried out that seasonal Mango Taco Salad bowl with chicken! Extremely tasty and the guy who made it was very generous with my toppings so who would complain about that? I must've arrived at an excellent time because I kid you not there was all but 2 people in the place when I arrived which resulted in my being helped immediately! Staff was great and customer service was on point! I'm glad to be back in Vegas and close to Qdoba again!
