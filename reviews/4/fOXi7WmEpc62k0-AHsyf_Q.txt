Forgive me diet, for I have sinned.

Okay I'm not really on a diet, and if I were I certainly wouldn't be ordering Bulgogi Fried Rice as I did this afternoon for lunch.

2nd time at KoMex. The first time I had an order of 3 tacos, each with a different meat and the optional kimchee on top.   Absolutely loved the meal, and lunch for 2 dining in (6 tacos and 2 drinks total) came out to some absurdly cheap price ($15?)  

This time I called in a take-out order of Bulgogi Fried Rice because calories and self respect be damned, I was hungry for Fried Rice (which only happens about 3 times a week so I had to act on it).   Upon arriving the restaurant was full (great sign!) and I was warmly greeted and served and brought my food back to my office.   

Upon opening the container I was shocked by the sheer mountain of fried rice that greeted me and I quickly closed it for fear of a co-worker seeing it.   Coast was clear so I took a few bites and was initially somewhat disappointed before realizing that I hadnt put any hot sauce on it.  Rookie mistake.  My impressions greatly changed of the dish after that in a good way, but overall I still found the bulgogi itself to not be as strong a flavor as I was expecting.   You could have told me this was a beef fried rice from some other chinese restaurant in Vegas and I probably would have been fooled.  It was still decent and combined with the previous 5 star experience and amazing value we're sitting at 4 stars overall for me.
