It is hard to believe five  Mexican fast food places could exist on 32nd St. & Greenway.  Food City has a place inside, Filiberto's, Los Betos,and here. ( there is one more that I can't think of..)
Anyway, I have been going to this place for a few years now.  While the staff is not the friendliest, nor have they been necessarily unfriendly, the food has always been good. Usually hit this place with my cousin for breakfast.  About two weeks ago I had their tripitas burrrito.  I crave that sucker now.  I think I dreamt about it the other night.The tripas are loaded with diced and perfectly crisped tripas( mouth is watering...) If you go, try something a little different.  The "scrap" meats that are common in Mexican family fare are pretty darn tasty.  'Course the "interesting" meat cuts sound a lot fancier when ordered in  French restaurant, but go for a truly tasty lengua, cabeza, or tripitas burrito!
