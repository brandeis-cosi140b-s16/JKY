I am indeed a fan. If you're down for some mariscos in Central Phoenix you should defitely try it out. Reasonable prices for good food. The mariscos are the upper end of the menu. There are also cheaper texmex items if you are in the snacking mood. They recently began accepting credit cards. Nice wait staff. Pleasant.
