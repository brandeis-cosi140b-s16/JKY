THE BEST Street tacos I have had in Arizona after eating Mex here for 15+ years.... Reminds me of being in Cozumel and San Carlos....genuine street tacos.......Meat is moist, and Mesquite flavored just enough. Salsas there are excellent too from a mild pico to their green which has a bite......Refried beans are perfect too.....I will be going back, Taco Tuesdays are a wicked good deal.
