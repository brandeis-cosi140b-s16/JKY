I love me some Laredo's.

First, the bad: the chips and salsa are pretty disappointing. They look amazing and smell so good, but just aren't that great.

The tacos are solid, all of them. Really well done and not too complex

But, here's what is amazing-the Farmer's Quesadilla and the Tortitas.
The Tortitas are barbecued meat and queso fresca on beautiful pretzel buns. Amazingly delicious. So good.
The Farmer's Quesadilla is spinach, black beans, corn, (maybe onions), and cheese.
It's served with guac, sour cream, and queso. All of which are fantastic on it.
