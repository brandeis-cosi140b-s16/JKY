I love Mexican food and Rosarita's Beach really hits the spot.  I've been here a couple times for lunch because it's pretty close to where I work.  I've only really tried one dish because I'm pretty boring and stick to what works.  On every occasion I've ordered the steak taco meal with rice and beans.  Comes with 2 steak tacos.  Keep in mind the amount of food you get isn't your normal extra large plate from a normal Mexican joint.  You do get a little less but, the quality of the food is perfect.  You can tell the steak is right off the grill and it hasn't been sitting around and re-heated.  I hate that!  They also have a salsa bar with 3 types of hot salsa and the carrots/pepper mix....awesome!  

The owner is the guy that rings you up.   He is a really nice guy and seems to act like he knows you.  The place itself is clean and has a beach feel.  Rosarita's had a bunch of personal pictures of the owner and his family at the beach.  It is a "mom and pop" business at its best.  Keep in mind that this is a family owned business and in order to keep his lights on the prices may be a dollar more than what you may usual pay at Roberto's or your local Mexican joint.  But, that extra service with a smile and the quality of the food with that extra "love" is totally worth it.  

If calories weren't an issue I could come here every day!
