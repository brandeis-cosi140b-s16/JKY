This place never ceases to amaze - they always pay attention to the little details that can take an all right meal and turn it into something awesome. Last night I brought in a party of 20-25 people and they took amazing care of us - although there was some confusion when it came down to breaking up the checks - a word to the wise; if you have a big party make sure everyone brings some cash or you will have a headache. I've had the pleasure of trying out a couple of their steak dishes now - each one has been absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly, with just the right balance of salty, spicy, and juicy. I will definitely be back again and again.
