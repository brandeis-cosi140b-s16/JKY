I can't believe I've only checked in here twice, because we must have eaten at this location at least once a week when I was pregnant! This is our go-to spot for a quick, easy and satisfying lunch, and always goes over well when people are visiting. The staff is extremely friendly and the food never disappoints. 
My personal pick is the fish tacos on corn tortillas, which come with cabbage, pico de gallo, a drizzle of chipotle ranch and a wedge of lime. Ask for sides of chipotle ranch and hot salsa on the side and you're set. Om nom nom!
