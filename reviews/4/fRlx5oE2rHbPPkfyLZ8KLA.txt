I find it only fitting that my first review on Yelp be of our local late night Mexican take-out joint both for my absolute affinity for Mexican Food and my love for this gem of a Roberto's...Yes, I know - there are dozens of Roberto's locations across the valley and I have not sampled each establishment's fare, but having gone to a good number of them, I can honestly attest to the Bermuda location's superiority! While most of the favorite late night dishes (Super Fries, Three Rolled Tacos, Carne Asada Burritos, etc.) are similar to other locations, the difference is in the little details...the hot sauce here is not too seedy, the spicy carrots are always fresh and crisp and the friendly staff is always willing to make reasonable substitutions - a must for my pico-for sour cream trade-off on my California Burrito! MMMmmmm.....
