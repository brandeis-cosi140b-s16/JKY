I agree with what Liz already said.  The one thing I had to mention is the green salsa it is fantastic and makes everything there taste awesome.  They should bottle it.  This is definitely a hole in the wall kinda place with very "home cooked" Mexican food. The restaurant is kinda shabby, but not offensive and the staff are always very friendly.  The food always comes out quick and they make it up right then.
