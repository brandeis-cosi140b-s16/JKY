It has become a tradition that every time my girlfriend comes to town, we make a pilagramage to Casa Don Juan. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, makes no difference to us as long as we can get our hands some of  their signature gucamole or nachos or any of their other fine entree's. 

When it comes to a great Mexican restaurant close to the strip, Casa Don Juan has it all.
