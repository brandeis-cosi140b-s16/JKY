My children love Chipotle, and where ever they are it is the first thing they look for.  I had never tried it before, but I have tried similar places, so I knew what to expect when I came in,  It is very clean and spacious, and there is plenty of room to park.  The first time I was there I wanted to read the newspaper, so I ate there, and it was quite pleasant. The next couple of times, I had burritos to go.

I was pleased  all of the times I was there.  As with any of these make-it-while you watch places, I think a lot depends on the people fixing the food.  All of the times I have been here, they have been very pleasant and have not skimped on any of the ingredients.

Compared to other similar business places I have been, the meat, whether it is the beef, chicken or pork, is extra flavorful. In all, a great experience.  In fact, as I write this, I am craving a Chipotle burrito...
