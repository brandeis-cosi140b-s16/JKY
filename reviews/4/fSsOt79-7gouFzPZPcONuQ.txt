We love Cilantro's. The best burritos, where they mix all ingredients rather than other places like Tacos' N More where you bite into a mouth full of sour cream. 

Love that you can watch them put your food together. Their fresh fried chips are good, just need SALT! Guac is okay, salsa bar is a good variety. 

Love their carne asada bowls and burritos!
