My roommates took me here for happy hour before they dropped me off at the airport and it was pretty darn good! It's located in front of the Fashion Show Mall. I just really don't like how there isn't a back entrance, so we had to walk from the parking garage and walk along the cars and around to get to the front of the mall along Las Vegas Boulevard.

Food/Drinks - We only ordered off the happy hour menu. Both of my roomies ordered the cheese quesadilla and I ordered the chicken quesadilla. We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa! Everything was tasty and worth the happy hour prices. We also got 2 margaritas each. I got mango and prickly pear! Omg best margaritas I've had! Not too strong, just right! They got strawberry and prickly pear. I had a sip of their strawberry and it was good too! 

Dining area - I really like how they have the outdoor patio with bar, and inside it looks very nice and authentic! We sat inside because there weren't anymore seating up front outside so we had a table right next to the window which was still very nice as well. 

I definitely recommend this spot! I only took a star off because of the hassle to get to te restaurant itself
