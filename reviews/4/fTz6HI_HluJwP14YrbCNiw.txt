My husband and I recently moved from Texas to Charlotte and have been in search of good Mexican restaurants. 

We live a couple of blocks away from crazy taco and pass by it every day, but haven't had the urge to actually go until today. We are always drawn to the bright colors and the drawing of the taco chasing the pepper on their signs...very fun. The design is nicely done for the style of the restaurant. Inside is very friendly and cozy as well.

We are vegetarian, so we knew it would be very little to choose from on the menu. They have an appetizer called gringo queso - which is just queso with beans in it - it was delicious! And the house salsa is very flavorful and good, but the consistency was a little too watery for our liking. I also think they could give more chips. Gimme dem cheeps!

We both ordered the vegetarian burrito. The wait for our food was not long, probably about 7-8 minutes. The plating was nice with tasty garnishes of cucumber and tomato slices. The veggie burrito is packed full of goodness - orange and green bell peppers, mushroom, onions, tomato, rice, and beans...probably more than that too. And it was a BIG burrito. Very yummy.
They serve the burritos with authentic red and green sauces as well - they were both very tasty and flavorful. The red was very bold. I preferred the green, it was really good with the veggies.

We just had water to drink - it was good water, served with a slice of lime, which I love!

The service was friendly and quick. We will most definitely visit again.

On a side note, it reminded us a whole lot of a restaurant in Grapevine, Texas that we used to frequent called "Burritos Locos." Very similar name, food, and atmosphere.
