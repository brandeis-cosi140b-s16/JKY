I went there tonight and was worried about some of the reviews. However, I found the service to be excellent, and the food was good, not great, because i like things a little more spicy, but that maybe just me. They also have a good wine list, which is unusual for most of the Mexican restaurants here. All in all it was a good experience, and I really liked the atmosphere. Glad I went.
