First time eating here, lots of food choices. Street tacos are mostly all under $3.00 each. I had the al pastor, pollo mole, and vegetarian (I like veggies!) All were great. My friends had burritos, enchiladas, and a torta sandwich, all were a great size for the cost. They have Dos Equis on draft, as well as margaritas.  Yes the place is small....it's in the "container park".  The concept is to have smaller spaces with cheaper rent to promote local business. For sure it's not GAP, Claire's, or Taco Bell. I love the atmosphere, feels like you're not really in Vegas. My only worry are the metal seats outdoors when it's 100+ degrees out. Other than that, I'll definitely be back to hang out here.
