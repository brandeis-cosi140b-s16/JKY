Loved the salsa bar with all kinds of fresh and unique salsas! Pecan, Jicama, Peanut, and Radish to name a few and I'm not usually a fan of tomatillo but it was really good. I had the steak and the black chicken mole tacos- the steak was on the dry side and lacked flavor but the salsa helped kick it up the few notches to where it needed to be. The space is small and tight, but with a cool modern Mexican decor. It looks like there is room to expand which I hope they get around to soon. We went for lunch and it was crowded and cramped. Service was good and attentive.
