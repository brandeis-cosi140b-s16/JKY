Went on a Friday for lunch for the first time. Small hole on the wall type restaurant with 5 small tables and a counter. Employees are super friendly and responsive. I had the consume loco and the tacos cochinita pibil. Both were very delicious! The soup starts off a little bland but throw in a few scoops of green salsa, a couple of the red and a squeeze of lime and now we're talking!
