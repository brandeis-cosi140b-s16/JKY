Located on Decatur and blue diamond.. On the side street.. Every time I crave for tacos I would stop by here to get at least 3 pastor tacos. That's my favorite, tried the beef but don't really like it. Kinda bland and chewy..

Tacos are $1.25 each..I haven't try anything else here beside the tacos..This food truck is always pack. Which means it's good, unlike the truck on the opposite street.
