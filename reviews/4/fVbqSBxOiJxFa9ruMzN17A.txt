I think they specifically seek out the nicest people in Phoenix and hire them to work at Z'Tejas. Also a walking distance spot for me and I really enjoy going. The margaritas are good, happy hour prices are great, the staff - as mentioned - is awesome and the food is good. It has cool decor and a nice environment and I'm happy to have them in my hood.
