I have have to disagree with the below poster.  I was turned onto Mad Mex during my college years because the opportunity to eat out at half price was worth it.  Furthermore, their veg. friendly menu was satisfying and NEW at that time (tofu in a dish... WHAT?).  So I have continued to deal with lousy service and horribly lighting for my tofu burritos =)
