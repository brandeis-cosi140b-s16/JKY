Service was awesome. On this visit our server was Lisa and she was very personable and made us laugh.  She also made frequent visits to the table for water, food taste and most importantly, keeping the free chips full. I tried the burrito with  cream sauce. The rice portion seemed small on the big plate but the taste of the food especially the cream sauce was good and in the end I was full. My family opted for the two item  combo plates and they enjoyed the tamales, enchilada, and tostadas.
