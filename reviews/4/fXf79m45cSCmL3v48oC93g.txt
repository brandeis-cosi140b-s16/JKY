Love this spot. Could be the fact that I live around the corner or could be the spot on food. They have 2 happy hours with $5 dollar apps that are enough to keep you full. I always sit downstairs. I call it my "dungeon". Pretty tricky to get up the stairs after a few cocktails, hence the indoor elevator for the tipsy patron. I always order the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped sea scallops. I take dates here and they all love it. We sit by the fire and it's low key. Great place to just sit and be relaxed. If you go early, hard to find a seat (place is very small) and the service is slow sometimes.
