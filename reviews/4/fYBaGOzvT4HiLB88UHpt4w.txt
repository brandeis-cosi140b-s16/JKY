Chevy's has amazing freshly made tortillas, but watch out because they're tiny and each one surprisingly contains 167 calories. They also make great quesadillas but only if they're made on their homemade tortillas. Their margaritas and desserts are also delectable, especially the little cinnamon-sugar tortilla cones with vanilla ice cream. I always had a blast here as a kid when they gave you a free sombrero on your birthday.
