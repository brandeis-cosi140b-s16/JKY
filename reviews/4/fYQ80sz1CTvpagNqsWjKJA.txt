Excellent burritos! The guacomole is delicious and they're generous with it, if you want it. I appreciate that many of their ingredients are free-range and organic. They have competitive prices with other restaurants of similar fare even though their ingredients are superior. It's nice to be able to see (and make adjustments) your burrito being created right in front of your eyes (like Qdoba). Friendly staff as well. OH! And the music has been remarkably enjoyable every time we've been in. OH! One more thing- there's a gated outdoor seating area. It makes it much easier if you have kids who don't want to sit still for long!
