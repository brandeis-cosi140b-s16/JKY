This is another place I came up on using this site, thanks. 

I been searching for some good tacos near my place and found it. I've eaten here 2 times on 5 attempts. This was due to the place closing before the posted closing time. The last two times I went by around 7:45 PM, and they were closed. Posted closing time, 9:00 PM. This is the only reason I've gave it a 4 out of 5 star rating. Back to the food. 

The food is excellent. I've only eaten the carnitas tacos with rice and beans. The 1st time I ate here it was awesome. The 2nd time I ordered to go and they were still awesome. The 3rd, 4th, and 5th... you know what happened. The tacos are a nice size, plenty of carnitas, with pico, cheese, and beans. 

The service was prompt and friendly both times. 

I still want to try more food from this place and will stop by earlier next time. I would recommend this place to anyone before 7:30 PM.
