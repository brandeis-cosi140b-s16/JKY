We took a break from the Christmas shopping craziness and had dinner at Rio Mirage tonight. The food was delicious. 

Chips and salsa are complimentary.
The chips were a little oily, like they had been re-fried to reheat, but the salsa is sooo good!

Hub had a fried burrito (chimichanga) enchilada style. The steak inside was super tender and flavorful. 

As usual, I ordered more than I could eat.

I ordered albondigas (meatball soup), mainly because I have made it but never eaten a restaurant version (and I was cold). It was great and would have filled me up all on its own. Savory meatballs, carrots, celery, onions, potatoes, cabbage (I think) and rice, floating in a thick chili broth. Comfort food. 

For main course I had Mahi Mahi tacos, with double beans since I don't like  rice much. Cubes of well seasoned fish, grilled and served in soft fried corn tortillas (soft but not dry) with lots of perfectly ripe avacado chunks. With a jicima pineapple salsa on the side. I prefer a cabbage slaw with fish tacos, but it was good. The beans were black beans, which I love, evenly cooked and topped with cheese. Luscious.

My margarita was made from a mix, but, hey, this is a low priced neighborhood restaurant. They did get the lightly salted rim part spot-on! 

No room for dessert!

All of the service was great, from greeting to drinks to packing up my leftovers.

Erik is an awesome waiter. Give that man a raise!
