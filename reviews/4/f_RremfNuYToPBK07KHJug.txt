Forget Filiberto's. Forget Riva's. Forget Super Burrito and the countless other fast food Mexican places in the valley. So what if their fluorescent overhead lighting and cheap plastic booths give you high school cafeteria flashbacks? If you want atmosphere and more of that family feel, head to Abuelo's or Serrano's nearby. 

If you're looking for a perfect breakfast burrito for under $4, Los Favs is the only place that delivers. The tortillas are always fresh, hot, slightly chewy, and ridiculously good. Combine that with fluffy eggs, soft potatoes, spicy chorizo (or ham, bacon, sausage, machaca or beans), and a handful of melted mexican blend; what do you get? A forearm-sized, artery-clogging gift from the gods that's just as good after a night of drinking as it is stone cold sober. Top if off with their tangy green sauce, and you'll be as addicted as I am. My only complaint is that they're not open 24/7 so that I can get my burro fix any time of the day! 

Here's a tip: call in your order early on a Saturday or Sunday morning for a cheap, delicious breakfast that'll fuel you up for the long day of beer and football ahead. Cheers!
