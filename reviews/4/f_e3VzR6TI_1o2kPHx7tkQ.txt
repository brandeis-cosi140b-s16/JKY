Family of 4 went there for dinner tonight. Staff was friendly and the food came out pretty quickly even though they were very busy. I had the shrimp burrito, while the rest of the family got the carne asada burrito. Mine was delicious and my family enjoyed their burritos. We also tried the carne asana nachos, which were excellent. The chips were homemade and very good. All in all a good experience and we'll be back. Only complaint I had, which is not at all the owners fault, was the family with 5 kids too many. If you're going to take your family out to dinner and bring your small children be courteous of those around you. Parents were too busy talking to each other to notice their kids running around screaming in the restaurant. So rude! If you can't control your children in a public place, stay home!!
