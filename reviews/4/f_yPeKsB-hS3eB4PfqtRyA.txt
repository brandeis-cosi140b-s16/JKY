I used to go here a couple of years ago in the summer for happy hour. I went out with a few of the ladies last night. Drinks are great and most are 5 bucks during happy hour. 
I had Mimosas, 2  carne asada tacos (mini) with chips, dip and guacamole. 
Excellent food. 

The also have free access to pool, even if you are not a guest.
