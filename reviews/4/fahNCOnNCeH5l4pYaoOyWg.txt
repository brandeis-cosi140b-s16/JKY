This Mex restaurant is tucked away in a corner of a dark parking lot. The inside is nicely decorated with clay tiled comfortable booths I had the arroz and pollo and it was delicious. See my picture. I added a $4.25 margarita. It was a nice size with a good mix of alcohol and flavor. The staff was friendly and good.  I'd stop here again if in the area.
