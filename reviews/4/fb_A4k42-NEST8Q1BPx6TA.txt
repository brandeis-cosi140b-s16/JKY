Restaurant looked very clean, and had a nice artsy decor. I also liked the restaurant didn't have blaring music playing so you can actually talk without screaming with the people you're dinning with,unlike other Mexican sit down places. I went for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu which had a good selection at a good price.  Service was fast and the food was good.  It was nice not to have to wait on the weekend to get seated around lunchtime.
