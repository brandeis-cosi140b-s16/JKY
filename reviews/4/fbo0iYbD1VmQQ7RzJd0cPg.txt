Amazing people. Brilliant classic and unexpected combinations. Worth the effort to call ahead and order. Worth waiting in line when it's busy. Worth finding this hidden gem. You might even get a warm batch - and yes, I ate them in the car before getting home. Salsa is darn good. T-Shirts are fun. Seasonal flavors are tasty. All in all a great find. It's the tamale reinvented!
