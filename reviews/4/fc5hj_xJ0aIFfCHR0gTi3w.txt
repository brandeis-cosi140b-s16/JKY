A co-worker took me here today, I was expecting a hole-in-the wall or dive type place, but it turned out to be super clean, friendly, and delish lunch! I love mexican food and this place will be in my top favorites now. Clean, fresh, and non-greasy mexican food! Yes, I said non-greasy!

The price is right, the food is fresh and the people are friendly! Kudos, peeps at T.P.!!! I'll be back next week!
