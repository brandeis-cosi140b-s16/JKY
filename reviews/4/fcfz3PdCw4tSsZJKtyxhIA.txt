Went on Saturday 04-05-14 and had a good time even though it was a lil' windy and crazy cold.  It was HARD to find the darn place and the area is like a ghost town.  I had two pina coladas $ 10 each, they were excellent.  Ordered the avocado roll and they have chicken $ 10.  Comes with 4 and is like a meal if you don't share.  They were insanely good.  Had 1/2 a shrimp enchilada from my friends plate and it was so good.  The fried ice cream was good but I loved the crisp tortilla thing it came with.  Sat in the patio, view was good, and there was an event by the water with a live band.  Thank GOD we sat by fire pit cause it was cold.  BBRRRR!
