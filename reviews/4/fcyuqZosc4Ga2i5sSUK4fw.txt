Me & my daughter are fans! The chicken taco (crunchy) is just the best. With all the veggies mixed in, it even feels healthy. This particular location is always pretty crowded. They sure are popular.

This is my second choice for Mexican, after Macayo's. Although they really aren't comparable... with one being a fast food place and the other, a sit down restaurant. 

Garduno's used to be one of my favorites for Mexican. But now they've been taken over by new management, the name has changed too. And the food is just not worth the drive. They still have the Mariachi's which is the only reason I'd go.
