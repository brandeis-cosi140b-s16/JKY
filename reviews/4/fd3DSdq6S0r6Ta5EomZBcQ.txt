When I first started coming here a couple of years ago, there were just three locations, and the carne asada was my little secret.  Now they've got a handful of locations, and are expanding the franchise.  This location (Ray and 101) feels more "corporate", but the food is just as good as the hole-in-the-wall original locations.

The carne asada is still pretty good, but my new favorite is the al pastor (pork).  It's fantastic, you have to try it.  And don't forget to check in on yelp to get some free chips and salsa.
