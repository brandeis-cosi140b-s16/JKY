Very nice authentic street tacos, right in the middle of Las Vegas strip between all kinds of touristic mega chain restaurants. Wow!

I was very glad to discover this place while looking for something decent to eat quickly, place certainly does not look very fancy but the most important thing i.e. food was good. I took the taco plate with 3 tacos, rice and beans which was more than enough to kill my hunger. Tacos were tasty, fresh with just about right amount of spiciness (with the most spicy sauce). 

All in all a place I would certainly visit again if ever looking for something quick to grab when walking up and down the Strip
