I'm a Carl's Jr fan for their fried zucchini and their crisscut waffle fries. The biggest thing about this place is their chicken sandwich. I definitely choose their chicken sandwich over any other fast food place in town that is. The chicken isn't breaded and its always tasty and moist. Their customer service could be a bit better though but it doesn't stop me from coming back.
