My friend and I were only in Vegas for a day for a wedding and we hadn't eaten all day. The heat just made our hunger and thirst worse! So we stumbled upon La Salsa Cantina at Caesars Palace and were unsure if the outcome would be good or not. Usually places like this are over priced and the quality sucks.

Luckily, it wasn't like that! The food was so good. The menu is a small to fair selection. Typical mexican restaurants have pages and pages of food to choose from, but La Salsa only had a couple and they were great dishes to choose from.

I had a grande chicken burrito and my friend had street style carne asada tacos. I was indecisive whether to get the burrito or a enchilada stack! I choose the burrito and what a great choice it was. Both of our plates had great portions of beans, rice, and our main entree. I had black beans and my friend had pinto beans. 

The only complaint I have is they didn't serve chips and salsa for starters. I glanced at a table across and they had chips and salsa, but another table didn't. So I'm guessing they serve them upon request. No big deal. Our meals had us full for the rest of the day. Oh, and the bus boy wouldn't stop hitting on my friend! That was annoying. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great mexican food. I wish they had this place in Southern California!!!
