First, go here with the intention of eating a lot! Portions are large! 
Service: excellent, the young servers were very attentive and hard working
Food: CHEESY!! The #13 (little bit of everything) was amazing specifically the tamale...mm! The Chicken enchilada and taco were loaded with chicken if you like meat! Personally, I liked the shredded beef more.
Ambiance: this is where this rating isn't a 5 star. The layout is exactly the same as Compound Grill and doesn't have that homey feel. I would recommend adding some color and more culture! 
Prices: entrees are reasonable, however appetizers are a little pricey (guac $7). The skinny margarita is excellent if you don't like sweet drinks. My husband ordered Cadillac and he rated it 8/10. 
Definitely a must try!
