Stopped by yesterday with my honey and our toddler for an early dinner yesterday. As others have stated- it was pretty empty. Maybe 5 other tables- but it was about 3pm so in between meals. 
Server came over timely and was very nice. Food and ritas came out quickly- and everything was correct. Taste was fine- nothing amazing spectacular, but it was good. I'm sure we will come back.
