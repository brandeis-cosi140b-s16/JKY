First timer here :)  I've been to chipotle ( not a fan ) I've been to cafe rio ( a fan) but there's something really special about this place, everyone is soooo friendly ! If you've never been here, you can compare it to chipotle as the ordering goes, but the choices of aguas frescas ( fresh water for ya gringos ) are incomparable and the lady behind the counter was very generous with all the free sample offerings . I chose the pepino ( cucumber ) & sandia ( watermelon) combination and it was so spot on compared to what you would get at your local Hispanic markets ... Just the frescas had me sold :)  

My GF ordered just pepino but they had endless flavors including the following : horchata, Jamaica, Fresa, espinacas, and chia. We both ended up ordering the Mexican salad with pollo. The salad had Mexican style rice and pinto beans, we both eat healthy and the only downside with that is, I wish they offered brown rice and black beans but any- who, it had lettuce tomatoes and a tomatillo dressing. It was good :) then we both shared the Mexican street corn, it was good but not as great as you would get it from the Elote man.. Just saying ... The tables were clean. The staff was nice, but the chile ( hot sauce ) bottles were almost empty. Overall good food, good prices .. We shall return .
