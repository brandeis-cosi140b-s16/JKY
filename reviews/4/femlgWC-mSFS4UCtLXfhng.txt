Diego has amazing chips and salsa.  I love salt and the flavored salt trio that came with the chips was fantastic.  I ordered the chef's tasting menu and it was quite tasty.  It had several different beef selections on it and each one was interesting and delicious.  It was a little pricier than the average Mexican joint, but I thought it was worth it.  Margarita hit the spot.
