Seeing that I have eaten at pretty much every restaurant at Tempe Marketplace I decided to try Maria Maria for lunch with my friend since I've heard good things about it. Loved the ambiance inside the restaurant, it was very open and had a trendy,colorful, posh vibe going on. 

They started us off with chips and 3 different salsas (which if it's good I can make a meal off alone) one had a  smoky chipotle flavor, the other one was spicy and I tasted lots of cilantro, garlic and maybe tomatillo and the third one was a more standard medium chunky salsa, they were all delish! My fav had to be the cilantro garlicky one.  I ordered the lunch combo that came with an entree and soup or salad. I got the chicken enchiladas "suizas" and the spinach and mango salad. The tomato cream sauce and cheese on the enchiladas was heavenly and the raisins, slivered almonds and vinaigrette worked well with the spinach and mango.  

Overall the service and food were great! It was pretty empty for lunch so I would like to come back during dinner time to see this place in action!
