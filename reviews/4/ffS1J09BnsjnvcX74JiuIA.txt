It's great to have another option in Old Town for late-night grub.

My Wife and I came here for dinner and had a good meal.  
The decor is pretty nice ... definitely nicer than we expected from a place that has 'Tacos & Beer' in its name.  

The staff was friendly ... the only thing I'd say is when we were greeted by (I think) the manager at our table, he offered to bring us guacamole with our chips and salsa.  Sure, we could have asked 'how much is it,' but the way he said it seemed to imply it was either complimentary or cheap.  It was $10.  We were also a little surprised by the drink prices.

That being said, the guac was incredibly good.  We also enjoyed the Carne Asada tacos.

Happy to have this place here.  Definitely good for late-night bites and Happy Hour.  

ENJOY!
