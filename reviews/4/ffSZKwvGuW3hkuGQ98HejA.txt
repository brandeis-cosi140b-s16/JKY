The California breakfast burrito was a perfect combination of pico potato cheese and steak. Perfect for a hangover. I will not order the carne Asada taco salad again because it was extremely salty. I think it's because I got carne Asada though so I may try a taco bowl again but get steak or chicken instead. Then if all that fails I will just go for the breakfast burrito. I just love all the toppings on the tAco salad, it has just a little bit of everything in a fried taco bowl shell. I will be back here!
