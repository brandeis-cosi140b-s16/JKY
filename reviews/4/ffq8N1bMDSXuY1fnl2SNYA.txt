I was craving tacos, in that annoying slightly drunk way: "Guuuuyyss I have to eat tacos."

So off we went.

Tacos in a strip mall? Yes please. Their tacos are cheap and they serve quite a variety.

My favorite was the beef tongue but they have chicken and lots of options for you scaredy cats out there.

Queso was super interesting and a large serving. Salsas were great too- if you are in the area want some authentic offerings are just cheap tacos open late, pull into this shopping center parking lot.
