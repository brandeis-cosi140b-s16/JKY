By far, the best Mexican food I've had so far in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Yum!  First, their chips and salsas rock.  The perfect amount of kick.  There was a menudo on special, which our waitress recommended but let us try a cup before ordering.  It was ok, but you could tell what you were eating.  I'm glad I tried it, but not my lunch of choice.  I ended up ordering an enchilada dish - 2 mole enchiladas and one with a green sauce.  I was not impressed with the green sauce - it seemed to be VERY heavy on the cilantro, but I LOVED the chicken mole enchiladas.  Yum!  Also was served with rice & beans and they were great.  My boyfriend had two different tacos off the menu, he thought they were both OK but nothing too great.  He did tell me that he had the barbacoa there in the past and LOVED it, but I will have to take his word on it.  It doesn't look so great on the outside, but I would definitely recommend this to others and I will definitely be back!
