I was so excited to hear that Dos Caminos was coming to Summerlin. I had tried the one in the Palazzo a few years ago and loved the guacamole. 

Walking in .. we noticed that they hadn't done too much renovating from the old Agave restaurant. It's still open, spacious with comfy booths all around and a huge inviting bar in the middle. Love the outdoor space which would be great for cocktails and appetizers. 

We ordered the Guacamole with the Jumbo Lump Crab and Chipotle .. it was just as good if not better than I had remembered. The trio of salsas was good as well, and the accompanying chips crisp and nice and salty. 

Mom decided on the Grilled Shrimp Quesadilla which was served on an open-faced crispy tortilla. She loved it .. I mean really loved it .. and she doesn't usually go for Mexican fare. She even loved it as leftovers the next day! 

I wanted to try a little of everything and got the Dos Caminos Bocadito Trio. It came with two pieces each of the chicken taquitos, molotes potosinas (corn masa turnovers with roasted pepper rajas, spicy house made cheese,
pepita-pasilla de oaxaca salsa), and the plantain empanadas. I found the empanadas to be bland and mushy, the chicken in the taquitos dry and the potosinas just okay. Definitely not something I'd ever order again. 

We will most certainly be back as it's so close to home and I would go just for the guacamole, salsa and chips. And then maybe sample one of those yummy sounding desserts!
