If you are looking for a happy hour with great drink specials and free chips and salsa, then this is your place. They also have great specials on appetizers during happy hour. I want to say you can get a huge cheese crisp for like $3. My favorite thing on their menu is the spinach queso. It is made with a creamy white cheese and it is delicious. The rest of their menus is nothing spectacular, but their happy hour is definitely worth stopping in for. They even have TV's in the cantina so you can catch whatever game is on while you enjoy some beers!
