I'm a FOODIE, I admit it and that is why I HAVE to start working out again. I told my mom I need to get my  mouth wired.

ANYWAY, enough about me and my personal tantrums! On to business...THREE AMIGOS!

After reading the reviews the night before, I was ready to run out of the door in the pouring rain to try this AWESOME Mexican food. I was tired of the chain restaurants and wanted something authentic, not to mention the rave about the margaritas.

Alas, my boyfriend and I went to Three Amigos for lunch yesterday. Talking about shabby chic - just the way I like it. From experience the most shabbiest places has the best food. If you're looking for ambiance, this is not the place for you - go to Cantina for that (their food isn't all that great either). Anyway, so my boyfriend and I ordered the enchiladas. I had the Enchilada Verde...hands down I loved the sauce. When they placed that mound in front of me, I said..surely I can not eat all of this BUT as soon as I took my first bite, I smiled!

My boyfriend ordered the enchilada with the red sauce, I want to say it was called Enchalada Roja - he enjoyed it as well!

We will definitley be back and will try the other dishes my fellow Yelpers have raved about. 

BTW, the chips and salsa was okay - I've had better at On the Border (I know...CHAIN!) I'm so not a fan of Chain restaurants

Until next time, Yelp on fellow Foodies!
