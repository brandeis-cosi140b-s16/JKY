Good for your soul (if not your waistline) food!  Delicious, fresh food, service with a hustle (we sat at the bar during lunchtime), enormous portions and pretty much everything is smothered in cheese!  Whatever you get, make sure you try the succulent (yes, succulent) beef machaca as one of your fillings.  Unbelievable.  Spinach enchilada is super rich and tasty and the sonoran enchilada was so flavorful!  My best tip is to wear pants with an elastic waistband or just go all out and wear a muu-muu or caftan!
