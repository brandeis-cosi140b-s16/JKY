The boyfriend and I were in the mood for some non-greasy Mexican food so we ventured up to Los Sombreros last Friday. We have been there several times but we always order the same thing. I get the pollo con espinacas and he gets the pollo enchiladas. 

It was a nice evening so we chose to sit in the outdoor patio area - great atmosphere with twinkling lights, little fire pits going and a guy playing guitar and singing in Spanish. They were very busy that night so the food did take a little while to get, but other than that the service was good. And besides, you have the chips and salsa to snack on while they prepare your food.

Los Sombreros is not your typical taco shop. Don't walk in expecting to find greasy tacos and humongous burritos. It's more what I would call "foofy" (technical term) Mexican food.  My pollo con espinacas is two generous portions of chicken served in a chipotle cream sauce with spinach. On the side you can get rice, beans or veggies so I got rice and veggies. This dish is SO good. The chipotle cream sauce is just the right combination of spicy and creamy - make a great dip for the chips too! And the portion is big enough I always take half home.

I didn't get a margarita but this place has a HUGE list of tequilas so if you're looking for something other than Cuervo this place can satisfy.

I've always been happy with my dining experience at Los Sombreros. It's a great date place with great food.
