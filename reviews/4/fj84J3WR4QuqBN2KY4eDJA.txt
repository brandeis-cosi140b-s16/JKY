I've always loved El Pollo Loco. How can you not love yummy citrus marinated flame grilled chicken? sooooo gooood and getting hungry just thinking about it. Salsa bar is great and my favorite is the avocado salsa...I heavily douse that on everything. The pinto beans are a good side, along with the side salad (which is huge!), but have never cared for their rice, it is always a lil on the half done side and taste just like instant rice that they microwave or something. You get 3 tortillas with your combos and I like to make lil chicken tacos with them. For dessert you must get the churros...2 for 99 cents and they are always cooked to order and so yummy and fresh!
