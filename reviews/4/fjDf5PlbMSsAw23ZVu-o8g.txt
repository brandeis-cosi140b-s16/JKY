I am such a fan of this place.  Within the category of dives without waiters, this is a 5 star.  The food is so fresh and delicious.  The meat is spicy and of high quality.  The tortillas are homemade and again yummy.  The owning family is sweet, very helpful and really wants their customers to be happy.  My daughter takes golf lessons near here, so we will be regulars--bigtime.
