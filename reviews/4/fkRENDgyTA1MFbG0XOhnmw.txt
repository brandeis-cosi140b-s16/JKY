The only reason why they are getting a 4 star is because the banana stand and dulce de leche shake are amazing but the food was just ok 
The fries were to crispy and I like my fries crispy but not to the point where they are hard to eat. The burgers were ok, had good flavor but not worth the price and the tacos just weren't up to my standards the beef was ok and the chicken was dry. Overall this is a great place shakes but wouldn't come back for just the food just the shakes :)
