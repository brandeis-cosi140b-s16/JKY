When I go to Rubio's, I only have one menu item on my mind, the self proclaimed World Famous Fish Taco.  On rare occasions, I have foolishly strayed away from the fish taco in some misguided attempt at variety, and been disappointed.  I'm not trying to say that the other menu items aren't any good, it's just that the fish taco is what they are known for and what they do best.  They are balanced just right, corn tortilla with crispy fish, cabbage, sauce, lime and hot salsa (added from the salsa bar).  However, these babies have a short half-life and deteriorate quickly.  I do not recommend them for take out, and if you opt for the two taco plate, I would resist the urge to munch on the chips and pinto beans and devour those tacos while they are hot and fresh.

The service is always quick and friendly, and sets Rubio's apart from many order at the counter/take out restaurants.  They can be very busy around lunch time, but the manager and employees still ask how everything was while they clear your plates.  They really seem to care about the patron having a good meal.
