It's very small and it can be scary if your not familiar with the area BUT YOU' ll be fine service is great, food is a bit greasy but duh almost all Mexican food is. If you want a nice quick lunch this is your spot, if your expecting the most biggest or yummiest burrito in Vegas this isn't your place....now don't get me wrong their burritos are good but lacking compared to Cali but its Vegas sad to say Mexican (American) food sux here anyways. To get to the point don't expect a fat burrito, good quick food... And try the carne asada fries their very good unlike Roberto's yuuuuuuck, tortas are delicious!!
