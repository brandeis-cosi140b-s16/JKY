We found this place on Yelp when looking for some cheap Mexican food in the downtown area.

This is definitely the super cheesy Mexican food variety which is not generally my favorite, but I'll make this spot an exception because it's really good and really well run.

The service was so so so so so friendly. We were seated promptly and had our drink orders taken right away. Two of us went for the $1.75 margaritas. They weren't some amazing cocktail, but they were worth the price for sure. At the end of our meal we all got free shots. Is that something they always do? I have no idea, but the shots were also delicious.

I tried out the "Healthy" burrito. I'm sure it really isn't healthy but the Picado filling was amazing. Check it out.

I can't remember what the rest of my dining party got but nobody was sad with what they ordered.

Overall a tasty, pretty quick and super friendly dining experience.
