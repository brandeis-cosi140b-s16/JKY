Got the create your own tacos for 7.25, soft flour, carne asada, asadero cheese, and pico de gallo salsa. For what seems like whole on wall (it'd be easy to miss this restaurant since it's not facing the street and it's next to coin laundry). The wait was worth it. Carne asada was very good. I agree with one of the reviewers, price for a lot of items on the menu is kind of on the high side. If you are in Madison, a must-go foodie place.
