Three of us visited this clean, bright restaurant early Friday evening.  We ordered cheese and ground beef rellenos respectively and a bean burrito.  We also shared a bowl of boraches soup.  It is casual, order at the counter and then it is served on the table by the chef, owner, Johnny.      The chips and homemade salsa was on the table before we sat down.  I never drink pop so I judge a place by it's ice tea.  Johnny advertises that he only uses fresh and sure enough the ice tea was fresh brewed.  The food so followed, a little pacing would have been ok.  The soup was the best thing I had, beans, rice cheese.  Very tasty.  The cheese rellenos was different, mild green chile wrap in egg roll and fryed.  I ate the whole thing.  The sides were rice and beans,  also near perfect.  This is as close to homemade you can get without crashing my friend Mary's birthday party in south Phoenix. My companions enjoyed their meals too.  It was a little salty for my taste.   We are planning a return trip soon.
