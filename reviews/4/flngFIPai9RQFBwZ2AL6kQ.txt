As a Texan and an avid Tex-Mex lover, I was quite skeptical to come eat Mexican, let alone, Tex-Mex in Pittsburgh of all places. I came here for brunch with my BFF who has just moved to Pittsburgh. Knowing I might be disappointed in Mexican food up here, I was excited to get a wonderful brunch menu item. I chose the chicken and waffles, while the BFF chose a burrito. We also got a trio of guacamole, queso, and a salsa to start.

My chicken and waffles were off the chain amazing. The chicken was boneless and fried and tossed in a delicious spicy sauce. It was served with some agave nectar as well as some cream cheese concoction for dipping. Oh my goodness, it was just so amazing. The spiciness combined with the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese was just out of this world. I devoured my meal.

Now the BFF's burrito was not as good, sadly. To call it a burrito is even a bad choice of words. It was a moist, soggy tortilla that was not rolled in burrito form but simply wrapped around a large mound of mostly rice. It would have been great and probably more tasty if there was HALF of the rice. It was just silly how big it was and the rice distracted from the other ingredients. 

As I looked around, I saw a few other pairs of diners in which one got chicken and waffles, and the other got a burrito. It was so sad really, because mine was so good and I kept talking about how good it was and her's was just mehhhh... 

All in all - fabulous brunch, lame burritos. Go try the chicken and waffles NOW!
