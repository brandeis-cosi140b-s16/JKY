I enjoyed my meal here very much. I got a bowl and the hubby got the fish tacos'. We destroyed my bowl. There was nothing left to it. Not even a piece of lettuce. The fish tacos' were good, but my bowl was definitely better.
They have all these topping you can add to your salad or bowl or whatever you order. I thought the price was good, and the service was quick and friendly. I'd definitely come back here.
