I had the traditional carne adovado burro with green sauce.  I love spicy food, and it fit the bill!    The canned Mexican music could be turned down a couple of notches - it was a little hard to communicate.  Our server was very attentive.  Afterwards, we had a drink in the bar and enjoyed the live music.  Very cozy, comfortable neighborhood bar.
