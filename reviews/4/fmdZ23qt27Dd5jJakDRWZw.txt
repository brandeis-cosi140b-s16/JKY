Food was awesome, only complaint is that a generous order of fajitas only came with 2 very small (6 inch at best) tortillas and more cost extra not to mention you couldn't put much in them.  Staff could have been a bit friendlier like they were to the frequent fliers.  Overall, best Mexican food I've found in the West Valley in the short time I've lived here, authentic!
