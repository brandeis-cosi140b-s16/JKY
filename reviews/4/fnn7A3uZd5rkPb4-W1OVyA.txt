This Chipotle location is always busy. The line depending on when you go can be close to out the door. There is indoor and outdoor seating in a clean atmosphere. There are three things they serve Burritos, Tacos, and Salads they want to create it.  Then four options for children. The meat is free of chemicals, beans are organic and the vegetables are purchased from local farmers. The food is always good, but the chips seem to always taste stale.
