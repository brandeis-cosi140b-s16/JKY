Went in for lunch the other day in what used to be Baja taco. Clean on the inside and the gentlemen at the register was very polite which is always appreciated. Orders rolled tacos (5-3.75) or (3-3.00) I went for five and a carne asada taco. This place is basically like a Roberto's, don tortaco, Faustos etc. good if you're looking for a quick bite.
