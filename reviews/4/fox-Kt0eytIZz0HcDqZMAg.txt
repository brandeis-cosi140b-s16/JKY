Our first time at this new restaurant on the old Cocomo Joe's location - nice changeup!  We went on a Friday night and there was quite a crowd at the bar, and the restaurant was packed already at 6:45.  Lots of families with kids, it looked like.  We were seated quickly and brought chips and salsa that were pretty standard.  Drinks arrived quickly and we were pleased to note later that our first round was Happy Hour prices, even though we weren't in the bar.  We ordered the lettuce wraps which were interesting, but just OK.  Basically the chicken burrito filling with lettuce.  For entrees we each got a burrito - skirt steak for me and pork for my hubs.  Initially they brought me the wrong burrito (chicken) but quickly corrected this.  Both were very good but the pork was a standout.  My husband did comment that he would have likeed a bit more seasoning/spiciness to the dishes.  Large portions with beans and rice, we took over half home with us.  So despite a few hiccups, I would definately go back.
