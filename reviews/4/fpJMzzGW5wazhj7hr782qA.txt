I would take this place over any other Mexican place on the strip (we had a gross experience at El Segundo 2 days prior). Really great tacos, service, and price to match. Love the spicy pork taco. We eat a lot of great Mexican Food in Atlanta and I would definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas.
