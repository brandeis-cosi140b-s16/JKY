Delicious Mexican food downtown. We went for their lunch specials and were not disappointed. Our waiter was well versed in the menu options and helped me out with what I deemed "the taco conundrum" - which basically meant that I wanted the taco/rice/bean lunch combo but with an extra taco. He managed to hook it up with a marginal price increase, a move that was greatly appreciated by both my stomach and my wallet. If you want some traditional Mexican food and you're in downtown Phoenix, this is the spot for you.
