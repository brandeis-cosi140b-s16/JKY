If Chipotle had a frequent flyer card, I'd be in trouble. And so would they. I come to this one so often that I could probably walk out of there with the correct order without even saying a word. This is a problem for many of my pairs of pants and sometimes my wallet, but when the service and food are consistent, well then popping a few buttons is just a risk I'm willing to take.

If you've been to Chipotle before, you know the drill. The employees aren't extraordinarily outstanding, but they've always provided decent customer service and can move a line of 40+ deep out of there pretty fast. Yes, the line can get long between 11am-1pm, so if you're looking for an in and out lunch experience during those hours, you likely won't get it. This isn't to the fault of the staff-everyone has a different order and some people are making up burritos that don't exist which can dig into the wait time. There's almost no seating during those hours, but they do have a patio which can be utilized during the four weeks of the year when it's safe to sit outside without getting sun poisoning.

The manager at this location is super nice and I've seen her quite frequently working the line, cleaning tables and running the register. That's generally a sign of good management and I think it sets a really great example for her staff.

Definitely one of the better options for lunch if you work in the area.
