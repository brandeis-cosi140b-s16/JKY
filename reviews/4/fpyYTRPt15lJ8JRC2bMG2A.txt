Mikeys II is owned and operated by a local family.  Their food is authentic, and made to order.  I like their tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and the rice and beans are top notch.  Red chile hot sauce is warm, but not real hot, and very tasty.  Pair up your meal with a bottled mexican Coke, and you have something special!
