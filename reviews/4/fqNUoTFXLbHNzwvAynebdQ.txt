I'll admit it - I was a bit concerned about grabbing lunch here.  The neighborhood is fine but the place is a bit rundown. But when you walk in the door the smell of fresh Mexican food draws you to the ordering window.

We had a Chicken burrito, a Carne Asada burrito and an Adobada (marinated pork) burrito.The Carne Asada and Adobada were terrific.  Just the right amount of everything.  The chicken burrito was a bit bland.  It was fine, but you might want to dump a lot of salsa on it to spice it up a bit.

The prices are more than reasonable.  Burritos go from $3.25 to $4.25.  Combinations are a few dollars more and the tacos are all under $3.

In case you miss the huge sign - it's cash only so come prepared.
