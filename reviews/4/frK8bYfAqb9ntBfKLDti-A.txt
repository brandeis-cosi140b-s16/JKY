I imagine there are a ton of great mexican food places in Phoenix.  I can't wait to find a better one than this - that's the ONLY reason I give it a 4 - so I can leave room for just in case I find something better (Note to YELP ... give me an option to do 4.7 or something like that... ok?)  Anyway - loved everything.  I hear what another reviewer said of the salsa - but my experience - it's like potato salad ... mom's is always (usually?) the best ... and everyone else is just not as good.  I loved it.  I loved it all.  My favorite haunt in Phoenix.
