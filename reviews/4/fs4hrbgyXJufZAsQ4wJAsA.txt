Aranda's continues to be one of my favorite places in the DeForest area. The service is always outstanding, and everyone who works there is very friendly.  Their employees always act like they want your business, and that they want you to come back.  

I highly recommend all of their lunch specials.  They're all good, filling, tasty, and a great deal.  They always bring warm chips to the table, and my one small complaint is that their salsa is thin and juicy, and a bit bland.  It would be great if they'd upgrade their salsa with more 'solids," or even replace it with something closer to a pico de gallo type salsa.  

I've enjoyed just about every meal there, with good, typical Mexican food at an extremely reasonable price...all backed by great service.
