Alright, so let's be honest..."looks can definitely be deceiving" and while I am also guilty of judging a book by it's cover, I must admit, sometimes we miss out on something great for being so shallow! lol! 

THE PLACE...had me on a wild rant over the weekend on the ridiculous wait time to get seated. Not only that, this place is SO small, you must wait outside in the "marvelous tolerable Vegas heat" until a table clears! So yes-I waited...figured, why leave if you're already there?...
 
THE SERVICE...was average. There's a $1 fee for using a credit/debit, which I thought was ridic but anyway...moved on from that. Service was fast servers and were attentive. 

THE FOOD: Not to brag about how UH-MAZING my Jalisco food is but their limited menu items-every single one of them, are straight up authentic and bomb!! Minus the Torta because i'm not into soggy sandwich but i hear that too is amazing! I've had everything on that menu and love it! worth the wait, worth the extra dollar debit charge and worth the perverted looks you get from all my mexican paisas while you eat. ;-) Must try the barbacoa!
