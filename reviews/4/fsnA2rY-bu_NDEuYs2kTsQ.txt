Ok, if you don't like the heat- stay the hell out of the kitchen!

Mexican food is supposed to be spicy and HOT!  This place definitely delivers the heat, I mean their chili's really pack a punch, they way it should be.  Yes, it is one of those hole in the wall places, so if you prefer a squeaky clean and modern establishment, go eat some bland wanna be Mexican food in Scottsdale and pay for the ambience.  The salsa's here are really good and flavorful.  Enchiladas, rice, and beans - YUM!  The Posole is right on the money, so delicious and full of flavor.

If you like it hot (the food) and you aren't going out to eat to be dazzled by the establishment then give it a shot, but go with the right expectations or just don't bother because it clearly isn't for everyone.
