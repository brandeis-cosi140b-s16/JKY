My sisters and I checked out Tijuana Flats for an early dinner last week. 

Overall good experience.

Orders are placed at the register and prepared in the back. I prefer Chipotle's and Qdoba's right-in-front-of-you prep but okay...

Two of us had the Throwback Thursdaze special for $5.99. The other ordered tostitos (but she thought she was ordering a quesadilla).

The TT special consisted of a Tijuana burrito, chips, and a drink.

The burritos are customizable. I had mine in a hemp tortilla. Delicious.

The table we sat at was a rectangle for four. There was enough room on the table top but I felt like I could use a bit more elbow room between me and Sister One.

I was afraid of the famed hot sauce bar. Wussy old me tried ONE very mild sauce. The more daring Sister One tried a few of of the sauces including a Very Hot one. Sister Two and I laughed like loons at Sister One as she wiped her runny eyes and nose.

The staff checked on us every so often, offering refills on drinks, removing our trash, and asking if there was anything we needed.

A nice evening out and not a lot of money spent.

I'll go back.
