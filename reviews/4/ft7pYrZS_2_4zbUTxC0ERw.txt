Monterrey's has nice and classy, Mexican themed, decor.  They are not ideal for going to watch a game as the televisions are too small.  They provide a nice patio which is optimal for nice weather.  Their service is "hit-and-miss" as some waiters are excellent while others are slow and rude.  They provide a very reasonably priced lunch menu that will nearly guarantee leftovers.  Their food is tasty and their margaritas follow-suit.  What keeps me coming back is their excellent salsa that is provided with their tortilla chips.
