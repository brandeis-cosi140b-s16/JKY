Let me start off with, I live in the Chicago area in a heavily Latin/Mexican populated area. I am used to true, authentic Mexican food. Coming down to Arizona for Spring Training my family and I were looking for some Mexican food. Of course we went to Yelp and we were not disappointed. We went on a Saturday night when the mariachi band was playing. It was fun, delicious, AND authentic. The salsa comes free with the meal, but it was a bit spicy so be sure to order some of the delicious guacamole to cool you off a bit. The chips were fresh and warm. When they brought those chips out I knew the rest of the food was going to be amazing. 
Also, some of the best salsa verde!!  When I come back down here in the future I will make it a point to come back to this restaurant.
