My whole family is from Denver and have yet to find a place with good smothered burritos until we found this place. This is New Mexico style food done right. We drove across town just to try it after being referred to it by another Denver friend. The inside of the restaurant is small but has the total Denver/NM feel to it. I ordered the small smothered fries and I wasn't even able to finish it. We will definitely be coming back. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the green chili could have been hotter! But the $3 margaritas make up for that!
