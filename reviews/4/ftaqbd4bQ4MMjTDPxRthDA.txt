So a while back when I was in Vegas me and my friend decided to try to find the food court at the Cosmopolitan cause we were hungry and had some time to kill before our flight.  We looked around on the second and floor and ended up walking into a restaurant that had Mexican food on one side and Chinese Dim Sim on the other.  So we thought hey, here's the food court! Let's go grab a seat. We get seated by a host and thought it was weird that a food court had a host..then we get handed a menu, only then did we realize that this place wasn't a food court, it was a full on restaurant!  At that point I think we both debated if we should leave, but in the end we decided to stay and give it a shot.

I have to admit once you sit down and look at the place and you see the Dim Sum station vs the Mexican grill, its very foolish that we couldn't figure out that this place was something different; and it sure was.

The Mexican-Chinese fusion food they have here is something I have never experienced in my whole life.  And that's actually pretty surprising considering I grew up in San Jose, CA where there is an abundance of Chinese Restaurants surrounded by Mexican Restaurants in the Eastern Part of the city.  Well we get cracking and I remember I had a few orders of dim sum and a few tacos.  I had no idea that gourmet dim sum and tacos could exist..let alone exist in the same restaurant!  The fusion food will keep you coming back for more, I know that from now every time I'll go to Vegas (which seemingly appears to be every 6 months) I'll be making a stop at this tasty little restaurant!

And you should too! Just make sure that you know that this place isn't a food court. haha.
