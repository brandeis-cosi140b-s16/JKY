I am usually a blackened tilapia and salsa verde shrimp taco girl w/black beans and a crap-ton (technical term) of salsa, but today's $1.50 Taco Tuesday called out to me in an I'm-too-lazy-to-cook-after-work moment. Plus, 2 tacos for $3?! Can't really beat that... though I'm adequately full after scarfing mine down, I stand by my regular choices. 

For your own sake, don't order the classic taco as take-out. Within 5 min, the wrapping makes any crispiness soggy. No bueno...but edible.
 
Verdict: Taco Tuesday rocks, but eat it in-house while super fresh. Otherwise, I still love my standards and they are great, even as take-out. If you are nice, they will give you a slightly larger container or two for the salsa (the spiciest and chipotle ones are my faves).
