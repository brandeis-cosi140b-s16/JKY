Vega's Cafe is a solid place for Mexican food in the Northwest!  We have been there a few times and enjoy it, although we have not had many entrees there, what we have had has been enjoyable!  Best way to describe this style of Mexican is probably to say the food is "like a good home cooked meal".   Sometimes I worry about certain places based on location and this is definitely one of them.  If you don't know the area well it can be hard to find.  I believe if they had a better location, closer to town, they would probably be more successful.  The northwest is slowly dying due to the foreclosure crisis sweeping through all of Vegas.  But i think its worth a try if you are in the area and craving some Mexican food!!!
