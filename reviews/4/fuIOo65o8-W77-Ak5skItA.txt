Great quick place to grab some fresh Haw-exican food. Many combinations for meat eaters and non. Usually do drive thru. They are fast and extremely friendly. Usually get the steak tacos or pork salad bowl w tomato onion salsa. Skip the rice, as you won't be needing it here!  Love they have cabbage as an option and the jalape√±os are fresh, not canned garbage. Rock on Braddah's!
