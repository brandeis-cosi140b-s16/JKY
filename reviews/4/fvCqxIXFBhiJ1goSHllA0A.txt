Excellent fish and carnitas street tacos.  The fish was fried nice and crispy with a tasty mayo based sauce.  The carnitas had terrific flavor.  Both were prepared Baja style with lots of tomato, onion and peppers.  Also tried the chicken taco and the chicken was pretty dry.  Not nearly as good as the fish or pork.  Nice clean place with excellent service, great music and pleasant decor.  I'll certainly be back and try some of the other offerings like their pastor and grilled steak.
