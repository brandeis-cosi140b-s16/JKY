My husband and i visited Los Reyes de la Torta after hearing so much about it. The hubs went with whatever sandwich was on Man vs Food, and he struggled to finish it, but did! I was pregnant and couldn't even finish my Torta. Hubs was bummed they don't serve alcohol, and it was a pretty tight and noisy place that night, but I'd definitely go back!
