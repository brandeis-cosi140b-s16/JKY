Every time I go to a restaurant and see three fish tacos for $20 or so, I just have to laugh.  The fish tacos at Federico's are a perfect symbol of why I moved back to the Valley--cheap, tasty, and available 24 hours a day!  For about five bucks, I can get two fish tacos overflowing with cabbage, flavorful sauce (you can taste the fresh cilantro), and soft tortillas.  Sure, the fish is fried, but who is looking for healthy at 3 in the morning?   No, Federico's is my little insomniac gem with great, inexpensive, satisfying food.  So delicious and so convenient!
