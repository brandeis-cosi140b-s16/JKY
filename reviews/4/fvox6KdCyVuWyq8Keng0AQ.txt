I had the great opportunity of meeting up for lunch here today around noon and was pleasantly satisfied! Last time I was in this space it had an Asian theme but they've redone it and it looks super. To eat we started off with two iced teas, an order of the guac, two veggie tacos, a veggie torta and I had the ensalada de la casa. Everything was fantastic; the veggie tacos are a steal at two dollars! I could have probably eaten 10-15 of them! The torta was delicious too and had the same marinated seasonal veggie mix between telera bread. My salad was light and refreshing, although it could have been a little larger. Props to all the friendly staff and to our competent server who went out of her way to make sure everything was to our liking. She inquired about our food preferences, told her we were vegetarian, and impressed us by actually understanding what ingredients are veggie friendly. Can't wait to try breakfast and drinks here in the future!
