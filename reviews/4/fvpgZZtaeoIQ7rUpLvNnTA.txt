Don't let the 4 versus 5 stars fool you, the food here is delicious, and everyone is warm and friendly, even to a very pale American girl who never had real Mexican food until she moved to Las Vegas

I judge Mexican food by the Carnitas, something I had for the first time about 4 years ago.  The carnitas here is delicious, but occasionally a bit too greasy.The carne asada has good flavor, also, and I enjoyed the pork tamale, huarache, and the rolled tacos.  The green salsa is absolutely too die for delicious.

I stop in once a week or more, and get treated like a welcome friend every time, and that keeps me coming back even more.  If you haven't tried it yet, stop in for lunch and try one of the lunch specials. You can even go through the drive-thru and take it with you!
