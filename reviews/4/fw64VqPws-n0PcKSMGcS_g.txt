Yummy Margaritas and a menu with refreshingly different choices all sensibly priced.! Salsas and warm bean dip were very good complimentary starters.  My a la carte items (beef flauta and marinated pork taco) were okay (wish I had gotten those bacon wrapped shrimp thingies mentioned in the reviews....).  Hubby loved his chile relleno.  We'll definitely go back when out Wickenburg way again. Thanks, Yelpers!
