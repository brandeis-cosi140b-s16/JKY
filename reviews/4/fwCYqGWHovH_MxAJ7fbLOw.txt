Went here again last night with my sister. You gotta love this place! so many unique dishes on the menu, and their service is the best. We met an awesome guy named Miller who was our waiter. We talked a little bit about where we were both from, he gave us plenty of time to look at the menu and was super nice. And he made sure we got everything we needed. A couple times the food runner brought the wrong stuff and Miller was quick to get it switched. I totally recommend this place to anyone who likes mexican or asian cuisine. Its an "experience" to be enjoyed.
