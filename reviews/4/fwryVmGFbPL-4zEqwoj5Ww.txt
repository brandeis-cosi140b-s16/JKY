A lifelong Las Vegas resident and friend brought me there. Honestly I would have never just pulled up and went in. Just looked like a local Local's place. Not on the main tourist drive.
OK, could not have been more wrong! In business since 1950 (yes I was alive). Same family, great tradition and even better, great homemade Mexican food. All I can say is when someone visits us, there are place we make sure we take them. Our list just grew by one! :- )
Good food, good service and you get to support a family that helped mold our great city by feeding the stars who's pictures are on the walls.
