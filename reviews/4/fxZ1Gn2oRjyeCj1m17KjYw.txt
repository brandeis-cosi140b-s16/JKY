Good carne Asada in El Mirage? I guess it is possible because Humberto's delivered in a good way during a recent visit in this outpost of a town. There was not one piece of grizzle or fat in the entire two tacos, which already is a good start. I do like my carne a bit thinner, but this version, despite needing some extra chewing, was still quite tasty. The tacos were loaded to the brim with meat and just a dusting of guacamole and a splash of pico. They gave you red and green sauce on the side, both of which were on the mild side. Only other small issue is that they need to double-wrap the tacos because we had a taco malfunction halfway through numero uno. Regardless, at $2.80 per taco, these puppies aren't worth a special trip here, but if your in the area, you will be happy with your order.
