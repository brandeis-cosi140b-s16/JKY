Whenever I'm a regular somewhere, I think consistency is super important.
 
I'm such an F-A, for ordering the deluxe chili cheddar fries with cilantro n jalape√±os, always and 9 times out 10 it's perfect. Fries are freshly fried and crispy, ingredients are fresh with the right amount, quick efficient service, very welcoming with great big smiles no matter what. That 1 out of 10, they must've used fries from 5 minutes ago. 

Needless to say, out off all the eateries that surround my work area, I keep coming back for the tasty eats and awesome service.

Go del papas! I mean, Del Taco.
