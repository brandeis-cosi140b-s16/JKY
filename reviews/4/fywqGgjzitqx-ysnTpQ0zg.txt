I have walked by this restaurant a few times, commented that we should try it, and yet never stopped in. The storefront is unremarkable, and while not uninviting there is very little to compel you to visit.

After some discussion, we decided to try based on our previous statements and the fact it is nearby and some Mexican food that is more "home cooked" would be welcome.

From the time we entered we were welcomed warmly, and I'm assuming the owner talked with us and helped us choose our dishes.

We ordered 6 dishes between 6 people (2 kids) and the food was delivered very quickly. While we waited, we had ample chips and salsa. The salsa was interesting, very atypical. It had a jellied quality to it that I really liked. It wasn't so spicy, one of our kids was happy eating it.

The rest of our lunch was fantastic. Very light flavors, the food itself wasn't so heavy which is unusual with a lot of Mexican dishes. I can see people being disappointed if they are expecting saturated flavors.

Great service, great food, not a 5-star establishment just because of location and ambience. It's hard to get excited when you're in a Target parking lot.
