Great $6.99 lunch specials & big lunch menu, 10am-3pm every day! I had the soft chile relleno which was very tasty! They also make a crispy one which sounded good as well. I usually prefer a verde type sauce but the enchilada sauce they put on it paired well. Rice is great! Beans are tasty & make an excellent dip. My mom had the enchilada & carnitas taco which were also good, though the crispy shell isn't homemade. My favorite part was the marinated cabbage they brought w/the chips & salsa. I'm going to try to make it at home. Chips & salsa were decent. Service was fantastic & the place was clean & welcoming. All & all, solid good food. I'll definitely come back for lunch.
