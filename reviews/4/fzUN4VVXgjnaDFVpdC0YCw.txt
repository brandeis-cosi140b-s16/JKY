There is nothing like walking into El Pollo Loco and actually seeing the chickens grilling in back.  The smell hits you as soon as you walk in the place.  I guess it makes me feel good to see "fast food" actually taking its time cooking.
I love the chicken bowls.  I always substitute the pinto beans for the BBQ black beans.  YUMMY!
And, if you so desire, you can order tortillas on the side and they give you a choice of corn or flour.  Both are really good!  Chewy, stretchy and don't fall apart when you use them to eat.
The restaurants are always clean and well-kept.  I've been to a few different locations.
