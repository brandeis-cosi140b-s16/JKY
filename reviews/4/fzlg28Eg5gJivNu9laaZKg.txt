Last night was my first visit to Bueno Burger.  I'm not a huge burger fan, but after this burger, I have converted.  Got the Bueno Burger with cheese, lettuce, pickles, onions and thier Bueno Sauce....yummy!.  

Next on the menu is the Sonoran Dog, I just hope it taste just like Guerros in Tucson, theirs is amazing.
