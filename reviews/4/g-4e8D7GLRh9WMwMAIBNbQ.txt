Margarita's by the pitcher, what more do you need!!  This is a great (divey) Mexican place that really hits the mark with food, flavor, price and service.  My friend ate here twice during our stay and dragged me along the second time.  She said the first time they had a mariachi band that played rock music and took requests, they were not there when I went, but that sounds cool.  

We had guacamole which was awesome and cheese/bean dip as well.  The portions were great for 4 to share.  The chips are thick which is nice for eating salsa and dips. They give you a green and a red salsa which I appreciated.   We were able to order enchiladas and tacos ala carte even though they are not listed  on the menu like that.  We appreciated this since we were not starving.  I had the traditional chicken enchilada with red sauce and it was soooo bueno!  Enjoy!
