So my boyfriend has been to Canyon Cafe in St. Louis which is owned by the people who own Sam's Cafe and we had been meaning to go for a while so he knew what to expect but I didn't.  The meal started out with the chips and salsa which were pretty amazing.  The salsa had more bite to it than normal salsa you'd get at Macayo's or Arriba's.  The chips were a wide variety that included everything from sweet potato to blue corn to a white corn with a sugar coating.  I got the carnitas platter and my boyfriend got the enchiladas and carnitas dish.  The carnitas were mouthwatering.  The combination of the meat with the guacamole and rice made the tacos to die for.  The cheese used in the enchiladas was rich and mouthwatering.  Different than just the typical cheddar cheese.  For dessert, I had the banana burrito which was okay.  I much prefer the banana tempura at Benihana.

Besides the fact that the food was so good, I give Sam's Cafe 4 stars because I lost a piece of jewelry while dining and the staff helped me find it :)

Definitely would return here.
