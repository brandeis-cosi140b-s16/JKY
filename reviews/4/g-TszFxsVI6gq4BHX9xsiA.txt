I've become a regular here since the food is made to order, good portions, and you leave full without the greasy feeling you get from many other places around town.  There's also various specials throughout the week and my favorite is Torta Thursday where you get a free drink and chips. 

So far I've had tortas, fish tacos, and breakfast burritos but must admit the fries look pretty amazing topped with meat and cheese.  What I really enjoy is choice of tortillas, grilled or fried fish tacos, and every step of preparing your order is asked for input from you.  I also love that when I'm taking a break here during the work week I can also grab a much needed Rockstar that they keep in stock in multiple flavors.
