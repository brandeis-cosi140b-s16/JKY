Garduno's is spicy. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know. I'm a white guy, what do I know about spicy food.  Well, I'll tell you a little secret.  I'm 1/8 Hispanic and 1/8 Native American.  That makes me an expert!

I always get the Carne Adobada Burrito when I go here.  Its that one dish that stops you from venturing deeper into the menu.  You know the one.  You go to a place and say "I'm gonna try something different this time" but when you arrive, you lose all sense of bearings and before you know it you are ordering the same dish again and again.
This burrito is one hot little firecracker, but don't underestimate it's punch.  It will seduce you, enter your mouth, and surprise you with a juicy slap.  Much like Big Mama's hand across your face after doing a load of dishes! Be warned!

The food is great.  They finish you off with the Sopapillas with honey and it makes you all sticky with pleasure.  They are like warm, soft, billowy clouds of fluffy dough melting in your mouth.

The service is meaty okra (Thanks Ron!) but it gets the job done despite its careless, and dilly-dally approach to serving.

The spiciness of the Carne Adobada is exponentially proportional to the number of times you reheat your leftovers.
