Following the model of Chipotle and Q'doba, Zaba's offer quick fresh Mexican food in large portions.  There is one difference that I think is key though, it's locally owned and operated.  I like knowing that, especially in Vegas where everything is big flashy and commercialized.

I've been to this location, and a few others around town many times.  The food is constantly fresh and affordable.  No matter if you get a bowl, burrito, salad or quesadilla you'll be happy with the result.  I understand it's not gourmet food, but for the price point, you're noting going to get more value and fresher food than from Zaba's.
