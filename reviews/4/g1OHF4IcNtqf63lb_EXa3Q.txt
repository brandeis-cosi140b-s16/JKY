We have been here on three occasions so far, and I really like the food. The quesa poblano (Quesadilla with poblano chili's and oaxaca cheeese) is awesome.  I have only had the carne asada and al pastor street tacos, with beans and rice, and have no complaints.  Perhaps my favorite thing is the salsa bar, I am really partial to the Seven Chili's and the Salsa Mexicana, but there are so many great choices.

My only complaint is that on 2 of the three occasions we have been there, they have been understaffed on the front end.  Food comes out quickly, but not always the best service.  We never had our water refilled, and it took three requests to get a beer brought to the table.  Can't blame the server, they have been busy, but management may want to reconsider how they staff. 

Overall, this is becoming on of my favorite go-to spots for tacos.  If the service improves, I would bump it up to 5 stars.
