A family friend talked about this place all the time, so my friend and I finally went when we were in the area. It was great! Even though most places do this, I love that free chips come with your meal!! It was almost overwhelming because they have a very large menu, but I just got a bean and cheese burrito and I thought it was great! I would definitely go back.
