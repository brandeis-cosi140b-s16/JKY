Two words. Taco Tuesdays. Big night for the carnivores. And even though I'm now a vegetarian, I can still appreciate the beauty (from afar) of a $1 shredded beef taco. And did I mention the $2 Tecates and Dos Equis and $4 house margaritas all night? If your regular happy hour spot is packed, I'd recommend visiting Cien Agaves. 

And apparently, each night is devoted to a different taco, with specials all week long. With an entire page of delicious taco options (including some yummy veggie-friendly options), this is your one-stop taco shop. 

The chips and salsa are also tasty and plentiful. They bring you both the chunky, mild red salsa, and a slightly spicier tomatillo version. And the chips are reminiscent of those served at Aunt Chiladas, fluffy and delicious!
