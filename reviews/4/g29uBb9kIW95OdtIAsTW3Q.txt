I relied on the Yelp reviews to find a good Mexican restaurant in a certain vicinity, and Rita's Mexican Food was the choice. Seeing they take reservations, I made one since it was a Saturday night, and we were planning on dining at 6:30.

I was surprised to see the place empty, except for a couple tables, and wondered if Yelp had let me down. Nope! It started with the friendly wait staff. She was very nice and checked with us often, but not too often, to make sure we were ok. The Sangria and strawberry margarita were very good. My Parrillada Del Rancho dinner included a thin slice of steak, chicken, and pork chop. All 3 meats were a slightly overdone, maybe from the grill or the "cooker" it was presented on at the table. But tasty, none the less. The other 3 meals were said to be very good, too. Oh, and the guacamole was freshly made at the table, and also very good.

4 dinners, 2 alcohol drinks, guacamole appetizer, and a a fried ice cream came to $132.
