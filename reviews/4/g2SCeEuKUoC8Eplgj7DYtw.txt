This place is so easy to overlook on Sunset that I have driven by it probably 100 times before I realized what it was. I am now sad after having tried it that I didn't go in sooner. The food here is spectacular! My only complaint with the entire place was that the salsa bar was kind of lacking. I was excited to see that they did have a salsa bar to begin with, but after trying several of them with a variety of spices, I was disappointed...they all seemed to have the same basic taste...of canned tomato sauce...very odd and very disappointing. The food I ordered however was delicious. I ordered a torta and the meat was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. The price overall wasn't bad either. I will be back soon to try other things on their menu.
