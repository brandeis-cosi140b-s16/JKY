I really do adore this place. I go there at least 3 times every time I visit Arizona. The food is inexpensive and very authentic. I believe all the chefs are women and they're cooking is delicate and precise. The decor isn't great and it's a little dark but it's still my go to place for breakfast burritos and taco Tuesday's - Highly recommend.
