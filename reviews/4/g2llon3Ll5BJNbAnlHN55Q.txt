We were on the hunt for authentic Mexican Food for a visiting relative and we found it!  I googled "hole in the wall Mexican restaurant" but despite the rough neighborhood, Los Reyes is very nice inside.  It is clean and cozy and although I'm a "clean freak" I wasn't scared to eat here at all!  

We had lengua tacos, cabeza tacos, and pollo tacos - everyone thought they were delicous (especially the corn tortillas)!  We also tried the shrimp ceviche tostada appetizers for .99 which was a great value and very tasty.  My daughter had the strawberry iced drink and the cheese quesadilla and she loved them both.  Usually quesadillas are greasy or dry and this wasn't either, it was really good.

We can't wait to come back here and try some tortas, the chicken salad - which looked delicious, and we'll try to save room for some of the amazing looking fruit salad.

Oh yeah and the taco prices were outstanding -- $6 for a big plate of 3 tacos and a "salad" which was lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, grilled onion and jalapeno.

What a gem...
