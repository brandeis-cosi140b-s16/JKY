I went to this restaurant on a business dinner.  First the atmosphere and decor is spot on.

I am not typically a fan of guacamole, but WOW!!  Reminded me of the old steak restaurants that would fix a Caesar salad at your table.  The server came to the table, asked how hot we wanted our guacamole and fixed up a fresh serving.  It was fantastic.

The rest of the food was quite good.  Two of us had the duck confit and two the flat iron steak.  I would have the duck again when I go back.

The only reason I didn't mark 5 stars is that our server wasn't that great.  Forgot for about 10 minutes to bring some drinks to the table, etc.
