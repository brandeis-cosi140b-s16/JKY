The place was clean
The service was nice
The food was ... well it is Taco Bell. 

We had a few things for a quick lunch. I tried the beef enchirito and a beef griller. I loved the griller thing. Kid #1 had a combo burrito and #2 had a nachos with meat and cheese only. 

While the meal was fine the price was just right! That is why they are still around. CHEAP and QUICK.
