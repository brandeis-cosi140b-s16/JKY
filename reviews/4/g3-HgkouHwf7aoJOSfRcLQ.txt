This is a mixed review, but by the actions of the owner of the franchise, he turned a negative situation to a positive one. This review has nothing to do with the food. It's great..fresh, flavorful, salsa is perfect...I was in the mood for their lobster tacos. Was told by the order taker no lobster..2nd choice Mexicano Burrito w/ Monterrey jack and no sour cheese really simple order. Owner comes out says he's out jack cheese, needs to go to the store and will be right back. In the insuring time, they proceed to make up my orders. I asked if they had made my orders, she says yes. Says they will add the cheese later. Thirty minutes later owner comes back. Delivers the cheese to the kitchen to complete my order. Then walks up to me refunds me my $20.00 for the orders, says this order and my next one is on him.. Gives me my order, noticed the order has sour cream on it (the one I said no sc)...Apologizes, makes a replacement order. Walking out I get a call that I need another order. I order it..he doesn't charge me, unbelievable!! This guys knows customer service. This restaurant recently reopened after being closed for some time. I know this escapade cost him some $$$$$$. I'm definitely coming back!!!
