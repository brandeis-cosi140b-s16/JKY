When I saw a Cafe Rio was opening in my neighborhood, I'm not ashamed to admit I filled with Christmas-level glee. I like the place a lot. And now it was finally nearby!

Since then I've come to this location for lunch 1-3 times per week and find the staff to be genuinely friendly and helpful. The food is always very good and they make it as quickly as all the other locations I've visited (translation.. not super quick). After all, they are making customized dishes on a per person basis. 

Some other reviews here complain of missing food items. That has not been my experience. One time I had to wait a few minutes for a new batch of red sauce to be ready, but when it came up it was the best I've ever tasted. 

I agree they seem a bit understaffed, but with a little patience and kindness I've found it to be a wonderful place to eat. The food is very tasty and reasonably priced. 

The only other choices for decent Mexican are Wahoo's (meh) or the 20 minute drive to another Cafe Rio to wait in a line that 'might' move faster but will certainly take way more time overall.  

I'm voting with my dollars to keep this neighborhood Cafe Rio going strong.
