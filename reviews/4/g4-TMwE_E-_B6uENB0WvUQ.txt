OK, no joke- the Doritos Locos Taco Supreme is amazing!  I thought it would be gross, but after trying it- pure genius!

This Taco Bell is my go-to if i need my T-Bell fix.  I've never been inside, only through the drive-thru.  The people are always nice and fast.  Order is always correct.

I hope they keep the Doritos Locos Taco forever, and I'm not kidding!  If you haven't tried it- go now.  A Dorito as your taco shell?  Nice!

Everything always tastes good, as good can be from Taco Bell...haha!
