From the outside it looked to be an above average size whole-in-the-wall place. I had a good feeling about it just based upon that!

I have only eaten here once, a few weeks ago when I was in town. The bro-in-law took me here, raving about the street style tacos. He wasn't kidding. I ordered two carne asada (steak), two carnitas (pork) and two lengua (tongue). All three were EXCELLANTE! None of the meats were dry and all were very tasty! Their salsa bar, with marinated carrots, were good to go! The Horchata (rice drink) was one of the better ones I have experienced. Oh yeah, they throw down some refried beans and chips on your plate too. Enjoyed them also.

You know you've walked into an old school, authentic tasting, restaurant when 3/4 of the customers are our Border Brothers & Sisters! With a ratio of the other 1/4 being us Gringos you know it's good food and service. If it was in a white bread neighborhood the percentages would probably be flipped.

No, I did not get the shits afterwards LMAO.......... I'll be swinging by on our next trip to Lost Wages!
