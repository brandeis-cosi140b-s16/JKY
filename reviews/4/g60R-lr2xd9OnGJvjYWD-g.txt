So I wrote a review of this restaurant the other day that was not favorable after I saw a 4 star rating.  Let me say that when my family and I ate there several months ago the dinner was horrible to say the least.   I was contacted by an owner as well as their social media manager.  They both asked me to come in for another try as when I ate there they had issues in the kitchen which were later ironed out.   

Since I wanted to rate this place again I went in as if I had never eaten there before and told the waitress it was our first time.   I asked what shouldn't be missed when ordering.  She mentioned the fish tacos and the mushroom enchiladas.  We ordered both along with the bean and tortilla soup as well as the carne asada tacos for my son.  We all loved the food.  It was 1000 times better than our experience 4 months ago.  Whatever changes they made were for the better.   

The meal was top notch until the desert.  We ordered the tres leches which should have been called UNO leches due to the fact it was more dry than wet.  Bottom line it was horrible.  Everything else including the service was fantastic.   We will definitely return but not order desert.
