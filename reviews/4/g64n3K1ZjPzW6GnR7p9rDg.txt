Great place to bring the kids for lunch, especially if you have two or three.  Just make sure they put you in a booth.  The salsa and chips are very good and I like the taco salad with Italian dressing.  I had a couple taco's the other day with machaca meat and that was pretty good.

Service is always friendly, and the little ones if we are in a booth can move around a little and not bother anyone.  Just make sure you are not on the bar side of the resturant if you have kids, the booths are not as private.

The real secret to this lunch?  There is a McDonalds in the same shopping center with a play area.

If the kids are good I take them for a treat(Ice cream or some cookies, milkshake for me) and time in the McDonald's play area after Serrano's. 
This usually tips the balance for a very enjoyable lunch with kids at Serrano's.
