Great family atmosphere and the food is good, too! From the chips and salsa to tasty fajitas, delicious crispy tacos to just plain old rice and beans-everything was fresh and hot when it got to the table. We went on a busy Friday night and were seated in 15 minutes, served another 10 minutes later. That is great service for packed house. A bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth it! Definitely take a large group here-the prices are great, too!
