The food was good I had a joey jr , it could of been a little warmer .but it tasted good , the staff was friendly . They might of been short staff because I had to wait a few minutes for someone to fill my joey  . But they apologize for the wait which was nice and the cashier was nice as well. I also thought it was a good deal for a joey , chips and a drink for 6 .50 .Also the free Salas is good . When I go back I will ask them to warm my joey up .lol
