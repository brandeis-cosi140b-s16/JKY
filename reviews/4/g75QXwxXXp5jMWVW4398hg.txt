I love the Chinos for lunch.
 I Love it even more for dinner (you see the distinction? I used a capitol "L"). There are always wonderful Mexican-Chinese fusion plates, but there are actually available tables to sit at for dinner. To some, this combination may sounds like heaven and to others, a gut-bomb, but no matter.....You must go and try it. It is impossible not to fall in love! I am not sure where "jerk" spices originated, but the food is infused with those tasty flavors as well. 

If you have never been to the Chinos before, don't fret. There are samples available of just about everything on the menu. Also, you may want to have the staff walk you through how to order on your first visit, as the process can be a bit confusing. Each meal is topped off with a cookie, usually snicker doodle, but if you are really lucky, you may be blessed with a chocolate lava. Best wishes and go hungry!
