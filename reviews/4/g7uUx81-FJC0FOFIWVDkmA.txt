Shuttling between old apartment and my new place here in Sunrise, we had to have breakfast takeaway, and I was pleased.  Delicious. The breakfast burrito was all the fuel I needed for a day of packing and moving. Now that we are solid residents and I have tried other Mexican eateries in the area, I must say, the quality of the cooked meats is levels above the other guys. The carne asada burrito my husband had was made well and I was happy to see that the carnitas in mine was still recognizable as pork. I abhor meat cooked or charred to a tasteless jerky.  I also love that the condiment bar was kept well. The pickled onions are AMAZING and carrots are a necessary accompaniment.
