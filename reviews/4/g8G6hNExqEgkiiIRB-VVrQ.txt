Good times Dos.   I can always rely on Dos to be open and serving food until 2 am.  Even in the rain.   Nothing is better than a bucket of beers and a 6 pack of street tacos.  

The food is always good at anytime but the service might be a little slow.  Finding a table that isn't sticky is a trick but I can bring my friends and our dogs so it's definitely worth it.   You just have to belly up to the bar for the best service.  

Come to Dos to eat and drink and watch the UFC sometime.  It's worth checking out.
