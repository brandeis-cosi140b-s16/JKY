This place is ghetto! But it's the only cheap and sort of healthy place near my work so I can't complain. The prices are a little bit more, probably 25cents more them you would usually pay. Not bad for being on the strip!
I love the chicken bowl which has rice, beans ( I usually get it without beans because I hate beans), your choice of salsa, sour cream and lots of lettuce. I also love their chicken salad with the sauce they give you makes it just right.
They do offer other meat besides chicken like steak, carnitas, Barbacoa. No worries if your vegetarian they have the veggie burrito or bowl.
