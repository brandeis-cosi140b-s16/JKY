Tried Joyride for the first time on Tuesday. I loved it. Their salsa was amazing and they have a really good selection of draught beer. I had the Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye. 

What made me especially happy were the really nice options for vegetarians. This can sometimes be difficult at Mexican restaurants. I asked our server (we sat at the bar) about suggestions, and she said that anything with their signature veggie mix was good. I chose the enchiladas, which also had goat cheese, and they were AWESOME. 

The veggie mix was delicious and not boring, the creaminess of the goat cheese, and just the right amount of heat (I selected red sauce) made a killer and satisfying combination. At $9.00 the portions were more than generous, but my companion and I worked together to finish them up. 

This will definitely be my new go-to spot for Mexican in this neighborhood. Again, they only lose one star for the parking situation. I'm never keen on forced valet, because I rarely have cash to tip.
