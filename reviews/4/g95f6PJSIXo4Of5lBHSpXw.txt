I was in PHX on business and searched for Mexican restaurants near my hotel. El Molino popped up and we decided to give it a try. Don't let the demure appearance scare you off. The restaurant is tucked into a strip center space, and we initially were put off. But we ordered from a large menu with multiple choices and waited with our beers. In a few minutes, our food was ready and was it good! The burrito with shredded beef and green chile sauce was fantastic, as were the sides. I will return!
