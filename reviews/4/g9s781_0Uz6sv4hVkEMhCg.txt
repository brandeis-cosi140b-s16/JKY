Thinking about attacking that taco craving? Look no further. I like mixing and matching from their 12 different selections. If you've dined at Fox Restaurant Concept establishments in the past, you know the Slow Cooked Bar-B-Q is a winner winner, shredded pork dinner. Go with a the charro beans (light, spiced, pinto beans).

The other day I tried the chicken mole and vegetable arroz. It was flat-out superb. The braised shredded chicken is served in a bowl mixed up with the rice and mole sauce with corn or flower tortillas on the side. If you happen to bring home leftovers, you'll be thanking yourself later. Speaking of which, ensure you have leftovers by starting with the guacamole and crispy salted chips. The guac has a faint kick to it, so be ready. 

In the mood for enchiladas? You're going to get a cheesy delicious pie. The enchiladas are served up in a cast iron skillet, queso to the brim!

The decorum is trendy and cool. I really enjoy going here, though it can get pretty busy towards the evening. As with any FRC restaurant, you're going for the great tastes and ambiance, but not the price.
