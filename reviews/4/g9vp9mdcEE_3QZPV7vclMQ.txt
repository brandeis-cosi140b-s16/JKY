$0.99 tacos - generously sized and very tasty.  The fact that you can sit down at this price is amazing - who cares about the lack of decor.  To top, service was very friendly.   

We went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed.  Lamb's the weekend special so we order the lamb soup and the grilled lamb taco.  The shredded lamb in the taco tasted more boiled than grilled - we surmised that this was the reason for the tasty lamby soup.  

We ordered a few tacos and liked the al pastor the best.  The dry-rubed spices had completely infused into the meat which combined with the smokiness of the charcoal grill made it one of the best al pastor we'd had.

Also liked the horchata - most places make it too sweet - this one was just right allowing other flavors to come through.
