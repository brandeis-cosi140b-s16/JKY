My son got the Pechuga ala Plancha which was amazing.  My daughter had a quesadilla which she really liked. The meat in my tacos was tasty but very dry, making them a little tough to eat. My margarita and side order of guacamole was also good.

I've been in Madison over twelve years and never knew this place was rucked back here. I will be back.
