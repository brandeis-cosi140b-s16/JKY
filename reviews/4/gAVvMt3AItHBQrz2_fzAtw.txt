"How have I lived without their green sauce all my life?"

This place is just around the corner so we stop in every now and again. Rudy - the owner is super friendly as are the rest of his staff, his family. 

My favorite is a bean and cheese burrito that I dump their green sauce into. BUT their tacos and tamales are delicious too. I haven't really had anything I didn't like. 

If you're in the area stop in and try it!
