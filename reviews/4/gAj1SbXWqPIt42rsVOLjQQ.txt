Just about as good as it gets, but their prices are getting a little steep.  $2.79 for fish taco $2.99 fish especial I can understand but $1.99 for those teeny weeny street tacos so delicious to my taste buds?  We calculated and it's $.66 per bite 'cuz you only get 3 per taco.  Good thing they frequently have coupons for their email beach club and always a free meal for your birthday, what a GREAT bonus, I love that!  (PS) make the lobster burrito a permanent fixture, will ya?  And get a stupid kids meal toy for my bratty kid, she's tired of just crayons...  Just kidding...  :)
