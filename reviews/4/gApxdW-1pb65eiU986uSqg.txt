Lunch at Two Hippies today.
This is a 4 star with comments.

1)  5 stars for small business, new ventures, private companies.
It isn't easy, been there and done it.

2) 4 Stars for location.  Perfect location, very fun.
No bathroom?  Not even a place to wash the salsa off your hands?
If it is there I didn't find it.

3) 4 stars for food:  Great Green chile beef burrito.
But it was a "busy" like I could get at a chain store.
Why do we have to have rice and beens in everything?
Carbs yuk.  

2)  1 star  for No Ice Tea.  No Ice Tea?

Will go back this week for sure.
