The food is very good (at least the Albondigas, which is what I ate). Complimentary chips (warm) are offered and they have a nice selection of salsas.  The margarita's are also excellent as is the sangria. It's not fine dining - it's a nice casual place for an informal meal. There is also a separate bar with some TVs. 

The only downside that I observed is the service can be spotty. It's friendly but they do not seem to have a dedicated hostess at the front so you can wait a while to be seated. And if they are busy, the service is very, very slow.  Note to management - hire more staff and more customers will return.  Also, the web site says they accept reservations. They do not.  I would return but not if it was crowded.
