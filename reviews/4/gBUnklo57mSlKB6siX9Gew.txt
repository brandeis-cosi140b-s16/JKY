I drive through Wickenburg for work every once in a while, and I've stopped in to El Ranchero twice now for lunch. The food and service were top notch both times. We were seated, brought chips/salsa, and drinks quickly. They have two different salsas and a bean dip. My preference was the spicy salsa which had a nice sweet flavor and a good level of heat. I recommend the enchilada tricolor combo plate. It comes with three enchiladas - chicken, beef, cheese.  The chicken and cheese are topped with a mild green sauce, and the beef has a red sauce.  The beans and rice are great too. Our server handled our large group very efficiently and with a smile on her face. My only complaint is that the restaurant could use a refresh. There were some wobbly chairs and the bathroom is sub par.   If you happen to be passing through Wickenburg, you won't be disappointed at El Ranchero. Check it out!
