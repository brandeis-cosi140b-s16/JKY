I quite enjoyed this little place. Personally, I quite enjoy Mill. And I live within walking distance so I'm there a lot. (No, I'm not an ASU student.) But that's besides the point. I thought the food here was fresh and quite delicious and prices were nice. I like fish and always have to try fish tacos and this one did not disappoint. It was grilled and seasoned and had a hint of lime, not deep fried and artery clogging like other fish tacos. I had a side of black beans as well. At some places the black beans are too damn salty. Here they were not salty, but seasoned with chili pepper (or something spicy like that) and had bits of onions in it. 
I hung out inside, watched some Spanish TV, and enjoyed lunch.
