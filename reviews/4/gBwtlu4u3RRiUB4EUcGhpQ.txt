Have gone here on a few occasions now because of Yelpers and have not been disappointed at all. LOVE the Fries w/Carnitas, they are the bomb!! Their burritos are very good, my niece who is finicky loves them and their tortas are yummy. Just wish the salsas were spicier cause they are very mild to me, even the Habanero that you have to ask for at the register is mild but oh well, still delicious.
