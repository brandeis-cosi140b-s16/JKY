I just realized I did not review this place when I visited back in June of 2012.  See, I had my first  official date here way back then with my now  fianc√©. For kicks and giggles, we decided to go back to where it all began. We even sat in the same booth and order the same meal ( me being fish tacos and him being the baja burrito) . We ate so many chips and salsa that I was surprised that we actually at our meal but the food was as good as I remember. The waitress, Brandi was awesome but I must say that the company I was with was fabulous and it was so much fun reminiscing about our first date. Tons of fun revisiting and I know we will be back again soon.
