Best chips n salsa. I wanna take the whole bottle to myself. When I have parties  at home I order the Fiesta platters. Everything here is good. Only reason I gave 4 stars n not 5 is cause one time I went in n they ran out of Pollo fundido. Gave me a regular chicken burrito. I was looking forward to fundido. Anything fried is better right? Fast service..clean restaurant
