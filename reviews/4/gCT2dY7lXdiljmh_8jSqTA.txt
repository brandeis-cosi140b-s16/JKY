I was really surprised by this place!  Soooo much better than that other "bertos" place!  I went thru the drive thru so I'm not sure about the inside but I ordered the taco and cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans. I also ordered a side of chips. The food was very good and the rice was REALLY good!  The chips were hot!!  Loved it!  Yum!  I will be back when I'm in the area again.
