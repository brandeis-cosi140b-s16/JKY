Rosa said she makes everything from scratch.

My husband loved his tacos!  He said he will be back, and he can't wait to try her burritios!

I got the rolled taco's and they reminded me of my childhood. It tasted like the shells were made from scratch.  The meat was a little to chunky, but other than that I really enjoyed the tacos.  The rice was pretty good too.  I'm sure I will be back.
