When I was in college there used to be a La Tolteca right across from ASU. We went there all the time and got the burritos "as big as your head" or at least that's what we called them. They were so good.

Eventually that place closed and I made my way down to this location.  This place is a lot of fun. Good Mexican food, a in house bakery, a small store and butcher shop.

This place is real and it a phoenix landmark, check it out.
