I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of authentic Mexican cuisine. El toro loco and Emeliano's are my go to in the Southside. Me and my buddy went for happy hour where they have some decent drink specials and solid food specials. We both ordered the three amigos chips/ salsa and queso. The three amigos is 3 tacos 3 different kinds of meat, your choice of corn of flour tort and two kinds of toppings. Wow, they were phenomenal. Our bills came to $6.02 after splitting the bill. I would of gave 5 starts but they charge for chips and salsa.
