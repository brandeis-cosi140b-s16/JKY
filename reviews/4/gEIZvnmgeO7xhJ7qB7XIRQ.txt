We stopped in a month or so after the remodel that was recently completed. First off, they did a great job with the interior. Nothing off the charts design wise, but everything was new looking, and clean. That always helps.  
Started off by ordering drinks. We had a regular margarita and a mango margarita. Both were tasty..nothing totally over the top. 
We ordered the guacamole to pair with the chips & salsa. The guac was really good, something that I can't say I was expecting after eating their bland chips. Personally, I think they need to kick it up a notch with their chips and salsa. They are just sub-par. We walked in expecting knock your socks off chips and salsa because they are called FIESTA CHIPS & SALSA. Their chips and salsa is equlivent to maybe...fresh grocery store quality. 
However, our entrees were great! I got the shrimp and cheese enchillada with green sauce. My boyfriend selected the carne asada. Both came with the usual rice and beans. The portions were more than enough. We definately felt satisfied after our entrees. 
Someone else had made the point that this is not "authentic" Mexican, and they were definately correct. The good is good, though, and you won't leave disappointed. 


The prices are pretty on par for the quality of the food.
