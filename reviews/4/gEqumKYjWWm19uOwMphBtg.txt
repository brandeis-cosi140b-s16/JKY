We stopped here for lunch the other day, in the mood for something a little spicy (and cheap). I ordered the grilled steak tacos and boyfriend got the carnitas. I don't normally love pork, but we each traded one of our tacos and both kinds were delicious :] The salsa bar IS a little limited, but there were two that I loveddd so I didn't really need more options. Our total bill for chips and salsa (refills included), 4 tacos with rice and beans was $15.00...sold!!! Food was great, we will definitely be coming back!
