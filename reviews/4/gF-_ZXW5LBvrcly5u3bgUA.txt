This is my #1 favorite local alternative to standard fast-food joints! The price is right, and the food is as good as a lot of pricier alternatives. No, it's NOT high-end gourmet-Mexican food. However, the shredded beef tacos, rice & re-fried beans are just as good as at Ajo Al's. 

I tend to stay away from the chicken enchiladas, though... had a couple of bad experiences with them!

I especially like that I can get some reasonable, decent food late at night!
