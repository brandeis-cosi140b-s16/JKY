Sometimes Roberto's gets a bad reputation for being a dirty restaurant.  And perhaps some locations are.  But do not let that scare you.  This location on the east side of the valley is always clean as are many others across the Vegas Valley.  It is always open and it is always good. I love coming here.  Almost religiously I have to get the three rolled tacos with guacamole and maybe a taco or two.  Or if visiting on Wednesday, a handful of $0.99 chicken tacos.  And don't forget the pickled jalapenos and carrots with some radish and cucmber on the side.  The food is good.  It is fresh made.  They are fast.  The menu is not short of anything.   They even have this one creation called asada fries.  Think nachos with carne asada and all the other fixings on french fries instead of chips.  Awesome.  They are worth trying at least once and is almost guaranteed to fill you without a second thought.  I'm getting hungry as I write this.  And now that I think about it, today is Wednesday.  I think a taco run is in order tonight.
