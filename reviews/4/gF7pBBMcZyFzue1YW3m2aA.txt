Have been coming here for years and it is consistently good food. It is older and quirky but the food and service are always good. I like sitting in the booths next to the windows with the view of the lake and in the fall/spring the patio is very nice. The bar is upstairs and has some good happy hour deals. My favorite is the chimi with the baja sauce, it is a spicy white cream cheese type sauce they add to the regular sauce and gives it that extra kick! They do sell margarita glasses that offere discounted refils as well.
