Full disclosure, I'm a Mexican food Breakfast type guy. I love huevos rancheros, chiliques, and anything else in that pantheon. This is basically the best breakfast spot in Queen Creek as far as I'm concerned. It's not a huge corporate conglomerate chain place either so that's a huge plus. At lunch the Sonoran Dogs are awesome too. Actually everything on the menu really kicks ass. The service is commensurate with how busy it is. It's a small place. The food is great.
