A colleague at work recommended KoMex for lunch and off we went.  A deliciously awesome fusion of Mexican and Korean fare, and it's kind of hiding in plain sigh in a storefront.  Everything our party ordered looked and tasted delicious, and there wasn't a complaint from anyone at the table.  Be sure to ask for chips and guacamole.  It's complementary and tasty, but don't eat too many because the portions for the meals are enough to fill you up.  I cleaned my plate but probably couldn't have eaten more without being too full.  Overall a wonderful experience.  I'll definitely return to try just about everything else on the menu over time.  Definitely give it a try!
