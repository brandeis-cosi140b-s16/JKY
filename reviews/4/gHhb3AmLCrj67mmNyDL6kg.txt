I went to San Felipe's at Desert Ridge for a happy hour on Friday night.  I had never been to this location, though a former version of myself may have been seen at San Felipe's Flagstaff in the club (and maybe even on the bar...).  I believe they took over the location where Fat Tuesday used to be.  

I was quite impressed with their happy hour and their ability to accomodate a large group (10+).  The service was pretty good and the specials were very nice.  $2 per beer in the buckets that we were getting.  And while I didn't get any appetizers, they were half off, and the cheese crisp that someone else ordered looked pretty good.  I also liked that the happy hour ran from 4-7p.  Haven't been to Yard House for a happy hour for awhile, and it seemed like theirs ended at 6p.  

Four stars for the good service, cold/cheap beers and good hours for happy hour.  Next time I plan a happy hour, San Felipe's will be on my list.
