Best taco shop in south Chandler.  Best carnitas for may, many miles.  Top notch service, friendly staff that will bring your order to your table and accomodate any special request.  When you see the prices you may be a little taken back.  It is not cheap, however I can't finish  two carnitas tacos. The portions are huge!  Good beans and rice and they have one of my favorite toppings for rolled tacos, cotija cheese.  The chilliquiles plate is masterful.
