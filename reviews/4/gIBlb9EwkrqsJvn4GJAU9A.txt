Summation of two visits within 1 week...
First visit was during lunch rush.
Second was late lunch post-rush.

Nice comfortable interior.
Good to excellent service.
Good food.

Was left wanting for drink refills the first visit during lunch rush. Second visit I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant with the service we received.


I had the Chili Relleno both times. 
First time I ordered it it had a bunch of grilled or sauteed onions on top. Didn't care for the onions. Second time I ordered it smothered in Green Chili. It was a little better but the green chili had little pieces of overcooked pork (I think) in it. Threw the taste off for me. So I avoided those little chunks.

Good quality cheese.

My coworkers loved the Steak Picata.
I'll return when in the area.
