it's a pick-up taco stand inside a bar-about 10 person seating-with nice murals & bar decor. kinda of skanky dirty dive
suprise! suprise! very spicy & super tender meat almost like pot roast. mex mix(pico) was spicy!! hamburger was like you bbq it yourself-yummy. mushrooms a little overdone & greasy. chimichanga & bean tostadas were delicous!!
real good food for a bar. especially if your inebriated!! Did I forget to mentio they deliver 24/7!!!
i wish they would get rid of the styrofoam container all ready-it just kills food!!
