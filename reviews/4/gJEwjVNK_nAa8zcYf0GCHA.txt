I love this branch of Monterrey. I've been three times, and I've had fun every time. It's a place we like to go on dates, as it's cheap and you get a lot of food, and the decor is kind of nice. Two of the times we've been, we sat outside and enjoyed the breeze while we sipped margaritas. 

There's about a billion vegetarian options, which always works for me. I see Kelly C. didn't like her chile relieno, but I've always liked mine. I have a friend who lived in Texas for a while, so now she is kind of ruined for NC Mexican food...I've not gotten my taste buds retrained, however, so I am still a fan.

The patio is gorgeous, the staff is friendly and quick, and the food is good. I would recommend it to anyone, especially for dating!

It's easy to miss as you're coming down Harris, so make sure you get the directions straight if you don't know where you're going.
