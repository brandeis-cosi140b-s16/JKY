Came here around brunch time and ordered the breakfast burrito with shredded chicken. It was flavorful and authentic! Also ordered a couple margaritas and a couple Micheladas (Michelob and Clamato juice) during the meal which complemeted the Mexican flavors nicely! I will be going back on my next visit to Phoenix!
