Family owned and operated, this place is solid.  The thing that sets this place apart from all the rest is how well they treat their customers, like family.  I've been there no less than 30 times and they have never "had an off day" when it comes to treating customers right.  

I have had their burritos, tostadas, tamales and taquitos.  I like the carne asada taquitos the best.  There are always fresh salsas in the salsa stand.  They often offer tortilla chips if you're waiting a little longer for your order.  Plenty of drinks to choose from, all the way from Coke in a bottle to a nice selection of cervezas.  

Tacos n More is a Maricopa gem.
