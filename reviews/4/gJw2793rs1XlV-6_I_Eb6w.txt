Service is decent, dining area is confined, portions are small, but the friendliness of the small staff is second to none and the food is tasty. If you want to stuff yourself then get a burrito, they're good sized burros but seem to be heavy on rice and light on actual meat. The taquitos (street tacos) are some of the smallest I've seen, but again, tasty. The empanadas have phenomenal flavor, just very tiny. For $2/empanada I expect more, especially when it cost less than fifteen cents to make one! Recommendations: Burritos, Breakfast Empanadas, Ham and Cheese Empanadas, and the Ground Beef Empanadas. The ingredients are fresh, and it's healthy Mex as opposed to the numerous greasy, overly cheesy Mex restaurants out there so that's a bonus. The chef is caring, engaged, and wants you to enjoy the food. All in all, we enjoyed ourselves and the meal and we'll likely return.
