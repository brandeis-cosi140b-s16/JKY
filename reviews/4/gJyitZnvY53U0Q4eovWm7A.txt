I must say that I have lived close to this Taco Bell for two years now and do not have one complaint of the service or food received when visiting this location. The employees at he driver thru are always very polite and accommodating. It is nice to go to a fast food restaurant that is consistent with its customer service. I definitely recommend that this Taco Bell is  up to par!
