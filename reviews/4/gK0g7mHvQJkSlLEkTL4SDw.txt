Ricardo's is just up the street from my work, and since my boss loves Mexican food it's another spot we end up going to a lot for our Friday office lunches. 

I always get the $9.99 lunch buffet. When there is a buffet that offers a full taco bar (chicken, carne asada and ground beef), enchiladas, tamales, rice, beans and more... why limit yourself by choosing off the menu?? 

We usually sit in the bar area, the service there is always on point. And the booths in the bar areas have their own televisions, great for my sport-obsessed coworkers.
