I love this place because it's not run by teenage kids who don't care about customers, but rather by the same 2 or 3 adults whom I see there all the time. 

When I order my food I don't have some vapid 16 year old girl asking me if I want to super size it or asking me if I'd like to try their new suspicious food invention, and it's not gimmicky and they don't enter into promotional deals with children's movies that require them to stick a $0.03 plastic toy from China into my kid's meal. 

There is no blaring noise or beeping from automated taco frying machines or drive thru window speakers, and best of all there is no stupid character (no clowns, no roman emperors, no kings, no one wearing a ginormous round, white ball head) staring me in the face from a poster that was obviously designed by a Madison Avenue ad man with the intent to get me to buy more food or buy a piece of pie that comes in a box.

What's more, their food doesn't taste like it's the product of a focus group at corporate headquarters that's trying to give me just enough flavor without having to spend too much on quality...no, instead it tastes like it is the result of a few people who know how to make delicious Mexican food getting together and saying, "Hey, let's make some good Mexican food and sell it". 

Plain and simple, you go in and order it, and they don't do anything except make it, stick it in a bag and tell you to have a nice day. No horror stories of the thuggish looking idiot kids who messed up your order, no agonizing decisions about whether or not to upsize or super upsize, no advertisements on the bag to assault your sub-conscious mind, and no little plastic toys from China to step on for 3 weeks until you manage to throw it away when your 7 year old isn't looking. Go there, eat it, you won't regret it. 

Two fisted, bare knuckled Mexican food in a plain white plastic bag...y que?
