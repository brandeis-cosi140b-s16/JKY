Clean, upbeat and good food.  The menu selection is better than that other burrito chain and the salsa and guac are better tasting. The team manning the prep line were friendly and generous with the portions. The manager offered us a small container of the queso (for free) since we had already purchased the chips and guac. We will go back for another family meal.  Everyone enjoyed our first try.
