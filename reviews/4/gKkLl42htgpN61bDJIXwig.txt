From curb this plase looks like any other run down Mexican street food spot. Once you step inside it is anything but. The two ladies in the kitchen were friendly and efficient. The place smelled clean and of fresh cooked tortillas. I ordered three tacos and a jarritos orange soda the total came to six bucks (little spendy). One of the ladies brought out fresh cilantro, onions, limes, and radishes as well as thee kinds of salsa!!! The meat was savory and the tortillas fresh made. I will definatly be back!
