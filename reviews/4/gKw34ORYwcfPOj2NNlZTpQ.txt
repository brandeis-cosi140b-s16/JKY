After reading glowing the reviews, we figured we need to see what all the chatter was about.  I'll have to try it again to fully make up my mind.  After our first dinner I'd give it a full 5 stars, but the second trip (with friends and family) it fell flat.

I highly recommend the nopales (fresh cactus) salad.  It's deliciously vinagary with diced tomatoes, corn, onion and cilantro in a light vinaigrette finished with queso fresco and pine nuts.  Yum!  The first time I got the green mussels with three cheese stuffing and fettuccine alfredo.  I could have done without the alfredo, although the leftovers made great late night munchies, but the mussels quelled my craving.  My boyfriend tried the steak enchiladas with a great spicy red sauce.  The service was great, and we were sure this would be a favorite stop in Henderson.

The second time we dined there we again had the nopales salad (a favorite across the table), but some of the other entrees fell flat.  We tried the vegetarian tacos, which lacked flavor, along with the green chili pork.  The mole was good, decent, but didn't rock my world.  The favorite item at the table were the fish tacos, which had great flavor (although the salsa was a bit too sweet for my taste).  The chicken enchilladas were fine, but lacked flavor, and definitely lacked heat.  None of the meals this time had much spice.  

When we're looking for a nicer night out eatery we'll head back this way and update as appropriate...
