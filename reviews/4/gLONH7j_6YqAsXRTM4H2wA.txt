The previous reviews gave me high expectations and after my first visit, I was very pleased.  

If I could, I would give the food 4 stars and the service 2.5.  They were probably short staffed during the lunch rush, and being by myself I was overlooked a number of times (I hate flagging down the server) and probably spent 10-15 minutes longer in the restaurant than if the server had been semi-attentive.  Don't get me wrong, they were trying hard (running down the aisles)... just hire another couple people.

The tacos were delicious, and while simple, struck me as "fresh" and full of flavor.  I had the "combo" and ordered two Chicken Mole and two Chorizo.  The chorizo was the highlight with guacamole and spicy fresh salsa.  The chicken was well grilled but I didn't get the kick I wanted from the mole.  It wouldn't take much for me to give them 5 stars on the food, just a finishing touch like a little bit of cilantro here and there.  Maybe I just need to know what to order.
