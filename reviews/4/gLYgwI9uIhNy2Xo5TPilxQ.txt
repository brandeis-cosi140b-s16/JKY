I love this place! The food tastes great- I like  that they have a whole bean burrito with avocado slices in it.  Their iced tea is good too.Plus they sell a great refillable cup and you get a much cheaper drink when you bring it with you. I use the cup all the time too at my desk. They also recently started using regular plates and silverware in the restaurant, reducing trash.  love when chain restaurants do this. It shows that you can still make a profit and reduce waste.

You can also call in your order and use the drive thru window to pick it up. that's convenient!

The only reason I dropped off a star on the rating is this- if you order food there you get a side of chips included. If you order food to go you have to pay for the side of chips. What the heck is that about?
