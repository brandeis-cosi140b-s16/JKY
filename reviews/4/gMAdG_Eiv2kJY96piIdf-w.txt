Met a girlfriend for dinner while I was in town. I made a reservation on opentable to make sure we had a seat. The service staff were nice and very attentive. We both ordered from their taco menu. I love that you can mix and match :-) I had the carne asada and tilapia taco, both were delicious! You won't be disappointed! 

I liked it so much I took my family back two days later :-) make sure you get the fresh guacamole!
