The food wasn't incredible but it was decent. I had a mishap with an online order so the manager offered to pay for my meal and deliver it to me the next night - great customer service! We ordered a chicken burrito, machaca enchiladas, beans and rice. The chicken was juicy but made the burrito watery. The enchiladas were decent but the beans and rice were great. I'd definitely be willing to try a few more items on the menu but the customer service is what really won me over.
