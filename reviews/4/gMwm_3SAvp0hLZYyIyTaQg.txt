A group of us had a night out in Scottsdale...on the way home, we stopped at Amados.

Looking over the menu, I was overwhelmed to see that they had a substantial selection of breakfast burritos, tacos, burritos, nachos, enchiladas, tostadas, etc, etc. There were so many choices that it was a tough decision! After much thought, I ordered a carne asada taco and an horchata. The total came out to $4.74.

The taco was not your average size. It was rather large, like a small burrito. Filled with a lot of carne asada, pico de gallo & guacamole. I topped with with salsa & lime juice from the salsa bar. This was delicious and just hit the spot! I was extremely full after finishing the entire thing.

I noticed on the menu that you receive a free bean & cheese burrito with any $5 purchase. Score! Also, for an extra bonus, they are open 24 hours a day.
