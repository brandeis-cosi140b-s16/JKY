I like this place for their margaritas, chicken tacos and the pollo fundido. Sometimes the chicken in the pollo fundido is dry :( hit or miss. The tacos are yum and the outdoor patio is beautiful. Sometime there is live music which makes it special. I find the main dining room kinda cold. The service is usually pretty good - sometimes slow. Overall, I really enjoy coming here, it's close and the food is usually pretty good.
