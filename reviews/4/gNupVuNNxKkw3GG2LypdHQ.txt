Stopped in to have dinner for my brothers birthday.  Our party was a bit too large for the small dinning area, there was 8 in our group.  However, after a short wait they were able to accommodate us.  

Everything I tasted was great, the only thing holding me back from giving a five star review is the small dining area.  I had two tacos and rice and beans.  The cochinita pibil taco was very good but the star of the show was the Aztec tinga.  So flavorful, so fat, so hot!  Man, good thing I had a horchata to cool the flames.  The horchata was very good but around halfway through it became nearly impossible to drink through the straw because of the fruit and nuts.  It was no big deal though.  All in all it was a great meal at a very reasonable price.
