Had been meaning to get here and finally made it last night. Excellent fare and solid service at reasonable prices. Party of 6 of us - man I love summer when the tourists leave and you can get seated right away anywhere. So nice to have craft beer on tap with my Mexican food - Four Peak Hop Knot IPA. Started with the chips and guac which I thought was very good, although I would have preferred it with the cheese on top. The elote, on the other hand, was wonderful -- as good as I've had. I ordered the "paella", which was a ittle thicker than a standard paella and seafood-less, I believe (Chicken, sausage, ham, root veggies). Very nice, and although I had plans to save some for tomorrow, it didn't happen. Wifey said the chicken mole was good, but she still prefers the version at Pepe's Taco Villa. OK, to each her own. Split an order of the coconut pudding (meh), and a key lime pie/tart/square/something that was phenomenal -- creamy and super-tart.

Only downside was that it was pretty warm in there. Don't know if they had A/C problems or were using a swamp cooler, but it was borderline uncomfortable at times. Crank up the A/C guys.

Great place. Great location. I'll be back to try the Al Pastor tacos, and can't wait to try the chicken soup everyone seems to be raving about...
