I hadn't really heard great things about this place, but I just moved around the corner and decided to give it a try. Since then, my roommates and I go at least once every couple of weeks because of how good it is. The nachos are good, but I go for the Dip Trio. It has housemade guacamole, salsa and the best white cheddar queso you will ever have. We also get a pitcher of house margaritas (which is the cheapest way to go if everyone wants to drink) and sometimes a second order of queso. Their patio is great because it is completely shaded and actually has a great view. The service has never been bad; some servers are better than others, but overall a great place to get lunch!
