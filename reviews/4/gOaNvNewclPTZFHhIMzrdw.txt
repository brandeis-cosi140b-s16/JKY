Don't miss the 1/2 price appetizers thru today, 3.22. Guacamole and salsa has a refreshing kick. Guacamole definitely surpasses quality of typical fare at local restaurants. Fish tacos (2) are a deal and tasty. Tortillas melt in your mouth. Service attentive but bar slowing the pace. Nice upscale feel without being stuffy. What a great addition to the neighborhood!
