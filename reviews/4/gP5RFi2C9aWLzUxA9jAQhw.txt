It's a nice spot for a decent lunch. Naturally I ordered the tacos figuring they'd be a solid choice for a place with "tacos" in the business name. Overall I was happy with the food quality and service. It tasted fresh and the meals arrived very quickly. The menu was simple and the prices very affordable. I'd return for a nice quick lunch. Salsa bar was good but you do have to pay for chips. The taco shells appeared and tasted pre-made too.
