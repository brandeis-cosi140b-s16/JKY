such a big fan!  we called for reservations late in the game (around 430 pm for that night) and they were able to reserve us a table at 630 on the patio.  the restaurant has a great atmosphere- not at all what i expected for old town scottsdale.  it's really pretty and nice and a really great place to dine.

our server was super friendly and attentive and the food was phenomenal! we got the sophia loren cocktail and the avocado margarita- both were strong but delicious.  for food we shared the duck carnitas empanada which was phenomenal, mahi mahi tacos and chorizo porchetta.  the tacos and the porchetta were both a good portion and really delicious.
