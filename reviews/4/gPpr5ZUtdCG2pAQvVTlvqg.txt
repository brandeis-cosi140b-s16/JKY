When I saw the name "Americas taco shop" the first thing that came to mind was "Taco Bell", good ole "American" Tacos... I was relieved when I found out the name is not based on the country but rather the name of a Hispanic Woman. Based on the "Arnold Palmer" beverage I have learned that if something that you consume is being named after a person then it is probably worth consuming.... just ask Reuben!!!

I frequent this location and when ever I am in the mood for a Mexican coke I will drop in like a paratrooper with one objective in mind. seek and destroy that sugary beverage. but like any mission other obstacles present them self that I did not initially anticipate. In the case of Operation Americas Taco Shop it always turns out to be the chips and salsa. It doesn't end there though.... they have backup, and it is in the form of carne asada. Carne asada is tricky because it sneaks up under the comfort of a fluffy torta bun, or under the cover of a well grilled tortilla. I tend to always end up with a regular bean and cheese burrito and a regular carne asada quesadilla. for me it is a manageable task and I do not need to radio in back up.

This is a mission that I will choose to accept on numerous occasions in the future. as long as the threat of carne asada is amongst us you can count on me to be there at "Americas" for Americans!!!
