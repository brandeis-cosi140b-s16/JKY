I've always liked this place, down the street from my house and authentic Mexican dishes. The inside is nicer than most street taco places or hole in the wall Mexican restaurants. Seems like it might be under new management which has pushed me to write the review, the changes show and I am impressed. Food has always been made well and flavorful. Only reason they didn't get 5 stars is their salsa bar is always out of limes.. What's Mexican food with limes ;)
