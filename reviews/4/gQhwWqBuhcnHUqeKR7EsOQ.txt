Barrio is serious about quality and imagination when it comes to Mexican food. Don't let the address or neighborhood fool you. There is no meal like this in Scottsdale. This is a no hype, all taste achievement experience for your senses. If Barrios can find a way to maintain what they have accomplished and open a few more of these around town, that would be delightful. If expansion takes away anything from this masterpiece, then leave it just like it is.
