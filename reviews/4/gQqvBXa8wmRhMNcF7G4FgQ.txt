Dinner tonight. Got there for happy hour. Had the house margarita for 4.00. Dinner was the big burrito. I would eat it again... and again... and again. Service was quick.

It was hard for me to not go back.  But since it was my first time in Pit, I decided to try more places.  Tempting..

Are there better Mexican places? Yes. Are they more expensive and fancy? Yes - think Loreal by Dupont Circle in DC. 

Bottom line, clean place with above average food at a good price.
