I am updating this review for only one reason. It seems that I have spent years over looking Caramba's dessert menu. They offer a choice called "Cinnamon Crisps" which are warm cinnamon baked chips drizzled with warm honey.  The huge portion they provide is only $1.99.

You need this in your mouth. Now.
