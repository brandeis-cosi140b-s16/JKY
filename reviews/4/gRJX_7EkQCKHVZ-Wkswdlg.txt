Haven't had any of the food yet besides the bar popcorn which was seasoned with a little cajun seasoning and delicious. Katie are bartender was friendly, helpful and quite witty. We made it here just in time for the start of happy hour and wow what a deal. 2 for 1 specials on anything that is alcohol. Shots, margaritas, beers, etc. buy one get one free. Can't argue with that.  Even though I didn't eat, the food I saw brought out around me smelled great and looked good too. I will def try some of the food next time I go and I will def go there again. 

Located right across the street from the Hard Rock, I would recommend it to anyone staying there that is looking for some local flair and cheap drinks. You will not be let down especially if Katie is working and its happy hour. Plenty of parking out front also.

Also they are a Browns Backer bar so if you are a Browns fan and looking for a bar to go to that is close to the strip this is it.
