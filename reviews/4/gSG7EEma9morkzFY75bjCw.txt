I have been coming here since it was Super Mex and will continue too come back! Love this place! They bring you out chips with a delicious salsa and re-fried beans to dip in while you contemplate what to order. I have tried a few dishes here and they were ALL good.. most recently they had a special that was a chile rellano filled with ground beef and covered in a chipotle cream sauce...MMMMMMMM!  They have the BEST shrimp soft tacos as well... so addicting! I also like their chicken rice bowl, it comes with cilantro lime rice which is the bomb.com and you get a huge portion for only $5 (enough for dinner and lunch the next day)  The one thing I really miss was when it was Super Mex they had an "Antojito combo" that I loved and they no longer have this available...boooo. It came with mini chimichangas and adobo wings that were DELISH! Jalisco PLEASE bring this back for me!!!! ;)
