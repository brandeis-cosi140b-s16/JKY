The super nachos here will probably be the reason for my death (or at least my morbid obesity). BUT I DON'T CARE. Great food at a cheap price. Gigantic portions. Lots of menu options. Only two complaints:
1) they charge you $1 extra if you use a card to pay.
2) the staff could be a little friendlier. I just feel like I'm doing a business transaction any time I go there.
