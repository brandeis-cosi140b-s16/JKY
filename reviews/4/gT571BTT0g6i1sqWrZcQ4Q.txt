Had the chicken fajitas and they were absolutely terrific! I might say the best fajitas I have ever had. The chips were hot and had a great flavor and the salsa superb! The food gets 5 stars!

Why do I only give it 4 stars? I had to wait at least 10 minutes to get another beer... the waitress should never let your beer run out.

I will be back!
