Starting off with the chips and salsa, I loved both. The atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned. I found zero problem with the service. It was attentive and sufficient. 

The drinks are the best thing. I had the Mexican Mule. 

I liked my tacos.  I had a short rib and the pork (called something else to be hip). 2 were enough but they were a bit overpriced for the size. The place is an overall great addition to Gilbert.

UPDATE: From this 1st visit I had some coupons for more tacos and a drink - all FREE. I went back expecting for there to be an up-sell and OK with it.  My friend and I ordered our drinks with alcohol, which should have been extra, I think. At the end, my friend and I asked for the bill but we were told the coupons had taken care of everything. We walked out paying NOTHING (except we left a generous tip for the waitress, of course). 

What a great way to do business! I'll be back to spend real money. No question.
