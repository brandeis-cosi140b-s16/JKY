My family and I came here today for lunch. Small shop, but great customer service. I am Vegan but my family isn't so it can be tricky sometimes to find a spot that we all like. I was pleasantly surprised that they had meat substitutes with tofu or vegetables! Awesome. I ordered 2 Komex tacos with tofu, and a side order of Kimchee fried rice. My husband ordered the Bulgogi burrito and he absolutely loved it. My daughter had a spam musubi and son ordered the cheeseburger with fries. I was also happy that they had stevia and sugar in the raw as an option for my tea. My food was delicious but I would recommend done thing. To maybe marinate and fry the tofu so it has a crispier texture when placed in the tacos. Over-all, great experience.
