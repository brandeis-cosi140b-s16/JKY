I have been to this place 3 times ( i think ).  All 3 times have been after 10:00 P.M..... i heard it was a restaurant but me and a group of friends went there because it looked like a dance club....SURE ENOUGH it is a dance club at night..... we had so much fun the first night we experienced diego! there is a cover charge and dress code but it was the best dancing i have had... all the people inside are chill ....no haters ...girls wanna dance and drink......it was like 95 percent latin people inside great dj.....i would recommend going there to anybody who likes reggaeton and hip hop. and salsa....
