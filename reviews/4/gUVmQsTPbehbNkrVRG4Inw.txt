Going off the strip in Vegas, you'll find a lot of restaurants especially in the same complex as Havana Grill.  There is apparently life outside of Vegas.  Naive me!  In this complex, there are restaurants that offer Lebanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and other cuisines, especially Cuban.  We decided to go Cuban and what a find this place is!

I ordered number #73, which is some chicken dish topped with caramelized onions, served with moros (rice combined with black beans).  I ordered this because I looked around and saw a rice and chicken dish and since my wife was ordering the chicken & rice dish, I didn't want to order the same thing.  I was glad I ordered this one because this is a very very good dish.  The chicken was very flavorful and tender.  The rice mixed with black beans is a unique dish and has excellent flavor.

The arroz con pollo (chicken with rice) dish however, was a major disappointment.  The chicken was hidden underneath all the rice and was flavorless.  The rice, although flavorless, kinda grows on you, but that's not really a positive.  The only good thing from the dish was their platanos or fried plantains.

The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  The lovely waitress, Alejandra was ultra attentive and nice.  We would definitely consider coming back.
