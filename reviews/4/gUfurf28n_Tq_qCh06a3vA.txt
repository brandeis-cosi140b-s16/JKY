I don't know why but I had really low expectations for this place the first time I ate here. I have been three times now and every time I am surprised by how great it is. They have awesome Al Pastor which you can get in a burrito, taco, tostada or quesadilla. You can actually see the meat roasting in the kitchen with a pineapple on top. Great salsas and friendly staff too.
