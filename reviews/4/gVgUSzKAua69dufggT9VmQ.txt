We really liked the place. Great horchata. OK chips and salsa. Fabulous shrimp fajitas. The service was good. The only downside is the location. It's a bit of a dive. The inside though is pretty cozy, so don't let it drive you off. This place, with its great food, low prices and good service is definitely worth it!
