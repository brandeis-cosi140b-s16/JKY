While in Tempe for work, I discovered Chronic Taco....and fell in love!  It kind of reminds me of a nicer version of Chipotle with a much larger selection.  The refried beans are made right there in the restaurant and they grill the shrimp fresh to order.  They also have a large menu, with a lot of different choices.  I would give Chronic Taco five stars, but I just wasn't a huge fan of the salsa.  I enjoy my food HOT, and their hot salsa wasn't hot enough for me.  I would've also liked to have seen a bigger veggie selection.  All in all, I REALLY miss Chronic Taco.  I live in Ohio and I would be deliriously happy if we had one here!!
