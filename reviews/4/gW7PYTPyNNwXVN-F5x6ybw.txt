So when I heard that we were going out to Maria Maria, I had thing idea that we were going to small hole in the wall barrio restaurant with homemade horchata and flan with some authentic Mexican cuisine.  I would have been totally cool with that and if I ended up at a taco truck or a small taqueria, I would have never looked back.  I didn't realize it was gonna be an uber fancy Mexican food joint right in a classy Tempe newly made mall.  They had some people playing live music (my party decided we were going to get up and dance like it was 1999 while we waited for our food, with everybody nearby looking at us like we were fools).   

But I fully enjoyed my chicken and mole tortilla casserole along with a delicious tasting set of sorbet (zesty lime, pineapple mint, and colima tamarind) for dessert.  You don't get a whole lot of sorbet but the flavors were quite mouth watering and I have never really tasted this kind of luscious sorbet flavors before.  Watch out...those $13 margaritas will add up really quickly if you aren't too careful.  

The one thing I got a laugh out of was that most of their burritos are stated on the menu to be "mexicanized version of the classic American burrito."  Isn't that an oxymoron?  I'll go with the sweet mole over the Mexicanized American burrito any day of the week.  =)
