The first place we checked out as soon as we arrived in Phoenix! We saw them featured on taco wars so we had to try their tacos. The fish taco was very disappointing (I had way better fish tacos elsewhere) but I enjoyed their beef tacos! It was as close to authentic street tacos in mexico as it could get. They also serve saut√©ed onions and hot pepper on the side which added more flavors to their tacos.
