I love this place.  Bacon breakfast burritos could be cooked crispier. Pico de gallo could be a little cheaper. Love the daily specials and value meals.  Friendly staff particularly one girl there. Food comes out quick. Love the free salsa and chips. Carne asada got pricey!!!?? The guacamole salsa is a little hot for me but like it. Recently started living the red!!
