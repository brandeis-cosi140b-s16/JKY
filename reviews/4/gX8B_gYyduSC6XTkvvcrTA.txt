Stopped by for lunch today, I've been meaning to for a while now.  Even though is was Friday lunch the wait was only a few minutes.  Seated quickly, clean table, and promptly served some delicious corn salsa.  The chips were a little soggy but the salsa was great.

I had the Beer Battered White Fish taco.  Batter was nice and light, not overpowering, and really highlighted the fish.  

Also tried the Blackened Mahi Fish taco.  Nice spice! The Mahi was a little dry but when you got a bite of Mahi, cabbage, creama it was perfect.  

I'll be back to try the BBQ Mahi fish taco.
