Idk why people are hating so much on this location. This is the most convenient location for me in terms of distance, but I've never had a problem here. Granted, if you're gonna go between 5:00-7:00, you're gonna hit a little bit of a line (typical dinner rush). But even when you get your order, I've never noticed them skimp on the proteins or anything else like some people are claiming. Whenever I come here, the employees are always very nice, accommodate/humor me when I ask for extra rice, lettuce, whatever it may be. This will definitely always be my Chipotle location of choice.
