Fast, good, and clean. Unless you are in just after the high school kids get through, which is impossible to defeat, this is a great little Mexican food stand style place. Finally a place has embraced the gringo breakfast burrito (bacon, potato, egg and cheese) and named it, New Breakfast Burrito. 

If you are in the area and hungry, worth a trip!
