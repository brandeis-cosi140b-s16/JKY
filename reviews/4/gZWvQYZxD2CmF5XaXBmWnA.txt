Even though this is not an authentic Mexican place, I love their food!!!  The plate's sizes are pretty big, the ingredients are fresh, and their service is pretty efficient.  Their winning and most popular plate is the pork burrito. This is not your typical carnitas, this is actually a sweet bbq pork. Although it sounds a bit weird is delicious. If you do not like pork you can always go for steak or chicken. However,  If you are looking for a most healthy alternative the salad is a great option. The portion is huge and contains a bit of everything, (guacamole, sour cream, beans rice and letters)
