Los Olivos was recommended by a local and we couldn't have been happier with this restaurant. Located very close to the Civic Centre, and near Old Town  it is easily accessible, even by foot from Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. Here are some comments:

Good: excellent authentic Mexican food, very reasonable prices, generous-sized portions, friendly service, parking lot in the back, lots of street parking

So-so: the place could use a coat of paint, but the food makes everything better

The chips here come with 2 bottles of different flavoured salsa which is a nice touch. I especially enjoyed the flautas and guacamole.

This is a highly recommended restaurant that offers excellent real Mexican nosh at reasonable prices. We'll be back next time we're in town.

A shout out to our server Daniel for great service!
