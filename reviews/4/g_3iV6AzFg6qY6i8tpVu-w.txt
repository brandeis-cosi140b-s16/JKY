Just had lunch here, I loved this place. The food was fresh, high quality and served with a friendly smile. The steak taco with cilantro and onion was one of the best I have ever had, I also had the fried tilapia taco, it was SO good, having it again, soon! The complimentary chips and salsa were excellent as well. The bakery items smelled amazing, next time I will leave room for something :) I will be back for sure.
