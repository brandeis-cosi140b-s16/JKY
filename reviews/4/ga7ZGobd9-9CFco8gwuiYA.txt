Go-to Taco spot!

Service - When we first started coming here, the service was great. Always friendly and patient workers. Yet, lately, the service seems to be going downhill. Workers are nowhere near as friendly, sometimes the cashier barely says two words and seems annoyed. 

Food - We get the Nachos with steak (comes w/your choice of meat), 2 steak tacos for the other half and 1 chipolte shrimp&1 chorizo taco for me. Always delicious. Only complaint is that SOMETIMES there is not enough meat in the taco. Salsa bar is filled with different kinds of salsa and even sour cream (I'm used to having to pay for the sour cream). 

So.. if you are looking for a place to stuff your face, but you want to leave with some money still leftover in your wallet - I recommend this place.
