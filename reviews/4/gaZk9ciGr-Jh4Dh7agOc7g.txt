About as good as it gets for fast food. I'm usually terrified of eating seafood from fast food joints, but I make an exception for Rubio's. The fish tacos are surprisingly good.... fish tastes fresh and is supposedly raised in a sustainable way. They have quite a few varieties and are constantly rotating new concepts onto the menu. Burritos and nachos are also very solid options. Rubio's is only a short walk away from the Aria so if you need some late night grub and don't feel like sitting at Cafe Vettro, Rubio's is a great option
