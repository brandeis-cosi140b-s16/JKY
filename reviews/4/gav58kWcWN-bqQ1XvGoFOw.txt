I'm quite obsessed with carne asada fries. And I really haven't found a good place for asada fries in LA since I've left SD. But that hunt will have to continue. I want to talk about the AMAZING carne asada fries here in LV. Carne asada fries loaded with (real!) avocado, cheese, and some of the best carne asada I've ever had with crunchy fries. Ahhh...drooling just thinking about it right now. 

Bf tried some of their tacos and those were mighty delicious as well! All their tortillas are hand made fresh in store. 

OH! And they have Orange Bang!!!! I'm in heaven!!!

Things I did not like:
- PRICEY! $2 for street sized tacos, $10 for carne asada fries
- Confusing ordering stations: you order different things from different stations 
- pretty far off strip (but there is a closer location to the strip)
