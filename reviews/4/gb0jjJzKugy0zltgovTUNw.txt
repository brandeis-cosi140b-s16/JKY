One of the better restaurants in Chambana.  A cozy, open dinning area with a small bar.  Warm colors, bright and airy.  A very comfortable feel.  Service is attentive and knowledgeable.  The food here is very fresh, and the kind of Latin American/Mexican that I wish more places would make.

Appetizers are great.  Ceviche is fresh as can be, and I love the Duck Confit taquitos.  Main dishes are large, filling, and always fresh as well.  Their seafood is great.  Tilapia and salmon are cooked perfectly.  Wild mushroom enchilada is awesome.  They have some sandwiches for lunch that are great.  Tacos for early bird dinner, great.  You will not find mounds of gelatinous refried beans and crappy rice that come from a can or bag here.  You can taste the fresh flavors.  A great mix of Latin America and Mexican.  

They also have a half way decent beer selection in bottles.  I usually enjoy some Founders.  A well stocked bar, and good mixed drinks.  

I keep saying this, but it is true.  A great spot with fresh and well prepared food.  One of my favorite spots in Champaign/Urbana.
