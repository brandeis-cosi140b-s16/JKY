I thought I'd write an update as it's been almost a year since my last.

My husband and I eat here at least once a week, usually twice.  Pretty much every time we go, I order Enchiladas and ask for a filling of chicken and potatoes.  It's not on the menu but they have no problem making them.  The reason I started ordering them this way is that I discovered their potatoes are absolutely delicious and I don't know what the heck they do to that chicken but it is so flavorful.  Unfortunately, now I have to share my order with my husband because he loves them too but it works out because we always share whatever he orders, which is often the Chorizo con Eggs and he always adds the delicious potatoes to that.

Last weekend, we decided to try a couple different things (along with the usual enchiladas) and one was the Carne Asada Tortas De Mexico and the Fish Tacos.  We're not there to save calories, obviously, and the fish was battered and it was delicious and the tartar sauce they used was very flavorful.  We didn't quite make it through the Torta but we sure tried because it was tasty.  The bun was soft and chewy and the filling was very good.  

We'll be back soon.  No doubt about it.  The people that work there are so friendly and really make you feel good about eating at their establishment.  The young gal that usually works the register always has a smile and has the cutest disposition.  Just an all around great experience every single time.
