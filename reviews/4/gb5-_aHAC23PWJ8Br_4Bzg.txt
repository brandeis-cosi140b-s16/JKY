A friend recommended this location for lunch. It seemed a little strange to have a sushi burrito, but I am always up for a challenge.

I brought 2 friends and we all ordered something different.

All 3 of us were pleasantly surprised with the amount of sushi on the burrito and the taste of each item.
I am hoping the portions stay consistent as their was plenty of sushi on the burrito.

Only open 6 days they were a little slow, but that was to be expected.
Steady crowd for a new location]

ECO Friendly, and very clean and open seating.

We will definitely go back!
