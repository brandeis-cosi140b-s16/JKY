I am going to regret saying this but here it goes... $2 TACO TUESDAY + Happy Hour drink prices.  I have been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed by the food... on one occasion i was disappointed by the service (that was when they first opened so willing to give them another try).  I have been here for the Tuesday special twice now and I love it!  Keep up the good work Barrio Queen - i don't want to see yet another restaurant open in that space... you are a perfect fit!
