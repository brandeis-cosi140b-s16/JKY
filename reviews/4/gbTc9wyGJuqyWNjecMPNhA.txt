I went for a late lunch today with my boyfriend.  We had excellent service.  Our waitress was too kind.  

I love that you get your chips and salsa immediately. Today we ordered a small guacamole and it was delicious.  

For our entrees I ordered steak fajitas.  Amazing.  And my boyfriend got the deluxe burrito.  So much food.  

Service was great today.  Plus we had margaritas that were only less than $5! 

Delicious food.  Delicious drinks.  Great service today!
