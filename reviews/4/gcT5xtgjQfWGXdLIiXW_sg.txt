This location was my first foray into sit down mexican food 8 years ago, and I still have warm fuzzies when the possibility to eat here arises.  The bean dip is always warm and tasty, and a little different every time with varying levels of spiciness.  Chips almost always hot and salted reasonably.  Yesterday I had tthe spinach enchiladas dish, I'm very keen on here, with a nice cream-based sauce on top smothered in cheese.  The vegetables side is great and think everyone should get it when they come here.   In terms of food, service, ambience this is really 3 stars, but for being so damn consistent over the last 8 years gotta give this one a 4 just like my closer location.
