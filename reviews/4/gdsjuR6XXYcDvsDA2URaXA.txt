From those who brought you Spanish Fly, here's the improved Spanish Fly in north Scottsdale.  They did a great job remodeling the old Jilly's and turning it into a beautiful place to drink.  The inside is very large with televisions, a dance floor, and multiple bars.  The outside boasts a large pool with waterfall, multiple bars, plenty of loungers and cabanas, and a pool table.  If you're a fan of people watching, come here on the weekend.  You'll find wasted 20 somethings sunbathing in teeny bikinis and 50 somethings swimming laps to show they still have vitality.
We came here on opening day to have weak drinks, our food order wrong, and a wait of 30 minutes for our tab after we asked for it.  It was opening day, everyone was friendly, and the place is so aesthetically pleasing that we chose to give it another try a few weeks later.  It had very much improved and I had a great time.  The drinks were not weak this time.  The food was delicious and came out as ordered. 
The only suggestion I have is to install another light in the ladies' room.  It is pitch black in the first stall and you have to use the light on your cell phone to find the seat.  I hope this place is able to last while so many others fail.  It's a really cool place.
