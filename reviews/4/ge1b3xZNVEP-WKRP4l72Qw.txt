Panchero's is similar to Chipotle, with a few twists.  I end up going to Chipotle about half the time, and Panchero's about half the time.  Since I'd give Chipotle a 4-star average review, I figure that means Panchero's deserves the same.  Still, it's 4-star in the realm of fast burritos.

Panchero's touts that they don't use pre-packaged tortillas, which is true - they make it on a press right there (although I can't say if they make the doughh on-site or not).  I'd say this does make for a slightly better tortilla, but not good enough to warrant going here instead of Chipotle.  Fortunately, that's not the only difference.

One simple but effective step Panchero's does is simply mixing the ingredients together before wrapping the burrito.  I love Chipotle, but it's really annoying when you get all the lettuce on one side, three-quarters of the pork on the other, and so forth.  No such issues at Panchero's.  Toppings are pretty similar, with Panchero's winning points for their recent addition of freshly diced jalapeno peppers, and the only one I've been charged extra for is guacamole, which is pretty standard.  On the other hand, I personally prefer Chipotle's cilantro lime rice to Panchero's rice - this will be a matter of personal preference.

The chips are made with blue corn, and are pretty tasty.  If you just get the chips, they're only 50 cents for a pretty sizeable portion, which is a bargain eating out if you ask me.  I don't always get them, but when I do I'm satisfied.

The quesadillas were disappointing, but I didn't have high expectations for them to begin with.  You go to this sort of place for the burrito.

Service is okay.  It's not bad, and the staff at the Gammon location are friendlier than the staff at the Fitchburg location (by the Super Target).  But the Chipotle on Old Sauk has much more enthusiastic, outgoing staff.  So if I'm not hankering for one of Panchero's slight advantages, I'm liable to go to Chipotle instead.
