The hubs & I love El Pollo Loco! It's a quick drive from our house, so I'd say about once a month we get a craving for it. Their chicken is the bomb & smells delicious as you pull up to the drive thru window. Our fav side has to be the mac & cheese, weird I know considering this is a mexican food joint, but man that stuff is good. We also enjoy their flour tortillas. They usually have a meal deal that includes a free cake but we aren't cake people so I always bring it to work. But we do love their flan & the churros are pretty good too. There can be a lil bit of a wait sometimes at the drive thru but trust me, it's worth the wait!
