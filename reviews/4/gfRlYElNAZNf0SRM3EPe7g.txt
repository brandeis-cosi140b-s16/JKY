For people who know me, I used to avoid Chipotle because I didn't think it was authentic Mexican food. But that was years and years ago.  Chipotle has slowly brought me around and enticed me with their burrito bowls! I usually get a bowl filled with brown rice, black beans and steak (sometimes chicken). I'm a fan of their medium salsa and their corn salsa.  And the staff is pretty generous with all the ingredients.

The location in the South Park Mall is clean and a welcome find among the other eateries in the food court. The staff is usually very friendly and the service is fast.  There isn't much seating inside the Chipotle location but you certainly take your food out to the many tables in the food court - it makes a great place for people watching!
