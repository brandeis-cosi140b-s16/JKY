I decided to check this place out late on a Saturday night. I was surprised it was so dead. We were the only ones there. No one was at the door to greet us. Three minutes later after making noise, a tastefully provocatively dress young nice lady came to greet us. I ordered the ceviche aguachile. It was a huge portion. The price was right. I thought it good. My husband had the Cameron al mojo de ajo. He thought the food was bland nothing too special about it. The menus were also all in Spanish no English translations whatsoever. I doubt I'll ever go back since there are many other places I must try. Oh but the place was really clean.
