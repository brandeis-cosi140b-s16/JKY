Another one of my favorite places...  Though I would suggest coming in during lunch (11a-1p) during the week, or for dinner (5p-7p) on Fridays... the food is mostly batch prepped, and best during those hours.

The location off of 19th Avenue and Greenway tends to be better if you are in that area.

I tend to order a combo with Carnitas Quesadilla, Hen Grenade Chicken, pork fried rice, and pinto beans... ymmv of course...  I've had most of the menu, but it's been a while since I've ordered anything else.. I come in about once a month lately either here or at the 19th ave location.
