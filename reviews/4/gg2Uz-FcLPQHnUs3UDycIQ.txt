Ok... So I eat here WAY too much and may be slightly biased as it is pretty much " in the hood" but people for those of you who were saddened by La Unica's passing:  BE SAD NO MORE!!!  This place is the real deal taqueria... It's not pretty, it' plenty divey, it's small and the ac can be dicey but it is (as Granny used to say) Goo-ood.  From the beer selection and Margaritas to the chips/salsa and the ENCHILADAS you cannot go wrong!!!  The service has been getting better bit by bit over the years and now (perhaps cause we are regulars) it is a-ok most nights.  Cheese dip with chorizo will make you Hap Hap happy and indifferent to the fact that your arteries are clogging and if you are a big mole sauce fan then this one's for you.  

Get a big margarita and at up y'all!
