I have lived in the greater Phoenix area and been to every Dos Gringo's in the valley, I like them all. The South Tempe location however, has the best staff by far. The staff, BOTH male and female are friendly, professional, and take their jobs seriously. The food is good and on par with what offerings a place like this would have. Obviously a large part of the place is the drinks, and the bartenders are always quick to keep your glass full of whatever you want. They will even try to make anything you request as long as they have the ingredients. Overall, I have no complaints and would gladly bring friends and family here and I will be back. Would definitely have to disagree with the overly critical reviews below. Some almost sound personal...
