If your looking for authentic Mexican aguas and tortas this is the place for you.
The skinny 
I have been coming here for about a year now and they have kept up with the quality waters I have tried the horchata melon limon naranja and pi√±a. All are great my favorite is the agua de Fruta the large drink is 2.70 and is worth every drop ask for no ice and get more :-). The tortas are ok seems pretty average comparing them to other torta places or even filibertos the carne asada is on point and they have daily specials like a torta fries and drink for 5.99 plus tax. They also have a panederia (bakery) with fresh Mexican donuts and breads decent prices you might get same quality at ranch market for cheaper but it's great they offer it. 
The bad 
The front counter is so close to the door I sometimes get confused about the line and it makes for unnecessary confrontations between patrons. While I do speak Spanish I did hear a lady having the hardest time ordering in English until I stepped in to help no big deal but I think they could have handled situation better. 
Overall 
This place is as authentic as the places I go to Mexico especially the waters they are great cooks, quick and affordable
