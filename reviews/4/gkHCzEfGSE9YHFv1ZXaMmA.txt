Sofritas, FTW!  One of my fav vegan meals from a fast chain. The sofritas are SO good.  I cannot get enough. The perfect blend of spices & flavor... Tofu never had it so good. Burrito, tacos, & bowl; brown rice, white rice... I love it all. Accompanied with their perfectly salted tortilla chips & the best guacamole in the galaxy, this is the business. 

This location is insane during the weekday lunch crowd. It's a smaller location so the waiting line is always out the door. During the summer, this is no bueno. Do yourself a favor and order online or via their mobile app, so you can skip the line, pick up your food, & go. If you're paying with a credit card, you can pay online too. Even better! 

My only real complaint is that this location sometimes overcooks its tortilla chips. 

They share a parking lot with other restaurants and stores, so that lunchtime madness spills over into the lot. Good times.
