First of all, I LOVE the chips and dip set up. That green chile salsa is amazing, but packs quite a bit of heat so beware! Seeing as AZ water is disgusting I usually order an iced tea. They serve a really tasty raspberry very lightly sweetened. I absolutely hate overly sweet tea, but their's was perfecto!
The cheese enchiladas are average, cheese, tortilla, sauce. Tacos are pretty good too, but I come hear for the tamales, red chile con carne, and sopaipillas! They're the first Mexican restaurant I've eaten at that doesn't have dry tamales. They are so good! Chile con carne is delicious and tender, falls apart in your mouth. I've only had the red because the green packs a little too much heat for me. The end of meal sopaipillas with cinnamon and sugar are so yummy!
