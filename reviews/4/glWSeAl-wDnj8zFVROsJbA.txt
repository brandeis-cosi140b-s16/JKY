I came into this particular FiliB's after a night of drinking. The cashier was new I presume as she screwed up my order twice. I didn't care. Mexican delight was about to hit my stomach and make me regret the night or morning...so excited. Another cashier came over and screwed up my order two more times. They both kept trying to persuade me to get five tacos instead of four. Then they fed me some line of bs that they couldn't sell me individual tacos...only the special. I got frustrated enough to just take the damn combo. I also got a carne asada burrito without pico de gallo with guacamole, a bacon burrito for my friend and some pollo asado and carne asada mini tacos(the combo I was pressured into getting). Total: Like $16 and some change.

The drunk munchies are the best. The carne asada and pollo asado mini tacos were soooo delicious. They filled me up so much with the free chips and salsa and those spicy carrots and jalapenos that I couldn't start on my burrito. The burrito looked so delicious but I knew if I forced it down...I would further regret coming to FiliB's. One mistake at a time. I would save the burrito for the next day and microwave it. Luckily, my fridge gets cold enough to freeze and my freezer gets cold enough to ruin food in. My friend said his burrito was good too. The sauce though...we came in super late, it was so watery from sitting all day. I bet it would've been way better in the morning or lunch.
