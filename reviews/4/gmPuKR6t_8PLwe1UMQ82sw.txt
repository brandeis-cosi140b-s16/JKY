Whenever I'm in Phoenix this is my first and last stop. If you want quality Mexican food, good bar scene and an overall cool place to hang out with good food, the teepee is your place! Fajitas are tasty! Oh and their chips and salsa do not disappoint...which should always be a staple for Mexican food!
