From our experience on July 5, 2014 I would say Barrio Queen is a good restaurant, and would recommend you try it.  We arrived just before 6 PM and were seated immediately.  We were brought their great chips, bean dip, and water right away.  Our server was right there with menus and asking for our drink orders.  The service continued to be perfect for the entire experience.

All three of us loved our dinners.  I had "Chilies En Nogada" ($24).  It was probably the best dish I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  This is one of their "signature" dishes.  Treat yourself.  You won't regret it.

My wife had Suizas Con Chorizo Enchiladas ($15.50) and it was very good too.  Our friend had the Arizona Burrito ($11), which she said was good too.  I had their Reina Sangria which was one of the better Sangrias I've had ($8).  The Dos XX Amber draft beer was only $3, which is a good price for a beer these days.

Overall we liked everything about the Barrio Queen, except maybe the Mexican music, and that ugly industrial concrete and bare pipe ceiling. 

We would go back.  In our opinion the food is a cut above most Mexican restaurants.
