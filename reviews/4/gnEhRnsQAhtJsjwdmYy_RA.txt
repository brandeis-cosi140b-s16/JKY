Honey, order the Pollo Rotisado.  I've been eating chicken all my life, but I never knew chicken could taste so good.

The Mexican Risotto and Queso Flameado did it for me, too.  Their iced tea is good and they have Splenda.  I'm into it.

The decor is great.  The location is fun if you're early & get a chance to wander around the huge World Market Center and decorate and redecorate both the home you have and your dream home over and over in your mind.  A nice way to work up an appetite.  Once we arrived to actually eat dinner, the service by everyone was fabulous.  The chef was very kind and accomodating and came out to speak with a woman about to order who didn't "like spice" and come up with something that would be to her liking.  No overinflated ego despite chicken-cooking superpowers.

A couple bummers:
-Too little of that delicious sauce with the chicken.
-Didn't like the chips nor any of the three accompanying salsas.
-Nothing special about the carnitas.
-With such amazing fillings, it's a bummer the tortillas (both corn and flour) didn't taste made on site (even if they were.  I don't know.).
-We didn't get the warmest welcome when we entered the restaurant for the very first time behind another group of people only to be snapped at by a cranky waiter whose only words to us were, "We're not open yet".  OK.  This being our first visit and seeing several people enter before us, we thought we'd make a dinner reservation.  We turned around and left (didn't make a reservation) and almost didn't return after such a terrible first impression.  That dude needs some serious training and we were so happy to not be seated in his section when we returned.

Still, there's no doubt I will be back.  I'll avoid that waiter again & order that delicious chicken again.  I think this place will only get better.  Be prepared to pay a pretty penny for the experience (but Restaurant.com or 3oclockclub.com can make it a little easier).
