These guys make some really good Sonoran food and this is their original location. It all started with a small Hot Dog cart outside and now they are rocking throughout the valley with several locations.

Came here for the Sonoran Dogs and was not disappointed. They are made to perfection and the buns they use are delicious. It is hard not to eat at least a couple of dogs and maybe sneak down a third. Nice!

They have a giant menu with tons of the standard Sonoran favorites. The salsa bar is very fresh and you can load up with as much as you want. I like the fact that the salsas have some good flavor with a few having more heat than others.

Service is very friendly and on my first visit they took the extra time to explain the most popular items as well as their daily specials. The inside is also very clean and the food comes out rather quickly. Best part is that they are very close to my work. See ya there around lunchtime. I'll be the one with the big smile. ESTOY LISTO!
