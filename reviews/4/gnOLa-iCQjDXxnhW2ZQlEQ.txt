This place was really nice! My niece and I were hungry around 3 pm on Saturday. We stopped in here for some lunch.

The decor is awesome. I loved the colors, the lights, and all the light fixtures. The booth was roomy and comfy. 

Our waitress was over right away with yummy chips & salsa. We figured out what we wanted for lunch - shredded beef enchiladas for me, carnitas street tacos for my niece. The food took awhile to come out, considering there weren't many people in the restaurant.

The food was worth the wait! My shredded beef enchiladas were some of the juiciest, most flavorful enchiladas I have ever had. There was a perfect amount of cheese, and the green sauce was really delicious.

The rice was really bland, and the beans were just alright. But the enchiladas themselves were amazing. My niece also enjoyed her tacos. Great portions, good prices.
