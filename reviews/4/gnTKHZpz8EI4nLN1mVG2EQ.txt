I visit La Canasa several times a week, a week mainly due to their proximity to my office. Luckily their food is pretty decent as are their prices.

If you are going here for lunch you may want to avoid arriving right at 12pm as the line out the door can be quite long. For lunch you order at the counter, and take a number to your seat, and they bring you your food. Tipping seems to be optional in format of dining. 

Another unique aspect is their Chips and Salsa bar. It contains the usual corn tortilla chips and the delectable flour tortilla chips. If you have never had flour tortilla chips you are in for a surprise.

The menu consists of the usual Mexican fast foods, burritos of all types, tacos, enchiladas and plates. There are also soups and some authentic items for the brave. For lunch you may want to look at the a la carte menu and save a few dollars unless you are huge fan of rice and beans. Another money saving tip is to forgo the drink as their soft drinks cost upwards of $2

I often order the chillie relleno burrito. It is a item I try everywhere as it has many different recipes. Here the burrito has the obligatory chillie filled with cheese covered in a very eggy egg batter and a hot red salsa mix heavy on the peppers. If you like your food "enchilada style" you can order it this way for an extra charge or simple walk over to the salsa bar and smother your burrito with salsa.
