Fantastic experience while stopping over in the Phoenix airport.  Husband had the burrito with rice and beans... Very filling and delicious. I had the carne asada tacos with born tortilla shells. Absolutely delicious!  Clean restaurant, prompt and courteous service, and excellent food. We'll certainly return!
