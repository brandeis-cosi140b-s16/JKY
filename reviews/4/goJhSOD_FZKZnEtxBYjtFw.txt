I went there today and actually really liked it. They bring chips and salsa for appetizer. The chips were ok. They brought 3 different salsas, and the green one was by far the best one.  We ordered for dinner the steak diablo and the shrimp fajitas. we both really liked the steak diablo. It was a skirt steak with sauce that was really flavorful. I was surprised at how much i liked it. The shrimp fajitas were good, but not as good as the steak. Also, although I"m a corn tortilla fan, their flour tortillas tasted better (they offer both). 

The place is a little pricey, especially if you're going to drink alcohol. I didn't try any, but margaritas start at 7 dollars.

The ambiance and decoration in the restaurant is nice, and we were surprised that a texmex restaurant would be playing non-stop salsa while we were there, but I don't mind as I prefer to hear that.

It's definitely not authentic Mexican food, but I did enjoy my meal, and might go back for it.
