Well you know, there's times you need something south of the border. So I visited Cabo's at the Fe. Not bad, was what I expected. If I wanted something more authentic there are several to be found. But  there are plenty of times when an imitation will do just fine. I got the unlimited tacos and was happy with my meal.
