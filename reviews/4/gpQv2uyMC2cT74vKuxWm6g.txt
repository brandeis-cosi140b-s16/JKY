We walked into Halo (piercing shop downtown) and they handed us some pamphlets...
One of them was a map with all the cool/hip spots downtown and we realized we hadn't been to many of them. So we Decided to go to all of the ones listed and cross em out.
And, this was our first stop. 

I'm gonna start off by saying how much i like the vibe of this place, especially the outside seating on a sunny day.
The food was so yummy.
And, I normally don't like going to eat Mexican food other than my own Mom's kitchen because I am Hispanic and extremely picky.

I really love their carne tacos and quesadillas..
Their beans(lard free) are my favorite. 
The horchata is not that powdery crap.
It's home made. 
I really do love this place.
I've been here a few times already and also brought my parents who loved the place as well.

The only thing I will say is that -if you want to get completely full, it is a bit pricey.

I tend to crave this food a lot, and I'm glad I finally found a lil taco shop that met my standards.


Way to go America!
