It's not the best carne asada I've had, but it is heaped on generously to your fries.  You will also get an equally generous portion of guacamole, and all the ingredients that make up the carne asada fries.  Its prices are fair enough for how much food you get as well.  From what I understand, the other Roberto's locations do a better job, but this wasn't bad at all.
