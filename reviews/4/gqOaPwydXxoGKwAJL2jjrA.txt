We went here with some friends.  Didn't ever hear of it.  We got there, nothing fancy.  Sat down and they served us up some salsa and chips.  The tomatillo (green) salsa was sent from heaven.  The red salsa and bean dip were " 'ight", nothing special.  Back to the green stuff...it comes in the smaller container, ask for a bigger one, the stuff is hella good.  Now, I get the Fajita Burro (chicken) everytime.  I got the popular shrimp dish once, it was good, but I'm sticking with the Fajita Burro.  I like this place more than a popular Mesa restaurant that rhymes with "Ria Tosas".  The food here doesn't taste too smokey.  I come back often.
