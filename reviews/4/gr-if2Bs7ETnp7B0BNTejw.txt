Cocina Real is about 10 minutes walking distance from my home and I eat there often. Been going there for 10 years. They offer reliably good, not great, Mexican food for a reasonable price.

I usually have enchiladas or one of the seafood specials. One of my particular favorites is the Enchiladas Sonora, which has smoked chicken, spinach, poblano peppers, and pinto beans with verde sauce. 

A recent addition to the menu is a soup that has broiled shrimp, chicken, rice, and fresh slices of avocado. I REALLY like that. It's medium spicy so it probably isn't for everyone's taste.

My next project is to test fire all their chicken entrees. 

This place isn't particularly fancy but I have found it to be a good value for the money. I've always had good service too, but I usually come on Monday evenings when it isn't particularly busy, either.
