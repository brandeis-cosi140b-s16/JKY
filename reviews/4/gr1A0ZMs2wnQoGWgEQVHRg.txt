We were at the Wynn for a conference.  On the last day, we decided to walk across to the mall and saw this restaurant.  They have a cute outdoor seating area with makeshift trees.  We were the first ones there around 11 AM and were seated promptly.  Our waitress was very friendly and constantly kept checking on us.

We ordered the following:
- Fresh-made Guacamole: DELICIOUS.  We had it made medium spicy and it was so good.  They give you a good portion, enough for 3-4 people.
- Bottomless Chips and Salsa: The three salsas served are delicious.  Along with the salsa comes a huge order of chips.  You will not ask for a second round.  Its enough for 3-4 people.  Must have.
- Vegetarian Tacos:  The soft tacos are tiny, served with rice, brown beans, salsa, and veggies.  I loved the tacos.  I was too full from the chips, but I still managed to eat at least 3 tacos.

We were in a rush to catch a flight, so the lunch was rushed.  We didn't get to see the dessert options.  But since our conference is an annual affair, we will surely be back next time we are in Vegas.  Definitely worth a try.
