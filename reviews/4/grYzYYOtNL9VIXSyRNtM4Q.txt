La Perla is a restaurant that has been through many changes.  Some were good and some were bad.  In fact I think the food changes daily as well as the prices.  There was a time when I wouldn't step in the place, and there were other times when i couldn't have enough.  This is my second favorite of the old Glendale restaurants.  Their chips and salsa are outstanding.  I love their tacos and enchiladas as well as their rice and beans.  Every once in a while the food is sometimes a little off or burnt, but overall still very good.  Just a warning sometimes the food can be greasy and other times it can be VERY greasy.  It is all very flavorful and I would recommend it.
