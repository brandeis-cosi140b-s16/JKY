thankfully it's warm enough in the desert to eat outside, with the aid of heating lamps. the house margarita is sublime, the horny isn't that bad looking either. i loved their mushrooms & tortillas. while there, the bartender convinced me to have some partida tequila. i sniffed, ogled &  proceeded to let the smoothness trickle down. great staff- they're really accommodating.
