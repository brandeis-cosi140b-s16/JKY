I need to make one thing clear: this place is good. Apparently my first review gave the wrong impression, as if I was unhappy with this place. Well, consider the 4-star rating then. That's good! And consider the 4-star rating now. Even better, considering I've been back several times!

You should check this place out if you're in the area. The service is fantastic, and you'll be supporting a local business. How refreshing. 

There's something on the menu for everyone, including a tasty chilero salad for those watching their calories. I always order the shrimp quesadilla, though, with the side of raspberry chipotle sauce. It's addicting, and I find myself craving Chilero's from time to time. It's just one entree I'll never grow tired of eating... In fact, I'm craving it now!

Hey, the last time I went with the family, it was my suggestion to come here! So, yes, this is a great option for anyone in or near Mesa who likes Mexican food done well and served by friendly people who actually have a vested interest in the success of the business. You'll get top-notch service in a charming establishment. So go. Please. Support local businesses!
