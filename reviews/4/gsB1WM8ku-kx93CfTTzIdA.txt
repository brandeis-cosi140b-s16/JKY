This is one of the best Mexican food's I have ever eaten, I aint no expert on Mexican food especially since I dont eat no meat, but I do droll over Mexican food and like I told someone who asked me what my most fav food in America was and I said, Mexcian (ironically, get it?). Anyway this place has great food, the alcohol is cheap as well. Get the bucket of coronas. They make their own homemade salsa everyday and oh their beans r excellento! It would have been 5/5 if not for the ambiance, which just to be sure is good, but nothing out of the box. It gives a authentic mexican feel though. The staff are friendly and will make you want to come back for sure again.
