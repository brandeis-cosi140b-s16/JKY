Ok, for those of you who like going to chain restaurants, this is not your place. Also, if you're looking for white tablecloth and Vogue-ish ambiance, go to PF changs (yuck). This place is for weddings, family gatherings, just simple good food, morning noon and night, and amazing drinks.

We went for breakfast, because I love a good Mexican breakfast, but they're impossible to find here.

John had juevos rancheros and they were lovely.
I had the eggs and ham and it was perfect.

Great departure from the typical diner breakfast. Perfect for a hangover, because there's a full bar, and they will give you a bloody Mary.

The wrinkle, is that breakfast is served weekends only till noon. We walked in a half an hour late and they accommodated us. ;)

Their claim to fame is the taco lunch buffet. ~we didn't stick around for that. I can also imagine there would be some good salsa dancing in this place late nights.

From the outside it looks like a tiny storefront. But it's huge inside and mellow, like everyone there was there the night before and the moonlight hasn't brushed off yet.
