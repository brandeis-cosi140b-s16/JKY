I have grown up on Jordan's and it is like home food to me.  When I am out of town, I miss it and crave it.  In fact it's often my first stop if coming from the airport.  With that being said, it is not for everyone.  The restaurant is kind of dumpy and the food a bit pricey for what you get.  Luckily, I have converted my best friend to a Jordan's lover and we go there at least once a month.  My husband is still resisting, even after more than 15 years of being dragged there. 

The hot sauce is spicey and tomatoey.  The cheese they use on the cheese crisps is so gooey and good!  My friend loves the salsa, but you have to specifically ask for it, as they always default to the hot sauce.  The service is usually good and I know most of the staff.  There have been some times when it wasn't so good, but it's not the norm.  Personally, I would give 5 stars, but I am writing this for people who have never been and I don't know that a Jordan's virgin would have the same love for it that I do.
