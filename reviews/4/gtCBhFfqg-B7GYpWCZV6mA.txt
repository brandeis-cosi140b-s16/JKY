As far as Chipotles go, this one is pretty solid as long as you don't go during a "busy" time. When we go at the off times (e.g., after 6:30 pm, between 1 and 4), service and good quality are spectacular. If you go during a busy time, the staff often seems stressed, and the food just doesn't seem as hot or fresh. That being said, my husband and I are typically satisfied and come here frequently. Parking and cleanliness are always up to par, and there is both indoor and outdoor seating, which is nice for the warmer months.
