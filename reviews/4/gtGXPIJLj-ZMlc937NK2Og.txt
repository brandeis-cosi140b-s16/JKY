If this place is average it's only because you've lived in Arizona your whole life and have been spoiled by great Mexican food. They have the best salsa HANDS DOWN! The bean burro enchilada style is awesome and so is the green burro. It's old school though and not a hipster place. If you want solid Mexican food at a good price this is your place.
