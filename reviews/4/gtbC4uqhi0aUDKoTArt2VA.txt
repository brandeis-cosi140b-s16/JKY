I used to go to the 7th st location until it closed, while I find that to be a TOTAL bummer (bartender had a heavy hand & there were lots of the regular servers)  I do very much enjoy the salsa at this location better.  It is chunkier and fresher tasting.  I feel like the enchiladas are a bit smaller at this location and they don't use quite as much spice on their machaca, but regardelss the food here is good.  Yes, it is "Americanized" but 90% of the places in az are, its all good.. you just have to find the tasty "Americanized" mexican food places and Manuels happens to be one of them.  The hostess is always personable, which is great and makes a nice first impression.  Service is hit and miss, but the food is good and the price is right.
