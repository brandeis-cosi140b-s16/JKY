My husband had lunch here today. I had sizzling chicken breasts with mashed potatoes, both were good especially the potatoes, I am kind of a snob about good mashed potatoes. My husband had the salmon with Jasmine rice, he said it was good. Would come again, plates ran around $11. Sports Bar atmosphere, but during middle day quiet and good music playing in background.
