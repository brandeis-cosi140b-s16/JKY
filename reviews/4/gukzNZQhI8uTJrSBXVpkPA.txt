Always a fan of Chipotle.  This place had some service issues when they first opened, but that has changed since then, so they get the 4 star review. :)

What's really cool about this place is that they have the "pre-order pickup window".  LOVE that.  Very convenient for the corporates (like myself) that order in advance online, want to run in, get it and go back to your meetings.
