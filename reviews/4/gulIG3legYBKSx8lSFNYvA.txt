Manuel's is consistent. Service is fast and friendly. Chips are warm and salsa is satisfying. When I worked closer, I'd come regularly for work lunch. We would time them bc food came out so quickly. Record time from server walking away with our order to returning with our food was 4min 53sec! Food is nothing that will wow you but if you're looking for a filling, mediocre Mexican meal (which I often am), Manuel's is a must. 

Also, they just finished their remodel. Bigger bar and brighter atmosphere.
