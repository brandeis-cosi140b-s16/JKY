On my way home and wanted something more than fast food. Loved the rugged, distressed look of the place - like a beach side restaurant in Mexico. Large quantity of food for the price. Had the pork burrito (it was good), but will try something else due to the responses of others on yelp. Unlimited chips/salsa bar was great also. Will be back!
