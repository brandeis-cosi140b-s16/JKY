I eat at Mucho Gusto quite often with clients/potential clients. The lunch menu is very reasonably priced and has a great selection. I really like the chips and salsa delivered while you wait. I gave this a 4/5 because the wait is longer than normal once you put in your order. Other than that, it's great!
