Chico's is within easy biking distance from my house, so we end up going here when we're starving and not wanting to drive any place. 

I always load up on the california veggie burrito and my roommate loves the taco salad. We usually end up sharing as there is always way too much food! 

One complaint - can't we get some ACTUALLY spicy salsa?
