My review comes after 3 separate occasions where I have had the chance to eat here.  The first was not so overwhelming as I was disappointed my check was charged an 18%  gratuity for lack-luster service.  In addition to that, there was a space to add a gratuity as if it had not already been added....very underhanded.

The food on this winter Sunday morning made up for the billing issue.  We had a group of friends meet there for breakfast on a Sunday and ended up staying for over three hours.  Honestly my memory fails me of the dish I ordered but finishing it was not a problem as it was quite good.  In fact, everyone there was happy if not impressed with their choices. 

The 2nd venture there was with my best friend Melissa.  We were limited on time and called ahead for our lunch to be eaten there.  When we walked in, sure enough, our food was waiting for us on the table, covered with foil to keep it hot.  Simple lunch specials but delicious nonetheless.  Mel and I we quite impressed they took the time to follow through with the order , get it right, keep it hot and make us feel so valued when in fact they had no idea who was coming to dinner.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up for the service!

Visit #3 was again with Melissa and also for lunch.  This time we were not so hard pressed to get out of there so we were able to relax a chat up the place.  Very simpleton in the decor department but I am not there to be impressed with a pretty picture.  Does the food taste authentic and would I eat there again....these are the real questions.  

The answers are YES and YES!  Delicious, hot, reasonably fast and a place I will be going back to soon.  The lunch specials are cheap, filling and worth a repeat visit!  Comparing it to some other Mexican places in the immediate area, this one is one of the betters ones, hands down. 

Enjoy!
