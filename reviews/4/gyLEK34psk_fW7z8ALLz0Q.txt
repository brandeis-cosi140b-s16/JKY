This was one of the first Mexican food places I tried when I first moved to AZ ten years ago.  Back then I knew nothing, now I see that I was lucky to have been taken somewhere that would really get me interested in trying more Mexican restaurants.

Well after about 8 years I went back last night and had it again and I was impressed.  The beans were a little bland but that is about the only complaint I have.  The salsas were fresh and delicious as was the tortilla on my fish burrito. I could have just eaten a couple of the tortillas with the salsa.   My boyfriend got three hard shell beef tacos and it was only $3.49 and it came with chips. So not only was it tasty, it was cheap.  It is close to the freeway so even though I don't live very close I will be going back soon.
