I work down the street from this place, and I like to sometimes pop over here after work to take food home. On most occasions, I buy a ton of food and invite the parental units over to share in bountiful amounts of chicken, beans, rice, sweet potato fries (my favorite!) and cole slaw (my second favorite!)... and, if it's a real cheat day - churros (2 for $1!)

First of all, I'm going to assume you haven't been to EPL before. Allow me to tell you what's the haps here: their only protein is chicken. So they have chicken bowls, burritos, breasts, salads... all sorts of meals, but with just chicken. No steak or anything awesome like that, though for a glorious short white they had carne asada... Anyway. They have a lot of sides that go with the chicken, such as rice, beans, sweet potato fries, cole slaw, steamed veggies, tortillas, mashed potatoes... good stuff. 

One of the more "classic" EPL elements is their salsa bar, where they have different kinds of salsa you can serve yourself. I love the classic Pico De Gallo, though the Avocado sauce is good, too. If you've been to Baja Fresh, then you understand the concept. 

In terms of how good their chicken is, it's pretty good. It's not the most delicious or the most tender ever, but it's consistently good. I usually end up getting the Ultimate Pollo Bowl, but I've lately been going for the Ultimate Burrito. They're both pretty substantial meals, even for a huskier gentleman like myself, and do a pretty good job of filling me up. 

Cost-wise, I think it's really fair. On my last trip (7/8/2011) I bought the following: one classic chicken burrito, one ultimate burrito, a 12-pc family deal that came with four sides, and six churros for $25 after using a coupon I had for $5 off. Not a bad deal. That was enough food for four full-sized males and two grown-up ladies, with enough food left over to create two small meals. Not a bad deal, right?
