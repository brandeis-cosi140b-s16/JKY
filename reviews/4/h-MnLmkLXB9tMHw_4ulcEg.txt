I pass by this place weekly, but it was only my second visit.  I just wanted to pick up a burrito for later.  I'm all about a simple dish, so I got the bean burrito with cheese.  Granted, my family is filled with great cooks, but the beans were so good!  Just a yum dish, I cant wait to try other items.  Just wish place was bigger!!!!
