such a RANDOM gem to find on the strip! 

pros:
- $1 margaritas! come on... whats not to like about that? for the price of ONE drink at any other vegas you can get completely drunk at the tequila bar and grill! the margarita was great! they dont skimp on the booze, and seriously, 4 or 5 of these little babies and youll get an awesome buzz going
- $1 tacos! 
- nachos!!! for $14 you get enough nachos to feed 4 drunk girls and get them FULL. we asked for it to go and the server said, well, its kind of big, it fills lot of to go boxes. we were like, whatevs, give us nachos! ... the plate - or, i should say PLATTER of nachos and filled 3 large to go boxes to the brim!!! 
- $2 tequila shots! ... tequila and i are enemies, but $2 for a shot? really? where else can you get $2 shots of anything on the strip???

cons:
- poor service: we went around 9pm and it was PACKED. took us forever to order, and even longer to get our food
- self seating... for some reason i dont understand the logic of restaurants who use this method. its chaotic! since parties are self seating and theyre not spread out evenly amongst the wait staff, often times the wait staff fall behind and are ALWAYS busy. took me forever just to flag our server time every time we needed something. if i flagged someone down who wasnt our server, theyd say, sorry, ask your server. they didnt seem to care cause they werent working for your tip.
