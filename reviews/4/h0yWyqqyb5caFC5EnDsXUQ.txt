Armando's is SO good... way better than any of the other drive through options in the area.  They have out-of-this-world breakfast burritos (I usually get the Armando's Special; eggs, potatoes, bacon, cheese)...and they're HUGE.  I usually eat half in the morning and half later for a snack.  
For lunch; don't pass up the carne asada tacos; delicious.  
Everything is really well priced, too - pass up the chains and give Armando's a shot.  It's well worth it!
