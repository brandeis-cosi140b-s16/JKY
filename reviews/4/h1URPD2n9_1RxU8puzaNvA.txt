So the mission to find amazing authentic Mexican food in Vegas brought me here (as well as some rec's from other yelpers) and I gotta say- I was not disappointed. From the minute you walk in you're transported back to Mexico. They have different counters to place your order. I tried the carne asada fries and they were AMAZING!! They have 2 options- the $5 and the $10 fries- they're they same thing it's just a difference of size. The fries have carne asada, guacamole, cheese (mountains of it!! :D) and this amazing green sauce which I couldn't quite figure it out. It was pretty frickin awesome..I'll def be back to check out the other food.
