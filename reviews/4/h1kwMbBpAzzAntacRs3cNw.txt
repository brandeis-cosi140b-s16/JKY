I've never been here and not seen a giant line and thought "oh great, there better be some gauc when I get up there," I'm a patient person can't you tell?

People of Yelp, the line will move. And it will move fast. At most its taken taken minutes to get from the end to check out. Know your order people.

White or brown rice? You can choose, the white race is where it is at

Pinto or black beans? You can get both for no extra charge

Fajita vegetables? I pass

Salsa? ALLOFTHEM

Order online and beat the line, there are a couple reserved parking spaces in the front if you order via the app.
