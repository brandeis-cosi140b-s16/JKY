The food was a little pricey for why you get- I got the lobster taco and I had barely enough lobster for the three tortillas they gave me. It was delicious though and the free chips and salsa definitely helped their case. They were good and our server was very attentive to keep refilling them. My boyfriend for the loaded nachos with the hottest fire sauce on the side, it was really good! Overall, the name draws you in and the food and service are good but they should rethink their prices. The portion for the nachos was good but I think the tacos should've been cheaper.
