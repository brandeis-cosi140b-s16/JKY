I came with my wife and baby at 230 and ordered 3 tacos and it came with a side I never got the happy hour menu and I really wish the waiter informed that it was happy hour before I ordered. Besides that my server was really busy and I could tell. But the food was amazing 5 stars. That happy hour menu is one of the best I've ever seen. The atmosphere is fun and trendy kind of had that 80's cool vibe.
