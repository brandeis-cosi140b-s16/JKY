Chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat when i'm looking for an affordable filling meal. I love the variety of ingredients and choices you have to eat. I would consider the restaurant an American-Mexican Restaurant. The food is really tasty and well seasoned but, if you don't go during busy hours then your burrito or food of choice will be cold and not as pleasing. When ever i go out to eat, Chipotle is the restaurant i always visit.
