I have enjoyed the Desnudo Taco Nights inside of Moon Doggies before the restaurant opened up next door.  I am so happy I can now have their delicious tacos any night of the week!

We ordered the California Burrito, Chips and Salsa, Sauteed Vegetables, and a side of beans. 

While everything we ordered that day was fantastic, the sauteed veggies were INCREDIBLE! Definitely choose the vegetables over the beans.
