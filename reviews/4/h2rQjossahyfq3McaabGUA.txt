I travel a ton for work and make it a point to visit the best burger joints in town. I had the special which is called the 1st date and it comes with garlic, mozzarella, Parmesan and 1/4 pound patty. I also ordered the sweet potato tots. The tots were fantastic and the burger was solid. I judge a burger on the quality of the meat and according to the guy at the register, they use a local 80/20 mix.  It was very good quality. My only complaint is the size and price.  It was $15 for a burger and tots. That's quite pricey for a 1/4 pound burger and what I perceive as a small order of tots. It was super busy so maybe I'm the only one that cares about value.
