We stopped here on a drive from San Diego to Phoenix. The outside is very run down. I was worried. The food is good, definitely home made. The carnitas tacos were good. Her pico was good too. My son had the chicken enchilada kids meal with rice and beans and he loved all of it. 

The service was great. Very friendly. For Gila Bend, it's good. I would eat here again.
