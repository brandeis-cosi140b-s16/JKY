We were in town for a graduation & found Sabor on Yelp. We were not disappointed. We made a last minute lunch reservation for a party of 11 and they graciously accommodated us.

The service was great and the food was delicious! The food is a nod to traditional Mexican dishes. It was elegant and flavorful along the lines of Mary Sue Miliken & Susan Finiger's Border Grill Restaurants. The mole dish was great as were the imaginative salads. Lots of great options for the vegetarians in our group.

Locals please patronize this restaurant so us out-of- towners can get some wonderful Latin food in Henderson! :)
