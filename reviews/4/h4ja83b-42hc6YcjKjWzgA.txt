I would like to give a huge thumbs up to this location.  I go in for my lunch break which is one hour and they always get me in and out on time.  There lunch menu is awesome, everything I have tried on it is delicious.  I love the chicken chimichanga.  I just want to say thank you for great food and impeccable service.
