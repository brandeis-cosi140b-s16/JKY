Had a thoughly good experience here on a Saturday night while in town.  Came for a late dinner and the place was pretty busy so we waited about 25 minutes for a table.  Ordered the tableside guacamole with pomegrante seeds which passed for above average.  However, the mole torta was superb as were the filled churros.  I understand it was a Saturday night, but for the price point I expected a bit more attention from our waitress.
