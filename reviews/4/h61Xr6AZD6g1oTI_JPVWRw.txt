Tried this place last Thursday after attempt to two other Mexican restaurant failed.

My friend wanted Mexican food, so we went to La Cosina first.  When we arrived at 7:44pm, the waitress informed us that we can only do to food.  We wanted to dine in so we went to El Mexicano on eastern.  They were out of business.  

Then I remembered that there was a mexican restaurant super close to where my friend lives, so we made a loop back to where he lives. 

We walked in and realize that El Picante closes at 8:30, and it's already 8.  My friend ask the person in front (we think he is the owner) if we may dine in.  He said "Oh, it's still early!"  I thought he was like the nicest person.

Food
-Pork Tamales:  I have been looking for a good tamales for quite some time, and I found it here.  The pork has so much flavor inside of these corn meal.  
-Three chicken taquitos topped with shredded cheese, guac, pico, served with your choice of black beans or refried with rice.  Yummmyyy.

Service:
