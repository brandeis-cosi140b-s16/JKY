The first time I had Rubio's ever was about 6 months ago in Casa Grande.  Now I'm hooked.  Love the original fish taco, and now I'm also really enjoying the shrimp salsa verde tacos that I think are out for a limited time only.  So fresh and delicious!  This particular location has very friendly staff, and when we were there over the weekend one employee was moving tables and scrubbing the walls and floor.  The joint was clean anyway, but how often do you see an employee taking the time to do a deep clean?  A lot of places I visit I don't even want to look at the floor/wall/behind the chairs.  Best to stay in the dark, but this place is as clean as it can be.  

I also like the choices on the salsa bar and the fact that I can get a cold adult beverage to have with my tacos.   I've never had a bad visit to a Rubio's.  Definitely a fan.
