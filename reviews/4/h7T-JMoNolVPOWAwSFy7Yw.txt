I have been a fan of Rosa's since it was an unknown hole-in-the-wall. No longer unknown -- nearly any time of day finds the place packed -- and occupying several times the space it started with, Rosa's could still technically qualify as a "hole." But no mater; the food at Rosa's is about as good as Mexican gets. Housed in a run down Mesa strip-mall, this unlikely epicurean delight serves traditional Sonora-style Mexican food, topped with five different kinds of homemade salsa (watch out for the  habanero --it will strip the enamel off your teeth). 

But it's the soft tacos that are Rosa's real glory: beef, pork, and chicken are marinated in fruit juices and herbs for 12 hours, slowly oven-baked for another 10, then shredded and charbroiled. And the fish taco is in a class by itself. Mmm... I think a taco run is in order...

I only deducted a star because the wait can be very long and therefore the service slow. But I'd love Rosa's if I had to wait all day!
