If you're looking for some good, cheap eats outside of the strip, I highly recommending going to this joint. Its a bit out of the strip so I'll look a lot more ghetto, but it's well worth the trip. I was there for a Sunday dinner and boy was it packed. There is plenty of parking. There is a lot of booths and seats, but getting a open booth can be difficult when its busy. Another thing that I didn't like was how to order. There are three lines, but each line you can only order certain stuff. I hope they would change this up soon.

If you're looking for a burrito, tough luck. They don't have any here. I decided to try the carne asada fries to go with my tongue, beef and oyo tacos. The meats were fresh and very comparable to something I can get in LA and San Diego. The carne asada fries were really good. The portions were huge, and I liked how they cut the meat. Most places the meat is cut into really small pieces; however, they give prretty big pieces here.

The service here is pretty good. The people serving you are pretty friendly and the cashier was really helpful. I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but they really need to improve on how the food is ordered. Other than that, I really enjoyed my dinner here.
