When I asked coworkers about the best Mexican food in Maricopa they said Headquarters was the spot.  So I had to go and see for myself.

The place is totally my speed.  Small.  Dive-y.  All wood err'thang.  Curt and irritated waitresses who are only there to get your order and your food.  I could see them being rude and terrible but on the day I went they were quick with the food and refills.

The chips and salsa were pretty decent.  I like hot but I don't base judgment on hot.  It's just my preference.  The salsa was tasty but for my tastes could have been hotter.  

Prices are way reasonable.  I think it was cheap.  

Mostly all locals, workers on break for lunch, families.  Only two larger booths, the rest were four-seaters.  

I didn't even have Mexican food.  The night before I'd eaten at Poncho's on S. Central.  Day before that I had a local burrito.  So I wasn't feeling any more Mexican. 

However, most everyone at my table ordered Mexican.  I saw a huge Chimi, a taco plate, an enchilada plate and huevos rancheros.  All looked good.  The enchilada plate, my wife ordered, was a tad cheesy for me.  

I ordered the El Diablo burger which a basic green chile/cheese burger.  It was great, greasy and hot.  The chile wasn't hot but the sandwich was.  Fries were homemade.  

I'm putting it in the rotation.
