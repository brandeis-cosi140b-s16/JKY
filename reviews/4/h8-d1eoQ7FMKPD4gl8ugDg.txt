I love hole in the wall finds. I can't take credit for this find as my boyfriend took me here one afternoon for lunch. But, I think he knows that I'm a sucker for outdoor dining. Plus, it was gorgeously sunny outside. We both ordered some grub... I think I had a chicken burrito on my first visit. 

This place is cash only, which is a huge pain in the butt these days. They do have an ATM in house, but it charges you a couple bucks to take out your cash.
