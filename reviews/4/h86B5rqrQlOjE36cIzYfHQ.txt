Whew! I didn't get sick! 

Years ago I became majorly sick from a Del Taco. Then a few months after that at a different location I got sick again and it was probably one of the worse food poisoning I've had. Sad to say, I've had a handful of food poisoning experiences, but it's because I'm food adventurous and it's just a hazard of travel. 

I've avoided this plague for years. My BF avoided it as well because of the 2 times he also got sick. 

Leave it to kids to not cook your food right....specially when dealing with chicken.

I saw on Yelp though when it comes to talking about fast food, this kept popping up. I know that fast food is nothing great, but in my area I have very few late night choices and one is a Del Taco. I got curious if it was maybe better than I remembered?

We decided to give it a try again. 

I got some del carbon tacos and a chicken burrito. Not bad at all. It has real chunks of chicken instead of that "cafeteria" style chicken that was minced and reconstituted into a chicken strip with fake grill marks which is a plus. 

I can't quite say I'm a "fan" yet, but it's A-OK. 

I'll leave them a positive rating though for not poisoning me though.
