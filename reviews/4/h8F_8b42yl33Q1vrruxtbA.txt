I have been to Macayo's before and gave it a bad review which You can see in my profile but this time was the complete opposite. I was a little thrown off by the crazy shirts the staff wear but the place was packed and that is normally a great sign. We went with a few friends and we were seated relatively quick. 

Now to the reason that a star was lost. Our waitress came around the corner wearing her party animal shirt like everyone else which you would think would put you in an amazing mood, but instead she came around the corner like a communist leader demanding our order and being super impatient and not at all welcoming.. Once we gave Mrs. Marx our order she disappeared and did not come back until the food was ready.  
(Pow, One star Gone)

The Saving Grace here was the quality of the chicken Chimichanga that was brought to the table, first of all it was the size of a small baby and second it was probably one of the best chimichangas I have ever had. To me it says something when the food you serve can overpower the horrid service that your servers provide. 

I think we will go back from time to time I am just hoping that we dont get Cruella the waitress again.
