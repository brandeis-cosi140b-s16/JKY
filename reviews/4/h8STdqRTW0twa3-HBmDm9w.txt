Always passed by this place but never stopped in until now... Typical Mexican ambiance.  We didn't wait too long until someone came up to us to take our drinks. The menu has a variety of entrees and appetizers. My son ordered from the kids menu: beef taco. I ordered the  chicken enchiladas. My son's looked like an adult meal. Mine was enough and I couldn't eat all of it. I'm not much of a hot and spicy person and it wasn't spicy but they did add some spicy peppers on the side, which I tried but no thanks. The food is pretty good here. The food tastes fresh. If you order Nachos your order will come swiftly as that is what they have readily. The other orders will take a normal cooking time. The only gripe was that we came on a Sunday around 3:00, and it wasn't too busy from what I could see. The service was a bit slow at the end with my check. No big deal but thought to mention it. Christine? was our waitress and she was very good. We will go there again :)
