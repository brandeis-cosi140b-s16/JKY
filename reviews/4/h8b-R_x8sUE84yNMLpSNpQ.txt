What a fun place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo with the family.  Chips and salsa to start and then came the Margaita.  I really needed that one.  I enjoyed my chili rellenos and the rest of the family seemed to polish off their plates.  Of course some shared which was a good idea because there is a lot of tasty morsels on each plate.  

What would Cinco de Mayo be without music? No need to worry as  El Zocalo had live music  which was great.  A few of us brave ones or maybe drunk ones got up a buggied.  I would  say this was a fun place to enjouy the company, food, drinks and music on this very special evening.
