I have past this place every single day during my yearly stay in Vegas. I always wanted to try it, but didn't know how the heat would affect my dining experience seated at the patio. 

It was surprisingly a great experience and great food. You have a blocked view of the Bellagio water but I just loved watching crowds and crowds of people pass by. The band was great.

I received my free margarita upon checking-in on yelp. Margarita was very strong. I ordered the "Jack & Coke BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger" I have to tell you I wasn't expecting anything great but the first bite I fell in love with this Burger. I finished everything on the plate including fries which were also great.

Next time, I will be trying the Jack & Coke Ribs
