This place doesn't seem to be too popular with my Yelp pals, but I like it. I don't have a Cafe Rio too close to my house, so I'll admit that it's not something I'd choose as a regular dining destination.  However, this location is a convenient option for my work week when I don't bring anything from home and when I need a break from the crazy chicken place. My usual order is the shredded chicken breast enchiladas with black beans and rice. I'm also a fan of their freshly made tortillas.  Service has been efficient and friendly plus I've never had to wait in a long line, something that's very important when you're short on time.  I'll continue to be a fan as long as they keep serving up decent food in a timely manner--gracias!
