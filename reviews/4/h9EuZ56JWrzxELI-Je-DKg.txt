Bottom line-food excellent and restaurant kind of gross.  We opted to take our food out.  Possibly the best Mexican I've ever had. Beware of the soda machines-the dispenser stuck, so I ended up getting some hibiscus soda on my pants :(


Anyway, excellent food that you can bring home or make a picnic of it.
