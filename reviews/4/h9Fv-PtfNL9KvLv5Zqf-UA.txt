I've been here before for a taco crawl and been meaning to go back. What I had during the crawl was solid and one of the better stands we visited. When we were with a group of friends at a downtown bar, I took the opportunity to suggest capping the night with some tacos. 

So it's not the gentrified part of downtown and is a much more colorful crowd, but calm the fuck down you will be fine. Soon enough they are opening a actual brick and mortar across from the Cardenas market on Decatur and Meadows Ln. While they are building the interior, they have a stand in the parking lot up and running so you can try them there as well. 

Tacos are $2 and they also do basics like tortas, burritos, quesadilla, etc.One of the few stands that take cards ($5 minimum to use credit/debit). 

I got pastor tacos which were solid like last time. A bit of char crispy bits, the seasoning was good on them and has grease, but not too greasy that it's gross. They dont ask you if you want pineapple, you have to tell them as we didn't get any on ours. 

Cabeza was shredded finely so meat and fatty bits is incorporated together well. It was tender and wonderful aside from it could use a tiny bit more salt though I fixed that myself with seasoning it. 

I love their pickled onions here at the salsa bar. They're sweet, a little bit of tang and really spicy with the thin slices of ripe habanero chilies what I originally thought was carrot.

Definitely love this spot. Cheap, tasty and open late (3pm til 1am Tue-Sun).
