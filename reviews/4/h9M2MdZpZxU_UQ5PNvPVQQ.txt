Despite all the negative comments we stumbled into this restaurant and it was delicious. This is now being written after our return trip. I'm definitely a chile relleno connoisseur and the one I had here us in the top three for sure. The downtown area needs a some work, but Anita's looks like it's keeping the people coming over here. Everything we've tried has been tasty and the service was fast and friendly.
