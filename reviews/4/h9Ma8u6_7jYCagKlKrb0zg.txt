A westerner finds some yummy salsas and delish tacos!!
We were there on a Sunday and plan to go back soon for dinner.
 The next table over had an awesome looking fish soup and tamales... these are not available every day, which I take as a good sign. things that are special will be fresh!!
Friendly and quick service, hot chips and a fresh salsa bar that had 8 salsas!
Muy bien!! Gracias!
