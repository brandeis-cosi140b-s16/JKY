The quality of the meat and the freshness of the products definitely has me not wanting to ever step foot in the nearby Chipotle! To make things better, they make their own tortillas right on the spot! They also make sure your food is warm by running it through their conveyer belt oven. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because some of the crew members didn't know enough about the menu to make recommendations or know about what was actually included in the some of the meals. I understand if you're new to the crew, but at least pick up a menu or do something to be more proactive to provide the best customer experience.
