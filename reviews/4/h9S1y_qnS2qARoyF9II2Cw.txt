Just found out that area 15 has a food truck rally every Thursday. I had the chicken hibachi and it was delicious. The only thing was I would have liked more chicken in place of all the veggies but that's only because I'm a meat eater over veggies any day. Also, their shrimp sauce is awesome. I can never get enough of that stuff and I think they make their own. Super satisfied!
