Fundido style! Ok- we had a little bit of most dishes, including the sampler to see which items they do best at Hal's. The answer? Everything was so tasty! We will just have to get the sampler I suppose. Totally decent margarita. And chimichanga fundido style is ridiculously good. (I don't recommend the seafood one though) 

Enjoy, I know we do.
