These tacos are toooooooooooo bomb!!!! I don't know what it is about the tacos but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the tacos! No matter what meat I put in that shell it is still good!!! The nachos are not really all that, haven't tried the burritos yet but that is next on my list..

CONS-

2.25 for a street taco is really expensive in my eyes (but they are so damn good!! :)

If your eating there bring your own fan because I was sweating more then a 2 dollar hooker in church within the first 5 minutes of me sitting down!! So hot!!! 

That's all the cons for me!!! Love the tacos!
