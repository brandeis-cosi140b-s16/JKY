Vaqueros started off as a late night recommendation for a good breakfast burrito; I had been craving a burrito all day and through the night. Well, when the morning came we went along to Vaquero's as suggested. As soon as I saw the place, I knew that I was going to be in for a treat. I love myself a little dive and Vaquero's is just that. Quantities are large and prices are small, very small.

I took on their breakfast burrito and added carne asada to it. It was one of the biggest burritos that I have ever encountered, but I wasn't discouraged, just hungry. Bite by bite I introduced that flour tortilla wrapped masterpiece to my taste buds until it all rested together happily in my stomach. I was full...really full. I was also extremely ecstatic for getting exactly what I was craving.

Vaqueros is definitely one of the better Mexican places that I've been to in Phoenix. There are so many that it is hard to choose sometimes, but if I'm around South Phoenix and I'm craving some cheap Mexican food, I'll probably be heading over to this place.
