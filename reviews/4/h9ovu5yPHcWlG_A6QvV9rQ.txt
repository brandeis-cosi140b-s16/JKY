This place has awesome service, experienced bartenders and good vibes...

My visit today is worth a 4 Star review alone for the happy hour special $5 Jose Cuervo Margaritas. I ordered a few just to be honest with y'all, and each drink was smooth and strong. They have a heavy poor which i dig, plus they have some great chips and salsa 

To eat I had the pastor chicken tacos, hmmm I probably would get another type next time, lots of flavor but I should stick to what I know lol. 

Oh and this place is clean, employees didn't feel rushed or panicked and has a diverse crowd of ages 17-55 pretty cool to see!
