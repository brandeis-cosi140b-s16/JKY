I love the traditional Mexican food here.  Try every variety of taco they have - I'll bet you've never tasted tongue so good!  Seriously, the lengua taco is really tasty, as are all the other varieties. Don't be shy.  The carne asada is the traditional streeet taco style and won't dissappoint.  The barbacoa is excellent too, just close your eyes and ignore the psychedelic pink color.  The flan is homemade, and excellent.  Prices are more than fair, and service is quick.  They serve beer and maragaritas (I don't know what else).  Maria, the owner is always friendly and will remember you if she sees you a  few times.
The only bad thing about this place is the incessant parade of panhandlers through the parking lot and the outdoor patio.  I eat outdoors whenever the weather is remotely tolerable (a byproduct of growing up in Minnesota where you can eat outside about one day a year between the snow and mosquito seasons), but am sick and tired of being harassed by red-eyed, toothless meth-heads.  And I don't come here after dark - same reason.  Thank goodness it is staying light later now that spring is here, because the food is really good.
