Good quality, tasty Mexican food at a very reasonable price. However the service is hit or miss, and they occasionally run out of different menu items. Your best bet is to go there during slower hours... If the parking lots is jam packed, you will most likely get slower service.

My personal favorite is the chicken chimi, served wet with all the garnishes. So tasty. Goes perfect with a pitcher of margaritas.
