This is my spot...MG hipped me 2 this joint...IT is on point...I don't even know wut Chipotle is cuz I neva been there & always go to ZABA's...4 real...It has healthy choice options compared 2 ur regular menu...I used 2 get the burrito with the wheat tortilla & brown rice, but I had a taste 4 their FAMOUS FISH TACOS and that has been my sh!t since...No lie...If u haven't had it, it is definitely worth the try...WORD!!!!
