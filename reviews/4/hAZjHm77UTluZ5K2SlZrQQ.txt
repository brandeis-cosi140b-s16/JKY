I have eaten here a few times.  It's pretty good as far as street tacos go.  Not many places other than Mexico that you can get those...

Today I had the Bombero Burro with chicken.  OMG this was fabulous.  It was pretty spicy - for those that don't like spice - don't get it because you won't be able to eat it.  But if you are a fan of spicy food - this is what to order (with your choice of meat of course).

It is a pretty good sized burro - I couldn't finish it all - and trust me, I tried.  I ordered it a la carte - there is a combo option - but again, it's a huge burro...

This place is nothing fancy but worth a stop in.
