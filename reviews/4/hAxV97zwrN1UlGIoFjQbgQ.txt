I pass by Super Burrito everyday on my way to work.  One morning, my stomach was a-grumblin' and a-growlin' and so I decided to stop and check this place out.  I decided that if I'm gonna see this bitch on a daily basis, I should at least introduce myself.

Inside was pretty okay.  The interior reminded me of Fat Burger, right down to the jukebox and the angry-looking Mexican dude behind the counter. As soon as I walked in, I remember being deafened with Banda music.  It was playing about as loud as it could have been played, about as loud as those cars with the bass cranked up so high that it sounds like it's farting down the street.

I got my old, classic favorite while I was there:  The California Burrito.  Carne asada, potatoes, chilies and cheese.  They browned the tortilla just right so it was slightly crispy, but not crumbly and not dry.  The tortilla was big and thick too, which led me to believe that they probably made it there.  

If Super Burrito were a girl, she'd think I was pervy the way I ogled that burrito.

It was really good.  I think I'll pop in more often and wolf down some burritos.  Bonus is that it's open 24 hours, so if you have the beer munchies or the pot munchies or the regular, I haven't eaten in a while munchies and it's 2 am, you can grab a burrito and gain repletion.
