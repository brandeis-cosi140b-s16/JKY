As a native New Mexican, I take my NEW Mexican food seriously. We moved into the area a few months ago and absolutely love going here. The name alone brought us in. This place has great food, a great happy hour, and friendly service. 

Whether you like red chile, green chile, or both, this place is good at both. Great flavor and better than average spice, especially level for the valley. 

The patio is really nice when it's cooler outside. Running water give it a cool atmosphere. Very relaxed, casual setting. We feel right at home. Definitely recommend.
