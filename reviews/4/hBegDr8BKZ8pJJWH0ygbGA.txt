I watched a great documentary about Chipotle on Netflix recently. I never have this place a second look until then. I'm not a "burrito" fanatic, but after watching the documentary I was impressed by the quality and quantity of their ingredients. So I gave them a try. 

Saturday night, around 830pm. My GF and I rolled in and we were certainly not the only customers. It seemed that this was a go-to place got a lot of people at that time of night. I ordered a chicken burrito, dark rice, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and lettuce. The employees were not skimpy with the ingredients... that warm burrito was packed to capacity! 

Overall delicious! Very nice employees sealed the deal. I'll be back to try the steak next time.
