I went to Cancun for dinner tonight for the first time--I'm also glad I didn't check reviews first! I thought it was great. It was a very slow evening--my date and I were one of maybe three couples total in the dining room--but I liked it that way. Our server was very nice, but he never told us his name, and I wouldn't have minded being checked on a bit more often.

Besides that minor service gripe, everything else about Cancun was very good. I think the tortilla chips are homemade, because ours arrived piping hot, with some nice mild salsa. For dinner, I had the Tacos de Carnita. They came out nice and hot, and they were so delicious, I kid you not, I actually forgot that there was also rice on my plate for eating. Very filling, too; I ended up saving the third taco for lunch tomorrow. I didn't get details, but my date seemed to enjoy his Burrito Ahogado, too. The price wasn't bad--about $10 each for our entrees. Plus, they play ridiculous telenovelas on the TVs!

All in all, I'm glad I tried Cancun, and I'd definitely come back again.
