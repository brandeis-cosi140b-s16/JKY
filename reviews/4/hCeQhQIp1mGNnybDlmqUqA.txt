Alright, I thought Burrito Drive was always more potential than actual deliciousness the first few times I ordered; that was probably because I tried to make my own burrito, which was fine. I also got some chorizo tacos once, which were also fine.

Then I finally decided to order a burrito off the menu, and let me describe the beauty that is the Sheh-neh-meh burrito. It's worth any humiliation you may incur in saying its name out loud earnestly. 

The combination of an especially delicious and smoky version of bacon (Neuske's) with the sweet potato puree, plus the charred grilled chicken, plus the salty cheese, PLUS the acidity of the rare bite of pickled onion, is a pretty spectacular melding of flavors. It just works out perfectly. Every taste bud is working, but in a complementary way. 

If you're missing spice just add some salsa to the dryish swaths of white rice that inevitably appear. I even added diced tomato and cilantro (for free) to add another layer of flavor and it honestly wasn't overkill. I can't endorse this burrito enough. 

So no, Burrito Drive isn't the greatest Mexican place, and I probably would go/order from a more authentic place if I wanted a full Mexican meal. But, they have the unique ingredients of bacon and sweet potato (and also great Mexican cheeses), and they know how to use them. So take advantage as long as you're here.
