Just my poysonal opinion but, this is my first time here and this place was great! Bernie is the man though. He was super patient and helpful as we ordered. Even after we placed our order he continued to help us with drinks and whatever we needed. 

My girl and I ordered a Pastrami Boyger, Chencho Fries and Wings. The Boyger was so bombbb! Flavorful and tasty. Lowkey, I'd eat here over In N' Out. The Chencho fries get boring after a few bites so I'd recommend getting more toppings like eggs, bacon or pastrami. Get em all. Wings were alright. I got half BBQ and half Buffalo. If you come here I'd definitely pick a burger or try one of their burritos over the wings. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal and experience here. 4 stars just because the wings were not that great. But good food and great service definitely calls for more stars. Will update again upon my next visit.
