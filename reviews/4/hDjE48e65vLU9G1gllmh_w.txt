Great experience, walked in close to last call for the kitchen.  There was no eye-rollling and staff was very accommodating, did not rush us one bit.  

The guacamole is made in front of you, a staple for any Mexican restaurant that wants to be a player in the game!  Also, the pancho villa candle is a nice touch, a slight minus was the waiter could not tell me who Pancho villa was. All good. #IGoogledIt

I ordered the mole shredded chicken plate and subbed the rice for more vegetables, no problem. #Paleo

Nice place, will go back.
