First of all, no matter the price of the food I do like quality meat. That tells me a lot about a restaurant's quality. 

We ordered a chicken salad, a beef taco and the beef burrito combo (combo means rice and beans, no drink) 

The chicken salad had a ton of chicken and not a lot of lettuce. The quality of the chicken was great and very flavorful. All in all, good dish. 

The beef on the taco and burrito needed some seasoning. It was kind of bland. The portions of all the dishes were very good. The taco was the size of a Taco Bell taco, but was $2. 

I saw the meats go on the grill raw which made me happy. It wasn't sitting there all day! 

It was $13 for the 3 items so that's not too bad considering the portions. We will try different dishes, but so far it wasn't anything "out of this world". It's nice they have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours.

The quality of food is good, beef dishes seem to lack flavor.
