Whenever I get homesick for San Diego I come here for some comfort food ....So Cal style! I broke my rule of not eating after 5pm because I was craving  a Breakfast Burrito...and they are open 24 hours so I figured it was destiny . The burrito was just what I needed after a day filled with salad and berries. It was filled with potatoes, cheese, eggs and bacon. Soo good it's probably a gazillion calories....but I will not worry about that tonight.
