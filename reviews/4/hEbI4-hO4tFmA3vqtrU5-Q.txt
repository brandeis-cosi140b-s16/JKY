I finally visited the Cafe Rio by my house after so many visits to the one close to work. This restaurant is equally gratifying. The bbq pork burrito is one of my faves served enchilada style with the green sauce! It's like bbq sauce and pulled pork inside a tortilla. The salmon tacos are delectable as well.  It's a fast convenient lunch if you're in the area, they may get busy but the service is fast paced and efficient.
