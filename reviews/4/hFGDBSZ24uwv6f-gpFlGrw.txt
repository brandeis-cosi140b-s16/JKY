I have been eating at the berto's places for as long as they've been around. This location is one of the better stores! Today I had the best thing I've ever had at any Berto's ever. They have a New Mexico Burro at this location, which is a red or green chili burro, with queso sauce on top. I had the green chili, and it was fantastic!!! I will be back this week to try the red chili version, since the other was so good. 

I hope this is something the other stores pick up on. 

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is due to the plastic silverware they use. It's the real cheap soft plastic crap, and almost impossible to use.
