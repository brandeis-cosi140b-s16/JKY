I used to eat at the lone Baja Fresh in Raleigh, NC before it closed, so I was excited to finally be able to eat some of their fish tacos once again.  They were as good as I remembered them being too! I got a grilled and a crispy fish taco.  Both were good, but the grilled was probably the better of the two.  The atmosphere is pretty standard fast food style with fairly plain decor, but don't let that make you think the food isn't worth it.  The service was friendly and the food came out quickly.
