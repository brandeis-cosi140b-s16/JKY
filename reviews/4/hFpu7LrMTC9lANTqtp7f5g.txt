I would have given it 5 stars had the service not been lacking.  Whether its because the waitress was overwhelmed, or they were understaffed...not sure.  We went there for lunch and it took over an hour, so I won't be going there again for lunch because I only get an hour lunch break.

The positive was...great food, the bussers are super friendly.  I woulda rather tipped him than the waitress.  I had a chimi and it was GOOOOOOD!! yum!  I will go there for dinner when I am not on a time constraint.
