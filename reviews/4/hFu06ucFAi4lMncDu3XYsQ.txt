My girlfriends and I have brunch once a month. This month we planned to go to Snooze in Gilbert, but there was over an hour wait so we went to Tqla instead and it was one of the best decisions! Carafes of mimosas, a bloody mary (maria) bar, great food and service. Two thumbs up from all 10 of us girls!
