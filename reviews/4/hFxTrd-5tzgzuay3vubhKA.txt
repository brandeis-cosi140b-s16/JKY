I like this location. Yes it does get packed and they don't always get it right but I like the staff. They are very friendly and always eager to please. I see myself coming here for quite some time. The food is always on point too. Only one inconsistency which is the guacamole, sometimes it's a bit too salty but you can ask to sample it first, so just make up your mind then. Well I'm off to enjoy my burrito, or in this case my quesadilla :)
