I was a bit unsure of what to expect, since I saw reviews all over the map of this place. However, I was in the mood for Mexican, and this place was convenient since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time.  

When I arrived - between 1 - 1:30 on a weekday, I was seated immediately.  There were a few other tables with patrons so I wasn't the only person there at the time. 

The service was pretty quick and menu offered all the standard options on a Tex-Mex menu.  Chips and salsa were brought out immediately and the chips were good, but the salsa was rather bland.  I had to ask for the spicy sauce to pep it up a bit. 

For my lunch, I decided to go with the Pollo Fundido, and I must say it was one of the better ones that I have ever eaten.  The deep-fried tortilla was nice and crispy, and it was filled with plenty of pulled chicken and covered in a creamy-cheesy sauce.  It was served with a side of rice.   I was happy with the meal and my service was good.

Also, I don't normally order soda, but since they had Mexican Coca-Cola, I ordered one of those. They taste so much better when they are made with real sugar instead of the icky corn syrup that sweetens American sodas! 

All in all, I was rather pleased with my visit and if I happen to be back in downtown Matthews with a hankering for Mexican, I will definitely stop back in!
