Very cool decor, excellent service. Ordered the guacamole with mango and crab: it was good. Ceviche was decent but I've had better. The chicken taco was my favorite in a close tie with the steak. The octopus "tako" was ok and so was the duck.  

Wanted to try something new and was an overall good experience, but slightly overrated. I still think the taco truck in Pittsburgh has better tacos overall.
