Second time and as money as the first. Had to actually post a photo of Juans Monster burrito,  chicken , steak, and shrimp with all the goods. You could literally hit someone with this thing and kill their dog it's so big lol taste was all their too. Wings as an appetizer were pretty good too, not the best but worthy of trying. Friendly service again, definitely will be back!
