Came here for my first late night with my CMU homeslices, and right away I understood the hype. 

Almost everything was half off, and for every broke college student that's a steal! The wait in was a bit long, but it was worth itÔºÅ

Once we sat down, service was slightly chippy at times but it made sense since there were so many people in for late night. 

I ordered the southwestern wings which were surprisingly crispy and flavorful, and the nachos we shared had super tasty guac on top! 

Overall, great portions, great food, but crazy crowd and super noisy! Definitely making a return for late night, because no crowd is gonna stop me from eating!
