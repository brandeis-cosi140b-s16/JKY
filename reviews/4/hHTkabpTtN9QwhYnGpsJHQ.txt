Came here with my 8 year old before a show at Mesa Arts Center, and the young man was easily bilingual which was good for this gringo. He took our order and we got our drinks. I had basic carne asada and the kid had bean and cheese burrito. It took a few minutes but it was all tasty and cheap. Everyone was very nice. Good meat on my burrito. Nothing too stringy or cooked wrong. I'd stop back.
