Came here by chance one weekday evening. Nice casual atmosphere, friendly service. The salsa is hot, the menu is small and concise. 

I ordered the carnitas tacos, my girlfriend had the carne asada tacos. Both orders came out quickly. The rice was especially good. My pork was a little tough but had a really good flavor. Her steak was also tough but had a good flavor as well. 

Not much to complain about. Very reasonable prices, good service. Good food. Not stellar but worth a trip for sure.
