Dropped off cleaning the other day & found El Molino by accident down several spaces.  It was so good I posted it on Facebook!  Very simple place, but clean with immediate attention & great prices!  I had an imported Pacifico beer & order of 3 beef rolled tacos with guacamole, lettuce & tomatoes for less than $10!  I LOVE Mexican food & I shall be back!
