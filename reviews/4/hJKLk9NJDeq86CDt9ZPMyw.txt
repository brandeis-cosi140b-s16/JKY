Its basically the same as Chipotle, but better.  Better for two reasons: the frequent visitor card (chips&salsa for signing up, buy 10 burritos get 1 free) and the queso sauce.

I can't give it 5 stars because they (like chipotle) put rice in the burritos.  It tastes fine, but it's technically wrong.
