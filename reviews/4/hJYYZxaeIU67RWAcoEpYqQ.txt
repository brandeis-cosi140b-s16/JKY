3 Margaritas is an old stand-by for me.  The food is pretty good and their salsa is full of chunky good stuff (I like chucks of tomato and onion in my salsa).  What I really like is their mariachi guy, he is very talented with a clear strong voice.  

This place may not be my absolute favorite Mexican food, but it is pretty good and I find myself here a lot. The beans and red sauce are yummy and I am a red sauce kind of girl.  There are a lot of traditional dishes to choose from and the menu is extensive and full of things that I don't see at other Mexican food joints. 

The decor isn't that creative, but they have a wall of booths snuggled up to a large row of windows. It's neat to eat here on a stormy day, because you can watch the storm move in.  Lastly, I have never had to wait for a table because it's pretty big with lots of room, so it never gets completely filled up.
