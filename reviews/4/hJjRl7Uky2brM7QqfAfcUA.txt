The food was not bad at least it was better than Filiberto's or any other Mexican fast food place. The setting  reminds me of Chipolte and Baja Fresh. 
The service was friendly, and the food was   tasty. I've had the Vegetarian Taco Salads, Cheese Quesadillas and Vegetarian Burritos here. Unlike other Qdoba's, this one does not serve breakfast, but the portions are better and bigger than Taco Bell. 
They picked a great location because it is next to Starbucks and the Good Egg, so you can pick up free wi-fi. 
It is right on the light rail, so this place is accessible if you do not have a car.
