When I first moved to Phoenix, I was told that I should never eat at a restaurant that ends in -berto's unless it's Filiberto's.  And, thankfully, sticking to that rule has always ensured that I didn't get sick from a bad burrito.

But it never prevented me from getting the wrong thing on a regular basis.  I order a beef, I get pork.  I order a burrito anticipating veggies, rice and meat, and get a brick-size amount of chicken cubes in a tortilla.  I order a drink and have to finangle to receive it.

Service sucks. This location's atmosphere is parking lot full of yuppy cars from the people going to Pita Jungle or getting vegan pizza.  But the food, regardless of how different from the actual or anticipated order, is always good.
