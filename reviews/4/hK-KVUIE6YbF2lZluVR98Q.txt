I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego awhile back and wanted to try out the Las Vegas location. The food here was pretty good! We ordered way too much - carne asada tacos, adobada tacos, carne asada fries, and adobada fries. I liked the adobada tacos the best. The adobada was much better than the carne asada. The fries were just average as well. It was mostly smothered in cheese, sour cream, and avocado sauce. 

Lines were long but moved quickly. They have separate lines for different meats and items so you have to stand in multiple lines if you want to order various things. You can ask for grilled onions and peppers on the side.
