We discovered this place bc. Carolina's was closed on Sunday!  This is noe my go to for carne asada! Its sooo tender and full of flavor! Their Gorditas are amazing! their beans are like the beans my abuelita made back in the day! Only draw back, their AC dont work well and their bottled drinks are kind of warm.
