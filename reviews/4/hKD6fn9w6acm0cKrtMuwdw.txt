Chuy's is tex-mex pure and simple. It doesn't pretend to be upscale or pretentious.  If you go, go hungry because they will feed you. 

You can customize any enchilada w/ any choice of house made sauces. The Boom Boom sauce is great! Kick it up a bit, or cool it down, they've got you covered.  The stacked, blue corn tortilla house specialty is a really good surprise.

Check in for happy hour, they serve the nacho car.  Its the boot of an old automobile, and in it you'll find awesome queso, salsas, jalape√±o ranch dip, and fresh made tortilla chips! Did I mention the nacho car is FREE! 

I'm a fan of the house cocktails as well.  The Texas Martini is $8, served in a shaker, and will refill your martini glass three times over.  They make good margaritas too! 

And if you're feeling really brave try the Elvis Presley Memorial, its crazy!
