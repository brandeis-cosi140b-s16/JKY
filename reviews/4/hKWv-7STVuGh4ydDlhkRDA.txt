This place reminded me of another Chipotle. My friend and I ordered their fish tacos. They were supposed to be the best there. We didn't get their Chipotle Ranch dressing though. The tacos were ok, with their corn exterior and cabbage/lettuce interior.Btw, the fish takes 3 minutes to cook. Everything seems to be made fresh to order. Most of the workers there didn't speak English, so another worker had to repeat and translate our preferences for the filling several times. Overall, the tacos were good. You could make them with any of their four salsas: mild (pico de gallo), medium (fresh corn salsa, green tomatillo salsa), and hot (roasted tomato & red chile). There are also other items like balsamic vinagrette, chipotle ranch, and homemade guacamole. Everything is supposedly fresh! They all looked pretty fresh and tasted fresh, so I believe it! 

The food is a bit pricey for what you get. The fish tacos (3) already cost about $8 with tax! Geez! I could have gotten more authentic, tastier, bigger tacos at Fausto's!

We actually arrived about 5 minutes until closing, and they were able to accomodate us. What service! We felt bad, so we left in 10 after receiving our order. That's why I'm giving them 4 stars!
