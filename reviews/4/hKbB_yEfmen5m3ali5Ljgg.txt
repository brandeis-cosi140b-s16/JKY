Hablas espanol? No importa!!!!  If you want cheap, gringo-esque  Mexican food served by friendly folks, Don Pedros is your place.

First, they serve freshly fried tortilla chips with homemade salsa (lots of cilantro).  

They have lunch specials for $4.  And I don't mean Taco Bell-sized portions either.  Everything they serve is hearty.  If you don't mind the calories, get the chicken chimichanga.  Its a fried tortilla, stuffed with chicken, and covered with chesse, guacamole, and sour cream.  They serve enough rice and fried beans on the side to feed about three people.  Every meal is finished by sopapillas-fried tortillas with honey, cinnamon, and a dollop of whip cream.  Muy rico!!!

When I worked nearby, I ordered takeout alteast once a month.  It was usually read in 10 minutes or less.  A typical entree is around $8.  They have a second menu with specialities and authentic Mexican dishes.  The wait staff speak English well, so nothing gets "lost in translation" when ordering.
