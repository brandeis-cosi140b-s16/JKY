I've driven by this place a couple times and we finally decided to try it. OMG, can I just say how happy I am that it is so close to my home. We ordered the chicken salad and it was amazing, but the real winner was the aguas frescas. I've never really been a fan but these are to die for. I even like the spinach one. I will definitely come back here - even if it's just to get an agua and not food. It is so worth it. 

The only thing I disliked is the chicken in my salad was a bit burnt and I hate that taste. Just keep an eye on the grill a bit better.
