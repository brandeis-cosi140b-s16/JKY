Taco Tuesday is the best! $.99 tacos - yummy crispy fried shells, good flavor to the beef.  All in all a great taco - it is a little greasy but that adds to the ambience of a fast food taco. (Don't get me wrong these are way better than fast food, but this is a dirve-in after all.)

I am trying the super nachos tonight - late night mexican food craving.  I will let you know my thoughts. Enjoy!
