I would say if Chipotle had a Younger Rockstar brother. That would be chronic tacos. There is graffiti on the walls nothing offensive. But they are taking it down. :( The employees are friendly and personable and strike up great conversations. The menu has a little more diversity then chipotle but is set up with the assembly line. They have Tortas and Nachos and breakfast burritos. And just about everything comes with a vegetarian option not just the standard bean and cheese variety. They also have specials on Monday with Burritos and Tuesday is for the tacos. The burrito is massive filled with steak and your choice of rice and beans, cilantro, pico de gallo. When i frequent Summerlin i know where ill be.
