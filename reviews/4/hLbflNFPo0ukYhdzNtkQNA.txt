JUST off campus is a little known place called Chipotle...

I think I came here once a week and always had to wait in a ridiculous line for my barbacoa burrito (extra rice because it's so limey and cilantro-y). So make sure you have some time on your hands if you plan on making the trek over here - and if you're not in the immediate vicinity and need a Chipotle fix, I'd visit another location to avoid the line.

Also, the chips are super good and the guacamole is, too (if you're into that green stuff).
