Vitamin T has been my go to spot for food and drinks before catching a game downtown. You can't go wrong with any of the tacos on the menu, especially my favorite the Pibil. Last time in I tired the bacon wrapped hot dog (sonoran dog) and it was quite delicious and filling, however if it your first time in, just stick with the tacos they won't disappoint. Wash  it down with a Dos equis and a chilled shot of tequila. This place isn't going to break the bank, and will get you full and a lil buzzed before heading into the stadium to be tempted with 9 dollar boring hot dogs and 10 dollar beers. The place still seems to be a lil hidden, every time I go in its never busy. Don't let this fool you, give it a shot.
