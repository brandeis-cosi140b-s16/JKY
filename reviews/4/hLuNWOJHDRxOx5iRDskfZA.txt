My whole family loves this place. The burritos are huge; enough for two meals for me. It is similar to Chipotle. You chose what you want in the burrito as the make it. Sabroso's ingredients are more fresh and authentic tasting than Chiptole, though.  I always get the Sabroso burrito with spicy chicken, corn, and green salsa. My daughter loved the soft tacos with carne asada beef. Don't leave without trying the cinnamon chips!
