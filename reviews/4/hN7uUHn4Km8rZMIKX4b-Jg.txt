Casa Don Juan has been on the "To Eat" list for awhile since it's always packed at this place.  We found ourselves here last Friday night (conveniently on the very busy First Friday too).

Starving and not wanting to wait, we decided to sit out front in this hot Vegas evening weather.  Tortilla chips with salsa and warm bean dip with cheese melting into it arrived swiftly at our table.  I was already impressed!  (I don't think I ever got beans with my chips before!)  We were chomping away on the chips and dip!  Yum-my!

What to drink?!  I went for the Mango Margarita ($4.99) on the rocks.  The BF went for what is known as a Red Beer, Clamato with beer and hot sauce.  Now, this was delicious!  I ended up drinking more of his beer than my margarita.  Don't get me wrong, the margarita was good, I realized I wasn't craving the sweetness of it anymore once I got a taste of his beer!  Their Pina Colada is a bit hit at $8.99 and served in a hollowed out pineapple.

Their menu is huge and extensive!  We had no idea where to start since we wanted to try a bit of everything.  We ended up with the Mixta Ceviche ($4.99), which comes with shrimp, octopus, fish, and lots of avocado.  It's a hearty portion and the octopus was pretty tender.  Not rubbery at all.  We also did the tacos ($1.99) a la carte - six of them!  Two each of the al pastor, carnitas, and the lengua.  They were loaded up with meat and guacamole.  The BF didn't expect them to be so filling and we actually couldn't finish it all!

Service was fab!  Our waiter and busboy were super friendly and always had a smile on their face!  Everyone seems pretty happy there - the diners and employees, so it makes your dining experience all that much better!

This place is popular, I even ran into Allison J. who had dined there earlier that evening! Definitely worth checking out for some good Mexican food!
