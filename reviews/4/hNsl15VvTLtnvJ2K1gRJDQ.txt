Ate lunch here today while visiting my cousin Marc.  His wife Lori is a huge fan of this place.  She kept saying "fresh" over & over again.  She was right.  It's a big room in a huge outdoor/strip mall kind of place.  You order off a menu that is painted on the wall, then you step up to a Subway Sandwich type counter where they prepare your food in front of you.  You order shrimp tacos, they throw the shrimp on the open stove right there.  Then they take your plate down the counter of "fresh" ingredients and ask you want you want.  
What kind of rice do you want?
What kind of beans?
Which salsa?
Which reminds me: they have mango salsa!  Are you kidding me?  It was yummy. Did I mention they serve mexican beers?  They have margaritas too.  But they're pre-made and come out of a tap.  Which is the reason I'm not giving Bajio 5 stars
The place was seriously busy at lunch, but they have many tables.
