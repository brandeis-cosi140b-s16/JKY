My wife and myself have been eating here for many years. The food is good and the servers are always attentive.. Our meals (2/7/15) were tasty and enjoyable. I ordered Chicken El Cortez (14) and my wife had Chicken Azteca (14). The meals had two large chicken breasts on each of our plates which left us stuffed ( one would have sufficed). You get complimentary chips and salsa along with a small cup of Fideo soup.. On holidays and special events it does get busy. But that's the same with all casino restaurants, This one is located in the Orleans. There are lots of Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but trying to find a good one to suit your taste buds is challenging. Having some ability to speak in Spanish is a plus for you local establishments lets face it. This is a good choice for a nice meal at reasonable prices.
