When I lived in Vegas, I often sent a silent prayer of thanks to the franchise restaurant gods for plunking an El Pollo down minutes from both my house AND work! Chargrilled chicken served in a variety of ways, along with a surprising number of side dishes (for a fast food chain, anyway) that is tasty and good for you AND your wallet. 

My personal favorites are the Pollo Bowl (chicken, beans, rice, pico de gallo, onions and cilantro all done up nicely in a bowl) and the Twice Grilled Burrito.  Muy Bueno!

Now if they would just open one here in Dallas.......
