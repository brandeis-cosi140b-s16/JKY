I just finished a green chilie pork burrito from New Mexican Grill.  First time I have been.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  The owner was very friendly and welcoming; he explained all about his food and what set it apart. They prepare the food in front of you so there is no mystery there.  Can't wait to go back and try their breakfast burritos!    Hooray for great Mexican food in Gilbert!
