As strange as it may be to find a good Mexican food restaurant inside a SwapMart... this place is good. Went here this past weekend... went a couple times actually. Had breakfast; a HUGE breakfast burrito with a homemade spicy and flavorful salsa that cost $5 and then for lunch I went for the flat fry bread with shredded chicken. Both meals were great and big enough to share. For breakfast and lunch my husband and I split the meals and only spend $12. For a inexpensive Sat or Sun of shopping and lunch it was a good day.
