With being in the basement of the Watch-Ova-Ya/Hells-Fargone atrium, I feel like JB is the best unkept secret in Uptown Charlotte.  They have been around forever and a day as the yellowed newspaper articles smattered across the walls will tell you.  As will the "best burrito in Charlotte - 1999" award.  Nothing recently?

The wait can be hit or miss to get grub from JB's, and if it is hit, you have a little of a wait.  I have seen it stretch almost back to the escalators before.

The easiest thing is to get a regular (pronounced reg-OO-lar with a tinge of spanish accent).  The steak is nicely cooked and the chicken is good as well.  Their guac is muy chunky and not too shabby.  The rest of the ingredients run along burrito standards.

You can either do one of the tasty cream sodas or birch/root beers or hit the fountain for washing down your meal.

Its just a quick take out, allowing you to find seating upstairs, outside, or back at the office.  In and out in only a few minutes with a $7 regular that has knockoff chicklets in the bag to take care of post lunch breath.  Oh, and they offer beano at the register to take care of any other olfactory offense you might commit later on...
