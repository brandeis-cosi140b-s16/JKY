The food here is great. The servings are huge! Everything is good quality and you can see the food being made in front of you which (I think) is very important. Although it can get a little pricey (cost of extras), I know that I'm getting some good Mexican food every time. 
Why 4 stars instead of 5? I like the original location better.. just because it's closer. :P
