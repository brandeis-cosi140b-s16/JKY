If you want Mariscos while on Vegas this is the place to go. It's not far from the strip and you get authentic Mexican food. Good service and live music is a plus. The Coctel de Camaron is filled to the rim with shrimp and they have good portions for all their food. If you have a vehicle and want to get away from the crowded breakfast places on the strip stop on by!
