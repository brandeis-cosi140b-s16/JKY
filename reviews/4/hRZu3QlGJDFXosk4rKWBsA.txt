Stuck in a strip mall in a rough area next to the airport, the barred windows make you ask yourself why you decided to venture here.  Opening the doors you'll find a L shaped dining area with waitresses that speak very little English.   I'm feeling better about this place already.  

I'm seated instantly with chips and two salsas.  The chips taste fresh and salted perfectly.  The "salsa roja" has amazing flavor and the perfect amount of spice.  The "salsa verde" is a little bland but full of fresh vegetables.  I could drink the salsa roja.  

The shrimp cocktail came with beautiful color.  The dish is filled with shrimp, cucumber, celery, tomatoes, and chunks of jalape√±o.  The first bite had an overwhelming taste if celery.  As I dug deeper into the dish the flavors began to balance, but I didn't get a strong enough taste of tomato/ketchup to claim this as good as I've ever had.  The shrimp cocktail is a very light dish that's worth getting again, but I wouldn't drive to find it.

Pitic offers authentic Mexican cuisine and is worth coming back to explore the menu.  Buena suerte!
