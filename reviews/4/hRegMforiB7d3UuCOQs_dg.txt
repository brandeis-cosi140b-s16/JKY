Spanish Fly is finally open! 
The set up is beautiful and welcoming.
 Love the day beds and cabanas with Tvs.
I didnt try any of the Mexican food but did order a roll that was delicious and served promptly.
One of the bathrooms didnt have mirrors which I dont like but were clean.
The drinks are a little over priced and the crowd wasnt my style. 
Loved the place, wouldnt go in the pool or go to at night but def a fun place to chill have a couple drinks poolside.
