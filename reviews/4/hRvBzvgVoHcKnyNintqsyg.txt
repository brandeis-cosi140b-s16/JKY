Why do I have to love El Norteno so much? Why?  Why can't I find their red chile to be  anything but perfection...spicy red sauce so good I would eat it without meat, hot or cold, with our without a tortilla, with or without a utensil if need be.  If I left a burrito in my car in July and found it a week later, I would likely still eat it, and just suffer the consequences later.  The green chile is a close second, though.  Best to get both.  And a Mexican coke...they carry the big 16 oz bottles.

I did try the machaca, and while it was pretty good, I still wished it were actually dried meat.  But they do put the meat on the grill after cooking to dry it out a bit, so it's closer to the way I like it.  They make a great shredded beef taco, too.  Meat that's not overly seasoned and a freshly fried taco shell.  I guess you could get a soft taco, but really, what's the point?  I also got a plate last time, just to try the beans and rice.  Beans were good, but I could do without.  I do like that they don't put peas & carrots in their rice.  What is the point of that anyway?  It's not like you need to stretch rice because it is so expensive.  And is eating a tablespoon of vegetables going to undo the fact that I just consumed 9,000 calories?

But my biggest question is why does it have to be so damn far away?  Oh, I know.  Because if it was in Scottsdale, they would have to charge $11.99 for a burrito, and it would suck anyway.  I now find myself making a lot more donations to the Humane Society thrift store in Sunnyslope...just a quick drive down 7th Avenue on my way home.  Sort of.
