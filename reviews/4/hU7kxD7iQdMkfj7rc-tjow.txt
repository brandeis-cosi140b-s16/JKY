Fast, fresh diner food. Yummy waffles, eggs and crispy bacon, fluffy pancakes, Huevos Rancheros, tuna melt, burgers. An Old Town experience, representing some of how it probably was in the 50's and 60's.  Kinda quaint, a little bit kitschy. They don't pretend to be something they're not! 

People are very nice. There's a brother and sister who serve tables that are super! Has a family-run feel to it.

I discovered Paula last year. She is a world-class award winning yoddler, the real deal from Brandon, Mo. Now, I knew nothing about this music until Paula, and is not my fav genre still. But I have to say she followed her dreams, achieved accolades for her work, and has a passion for it that should put her naysayers to shame. Live music is never a bad idea.She reminded me of Dale Evans and Roy Rogers from when we we kids. And I surprised myself by knowing some of the songs! Like Willy Nelson, Tammy Wynette's Stand By Your Man.She does requests. It was fun for the whole family, all ages.

Overall, it makes for a unique old western experience, I think folks will enjoy! 

Plus they deliver to the local area, great value!
