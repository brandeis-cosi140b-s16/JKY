I frickin' love this place. I feel like everyone wants to hate this place and write about it's suckery and suckdom, but I have only had positive experiences here.

The food is pretty good - I've had the nachos, tacos, enchiladas and some random salad and all were good. Not excellent - but very good. I also enjoy the margaritas here. Love the decor.

Yeah - so a lot of douches hang out here. So? Just bring your own homies and it will be okay.
