I'm in town for business and the guy at the front desk of the hotel recommended this place and it was a definite winner!

Drove up, and frankly it's not in the best neighborhood but the guy in the parking lot keeping watch over the cars in the lot with a "Security" t shirt on put me at ease. 

Sat down and was welcomed immediately and offered the fresh chips and incredibly hot red and green salsa.  Although, I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to hot and spicy.  I Just ate the chips plain and they were wonderful.

Had the Chicken Mole Enchiladas which were undeniably the best I've had.  The mole sauce was perfectly made with just the right amount of chocolate.  I have the stains all over my shirt to prove it!  The beans and rice were nice accompaniments.  

Everyone knows the traditional "Mexican" restaurants where you go in and order the # 13 and they're all the same right?  Rosita's Place is NOT this type of eatery.  The food is authentic as authentic comes and should not be missed.
