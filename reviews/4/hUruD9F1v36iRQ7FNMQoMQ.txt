Great New Mexican food. 
We were in Albuquerque a couple days ago and had some of the worst New Mexican food we have ever had. Who would have thought we would get here and have some of the best. 
Great atmosphere. Decor was very inviting. Very good service, food was delivered in a reasonable time. 
We would definitely eat here more if we lived in town.
