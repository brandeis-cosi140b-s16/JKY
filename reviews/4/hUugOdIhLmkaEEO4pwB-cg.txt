I'm not driving out of my way to stop at Chronic Tacos, but when I'm in the area, I know I'll be full and satisfied eating here.

I like Chronic for the strong flavors and good portions.  Plenty of options for fillings.  Good prices.  This is not a traditional taqueria...it's Americanized...or Californianized (is that a word?), but the food is still solid. 

Slight divey feel is appealing to some as well.
