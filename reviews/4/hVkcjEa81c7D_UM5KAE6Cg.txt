This is our favorite family-run Mexican restaurant in the Tempe area. We have been coming to this place since we moved to the area in 1984, and they were well established by then. The recipes are traditional Sonoran style that I grew up with in Tucson and Flagstaff -- the recipes that made our region famous for Mexican food.

The chips are served with fresh salsa. The serve an assortment of Mexican beers, and have some good, traditional margarita recipes. Try the chile relleno (with or without chicken), enchiladas, or any of the burros or chimichangas. Mmm.

As far as the atmosphere goes, it is great for small families, and they can accommodate the occasional crowd of up to 8.
