Very pleased with the service and friendly customer service at this Chipotle location.  The food was less salty then other Chipotle locations I have tried in the past. The food was stellar.  I was greeted with a friendly greeting from Justin and felt right at home.  I will be back for lunch.  Anthony J. Renguso
