Had a great meal!  Can't beat the atmosphere, but the food definitely held its own.  The enchilladas were great - mainly because of the tortillas.  Everybody at our table liked their food, and the sides of beans and rice were perfect.  If anything, my only complaint is that the food came out so fast it felt like we'd just sat down and then were ready to go.  I'll be back next time I'm in town.
