After a long night shift of yelping and eating nothing but tasteless diet popcorn I got off shift and my hubby asked if I wanted breakfast. Of course I replied and we drove over to Tacos El Gordo and sat in the parking lot. We waited with several others till 9am when they opened their doors. (kinda sad but true!) 
The place is clean and during our visit the staff was busy milling around cleaning an already spotless dining area. Restrooms were also well maintained which was a good sign! 
Because of the early hour, the Pork Adoboda was not ready so we each ordered a chorizo & Carne Asada taco and waited for the pork to be ready. 
The chorizo taco was ok, the corn tortilla, made fresh before your eyes, was soft and flavorful. The chorizo was soft but not so tasty. I tasted more of the salsa and guac then the meat filling. The chorizo taco was ok but I wouldn't order it again. 
The carne asada taco was my least fave. They use the less desirable cuts of meat and the presence of connective tissue and other Non-meat parts was really kinda gross. 
Thank god the pork tacos were ready. They were excellent. The pork was slightly sweet and spicy and the cool creamy green sauce and salsa they put on top complimented the meat perfectly. They were so good we ordered 2 more! You know the food is good when you eat in silence =) I would definitely return and order the Adoboda tacos. The place had brisk business at 9am so you know the place is awesome!
