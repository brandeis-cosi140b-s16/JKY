Laredo's is a simple little Mexican restaurant hidden away in a sad little strip mall. I admit I was hesitant upon walking in, but my brother picked it so I wasn't going to complain. I'm glad I didn't either because I was actually pretty impressed. 

The prices were really reasonable and the menu had plenty of variety to choose from. I had tacos, my bro had an enchilada, and my mother a taco salad. Everyone enjoyed their meals and they came out quick.

I certainly would not hesitate to eat at Laredo's again.
