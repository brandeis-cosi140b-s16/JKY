Love the food! My favorite is the chicken crunchy taco and the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. I personally think the black beans are a little salty but when I make black beans at home I used the low sodium so my taste my be a little more sensitive to the salt in the beans. I also love the chips and salsa, the salsa is very fresh. The menus are almost always dirty which is part of the reason why I gave only 4 stars. We have had a few bad experiences with servers being really slow never refilling drinks only checking on us when they take our order, give us our food (sometimes not even that sometimes a different person brings the food) and when they give us the check.
