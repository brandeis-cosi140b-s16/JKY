This past weekend, I was fortunate enough to partake in what my Husband now refers to as "the best food he has eaten at in forever," at Gallo Blanco.  Thanks to a recommendation from a friend, the Hubs and I ventured to Gallo for dinner Saturday night.  We called ahead and once we found the place, it was only a short wait to be seated at our table.  While we waited we started with some beers at the bar.  We enjoyed the overall vibe in the bar and restaurant.  It has a very open/trendy feel.  It is kind of noisy, but we really didn't mind... it actually added to the ambiance.

Ok, now for the main event... the food.  We started with guacamole and the street corn (per my friend's recommendation).  Now, we were starving, but this guac and street corn were unbelievable... particularly the corn.  Now, I make this style of corn at home, and I think it's pretty good, but this blew mine out of the water... it was so good!  The guac and chips were also awesome, but we LOVED the red salsa that was on the table.  It was perfectly spicy and very savory.  Love.  For our entrees we shared three tacos... the pork, pork belly special, and shrimp.  The Hubs loved the shrimp the best, I was found of the shredded pork.  All were very good.  We also had the carne asada torta.  The bun was fab and the carne asada was great... would have loved the guac on this instead of just avocado and maybe some cheese, but that is just my personal opinion.  Originally we were going to have dessert, but we were far to stuffed to partake.

Needless to say we will be back.  I'd rate Gallo five stars, but I need a return visit to confirm this first experience.  My Husband has been talking nonstop about this place since we went.  I am confident that we will be frequent visitors now that we have found this gem!  Yay for good Mexican (which is surprisingly hard to find in this town).
