We decided to take a break from dim sum and try something new for a Saturday morning. We decided to head out to the Silverton Hotel and Casino (http://staging.silvertoncasino.com/categories/) and try some Mexican food. Mi Casa Grill Cantina was the place to be. We got there right when it opened so there wasnt a line. Like any other good Mexican place, we got some hot crispy tortilla chips with three different kinds of salsa right when we sat down. Nice touch. We ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Beef Nachos, and Chicken Flautas. Each dish is about $8 and the food is pretty good. The only thing that disappoints, is afterwards while we were walking through the casino, a worker handed us a flier for 50% off a meal at any Silverton restaurant... Which we could of used at Mi Casa. DANG IT!
