Solid choice for good eats in Pineville!  Clean, great service, expansive menu, Mexican coke.  I tried a carnitas torta, it was loaded with lettuce, tomato, onion, black beans, jalapeno, avocado and oh yeah, roasted pork! They were super nice, it will be on heavy rotation, my favorite thing is they open at 10a!  Breakfast of champions.
