Yep! It's open,
With the growth of Surprise, there are going to be a whole lot more restaurants, fast food joints, and many other things opening around here. Taco Bell is one of the first! What can I say? I am a Taco Bell believer, really fell in love with them in my bachelor days! Saved me a lot of money! Love there flavored meat, and yes the are beef! Don't care what anyone says! Just like any other fast food joint! Service is the same, you get what you paid for people! Glad they open up!!
