Great Mexican restaurant! We used to go for margaritas when it was a tiny hole in the wall restaurant that had a few tables and 5 bar stools! After moving to the big location in the Wal-Mart parking lot it lost a little bit of appeal as it's always packed and not quite as quaint.
Start you off with the traditional chips, salsa & bean dip. Traditional soup before your meal and then dig in! We've had multiple offerings here on multiple occasions and the one thing that always stand out above everything else is the INCREDIBLE customer service we receive from our server! I highly recommend going as we are tonight!
