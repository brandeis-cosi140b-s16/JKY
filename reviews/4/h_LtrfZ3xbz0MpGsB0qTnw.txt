Super Mex, I've got to be honest.  I judged you.  Hard.  I moved in across the street months ago and started laughing at your ridiculous name.  I claimed that no 24 hour establishment could possibly serve good mexican food.  And I was totally ignorant of your Super Super happy hour.

I have seen the error of my ways.

Happy hour is 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. (Think it's only good in the bar area)  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly.  I ordered the Tacos Tijuana appetizer.  Three tacos with char-grilled chicken and spicy chorizo.  Very good and well worth the $3.95 happy hour price.

The chips and salsa was just okay.  Usually mediocre chips and salsa would cause me to look elsewhere for my mexican fix.  But $2 margaritas and 1/2 appetizers will keep me coming back for more Super Mex happy hour.

Super Mex, I'm glad I finally made your accquaintance.
