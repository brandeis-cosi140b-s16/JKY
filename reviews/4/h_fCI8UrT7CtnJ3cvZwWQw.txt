Found this on yelp.  Good upscale creative mexican food.  Definitely better than the usual mexican chain food (on the border, cozumels, el torito, etc.).  But probably would not impress serious foodies.  I had a very good appetizer salad with baby spinach, avocado, papaya, and some sort of chili glaze or dressing.  It was tasty and creative.  The shrimp diablo entree was good but not spicy enough.  Hostess Brenda was friendly and efficient.  Server Jose was efficient without getting in the way.  He kept my water glass filled without me noticing, and I was thirsty.
