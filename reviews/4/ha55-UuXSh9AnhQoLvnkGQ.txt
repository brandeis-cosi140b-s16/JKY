We love this place.  The calamri tenderloin is incredible and   Outdoor patio is awesome and the food is hearty but creative.unique.  The baracoa chimis are awesome.  The chips with three dips is also great.  Only knock is that iti is a little expensive.  We asked for chips with dip and guacomole and they brought our two bowls of chips and it was over $20 because they sent out two orders.  Most dishes are around $15.
