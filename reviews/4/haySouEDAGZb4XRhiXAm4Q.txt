I LOVE MEXICAN.

Now that we've established that, let me tell you El Burro's tacos are delish. Makes sense as this is the sister site to Round Corner Cantina. I'll admit to having only tried the tacos ... and only two of the tacos ... but the carne asada is so good! I finally broke down and tried the shrimp tacos which were so, so, so, so good. 

The people who work there are really friendly, too. Probably helped that when they first opened I visited 3 days in a row. 

I don't know how much I can say in this review that hasn't already been said (small place, not much seating, mainly take-out). There's also the small problem of me ordering the same thing over and over again.
