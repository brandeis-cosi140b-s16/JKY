My husband and I have been twice. Each time we sat at the bar. The first time, we just had two appetizers. One was the scallops over the fried avocado, and the other was a nightly special of the green pork chili. Both were outstanding. The chili was very spicy so not for the faint of heart but I like that. The scallops were AMAZING. I had the flour less chocolate cake. It was good for what it was but not the amazing homemade dessert I Wanted. The 2nd time we went, we split an appetizer and an entree. For the app, we had the pork belly. It was ok but my husband liked it more than I. There was this green pur√©e under it that I eventually identified as peas. I hate peas, but I didn't hate the dish, but I didn't love it either. But then we split the duck confit entree and it was amazing!!! Truly. Yummy. The dish sizes aren't huge (except the green pork chili) but both times we visited, we left satisfied and no longer hungry.
