We generally have four choices (robertos, chipotle, baja fresh) for fast-food mexican, and this is one of my favorites. The chicken is really good-tasting, seasoned very well, and so are the seasonal meats (carne asada, carnitas, shrimp---I've had the bowls, burritos, tacos, tortilla soup, and salads) are very good as well, I've tried all of them except for fish. With coupons in the weekly papers and other promotions ($5 meals), it's a monthly staple.

This is the first time we came to this one, though, on the far corner of a shopping strip mall (20 locations in LV & Henderson). It's small, clean overall (there was a food mess with rice grains at the floor of our table, but the employee swept it up for us), with a bathroom. The salsas are at the front counter. The drink machine (free refills) is near the seating (mostly booths). Highchairs are to the right side of the drink machine.

Hubby got a shrimp burrito and I got the shrimp ultimate double bowl (to share with our son), which was yummy. It's nice to see our son eat his food, because sometimes he can be very picky. He likes the bowls and he likes rice. The weekend before, we tried the carne asada, and that was very tasty, too.
