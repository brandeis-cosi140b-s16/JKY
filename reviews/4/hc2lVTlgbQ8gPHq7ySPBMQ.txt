Didn't know until today that we had this in town so I decided to give it a try. Had the carne asada burrito meal. The burrito was good,but better once I put some hot sauce in it, the chips were better by themselves than with the salsa. This is better than Roberto's, but I'm not going out of my way to come here and eat.
Had a very "Bro" vibe, awkward.
