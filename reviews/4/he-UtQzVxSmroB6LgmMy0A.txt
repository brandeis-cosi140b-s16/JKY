The food here was really good and the salsa they brought to the table is fantastic and tastes like it's homemade. If it's not freshly made, it's one of the best canned/jarred salsas I've had here in Vegas. Also, the food came out very quickly.

The service was impeccable. Our server Dena was amazing; attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. When I go back I will request her. I suggest you do the same.
