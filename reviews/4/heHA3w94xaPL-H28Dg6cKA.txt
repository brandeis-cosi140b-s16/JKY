Love love love Chipotle!! We eat there all the time!  They don't have a military discount (which I'm always on the lookout for), but they would lose so much money if they did cuz troops are always there.  The menu is a little confusing if you've never been there, but just think Subway, but with mexican food.  Sometimes the staff is great and seem very nice and other times they seem overwhelmed by how many people are ordering or how long the line is.  I wish there was another one in the area, it would help with the crowd.  All in all, love it!
