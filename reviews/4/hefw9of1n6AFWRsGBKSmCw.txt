Love Chipotle, love that they're an alternative to fast food, love that they have barbacoa and guac, and love the system to customize your meal.
This location inside the Fashion Show Mall is fine, clean, not super big, we were lucky there wasn't a line when we got there so we could order right away, staff was nice and helpful (my friend asked about gluten free options and they informed us that everything except the flour tortillas is gluten free in their menu - how great is that?!), got our food right away and had a seat inside - we didn't notice the mall seats outside the restaurant until we left, would have liked to seat there instead of next to the queue that formed while we were eating - nothing chaotic of course, and we were conveniently seated next to the drinks station.
I loved my barbacoa tacos with pico de gallo, salsa verde and cream, of course there are much better taco places in Vegas but they're all in Dowtown or far from the Strip so Chipotle is a good compromise and nice break while shopping at Fashion Show.
