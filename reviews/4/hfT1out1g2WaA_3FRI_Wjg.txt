Nostalgia and familiarity is the reason why this place gets 4 stars instead of 3. I'm originally from the Austin, TX area and this place has done it proper...right down to the Joe Ely posters! 

Unfortunately it took a long time to get our food but when the migas finally hit the table they proved to be somewhat worth the wait. The food was close to the typical tex-mex fare that you could find in Austin, but it was nothing to write home about.
