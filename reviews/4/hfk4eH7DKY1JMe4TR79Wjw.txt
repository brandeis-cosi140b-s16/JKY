I am such a huge fan of southwestern food and this place does the trick. Be careful that the food can be pretty spicy as a whole. The ambience is very chill and dark, like a lodge. 

My fave dishes are the bacon wrapped shrimp, scallops, and the roasted garlic plate. That garlic plate does me in with the sauces and soft elephant garlic to spread on bread. Wow! I just wish they didn't put a tortillas on the bottom of every plate. The prices can be a little high but the dishes are delicious. 

Parking is valet and happy hour is so-so.
