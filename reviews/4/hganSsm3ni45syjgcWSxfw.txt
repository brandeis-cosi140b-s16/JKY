First time here, we were sat right away. The button on the side of the napkin dispenser is critical if you want service after you sit down.
They don't have AYCE sushi so don't ask, everything is ala carte.
The rolls tasted good, flavor was very good, the shrimp cocktail tasted well.

Just don't forget the BUTTON on the side of the napkin dispenser.
