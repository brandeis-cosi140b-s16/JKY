I am planning my trip to Las Vegas in March.  One place that comes in mind for good Mexican food just off the "Strip" is Tacos Mexico. 

It is a very bright cafeteria style restaurant with a menu posted on a huge board that will take you a few minutes to figure what you want.  They have  a wide variety of meats and different ways to serve the tacos or burritos.  

I had a huge carne asada burritos that was very tasty.  I think it cost something like $4!  What a bargain for sure!  I also had a large horchata drink.  Well, it was the size of a barrel!  All in all, a very filling meal that i could not finish no matter how hard I tried!  I was full until late the next day!

Be warned, they do serve in large portions so come hungry.  If you decide to take the rest home or back to your hotel, be warned that the food may leak out of your bag and get all over the place.  

So, on my future trip to Las Vegas, I will have to catch a cab to this great Mexican restaurant.  I can't wait...of course, there are plenty of places I am looking forward to going to, but like last time, I managed to get here at 3 in the morning after an almost all night party!
