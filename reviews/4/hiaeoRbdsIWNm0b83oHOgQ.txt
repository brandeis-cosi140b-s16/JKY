Yum.  

You're going to enjoy the authentic traditional Mexican cuisine here like their tacos, but don't be afraid to try the Honduran or Salvadoran items, too.  I liked the pupusa and chicken tamal.  Spicing the food up with some side orders of guacamole or pico de gallo can be a real taste adventure and can make the difference between an average meal and a terrific one.  This part of South Blvd. isn't really the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off.  They also do carry out.
