If I mosey over to Scottsdale, this is where I go for Mexican food. The poblano enchiladas (#8) is a must and it's their staple dish. I get it every time I go. Most of the time the service is personable and excellent! Buena gente! I have had one bad experience here sitting in the patio area. Our server, who I have only seen that time, did not take orders for 15 minutes. Otherwise, I love franks! Did I say get the #8?!?!
