My husband and I went for a motorcycle ride.  We ended up in this part of town.  Not normally somewhere where we'd eat...simply because it is so far from our house.
We split a platter...one beef and one chicken enchilada with rice, beans, chips and salsa.  Really tasty!  Their chunky, pico de gallo salsa is delicious.  Wasn't a huge fan of their hotter salsa.  Reasonable prices and good service.  It hit the spot for our day ride.
If this was closer to us, I'd make it a point of going back there.  Not necessarily good enough to make a 45 minute trek though.
