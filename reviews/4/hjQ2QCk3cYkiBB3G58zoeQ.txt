My review is purely based on nostalgia. Don Jose is the first restaurant I ever remember coming to. That was over 20 years ago. My dad used to go to the old original location at who knows where... So, to say that I know it well and it knows me is an understatement. The nice family who ran it knew our orders by heart and we came about once/week for many years. Imagine my upset to find out it was closing back in 2009. I wanted to have a cry. Even though my dedication had faltered in the past few years since I started college, I was still heartbroken that the old reliable Don Jose would not be there. 

In the two years that it was not open, I mourned and craved my cheese enchilada staple, along with my beans and a cheese crisp covered in hatch chiles... Of course, we covered everything in their simple yet amazing garlic-induced red salsa that has a certain jenesequa about it. When I heard they were opening up under a new owner but with the same menus, I teetered. What if it wasn't the same? What would I do then?!?! My heart would fall to the floor and my childhood restaurant ruined... I went for it. 

I ordered the same thing I have ordered for over 20 years: Two cheese enchiladas and a side of beans. They tasted... THE SAME! Delicious and simple! Awesome! The salsa? ALMOST the same. There was something different that I couldn't put my finger on. I would almost say they may just use a different brand of tomato sauce, that's how slight it is... And that shows how many gallons of the stuff I've consumed in my lifetime. Well, adieu old Don Jose owners and hola to the new! Thanks for bringing it back and letting me continue the enjoyment in the same old booths I've sat in for years. (But seriously... can't ya'll give those a little more cushion at some point? I was sinking last time.)
