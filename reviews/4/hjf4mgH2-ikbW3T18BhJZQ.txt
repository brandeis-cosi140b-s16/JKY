if u like hearty portions for cheap prices, than this is the place for u! the food is frigging hot, u can tell it was cooked to order. the unlimited salsa bar really puts it over. the service is really the only thing that could use a little help, but its a casino restaurant so i can imagine the creeps they run into:) Me and my man both ordered appetizers, entrees and desserts and paid a grand total of $27!!! it was a "Uno Dos Tres Deal" and we brought the half home we didn't eat! In this economy, this was a really great meal for an AWESOME price :-D
