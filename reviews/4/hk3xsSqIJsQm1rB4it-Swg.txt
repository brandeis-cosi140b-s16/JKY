We decided to give Tequileria a try during a layover in Charlotte.  The service was way slower than I would expect for an airport restaurant with people trying to catch flights (we had to flag our waitress down every time we needed something...to order, more water, our bill, etc) but the food was good.

I had the nachos with guacamole and my husband had the chicken tacos.  The food was along the lines of a chain casual dining Mexican restaurant (think Don Pablos or On the Border) but it was surprisingly decent for airport food!    

Overall, the food was decent and ambiance was fun.  Coming back from a tropical vacation, Tequilera was a great way to extend the vacation feeling for just a little bit longer!
