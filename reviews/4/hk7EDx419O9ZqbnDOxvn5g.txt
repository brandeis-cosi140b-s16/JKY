Grabbed food at the Pink Taco while staying onsite at the hotel. We liked it better than the other restaurant that faces the cassino floor. Cal Mex style food w/ good margaritas and a Vegas style staff. Quick in and out, decent prices and delicious margaritas. We have been to the Los Angeles location before but we enjoyed the food and environment here a little more. Perfect if you want to escape the pool sun for a little while.
