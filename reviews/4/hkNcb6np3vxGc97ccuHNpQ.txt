One of my favorite Mexican food chains! The salsa is delicious, except it stays with you hours after your meal. 

The patio area is spacious and private. The portions are good; you either leave stuffed or you take home leftovers. I ordered a basic bean and cheese burro with a side of sauteed veggies. It was flavorful and just what I needed.

This location is conveniently located off Bell Rd. just west of Reems.
