GAWD I LOVE TEQUILA!  This place had every type of tequila that you could imagine.  Costly?  Yes.  Worth it?  Yes.  

SERVICE: 
We went there for dinner and got seated right away.  Of course, we had reservations, but I don't think we needed them based upon the number of people in the restaurant part.  

FOOD QUALITY:  
I would say this was darn good food.  It's Mexican food.  Being so close to the Mexican border, and because there are so many Latinos in the area, it would be hard not to have an upscale Mexican set of foods.  

COST:  
Well as my mom used to say, "You get what you pay for."  Yes, you pay here, but you do get quality.  

WOULD I GO THERE AGAIN?: 
Yes, I would definitely go there again.  I had a great experience there.
