A little odd to get to your first time, but quite tasty and relatively speedy service.  I got addicted to the 5-layer burrito at this location.  Why is it so good?  Magic.  Taco Bell Voodoo Magic.   Mmm.

Good customer service, correct order comes out, and inside is very, very clean.  Taco Bell isn't gourmet by any means, but it will do in a pinch - especially for the price. Those $3 meals are perfect (I usually stash the chips at home for another time as the burrito + drink are fine by me).
