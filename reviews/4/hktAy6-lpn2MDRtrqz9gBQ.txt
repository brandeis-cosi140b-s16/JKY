We frequent Someburros quite often.  We always order El Pollo Fundido everytime we got because we know it's going to taste good everytime we come in.  I've ordered other things on the menu and always go back to Pollo Fundido.  They make the food super quick even when they are really busy!  It's always clean in the dining area and the bathrooms too.  Everytime someone visits from out of town i take them there and they like it a lot.   We've gone to their other locations and it's always consistent as well.
