Though I sincerely dislike franchise food, I sometimes go to this location for lunch because it's so close to my office.

As for the food: it's Chipotle....they're the same everywhere.  I usually get the vegetarian burrito and always have a hard time finishing because the portion is so big.  I like that the food is predictable, but that I have a lot of options.
