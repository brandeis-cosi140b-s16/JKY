Another one of my favorites... it's a little crowded, and I'd appreciate if I could see the kitchen from the dining area, but the food has always been fantastic.

It's definitely the best Mexican style food you will find in the Phoenix area.  It's a little more upscale than most and with a few tweaks could definitely hit the 5 star mark.  I also wish that the parking were a bit better.
