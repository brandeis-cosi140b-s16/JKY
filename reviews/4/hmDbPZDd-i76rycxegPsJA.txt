Solid 3.5 stars

Favorite locale since it is close to home

5 stars: guacamole - often come in just for the guac to go
4 stars: steak bowl w rice, fajita veggies, lettuce, corn salsa, tomatillo salsa, cheese, sour cream
3 stars: is it my imagination, or are serving sizes shrinking?

Yes it is Americanized Mexican food done McD's style.
