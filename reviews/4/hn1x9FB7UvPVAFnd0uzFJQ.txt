Eat here if you are strolling around the strip and looking for a quick bite to eat. I HIGHLY recommend the Chicken Tortilla soup. I love chicken tortilla soup, and their version easily makes my top 5. The Short Rib burrito is DELICIOUS! Even the chips and salsa were flavorful. I loved the salsa so much, I wanted to take it to-go, but didn't want to look like THAT person. LOL Overall, I had a really great experience here. Oh, and you get a FREE Margarita when you check in??! SOLD!!!
