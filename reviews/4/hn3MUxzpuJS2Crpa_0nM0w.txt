My husband heard about Rito's through a news report and we decided to check it out for lunch earlier this week.  You certainly need to know about this place because it doesn't have much drive by appeal.   Make sure to get here early as a line forms throughout lunch for this tasty food.   Friendly staff, plenty of outdoor space to enjoy your lunch and even with you dog and the food was great.  We enjoyed the beef and cheese enchiladas with rice and beans...simple, but so tasty!
