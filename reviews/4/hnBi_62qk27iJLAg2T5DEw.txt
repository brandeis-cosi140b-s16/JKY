LOVE this place! Great food - guacamole, shredded pork tacos even just their chips and salsa are amazing.  The atmosphere is modern, comfortable and appealing. One of the best things I've tried at Cantina is their margaritas - absolutely delcicious and a variety to choose from. The only reason I'm not giving them a five is the prices. The fantastic margaritas I mentioned come at a hefty price - to the tune of $40-50/pitcher. So, as good as they taste, your buzz is killed when the check comes. Still, I'd highly recommend this place for a special occasion restaurant or date night with someone you'd like to impress.
