Fantastic food, great friendly service! Authentic and truly delicious! I felt like I was at one of my relatives homes with one of my aunties in the kitchen. The atmosphere was clean, warm & inviting. Our new family favorite for sure! Thank you Rio Rico, we also love the fact that you are family owned & operated! See you soon!
