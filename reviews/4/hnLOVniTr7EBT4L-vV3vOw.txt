This place is addictive. When I'm on campus during the school year I go here literally at least once a week. Because of the lack of options that the good ol' U of I does NOT provide, Chipotle on Green St. is the place to go if you want good food and have nowhere else to go. The steak fajitas here never disappoint, and you're always in for a treat if any of the ingredients are freshly laid out (especially the meat!) However, I've noticed that the burritos here are somehow much smaller than the burritos I get when I'm home for the summer...hmmm...seems like another way U of I screws over its consumers and students. Nonetheless, this is a fabulous place to go if you've become addicted to Chipotle. But for $8 for a burrito and a small drink, it's hard to justify going here too often.
