We lived right around the corner from this place... SO DANGEROUS. With a half-off late night menu (11pm-1am) which includes pretty much everything minus the tacos and a couple other more obscure items, when our late night munchies came grumbling, this place usually took precedence. 

We are big fans of the Pick-A-Dippa. We usually get the pico (usually very fresh and juicy), guac (consistently delicious and chunky), and the pineapple habanero which seems to vary depending on the season/produce. Sometimes it's straight spicy, sometimes it's a perfect balance of sweet pineapple and a spice that builds on the tongue. The color is usually a good indication of the heat (darker = spicier, yellower = sweeter). We always make sure to order a side of sour cream (which they usually don't charge for) to pair with the pineapple habanero... cuts the heat enough so I can enjoy it. 

My boyfriend LOVES the wings. Mild San Francisco with blue cheese. He's also a huge fish taco fan and these were some of his favorite in Pittsburgh. I love the house salad with the lime-cilantro vinaigrette (one of the best dressings in Pittsburgh) and the tofu isn't bad either... tofu tacos = yum. Also developed a liking for their quesadillas... I'd usually order one with just cheese, grilled onions and peppers, and corn. Depending on the cook that day, it could be a let-down or it could be amazing. Can't beat the waffle fries which are perfectly crispy or, heaven forbid I forget to mention... the Big Azz Margaritas. I don't like the fact that you can taste the basic pre-mixed margarita underneath all of the fruit flavors, but you can't beat the alcohol content or the size. Be prepared for a very fuzzy, buzzy, brain-freeze. 

Oakland is okay for college standards (food and service varies greatly depending on when you go), but go to the Shady Side location if you want the best Mad Mex has to offer.
