Don't be put off by the appearance.
The great little cash only restaurant has some of the best beans, rice and salsa I have had (I know that many will refute this).
The menu is what you would expect, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. all at a great price, as well as lunch and dinner specials that can't be beat.
There is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio.
There is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad.
It is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only.
