The size of this restaurant is absolutely much more roomier compared to the South Blvd. location. If you've been to one of the Aztecas in mid or lower Charlotte, then you won't expect to see anything different on the menu. However, what you can expect to see is a change in staff every six months or so. I believe they've changed owners once or twice during the time they've been open and have shuffled around the waiting and managerial staff. For the better though. They seem much more helpful and coordinated with their food runs and service. 

The food of the restaurant is decent and hits the spot. There isn't really anything special with their enchiladas, tacos, or tamales. I'm not an expert on Mexican cuisine, so I could be totally wrong, but those three items seem to be pretty uniform at any Mexican restaurant. The thing that really bothers me though is the lower quality of meats they have switched to. The chicken tastes like it comes from a Swanson Chicken can and the ground beef they use is the highest amount of fat possible. 

HOWEVER, those are the combos. If you really want the "quality" meat and flavor, then you have to go to their speciality items or fajitas and pay a little more money for quality. Nothing wrong in that, amigos. Having learned that the combos aren't really good anymore, I've switched to the Carne Asada and the meat is muchhhh better! Now I actually feel like I'm spending my money for a good reason. Fajitas are starting to show a little more bell peppers & onions than meat lately, so they're starting to slack on that, but the fajitas are pretty standard once again. 

I gave it four stars because of the lack of quality they're starting to go to now (I know, the economy excuse), but everything else is great in the restaurant. Friendly staff, clean tables, and decent prices for dinner. Lunch prices are excellent, so don't be afraid to come here for a quick bite if you don't want the same old $5 sub down the road.
