I really enjoy New Mexico cuisine. This restaurant has excellent food and many drink choices. We had a nice waiter named Brad ( however he forgot limes twice - oops) 
If you haven't tried this restaurant you are missing a great part of Gilbert. Sonoran style is good but New Mexico style is GREAT! Take it from a lifelong Arizonian!
