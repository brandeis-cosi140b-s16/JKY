It's a dive for sure - but their Carne Asada is delish.  We've been there 4 or 5 times lately and our orders have always been right both through the drive though and inside.  Hubby is a fan of bean burrito & chorizo quesadilla.  I'm all down for the Asada.  They will serve it in a burrito, over fries, nachos - I usually just get it straight up with a bit of cheese and sour cream.  Looking for ambiance?  Go somewhere else.  Looking for cheap Mexican?  Here's your place.  We always take to go - though they do have about 10 booths.  The only bad thing we've had here is the churros - hard as a rock :(
