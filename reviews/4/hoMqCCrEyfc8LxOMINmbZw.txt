It's possible that I  was just really hungry . Is it my imagination or did my Baja Fresh meal taste really good?  I always like   Baja but it seemed really extra good. I  had three big kids with me and none of them were able to finish their food , but said  it was tasty and they were stuffing themselves to try to eat it all.  
 I had the grilled Mahi  Mahi tacos.  They were packed with fish , salsa, avocado  and  a bit of cheese. Tasty especially with  their mango salsa on top.  I barely finished mine , it tasted great. 

We also were given a large bowl of fresh tasting chips when we first got there,  a nice touch.  

Salsa on the Salsa bar looked fresh and tasty. I really wanted to try some others but I am a sucker for mango salsa. 

I am already plotting to go to the Baja ,closer to my area to see if it also is tasting extra good.
