Wound up at Rubios for a free birthday meal!! Let me say I love Rubios!! And not just cuz the food was free lol! I had the Big Burrito Especial and it's stuffed with chicken, black beans, rice and soo dang delish!! I have tried most of the menu items and haven't found anything I didn't like!  If you haven't tried them you should! And if your into fish tacos (im not) I have been told this is the place to go!!
