Was stoked when I saw they were replacing the dead Coco's Bakery by my house with a Mexican restaurant.  I actually was waiting for it to open, and finally went in after I saw the new LED sign out front had power.

The first time I ordered my usual Mexican dish, chicken burrito with rice and cheese.  It wasn't even on the menu, but they made it anyway.  It was above average, but also very overpriced at $11 or $12.

The second time I went, I brought my roommates and we let the waiter make recommendations for dishes since their menu was so robust.  Everything they brought us was delicious, and my roommates aren't the easiest people to please when eating fancier dishes than McDonald's.

It's a little weird being in a nicer restaurant when I know it used to be a Coco's, but they're doing a good job with the restaurant.  I'll have to go back soon.
