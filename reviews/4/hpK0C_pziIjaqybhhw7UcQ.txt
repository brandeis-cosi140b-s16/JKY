I have been to the Blanco on Scottsdale Road a bunch, but went to this location for the first time. I went on a Friday night, and it seemed pretty busy, but we were able to get a seat on the patio very quickly (the patio was great for people watching!).

Our server was very attentive. He brought drinks, chips and salsa right away. The chips and salsa are amazing - the chips were very fresh and had a nice dash of salt, the salsa was a nice consistency and just a little spicy.

I normally order the slow cooked barb-b-q pork taco ... you MUST try these. The pork is tender and sweet, there are pickled onions that add a nice tang, mmm! This time I tried the Mexican chopped salad - it was pretty good, and a very large portion. To be honest though, I will probably stick to the amazing tacos the next time I'm here.
