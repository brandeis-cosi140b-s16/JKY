Another solid experience at Blanco! As a part of restaurant week, I stopped by Blanco...mainly just because I have been craving the delicious tacos, but then I remembered that it's restaurant week, so one entree turned into a three course dinner. Am I complaining? Absolutely not. 

We started with the guacamole and avocado and pork cheese crisp. As usual, both were excellent. Their cheese crisps are amazing. I tried the veggie crisp during a previous visit. Phenomenal. Everyone should order it. So moving on to the entrees, even though we were stuffed to the brim after the guac and crisp, we tried the fish tacos and pork enchiladas. While the fish tacos were tasty and the norm, the pork enchiladas blew anything else out of the water.The pork is lean and fresh and sitting in gooey cheese, sauce and within a crunchy taco. It comes with a creamy rice and pico. Excellent. 

To wash it down, I sipped on my favorite skinny margarita cocktail. I think they mix their skinny marg with sour and soda water and maybe with a hint of sprite? Whatever they do, it makes a fair weather margarita fan into a full pledged fan immediately! 

Waiter Jeremy was pleasant, friendly and completely attentive! The staff at Blanco are top notch. I know that when I visit, I'm in good hands and Jeremy confirmed this with the service tonight!
