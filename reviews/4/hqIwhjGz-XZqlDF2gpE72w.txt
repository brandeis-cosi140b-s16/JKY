We wandered in here around 6pm on a Monday and the place was DEAD.  This always worries me:  is the food lousy? The service bad?  Is it overpriced?  The answer is no, no and no.

The server was pretty quick to get to our table and was very friendly.  She brought some really good roasted salsa and a side of some veggie stuff, and a big basket of chips.  She took our drink order and was a little delayed in getting back to us but apologized for the delay and took our dinner order.

Dinner was HUGE.  I mean seriously!  I had the Chicken Chipotle and my finance had the seafood dish.  REALLY, really good; especially the Chicken Chipotle; spicy and a lot of flavor.  And the prices were very fair.  And their HAPPY HOUR has really cheap prices for drinks and appetizers.

So why is this place so dead?  I have no idea but I liked it, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food (salsa makes or breaks a restaurant IMHO!). Food was fresh, hot, and served in volumes.  Service was quick and friendly.  Price was reasonable.  What am I missing here?  Check this place out because unless I came in on an unusual night, this place is good. No, not amazing, but good. Yeah, I see the other reviews.  Maybe the place is under new management or something?  Seriously, it was a good place.  Give them a try.
