Their bean and cheese burritos are the best as well as the cheese quesadillas!  They are really big and totally worth it.  Some of the other things Ive ordered have been a hit or miss.  The fish burro is really good but Ive also gotten it again and it was a let down.  The soft fish tacos we also not very good,  Ive only gotten them once though.  The only reason im giving it 4 stars is for the bean burro and the cheese quesadillas.  Its pretty clean and the service is friendly and decent for the most part.
