What a great surprise.  We were walking to another hotel to find a different restaurant for lunch and we saw Javier's.  It looked cool inside and had a Tequila Tree and awesome wood carvings.  Our group of six decided to try it.  We are glad we did.

Our ladies had the Margarita Organi and loved them.  Our table had the Carnitas, Enchiladas Meris, Enchilada Poblan and the Tacos De Camaron.  Great fresh flavors, spice that was right on and service from Roberto that could not be beat.  

Thank you.  We are looking forward to seeing you again soon.
