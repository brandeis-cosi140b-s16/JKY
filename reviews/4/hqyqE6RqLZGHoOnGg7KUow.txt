I came in here to get my taco Tuesday on.. Sadly, no deals for taco

I instead found a deal for the breakfast burrito on Tuesday.  Got myself a breakfast log and a carne asada for the coworker.  Took awhile for them to get my order out.  While waiting, I packed up a few spicy sauce and mild for takeout.  Pick-up is fairly easy since they have a number system on the receipt.  

Back in my office, I unwrapped my log and was amazed already by the size.  Took a bite and was burnt by the hotness.  Even though it took me 5-10 mins to get back, my log was still hot!  Awesome!  I am glad they packed it full of eggs, hash, bacon bits.  Everything tasted good; mainly because I was starving.  I'm sure my coworker was happy too with his, since he devoured his before I even got half way.  

Plenty of seating inside the restaurant.  Mainly booth seating.  Parking may be an issue at lunch rush.  I always have a hard time here around noon till 1.
