I was craving tacos for some odd reason and had previously read other Yelpers reviews of this place.      I just had some of the BEST tacos EVER!  The place was completely empty  when I arrived at 6p.m.  I wanted to try the al pastor tacos but in a crispy shell not soft.   No problem .  My custom -made crispy fried tacos arrive just a few minutes later  hot and crisp  but not greasy- with the pastor (pork and onions) meat inside topped  with shredded lettuce , a little sour cream and and queso blanco .  A large thin tomato slice sat  atop the whole thing.  I was in taco heaven!   Both a spicy  red and green salsa was brought to my table.  The flavors of both salsas were awesome but the consistency was a bit too watery for me. (Ok - I'll live.) The homemade guacamole was also very good  simply made with chumks of avacado and bits of tomato.

These tacos were so good I asked if they could add these to their regular menu.   Elena  said that she and the cook had been talking about doing just that!  Elena's brother is the owner and she said that  she would encourage him to do so and call them Tacos Dorados  I hope they do so and soon~! .  I think I'll return tomorrow and try their  tortas.  If they are as good as their tacos I'll rate this place a 5.  (From a 4.5) 
If you go tell them Renee sent you to try her custom-made Dorado tacos!
Beverages offered include soda, beer and horchata .  Gracias Elena!
