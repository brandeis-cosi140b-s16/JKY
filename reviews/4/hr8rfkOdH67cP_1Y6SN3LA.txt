not too shabby. first time here and you dont expect fresh food from a fast food restaurant. they were very nice and patient as i pondered through the restaurant to see what they were all about. i chose the #10 meal with chips and a drink and added a chicken taco al carbon on the side. it seemed really small when i got it but it was full of flavor. if i imagine going to a taco truck, the tacos are sorta the same size. it was foiled up so it seemed smaller. the burrito was awesome! esp when you drench it and pour 4 different types of salsa all over it. their salsas are actually legit (better than some authentic mexican restaurants that i've been to). they were sparse on the chips but i decided not to complain about it since it was my 1st time. food was good, chips were small in number, but i'd come back to try their grilled chicken. my friend say she go CRAzaaayYy over that chicken! El pollo loco babehhhh.
