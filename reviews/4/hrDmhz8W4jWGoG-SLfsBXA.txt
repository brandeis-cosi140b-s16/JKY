As I put the bag on the counter and removed the pollo asado burrito I couldn't help but smile. As I held this monstrosity up to my size 8 head I noticed my head and the burrito were nearly the same size. Yes, the building may have seen better days, and I'm sure things could be much cleaner on the inside. but Betos is a strong value with huge portions and classic flavors.

If you are concerned about your waistline, this place isn't for you. This single chicken burrito had as much chicken as 2-2.5 burritos from Chipotle! In the future, I may eat 1/2 for lunch and 1/2 as a midnight snack.  As other yelpers have mentioned, yes there is noticeable amounts of grease, lard, and/or trans-fat. Who cares? It's almost refreshing to taste these old school flavors, as you will not find richness like this at the competition.

Because I was unaware of these epic portions, I also ordered a chorizo quesadilla for under 5$. This was also nearly comically huge! The chorizo was authentic, well seasoned, and plentiful. The grease level penetrated the fresh tortillas and created another unique rich flavor. 

What's even more impressive is that I lost track of time studying, and came in for a late dinner around midnight. Everything was perfectly hot and fresh. They even discount there already low prices for tacos on Tuesdays. I don't usually yelp after only a single visit. but this taco stand really punches above its weight.
