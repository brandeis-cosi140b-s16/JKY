Never ending chips and salsa bar: one of the many reasons Tex Tubb's is always at the top of my list when I'm hungry or looking for a happy hour place to go. Great chips and a bar with 4 salsas that range in spiciness and flavor. As a salsa enthusiast, their spiciest option packs a respectable punch. Paired with a range of well-made cocktails--especially the Moscow Mule--it's a great place to come during the week for happy hours.

For more substantial fooding, it has great taco options, even for vegetarians (which is sometimes a hard find). Tons of variation ranging from squash to backyard BBQ, with all meats and lots of non-meats represented. My favorite are the fried avocado tacos and pork and pineapple and blackened tilapia are phenomenal. Because the tacos are so good, some other options get short shrift,  but the Tortas are also top-notch. 

On weekend nights the wait for tables tends to be a little long and the small bar gets packed pretty quickly, so don't come starving. But most other nights the place is full, but not crowded. Most things can also be made gluten free and vegan.
