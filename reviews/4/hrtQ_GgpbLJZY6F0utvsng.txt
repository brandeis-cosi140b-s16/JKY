After 4 visits here, I feel comfortable saying that this is my favorite Mexican restaurant (thus far) in the area. The food is good, service varies from great to at least decent, and the prices aren't too bad. Full bar with a good selection of beers and mixers. I'm not a margarita drinker but I've been told by several friends that they are great here. The only thing that I've tried that I didn't really care for was the mole sauce which I found too bitter and overpowering. I recommend this place!!!!
