When I'm traveling I like to see if any restaurants near where I'm staying have been featured on any food shows. Its a good way to find unique and original places. Saw that this place had been on diners drive-ins and dives, so decided to check it out.

The first thing I liked about here was how open the place was, there's no shortage on space here. The menu takes a little figuring out, and the girl working the counter had about as much personality and cheer as a wet blanket so she wasn't really any help. We ordered a two different meat options and it came with fried rice and beans. 

We both got the jade chicken and pollo diablo, and fried rice and beans. The food was good, definitely better than I expected. The pollo diablo delivered on heat, and the jade chicken had good flavor both were crispy and not overly greasy.

Wouldn't have thought putting Mexican and Chinese together but Chino Bandidos makes it work. We will be coming back next time were in Phoenix.
