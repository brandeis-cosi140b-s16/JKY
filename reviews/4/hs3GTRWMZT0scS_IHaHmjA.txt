Got a ham and egg breakfast burrito from here. I didn't go in or even order it so I can't grade the service. A friend picked it up for me do this review is doily rated on the food alone. The burrito seemed fresh and it smelled good. It was a little dry compaired to filbertos. Meaning there was no sour cream or salsa. It just had pico. All and all I would pick it over any other fast food chain around here.
