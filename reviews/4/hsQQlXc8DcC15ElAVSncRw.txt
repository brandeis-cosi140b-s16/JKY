I have to say that this is my absolute favorite mexican food here in AZ. Why? Fresh and quality ingredients. You can tell they home make everything and it reflects on howbusy they are. The food is always quick to come out and they are extremely efficient. I never wait longer than 5-8 minutes. They are a bit cray cray on the upcharge prices (and wont substitute beans for guac if you dont want guac) aka extra charges but its whatever. They are doing something right.
