When I am at home living the high life in Queen Creek, this is my closest Chipotle. I do tend to prefer it to the Costa Vida across the street, although some times the lines can be long. A big ole' burrito is always good, but typically I go with the chicken bowl. Two chicken bowls and a side of chips & quac will run about $16, but it is good for what is somewhat fast  food. 

This location always has good service. I visited last night and asked the guy for some of the fajita vegetables - no problem. I ordered the chicken bowl and he said they barely had enough for one serving, so if I wanted he would give me half chicken and have steak.  Which leads to why this is 4 stars and not 5 - apparently chicken is the big seller, so why would you run out? I have to admit since I received the last of the chicken I wasn't really as concerned as the lady behind me who was told it would be a six and a half minute wait while the guy finished grilling the chicken. Maybe its just me, but if you know folks like to eat chicken, is it that difficult to look in the bucket, see it getting low and think maybe you need to throw some yard birds on the fire? 

Maybe a little operations management/inventory control is needed - but the food and service receives high marks!
