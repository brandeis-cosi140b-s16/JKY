Only reason they don't get 5 stars is their salsa bar. It always disappoints and even sometimes disgusts me. Their salsas tend to taste like they've been sitting way too long, not fresh at all. Also some have a sour taste like it's spoiled. However, that being said, their menu is delish! I love their Salpicon salad, it's amazing. It is a mixture of chopped radishes, cucumber, green leaf lettuce, cojita, guacamole, sour cream, and meat on top of a tostada shell with beans on it. I could eat this every day, it's just that good. It tastes so light and fresh. I also enjoy their beans, tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. They make a huge quesadilla with cheese, meat, and guacamole thats crispy and savory.
