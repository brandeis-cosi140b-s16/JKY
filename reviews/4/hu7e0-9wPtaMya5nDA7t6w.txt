My husband and I have been visiting this location for years.  The Wait Staff is always a joy to talk to and we really like the service we receive.  

Serrano's has a temporary menu that is full of yummy goodness.  Any good business knows you need to change things up a bit to keep things interesting and I always find something new to try on the menu.  

If you are looking for a fun time and some addictive chips and salsa this is the place to try.
