***3.5 STARS***

Enjoyed it.  Menu could still use a little refining - but amidst the overpriced nature of the Strip - this place was exciting food at a reasonable price.

A few thoughts:
-love the decor inside.  funky and fun - highlighted by the chinese fertility dolls in the middle/center, which are also where people sit while waiting for a table.

-cocktails were great.  had the salt drink, as described by others, and it was phenomenal.

-excellent service.  Ali, our waiter, was attentive and just a very nice dude.


And, food was a really unique mix of flavors.  Loved the tuna ceviche dish.  Also the eggplant was really different (in a good way), loved the consistency of it.

If I was to give this place a few suggestions it would be: a little less red meat/pork on the menu; tacos, as described by others, were a little greasy; and while the eggplant itself was cooked very well, the sauce on it was a little too heavy.

Lastly, GET THE CHIPS AND SALSA.  Some of the best I've ever had.
