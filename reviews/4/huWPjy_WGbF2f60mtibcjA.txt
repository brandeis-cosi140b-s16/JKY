This is our favorite place to eat inside container park. 
Here's what you do. 
1. Check the music listing. On Friday and Saturdays they have live music at container park starting at 5pm
2. Get a happy hour beer at bin702 sit by the stage
3. Get pinch tacos and eat down front by the stage. The taco plate is 9.5 but it's lame cause you have to pay extra .50 per taco for carne asada...not sure why. I like the potato flautas for 5.5. Comes with guacamole.
4. They will bring your food to you. 

Excellent experience we do this at least once a month
