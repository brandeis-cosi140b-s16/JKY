Pool party sweeeet...great concept!

I was here on a Saturday, maybe it wasn't "THE" night because it was pretty empty. But I hear this place is great during the day and certain nights...guess I missed which nights. Love the pool concept and the drinks were inexpensive. I could see myself dancing the night away here...unfortunately nobody was dancing which I thought was odd...maybe thats a AZ thing. The music was great! 

Can't wait to go back on the right night...or day!!!
