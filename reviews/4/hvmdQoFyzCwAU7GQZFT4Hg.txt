After a rousing morning of volunteering at Three Square, the Boss decides to take the whole team to lunch! Yay! The girls want Mexican and we just went to Lindo, so let's go to Frank and Fina's!

Service is great here. We didn't have to wait long for anything--seating, food, the check, etc. The menu is one page, front and back, but it offers plenty of choices. There are at least SIX DIFFERENT vegetarian options, which is huge. I tried the chile relleno and vegetable tamale combo, which was excellent. The fact that they even offered veggie tamales was unusual (and appreciated.)

The only downside I found was that they charge $2 if you split a dish. I'm not sure if this is an added gratuity or something, but I don't think much of it. I suppose not everyone know or follows the "tip as if you ordered two entrees" rule, so it's not a huge issue. Our server did note it as we ordered, which is appreciated.

Will be back.
