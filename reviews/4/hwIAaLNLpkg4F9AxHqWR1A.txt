I believe that this is the first location of Roberto's in town, although I may be wrong, but it is one of the first.  The building looks like nothing much from the outside, but it is always packed.  They have a drive-thru, but it can take a very long time to get your order.  They have a good selection and speak a lot of English at this location.  They are very quick in service and have nice specials.  They just don't have a shrimp burrito like some other locations.  They also have one parking spot, in front of the building, since most customers come from the MAX.  Expect to see some military personnel from the AFB and I'm sure there are lots of customers on the weekend from the adjacent swap meet.  I also found it interesting that this location has some arcade games and a jukebox.
