Menu is a tex-mex hybrid featuring unique takes on nachos and Mexican fare.

Shared the bbq chicken nachos with the husband. The bbq flavor has a great sweet and savory combo with a slight chili powder dimension that is great to eat! The black beans, corn and white cheese go well with the succulent chicken. Although it was a great change to traditional nachos, we did miss the sour cream and guac you expect to find with nachos.

We will more than likely head back to another one of the Nacho Daddy locations.
