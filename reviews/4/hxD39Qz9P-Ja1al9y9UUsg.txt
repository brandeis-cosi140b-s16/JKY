Uhhmmm burger!  Everything tastes fresh even the toppings. Oh well I should limit that "everything" to the hamburger and apple pie. The fries: yikes! I'm thinking I should have ordered the day before if I wanted to get fries from the same day. It's okay though. The delivery guy was cool and the burger is huge, so just top the meal off with that delicious apple pie (hold the fries), and you'll be satisfied. I hope anyway.
