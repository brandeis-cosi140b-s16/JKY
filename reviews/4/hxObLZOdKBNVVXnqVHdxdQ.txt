of course this place is far from authentic. its in a casino in a massive suburb. as long as you can remember that then its just fine. its a great place to sit down score dos xx, happy hour $2.50 tacos that are pretty decent and free chips and salsa. the margaritas are $5 and surprisingly good. the nachos are more about quantity over quality but they do the trick. I will say the service in the restaurant sucks so try to sit at the bar.
