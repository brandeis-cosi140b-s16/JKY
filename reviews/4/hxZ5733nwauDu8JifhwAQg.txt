Tableside guac.....BOMB!

In my opinion, there's one thing that keeps me a loyal patron.....it's in a casino-bleh, the servers are average in a good way.  BUT that GUAC, is to die for. I will walk a mile to get in and deal with the stench of cigarette smoke to have the opportunity to dive into that green goodness. Really that's all you need to know.
