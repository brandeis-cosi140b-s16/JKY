Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because there are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to save a penny.)  

There's always a lunch rush line and this visit no exception. However, I was able to get in and pay in less than 15 min. Plus you food is ready as you go along.

Tasty options, and large dining room space. I would go again.
