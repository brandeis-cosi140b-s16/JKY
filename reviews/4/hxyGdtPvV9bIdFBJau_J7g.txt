Quality is exceptional, prices reasonable, take out convenient. Like some others, the customer service was subpar. If they could offer service equal to their food, this place would excel. They either don't know how to improve the service, or don't care. It's a shame. The food will keep me coming back. 

When calling to order take-out, I have never been told before today by any business "I'm really busy, can you call back later?". Wow.
