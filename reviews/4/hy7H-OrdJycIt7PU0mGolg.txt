I went last night for dinner but I've been coming to this place for years due to its convenient location.  I have to be honest, I think the menu had radically improved!  I love their chips and salsa and if you love spicy you can ask for a hotter version.  We shared the Ultimate Chimichanga and it was bomb-delicious! They split our plates and I could only eat 1/2 of it! Great value especially when sharing!! I'm craving leftovers already! Going back very soon!
