We came here after enjoying a delicious pulled pork sandwich at taste of Glendale.  Unfortunately, they were out of the pulled pork:(  We decided on a chicken sandwich and Sonoran dog along with some onion rings.  The onion rings were delicious!! The hot dog and the chicken sandwich had a great flavor.  The only issue was that the chicken was somewhat dry.  The wifi did not work and no one knew anything about it. Overall it had a nice ambience and we would definitely come again. Maybe next time we will get to have the pulled pork sandwich.
