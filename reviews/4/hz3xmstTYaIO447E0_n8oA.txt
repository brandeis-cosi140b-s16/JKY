Pretty ghetto restaurant, not a surprise though based on the prices.

I've always heard people complaining about Filiberto's and getting food poisoning and whatnot, however in 5 years that's yet to happen to me.  Many a long night of drinking has ultimately led me here, and my favorite thing to get, hands down, is the pollo asado burrito.  Carne asada isn't too bad, either, and I really can't comment on most of the other food because I mainly eat those two burritos.  I've taken my parents here a few times when they'd flown into town and their only complaint was that they kept getting too much food and would never be able to finish the leftovers.

It's not some la-di-da place, however Filiberto's will always have a place in my heart...
