This is my second time here and both times have been amazing! You can't ever go wrong with the al pastor pork tacos, but their carne asada is fire also. Great smoky flavor to it! We ordered nachos both with carne asada and pork al pastor and they're sooo good with lots of like and avocado dip on top. 

The atmosphere in here is pretty spunky and not too loud either. Makes for a great experience.
