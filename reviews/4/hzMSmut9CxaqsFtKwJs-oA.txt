This is a favorite of ours - have been coming here for years. That said, we tend to order the same things. If you are looking for standard Sonoran Mexican food, you need to go somewhere else - this place specializes in Mexico City style food. )Although in recent years, they have added some standard Sonoran dishes to the menu) 

Love the chicken enchiladas suiza with green chili sauce. And this place knows how to do tacos and chilaquiles.

The margaritas are always good and the tomatillo sauce that comes with the chips is our favorite - we always have to get more!

The restaurant itself could use a little face lift - how about washing the door handles for a start - ick! But the food is always good as is the service.
