The checklist.

1. Am I hungry?
2. Do I have cash/can I get cash?
3. Are they open?

After that I know what I am going to get.  Red Burrito Deep fried and maybe a taco or two, add a side of rice and I am good to go.  I don't mind that this place is in a strip mall and there is limited seating.  The drive home is just long enough for my food to cool off to be able to eat anyway.  You NEVER have to worry about their food not being hot enough.  For those concerned with the lines, the staff at Rito's does their best to keep the lines moving. I grew up walking distance from the downtown location and the food is the same quality. If not for inconsistent hours this would easily have gotten a 5-star review from me.
