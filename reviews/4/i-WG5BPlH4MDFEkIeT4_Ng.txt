I actually liked this place unlike most people it seems on here. We went last Friday and it was National Margarita Day, so of course we had to have the $1 Margaritas. They're more like slushies but you get what you pay for. I ordered the two chicken enchilada combo and thought it was good. Four people in our group ordered different quesadillas and thought they were all pretty good. My only complaint is the salsa- it is VERY bland. We had to doctor it up ourselves.
