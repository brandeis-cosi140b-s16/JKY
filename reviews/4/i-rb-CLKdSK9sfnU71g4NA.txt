I had to sit on this review for awhile because the excitement when I first tried it was overpowered by my excitement for trying something different. Now that my head is clear and the over-enthusiasm died down, I can write a fair review. 
This place was a random stop after checking out the liquor store for a Christmas gift. Ita cute and loud (music) with coolers as chairs--just like back home when we would party on the beach. The menu is simple: tacos, hot dog, sides and fried dough. We ordered a chicken taco, fries, hot dogs and sweet dough. To be honest, it's all good. The texture of the dogs are awesome, as are the tacos. Great flavors, great combo of the whole Korean spices with hot dogs and tacos. Overall, I'd eat there again for sure. 

I hope that they continue to serve what they have now. Fried dough is a great way to cool off the palette from the spicy flavors, so order a basket. Great experience!
