Went to X=Tapa Joe's last night with my husband and 2 kids. It was the first time we have been there since it reopened under new ownership/management. Great kids meals with a a variety of American and Mexican cuisine. One kid had the chicken fingers and fries and the other had a bean burrto My husband and  split the tilapia and shrip fajitas.
We thought the food and service was great! We will definately come back again! So glad they reopened!
