This service was really good here.  Super nice. The food was really good and fresh tasting. I love the sauces and everything about this place. Pepsi products instead of coke is the only downside. Not a big deal, since I'm going to order the margaritas anyway! The margaritas are cheap and solid. Nothing to write home about, but not terrible with all kinds of sour mix ruining the flavor. I will be back, for sure.
