We happened to be passing through Phoenix, and checked it out after hearing it was featured on diners drive ins and dives.

I ordered 3 hard chicken tacos and a chile relleno - food was definitely solid. The chile was very large, and actually a chile, not a poblano.

It was crowded but our group of 9 had no problem getting a few tables together as previous diners left.
