drove by this place a hundred times, it looked like such a hole in the wall I didnt want to stop in and try it. Luckily I finally gave it a chance. Wow!!! This is a hidden gem, probably the best chili relleno I have ever had and great chips and salsa as well. The beans and rice were very good. Much better than any of the other mexican food around the area. Also very clean on the inside.
