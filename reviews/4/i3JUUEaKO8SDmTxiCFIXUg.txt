Quick, easy, and delicious Mexican food. Chimichanga that I got was simple, yet delicious. Service was quick, and their new location in Scottsdale is way less sketch than their Phoenix location (although I enjoyed going there too). Lots of seating, and tables are turning over quickly, so not an issue finding a place, even on a busy Saturday. 

If you're environmentally conscious, you might hate this place, since almost everything they serve in is made of styrofoam, even if you're dining in. Keeps costs down, and makes taking stuff to go extremely easy, but seems to generate a lot of trash.
