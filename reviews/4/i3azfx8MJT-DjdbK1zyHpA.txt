I stopped by Vida Vida during a short visit to NC this summer and I was impressed. Their frozen margaritas were pretty good, I also tried their frozen sangria which I did not like. It tasted like frozen red wine but the bartender was kind enough to comp the drink at the end of the night. Their tacos are out of this world delicious, the ingredients are fresh and tasty. I love how authentic the flavors were and I am definitely looking forward to my next NC trip to try the rest of their menu.
