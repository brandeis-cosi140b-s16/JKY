For fast food burritoes, I DEFINITELY choose Qdoba over Chipotle.  Eww Chipotle.  Gross Chipotle.  I won't even go for the free burrito day at Chipotle.  But anyway, back to Qdoba.  They have some good burritoes.. my sister loved any of the ones with their queso sauce, and I have to say I used to love their Chicken Mole burrito (not authentic, but still so good that it didn't matter), but I don't think they have them anymore?  I tried a bbq sauce one that seemed like it was close to that flavor, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't no mole, if you get my meaning.  Wink wink, nudge nudge.. yeah, I don't know why that requires a wink wink, nudge nudge.
