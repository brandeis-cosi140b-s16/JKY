Rita's offers some great menu choices. Menudo is not one of them. 
But seeing how most people detest the thought of eating cooked bovine stomach, I can't see how this qualifies as any sort of problem.
Oh, they don't serve Coke products either. 

Being a south Phoenix native and a menudo aficionado, I'm uniquely qualified to discern good menudo from bad menudo. This is definitely a bad recipe. 
The broth has too much of a tomato base and tastes weird.
The tripe is overcooked and flubbery. 
Overall, it's pretty disgusting.

So if you're having a weird day, with a penchant for menudo and a caffeine free diet Coke, forget it. 
Instead, have an ice cold Pepsi and a green chili burrito. 
Try their chips and salsa too.

Four stars for the server's gigantic hangers. 
Overall, Rita's is a good restaurant but their menudo does suck balls.
