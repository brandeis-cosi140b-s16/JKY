This is Roberto's there are many like this but this is mine!!! I have been to so many Roberto's and yea their menu are the same but this is by far the best!! They make you feel welcomed but just order eat and leave but I get a lush from the humor and hospitality!! I like that they tweak the order if I ask like half chicken half carneasada chimichanga!! Don't like how small inside but I'm guessing it's one of the old ones. Only downfall is the bad area of the city it's in connected to a PT's. Wouldn't recommend late night visit!! But if the suns out see if it's better than your local Roberto's!!!
