Carlsbad is the quintessential late night date spot for south Scottsdale. The huge water feature adds a very romantic aspect to this tavern. The food is ok, but the kitchen is open til 130 which is a big plus in my book. Service is always friendly and good this would be an average restaurant if it weren't for the great service and cool ambiance!
