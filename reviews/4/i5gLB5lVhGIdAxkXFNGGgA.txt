Went to Jordan's for the first time last night. I had the Green Burro, enchilada style, very tasty, large portion, very good quality ! Eddie was my server, nice young man, attentive, but then they got busy, still very good service :-)  Had one of the back room's all to myself, they even changed the TV channel for me ! Nice atmosphere, private rooms for parties, large get togethers !  They are well established in the community !  Thumb's Up !  I Will be Bach :-) By the way, try the Chunky, Spicy Salsa, it will clear your head :-) !
