I liked this place a lot. I had the steak fajitas and they were great. Brought to your table in traditional fajita fan-fare they were tasty, juicy, and the quantity was perfect. My only negatives are that the fajitas had a TON of bell peppers and onions (disproportionately so to the steak) and the refried beans had no flavor whatsoever. Honestly these two things didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying my meal. I will definitely be back.
