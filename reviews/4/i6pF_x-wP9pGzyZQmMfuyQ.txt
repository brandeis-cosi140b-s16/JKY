I've eaten at this location several times and I've never been disappointed. I think they have the best margaritas and daiquiris! Not only that, but their salsa is incredible. I could literally drink it. I've tried about half of the items on their menu and I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because sometimes the service can be kind of weird. On multiple occasions I've gotten two waitresses who seem way overwhelmed at their job. They're nice and helpful, but seem a little frazzled and not very confident in what they're doing. 

This place is clean, well-decorated, and overall a great place to grab dinner. I could eat here weekly!
