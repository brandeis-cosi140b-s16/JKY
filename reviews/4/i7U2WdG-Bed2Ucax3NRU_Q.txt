Soooo ummmm... my girls were wondering why I chose this spot. I honestly didn't know it was so close to the hood. My resident Charlottean friend enlightened me on the proximity and frankly I didn't care. I got street cred (not really). But it was worth the risk. 

Now I won't run home and tell my mama about the food, but I can say the salsas and dippings are gooooood. I honestly could have just come for this. I can't exactly remember what I ordered for a meal, but clearly it wasn't that memorable cuz I remember food. Trust!

I'm sure I'll go back... probably with my dude tho (he's got street cred... no forreal he does) at least for the salsas and chips. My main staple is nachos cuz it has everything I want on it, so I'll try that out and report back... over and out!
