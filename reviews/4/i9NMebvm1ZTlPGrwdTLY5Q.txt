Serving the lovely Clarendon Hotel, Cafe Tanquilo is a great spot to get refreshed takes on Mexican classics. Newly added vegetarian friendly options make this a great spot for parties of all types. Carne Asada is always great and revamped chicken dishes are a delight. As always, here in sunny Phoenix, cocktails and beer selection is vital and this spot delivers. Always, always, always get the Bloody Michelada, you cannot go wrong?
