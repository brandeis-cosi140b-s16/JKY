I always have an excellent experience at this Chipotle. They are consistently generous with their portions. The only downside is the ridiculously long lines. I realize Chipotle is extremely popular but at times the lines are insane. But its always worth the wait. 
It is too bad that they had to increase the prices recently but hey, who hasn't with this economy.
One area of improvement would be to keep the ice tea full. Lately I've had to ask them to refill it because its always bone dry. But they always have a back-up ready immediately.
