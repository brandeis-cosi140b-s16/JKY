I have been a fan of the Phoenix locations so I too was glad to see this open close to home. The freshness and quality of the meat is what has me coming back for more. I'm sure it's pricier than some of the other fast food Mexican places you see on many corners around the valley, but the chicken, al pastor and carne asada here are far superior in taste and quality. The al pastor is my favorite because of the richness and tenderness of flavors. The beans are creamy and delicious and my chips have always been fresh and crispy. The guacamole with the chip trio is storemade and delicious.

The staff is trying hard to get this newest Taco Shop off the ground. They were friendly and accommodating. When I want fast, fresh tacos, burritos or quesadillas I will be stopping by. I intend to be a frequent customer !
