I just recently stopped in with a group of 9 people on sat night and we didn't have to wait at all for 2 booths in the cantina. Stevie was our server and she was very nice and patient as well as efficient. I love servers that can take an order in there head without writing anything down. My girlfriend and I split the fundido which was amazing! We will have to come back for the happy hour which looks awesome!
