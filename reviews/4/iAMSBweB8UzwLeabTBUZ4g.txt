First to respond to some of the other reviews and folks who reviewed on other sites regarding the locale.  Yes, it is in a strip mall.  Not a fancy strip mall but we didn't have any plans on eating in the parking lot.  I'm not sure why the issue of safety is raised as we didn't feel there were any safety concerns.  Inside is very clean and the atmosphere is casual.  Enough said about that.

We felt from the menu offerings that there is a great west coast (of Mexico) influence.  There are many seafood options and also the offering of spanish rice contributed to our feeling of the "west".

In terms of the salsa.  The green salsa is sweet but they bring that along side a red salsa that has a nice little kick to it.  Alternating between the two was surprisingly grand.  They so nicely complimented each other.

The first time I try a new Mexican restaurant I always have the mole.  I figure if they do a good job on this complex sauce then they do a good job on everything.  I had the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce and it was great.  We didn't see just chicken mole on the menu, only this dish, but our waiter said no problem.  Great to know when we return.  My partner had a shrimp burrito with a pineapple salsa.  The burrito was filled with alot of good meaty shrimp and the taste was extremely good.  

Prices are reasonable and the service was very courteous and efficient.  What more can I ask for?  We will be back.  As a side note, the menu on their website is quite abbreviated and I believe it does a disservice to the restaurant.  The actual menu is varied and offers many choices.
