I do not understand all the hate on the other reviews.

It costs about the same as Chipotle, but there are a bunch of fun extras.  You get free chips and salsa with any order, you can get discounts depending on the day of the week, and I love their queso.  They also have several items on the menu more in the style of Taco Bell crunchwraps and things, but with better quality ingredients.

Like any burrito place, you have to try the different proteins and figure out what you like.  At Chipotle, I love the chicken or the sofritas.  At Moe's it's the steak or the pork.  But they also have some options you can't get at other burrito places like fish and ground beef.

Moe's is definitely worthwhile.  It's not more amazing than any other burrito place, but the chips and salsa is a GREAT touch.  It's enough to make it my go-to.
