This place is the same as all the other Chipotle's except its a mini version & it's on the strip! We were searching for an affordable place to eat after paying an outrageous amount for our cab & we found Chipotle which we are huge fans of anyhow! We were ecstatic!! Yummy!! There's also a pizza place as well as Panda Express in the same little area that Chipotle is so if you have kids, you can please just about all of them!
