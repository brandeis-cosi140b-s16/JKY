Visiting from out of town and wanted good, authentic Mexican. Didn't necessarily want fast food but this place has good reviews and was very close to my hotel. Glad I decided to try it. I would have given 5 stars buy paid like $3 for "chips and salsa", which ended up being chips covered in Pico de Gallo.  They were ok but most places give you chips and the salsa bar had the same pico.  Anyway, the Carne asada tacos were good. :)
