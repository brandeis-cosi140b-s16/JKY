BTW, for the non-initiated, it's Hweed-ohs, not Gweed-ohs. Guedo's is a standing favorite of Gilbert area residents and folks who work nearby. When I was a young adult (as opposed to now that I'm a "older" adult, boohoo, but I digress), I went here whenever I could, 'cuz the food was good and very cheap. Guedo's isn't gourmet food, but it's not Taco Bell. The fish tacos are the best! 

However, the portions aren't what they used to be, and they aren't what I'd call "cheap" anymore. Still, there's those dang good fish tacos...
