My brother has been going to this place for about the last 6 months. Always gets a bacon breakfast burrito. Huge and a good value for what you get. I went in tonight to try them for myself. Pretty much comparable to Filliberto's in every way. similar menu and similar style and sitting area. I ordered the bacon breakfast burrito. 4.59 for a huge burrito stuffed full of bacon, egg, cheese and potatoes. Very tasty and quite filling. I would definitely recommend them for the breakfast burritos!
