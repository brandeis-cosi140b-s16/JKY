Joyce W. loves bae.  "Bae" as in burritos and enchiladas!  Heyyy!

Came here for a night of hugs and heartfelt goodbyes.  My Meghan L. is leaving us cacti-huggers for the land of cheese curds!  :(  So how was Barrio Queen?  Minus the fact that you're paying Scottsdale prices for tortillas the size of a tennis ball [what even...] and $10.75 guacamole consisting of one avocado, the food is pretty good! 

I had the Chiles en Nogada which is a, "Chicken breast, dried apricots, golden raisins, onions, garlic, and red wine in a roasted poblano pepper, served in almond cream sauce with pomegranate, queso fresco, and cilantro garnish."  It also came with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and calabacitas.  I can't recall any pomegranate seeds in my dish but it wasn't missed.  I was too busy eating bite after bite of the best stuffed poblano pepper ever.  And that cream sauce!  I could barely resist the temptation of picking up my plate and licking every last drop of sauce.  The chipotle mash was also very savory and creamy with a nice hint of chipotle flavor.  Calabacitas is a vegetable side dish so yummers!

I also tried Mr. W.'s Cochinita Pibil.  Slow-cooked banana leaf pork marinated in sour orange and achiote paste?  Count me in!  The tortillas were so small though.  It was smaller than my palm, about the size of a tennis ball.  They give like a huge mountain of meat but three of the tiniest tortillas ever.  Mr. Dubs ended up eating his entree with chips like a pseudo nacho thing.  Speaking of chips, I love free chips and salsa and stealing fancy guacamole from my YFF!  It lacked some seasoning but it was amazing because I jacked it from Brett!

So while the ambiance and atmosphere in the restaurant is gorgeous [but man is dining al fresco craptacular when it's both hot AND humid] and the waiter is charismatic, I'm not sure I'll be back to this location.  I think their Gilbert location is calling my name!
