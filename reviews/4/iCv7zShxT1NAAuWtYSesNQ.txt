If I had been alone eating here I probably would have rated Maribel's 5 stars. However, my wife's order was fair to partly cloudy at best, probably worth 3 stars, so I'll meet in the middle with a 4 star review.

Let's start with the service - our waitress was outstanding. She was attentive and gave some recommendations and also informed us of the specials throughout the week. Definitely trying to make sure we come back - which I totally appreciate. However, we placed our order when there was only one other table seated, and it took a good 35-40 minutes to get our food after we placed our order. The waitress apologized several times and even brought us a complimentary churro to apologize. The churro was outstanding. One review compared it to Disneyland churros. While I appreciate them recognizing Disney churro's as the greatest in the land, this one wasn't quite that good.

So for my entree I was simple, bean & cheese burrito. It was only $3 so I figured I'd take a stab. OUTSTANDING! Beans were really good, probably could have used a little more cheese. And they have Dr. Pepper, nothing goes better with Mexican food than an ice cold Dr. Pepper in my opinion. My wife ordered 2 cheese enchiladas, one with green sauce the other with red sauce. The green sauce was average, neither of us cared for the red sauce. They were also very, very small. I know she wouldn't order it again and I wouldn't venture out to try it - but I am interested in the carne asada which the waitress said was very good.

I'm always game for a top notch bean & cheese burrito - I just hope this restaurant isn't a one trick pony because good Mexican restaurants in this city are few and far between.
