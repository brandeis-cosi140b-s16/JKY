This is a nice, reasonable priced Mexican restaurant. I usually get their big burrito and I always leave the place satisfied. The only critic I have is their salsa. But I like chunkier salsa so some others might like it. 
Other than that, the food does taste very fresh compared to some other fast food chain Mexican restaurants. The staff is friendly and the food comes out relatively fast. I would definitely go to there again.
