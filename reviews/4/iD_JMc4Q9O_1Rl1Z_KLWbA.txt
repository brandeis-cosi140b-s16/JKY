Just left the Sunday buffet at the "Rio" and had a great meal! I was able to meet the Alda today who is the resturant manager and we discussed a small issue I noticed at the buffet today. I have to say that she has done an excellent job since we first discovered the "Rio" about 6-8 months ago.  I wish her and the "familia" the best for thier two resturant locations!   - Daniel -  ;-)
