El Sombrero, AKA The Hat is a downtown Las Vegas classic. On any given weekday lunch you can run into local politicians, pig farmers, attorneys, newscasters or entertainment performers (I've seen all the above, not on the same trip). 

It's tiny so get there early - limited seating. You're not going to get the best service or Mexican food you've ever had but it's damn good. It could use a real good scrub down in there, but it's your typical local small diner - Mexican food style.

I've had a variety of menu items - combo meals with tacos, tamales or enchiladas, burritos, chili verde. All good, all worthy of a reorder.

I will be returning. This is my favorite spot to eat when I have to come to the courthouse or I have Jury Duty :(.
