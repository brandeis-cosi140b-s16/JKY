I've been looking for a place that serves a good coctel de campechana (shrimp,octopus,and oysters). The tatse was exactly what I was looking for. It comes in a huge glass that resembles a very heavy margarita glass. They serve it with saltine crackers, a bottle of ketchup(I didn't use the ketchup) and some lemon wedges. Its nice and cold and certainly hit the spot. The service was very friendly and my soda was always full. I will definitely recommend and visit Tony's again.
