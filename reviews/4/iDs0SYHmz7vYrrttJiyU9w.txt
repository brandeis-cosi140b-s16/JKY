Really great food for a great price! Everything I've ordered has been delicious  but I love their battered fish tacos. The seasoned rice is always light and fluffy, making a nice complement to the meal.  Everything is flavorful and the salsa bar has something for all tastes. It's such an affordable, fast, and convenient place. Crazy to get such quality food for the same price as a typical fast food meal. Only marking them one star off for the decor of the eating area; not bad but could be a little more inviting.
