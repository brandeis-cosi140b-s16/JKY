SumoMaya is an EXCELLENT choice for Happy Hour.

My friend and I spent $9 total on 4 incredibly tasty tacos and some edamame.  YUM.
Not too many places have Happy Hour DAILY ... SumoMaya does, and has great service, too!

I don't think you can beat the Happy Hour food options here.  Great taste for a great price.

The drinks aren't nearly as affordable, and outside of Happy Hour, food prices jump up quite a bit, but if you're just looking to enjoy a nice snack and some good conversation, SumoMaya is a terrific choice.

Enjoy!
