This is THE place for authentic Guadalajaran Mexican food. No, I've never been to Guadalaraja, but they say it's from there, and the food is SO good, so I'm down with it. I absolutely love mom and pop joints, and this is the ultimate. I love the story behind the restaurant--they came here from Mexico and worked hard to save money for their own restaurant. Who doesn't want to support the American Dream in action? And the owners/founders are the ones cooking your food. Rock on! Everything I've tried has been delicious and flavorful. Spring for the super tacos--it's bigger, more meat, and there's cheese in between the tortillas. Worth it! I overheard them saying they were closing for remodeling this summer. Looking forward to seeing the finished product! We purchased the homemade flour tortillas to take home, and it's amazing how different (better) they are than the store bought ones. They puff up when you cook them, and they get crispy and delicious. This is comfort food, for sure. Stop in and try it, you won't be disappointed. Great value, too.
