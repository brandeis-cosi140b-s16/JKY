Service was very fast not too crazy busy so we wen didn't have to wait long for a table.
Had the ceviche tostadas. They were big full of flavor and shrimp. 5.99 per tostada but two will fill you up for sure.
They had a Buffett that look good the only thing is the desserts for the Buffett looked like they stopped at frys to get a cake.
