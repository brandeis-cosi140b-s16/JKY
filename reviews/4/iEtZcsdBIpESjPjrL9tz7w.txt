Del Taco (insert greater than sign) Taco Bell.  Period!

Del Taco uses better ingredients than Taco Bell/Taco Hell.  Real meat vs "proteins, which can include all kinds of fillers favored by cost cutting TB.  And hot food is served hot!

I stop by here every once in awhile, because if you want a quick fast food chain burrito or tacos, this is the brand to turn to.  It's not gourmet but still nom nom yum good.  Plus I had good memories of Tuesday taco eating contest with the college roomies back in the days when it was $0.99 for 3 tacos (different location).  

BTW, if you are going to do taco eating contests, don't get the soft shell tacos like I did.  It was like a work out for your jaw after you are only 1/2 way through your first dozen.
