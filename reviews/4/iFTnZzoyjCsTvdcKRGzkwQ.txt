Located in our neighborhood, this place was hidden in plain sight....I've passed it at least 100x and for some reason, never noticed it.  Then, one day a colleague who lived in the neighborhood told me about a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood and I was like "what? where?".  Since that conversation, we've been here a few times and it's pretty good.  Here's what we've ordered:

Everything is really good.  It's not your traditional Mexican food....the chef here is very creative with their menu items and the flavors are really unique despite using traditional ingredients.

The Bean con Queso is delish and addicting....good thing they don't give you too large of a portion, otherwise you could blow your appetite on the 1st appetizer!  LOL

The Enchanted Garden Enchiladas is an awesome Vegetarian option for the non-meat eaters.  I decided to give it a try one day just to be different....and it was really good.  I also didn't feel overly stuffed despite the large portion.

The Chicado Melt and Chicken Chimi are awesome as well.

The servers here are pleasant and friendly.  The vibe is pretty cool and great for a family night out.
