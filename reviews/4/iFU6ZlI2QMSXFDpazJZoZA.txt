This place was a pleasant surprise.  I had "linner" here at 3:00pm on a Sunday.  I was impressed with several things about this place:

1.  The menu is amazing.  Not just the standard "commercial Mexican" fare; they have a couple of Cuban, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, and other Latin dishes, so you are not limited to Mexican alone.  They also have an extensive drink menu.

2.  Atmosphere is great - bright, energetic decor, fun environment, nice bar, open-concept design.  It's a nice place to hang out.

3.  The quality of the food is really good, and so is the selction.  

4.  The service is good.  I was there at a weird time, and they only had 2 servers, and there were quite a few tables of people eating.  They were busy, but they still did a good job.  I'm sure that, during peak times, they are well-staffed and attentive.

I had the Arrachera, which I haven't seen on a menu since my last trip to Celaya, Mexico.  It was excellent.  The beans and rice were very good, and the meat was grilled with bell pepper, onion, and jalapenos.  They served it with a salsa that was insanely spicy.  Probably a bit much for most people, but SOOOOOO good!  The combo of the jalapeno strips and the salsa had my mouth on fire for a while.  A true Mexican experience!
