We sat in the bar for happy hour, which is on whenever they're open! The bartender was great & attentive. We tried the street tacos (carne asada & carnitas), ceviche mini toastadas and fish tacos in lettuce wraps. We liked all of it! Plus the complimentary chips & salsas & bean dip are tasty too. And you can't beat $3 wells and $4 margaritas!
