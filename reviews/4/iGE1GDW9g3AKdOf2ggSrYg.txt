Hands-down the best bacon burrito I've ever had in my life. I would give them five stars except for the fact that every single time I call in takeout orders I still have to wait at least 15 minutes on arrival. The crunchy chicken tacos are really good too. 
But nothing comes close to these bacon burritos, at all locations ( Tempe and Scottsdale are my favs)
