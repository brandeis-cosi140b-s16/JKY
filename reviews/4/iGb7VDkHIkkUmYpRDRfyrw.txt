The carne asada tacos are very tasty and recommendable. The salsa they have is mouth watering, it's that type of spicy that will get your nose running but you'll be wanting more. I tried the rice and beans once, and they were not as good. 

Also their waters are fresh and made in store their horchata is delicious !!
