really decent lunch.  i had the slow-cooked pork soft tacos with pineapple and black beans and it was fab.  the guac was fresh and the pineapple was not canned.  the pork had a really nice adobo-smokiness to it and was very tender.  everything on the plate tasted delicious.  i would bet there was lard in the black beans because they were just that good.  nice seasoning, not too overwhelming or spicy.

the waitress was a little weird, like she had a hard time making her mouth form a smile, but she was effective and timely so that is probably more important.  she did offer me additional tortillas at no cost (lunch came with three) but i opted to just take home my remaining tortillas and fillings without the tortilla refill.  

so, minus one star since the chips and salsa were nothing you'd want to take home in a doggy bag and i wasn't blown away by the flavors in the green or red salsa; both seemed a little on the bland side and overly pureed.  i like salsa with a little texture and chips that aren't swimming in salt.  have to say, i was nervous when it came out because normally you can tell if a restaurant is hit or miss based on the first appetizer.

however, overall, really good lunch, nice price, fresh food - i'd go back.  i just wouldn't ask for the chips and salsa.
