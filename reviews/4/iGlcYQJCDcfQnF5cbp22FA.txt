On my last day in Phoenix I was tired of the same old boring food I was eating at the resort for a week (just thinking of it makes me ill) & wanted a burrito to gnaw on while I drove back to Vegas. I turned to yelp to help me in this quest and found Tacos Atoyac. 

Once in this small un-assuming place & seeing all the taco choices, I decided to dine in and try some tacos. I ordered two carne asada and two fish tacos. Also got a bottle of Coke to wash it down (I only drink Coke when it's in a bottle, weird!). 

Anyways, loved the basic ness of the place: order, sit down, eat, repeat! Loved the carne asada tacos. The fish tacos were good but a little salty for my taste. I liked that they serve grilled onions & peppers, they were really good. 

Belly full and wondering how I was going to evade another speeding ticket in the great state of Arizona while in a food coma, I hear someone order tamales. I love tamales but was way too full to even think of eating. I ask the owner if they are already warmed up & he informed me that they were cold & I could warm them up in the microwave when I got home, score!

I ordered two spicy chicken tamales and rushed home (going the speed limit of course) & popped them in the microwave for two minutes. DELICIOUS!!! Omg, those were some of the best tamales I've ever had! 

Though I vowed to never drive to Phoenix again, if I ever do make it out here again, Tacos Atoyac will be my first stop!
