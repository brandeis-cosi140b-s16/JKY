I go here atleast once a week, their shredded beef tacos are the best I've ever tasted! Sometimes the beans are too watery or burnt, but most of the time they are on delicious! I always go with the tostada or beef taco combos, and they always leave me wanting more. Definitely worth stopping by if you haven't tried it.
