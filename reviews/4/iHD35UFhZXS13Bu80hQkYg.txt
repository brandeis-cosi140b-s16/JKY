I'm torn on 4 or 3 stars.  I thought the food was good.  They bring you 3 types of salsa. We arrived to a really good 2 person band performing on thursday night.  Its just a nice place to hang out.  I would have to rate it was expensive.  I had the seafood guac.  Wow was it good.  $15 but the quality and taste made it worth every penny.  I probably would have given it 3 stars if it wasnt owned by Santana I admit I like music and I like live music places.
