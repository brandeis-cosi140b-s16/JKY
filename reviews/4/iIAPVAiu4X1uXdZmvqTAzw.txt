What is there really to say about Roberto's that's new? Most people know about the chain by now. But I will note two things:

1) Many of the stores have slight variations on their specials menu so it's always worth checking out.

2) Just from personal experience, while their menu is standardized, I tend to stick to older locations. Maybe it's all in my head, but the food just seems cheesier and more delicious at the older locations in town versus the super-sleep looking newer ones. Then again, maybe I am a sucker for spots that let their food do the talking versus using decor to convince you that things are better than they are in reality.
