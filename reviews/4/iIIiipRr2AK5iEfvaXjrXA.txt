Went here for breakfast this morning and was pleasantly surprised. I had the huevos rancheros. Not as good as Richardsons, but good.

The coffee is strong and the bartender read me very well when he asked if I wanted a shot of Baileys... despite my strong desire to accept, I regretfully declined.

The service is fantastic. My coffee cup was filled up at all times, the food came out quick, etc etc etc

I just want to point out, however, that this place will now be dubbed "AMbers Bad News Breakfast Spot" ... so any time you have bad news to share with me, just invite me to breakfast here so I can be prepared for the onslaught.
