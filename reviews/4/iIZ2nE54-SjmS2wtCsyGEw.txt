The best Tacos I have ever had coming from a restaurant.  They are always hot, stuffed with meat ( they don't skimp) and fresh.  The salsa is close to my Aunt Bernice's!  If I didn't know better, I'd swear my Nana was cooking.  The ladies at the cash register are very friendly.  Grab some chips and salsa and a couple of tacos.  You won't be disappointed.
