The Carnita's are to die for! Fast food but yummy! Got into town HUNGRY, the first few places were blocked by construction and traffic. Wasn't looking for fast food, we were NOT disappointed by the food! Hit the spot, hot, fast and spot on! Pork was tender and not stringy or too spicy.... But spicy enough!
