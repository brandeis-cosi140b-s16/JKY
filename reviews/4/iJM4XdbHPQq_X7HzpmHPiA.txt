Thanks to the handy Yelp app, I was able to get me some Mexican food fast on a recent trip to AZ. The power of the people delivered and I got what I was after: a quick, cheap meal of hearty Mexican food.

The place is in a little strip mall and I can't offer any better guidance than just get into the development and drive around like you're insane until the wafting smell of carne and beans fills your nostrils. Once there, you'll find a few tables and a simple menu taped to the wall. 

Tacos and burritos were the order of the day, so I scarfed on a California Burrito (carne asada and potatoes, amongst the usual suspects) and also tried the bean and cheese. Really, I used them as a salsa deliver device. Be sure to get the bottles of red and green salsa and go nuts. The red is spicier (but not killer) and I liked it a little more than the green, though generous portions of each were had.

A lot of the food had the distinct taste of fried, which is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but you've got to like fried things. I happen to like fried things, so that works out well for me. But the meat was okay if maybe a little underseasoned, and I have no complaints about anything else. 

I think the bonus cred here comes from the price. It's not dirt, rock-bottom pricing, but the fatty burrito came in at under $5, so I've got nothing but kudos for that. And the staff was super nice. Incredibly nice. Painfully nice. Add it up and it's a win.
