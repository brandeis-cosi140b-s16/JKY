This Chipotle got most of my expendable income while I was studying at ASU across the street. Many afternoons and evenings were spent there, usually after long days in the library or the political science building. Anyway, the service and food have never dropped off. 

I recently stopped back in to see how the food is in 2015. To my surprise, it was still good and the service was also very friendly and nice. I got there for an early lunch at 11:15 am. About 20 minutes later the local corporate Tempe community started forming quite a line. 

That line never subsided while I was there and the parking lot (which is rather limited) was full and cars began parking on the nearest residential street. That is still a problem here if you come with a vehicle at lunch time. That's really the only negative about this place. 

The fact that they are so busy during lunch with so many options just down the street tells me a lot about how good the food and service is at this location. Indeed, memory lane at this Chipotle was nice and the burrito was even better. 

I'd stop back in again when I am in the Tempe area.
