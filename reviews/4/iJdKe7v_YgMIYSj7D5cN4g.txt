The only negative I found was it took a little while to get the food. 

Now on to the positives:

Great salsa bar. Good choices of salsa, pickled carrots and jalape√±os, sliced cucumbers and free chips. 

The food was delish. The rolled tacos were tasty with a huge amount of guacamole and cheese. I had the cabeza gigantico burrito, the meat had a great flavor and texture, I tried the pollo burrito as well, and I can say that it was some of the best tasting pollo I have had in a long time. 

The prices are great too, burritos for under 5.

I will definitely be coming back the next time I come back to Phoenix.
