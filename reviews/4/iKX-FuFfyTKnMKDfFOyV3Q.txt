You've got to try this one out.  Wish it were here in Tucson.  , but we do travel to Phoenix many times during the year.   It's always a treat to search out different restaurants and hope we find some winners along the way.  This one just hit the spot. Love family restaurants that have these enduring recipes that date back years and years.  Mama cooking at the stove feeding several kidlets some ethnic family dishes.  Then maybe one day some tells Mama to open up a restaurant and serve everyone, gringos, Mexicans, other ethnicities some of their best dishes.  I believe this is the place where it formed.  Not sure, but it makes a nice story.  Anyhow, it was tucked away in an area around downtown Phoenix.  On the outskirts.  Not a great neighborhood but that makes it even better.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga topped with lots of chunky guacamole, sour cream and cheese on top. On the side came the green Enchillada sauce.  It was the best I ever had.  Big chunks of very soft mild chillies were floating in the sauce.  Husband had the Chili  Relleno.  It was delectable and the batter was light and fluffy. Son had the grilled fish enchiladas which was also so good.  Our very lovely server was Brianna.  Not only was she efficient, she was adorable and had a super sense of humor.  We went about 1:30 PM on Saturday.  The place was packed.  P.S. the chips were great as well and the salsa.  Mild with huge chunks of tomatoes.  Will be back again when in Phoenix.
