I have to give Cabo 4 stars because of my husband. He doesn't yelp, but this is hands down his favorite place. If I'm out of town- he will go here repeatedly. I'm not as impressed.

Cabo started in Blacksburg. Anyone else notice the high number of Hokies that live in the Charlotte area? 

The inside is really nice. I like the d√©cor. They renovated the building and did a great job. There is a little patio. 

I usually get the Lemon Grass Shrimp tacos. I like the mexi-slaw as the side. They have an INCREDIBLE corn chowder- but it isn't always on the menu. Order it if you see it.

My husband loves almost everything on the menu and always raves about it. BTW- this place can get PACKED. This is NOT a smart place to go to with a big group.
