I went to La Tolteca for my birthday.  We had a really fun time: the atmosphere is festive and colorful, the drinks were tasty and the food was good.  The menu is quite large, so there are plenty of dishes to choose from.  They let us make special requests (we asked for corn tortillas instead of flour), and the service was quite friendly.  I will certainly go back.
