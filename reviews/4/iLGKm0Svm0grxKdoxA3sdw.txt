An excellent and inexpensive local place.  The vegetarian fajitas are sooo good, better than Chili's chicken fajitas by a long shot.  Beans are good, rices is good, service is fast and food arrives warm.  Kids eat free on Sunday.  Very busy at lunch but not as busy for dinner, so prefer them over the chains.
