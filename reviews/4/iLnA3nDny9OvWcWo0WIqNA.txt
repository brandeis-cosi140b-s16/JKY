I don't know if Los Taquitos qualifies as a "dive". It's more like a fast food joint for authentic Mexican food. I mean, is in Ahwatukee, in the middle of a suburb, between a Safeway and a Walgreen's. Maybe compared to other restaurants in the area it is a dive I guess.....It's just that to me, a dive is kind of sleazy, maybe not in the best part of town and you feel a little dirty when you get out of there, and that can be good or bad (depending on what good of a time you had)
Anyway, went there to try it as is 5 minutes away from me. Like others mentioned, it's a small place. I went Saturday night, people were coming in and out picking their food and some were eating there. I was too hungry to do take out so I ate in. Ordered a chicken hard taco, pork soft taco and carne asada sopes. Food took a while, which surprised me as they weren't really busy, but it was probably because it's made to order. My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood!! Should have ordered more, my favorite was the sopes and carne asada. The salsas were flavorful and while I usually prefer red, I liked their green salsa better. 
Service was prompt, the young women that worked that night were very nice. 
I'm glad they're close to us, as we'll visit often.
