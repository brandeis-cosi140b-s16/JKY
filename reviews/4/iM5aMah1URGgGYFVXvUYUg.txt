I was a bit skeptical seeing that it was next to a bar. But I am glad I tried it and I will be back. The decor is very humble, but ideal for the restaurant. Ozzie was very attentive and friendly. She knew the menu and had great advice. I had the three tacos plate, fish, carne asada and chicken. Glad they do not serve a fish taco..aka..fish stick taco, very tasty fish. Beans and rice were perfect...just wish I had one more serving spoon full of both. My wife had the Green Chile (pork) plate, great taste but again needed just a bit more rice and beans.Ozzie recommended we cap off our meal off with a Churro, another great recommendation. Ya gotta have one and take one to go! Great prices and food!
