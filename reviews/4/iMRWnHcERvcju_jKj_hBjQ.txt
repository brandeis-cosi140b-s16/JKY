I am a big fan of Hussong's - and for one reason: the nachos. The nachos here are some of the best I have ever had. There are several options to choose from, and every time they do them just right. Great chips, great toppings, and just the right amount of toppings. And considering the size of the portion (and the quality of the toppings), the price isn't all that bad. Other menu items are ok, but it is the nachos that keep me coming back.

Now, praise of the nachos aside, I don't care for their margaritas, the service can be spotty, and it can be too loud and obnoxious for me at peak times. But if you come in before the dinner rush, sit at the bar, and order the nachos, it can be just right.
