Very solid restaurant worth checking out in downtown. Hopefully this will help lead to a resurgence of downtown dining and business outside of the Fremont Street hotels and casinos.
The points people make about the cost are somewhat valid, but this isn't a taqueria, this is much more of a chef driven better quality restaurant. Puerco ahumado was $15, but for a huge portion of smoked pork in a mole`. Great taste. At $11 for 2 the tacos are overpriced, but are high quality so you are getting what you pay for. My usual taqueria has all tacos for $1.30, so I feel the price point issue like everyone else.
These are modern/upscale versions of Mexican food, so don't come here and expect it to be "authentic" (see my comment about $1.30 tacos above for my idea of Mexican American food, but there are lots of variations on Mexican cuisine, including fine dining in Mexico so what really is "authentic"?).
Nice place, communal seating, very nice looking antique-ish back bar, and very good service make this place worth checking out. The drinks are interesting, and they have a massive selection of tequilas (up to $100) to try if you're interested in something other than Jose Cuervo.
Taqueria or Taco Bell vs. upscale Mexican, the choice is up to you. If you want better than the former 2 this place is worth visiting.
