We've been to Dos Gringos twice now.  Once on a Saturday afternoon and then last night (a Friday).  I've enjoyed myself both times.  They've got a great patio....lots of tables, misters and fans.  The Saturday afternoon was very mellow.  Not many people there....outside anyways.  Margs were decent....so was the food.  Nothing spectacular though.

Last night we got there during happy hour.  There were plenty of tables available, and we had a bunch of $3 margs and $5 appetizers.  They also had a really fun band, but they were unfortunately done playing by like 9pm.  Wish they could have played longer but I guess there's a DJ there later.

Overall, a fun place.  I didn't see anyone behaving badly, but we left by 10pm.  There were all different types of people...all different ages.  Maybe things get a little crazier as it gets later.  Don't know.  We'll definitely be back though!
