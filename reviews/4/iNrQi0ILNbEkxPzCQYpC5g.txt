Great random burrito today in the heart of Phoenix, Mexico. When your driving around this part of town, it is either tortas, tacos or burrito's. Now this joint has locations all over the Valley, so I was just expecting another standard grease bomb. No fast food Mexican places use white meat chicken, but the pollo asado here is all white and it was simply placed in a burro with guacamole and pico de gallo. It was a large item and a great value at 6 bucks. Not sure why this burro was so good, but it hit the spot and did not even need any of the salsa that was available. The interior at lunch is full of working class dudes (mostly Mexican), but at least on this day at this location this burrito was excellent.
