My sisters and I went here yesterday, Sunday at 2pm.  My one sister lives close by so she has been a few times already.   To our surprise they were still very busy.  We had a 15-20 minute wait but it actually took 30 minutes to be seated. 

As we waited even more people came in.  It was so packed that we thought, "Damn this place must be really good".

Our beverage order was taken and brought promptly.    The time between ordering our food and getting it was only about 10 minutes or so.  For it being so crowded I thought we'd have to wait much longer.  

I ordered the chicken chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese on top with a side of rice and beans.  Yummy.  The cream cheese gives it the extra flavor that just makes the chimi oh so good.   Everything had so much flavor.  Nothing bland here. 
 The best Mexican food I have tasted.  

The two sisters shared a plate which had, 1 toastada, 1 machaca taco, 1 beef enchilada, rice and beans.  They too enjoyed their food.  My one sister doesn't care for red enchilada sauce, however, the way Popo's makes theirs, is different.  It doesn't have that strong red flavor.  It's tones downed with something else.  

Everything was delicious.  I wish we had one close to where I live.  

I knocked a star off bc the staff could be a bit more friendly.  There were no friendly smiles here to be found.  They weren't rude, but not friendly either.
