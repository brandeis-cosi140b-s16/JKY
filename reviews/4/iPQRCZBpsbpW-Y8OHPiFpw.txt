What a gorgeous and unique restaurant! I love the pond in the middle where you can feed the ducks, turtles and koi fish. Well, that was my son's favorite part :-). They also have someone playing the guitar and a dancer who performs. I don't know what you call that type of dancer but it's the type that clicks the little wooden things in her hands. My son loved watching her dance and even joined her! It was really cute. This place is always busy and you usually have to wait quite a while to get a seat especially on the weekends (that's the reason for only 4 stars). The food is really good too, but this place is all about the atmosphere.
