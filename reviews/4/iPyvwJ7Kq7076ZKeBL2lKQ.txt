My 2nd favorite taco place in Vegas behind Tacos el Gordo.
Basically, soft tacos cost $1 and you can choose from asada, pastor, carnitas, chicken, and a couple others.  They also make great tortas, quesadillas, and some other things I don't know the name for.  
Great salsa bar that has, thank God, pico de gallo.  Most places just have the runny salsas - but I like the chunky pico de gallo.  Adds a lot of crispiness and freshness to any mexican food.
I also love their burritos - just meat, rice, beans, and salsa.  Highly recommended for cheap eats.
