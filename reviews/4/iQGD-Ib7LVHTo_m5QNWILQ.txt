To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised by this place.
We were craving Mexican food, and happened upon this place with Yelp's help as well as proper timing. Most other places that were closer were closed. So whatever, this place had a few reviews.
The exterior isn't something to be admired, but I never count that into a place. If it's got good food and good service, it hits the mark for me. The food was more than I could ask for. The portions were huge, the food was fresh (save one of my enchilada tortillas that was stale on one half), and the plates looked really delicious (plating, garnish, and array of color). The menu was huge, and I could see myself ordering something different every time.
The service left a little wanting. Our waitress didn't come by often which led to empty waters constantly. 
The only reason this gets a four out of five is that the service wasn't top mark, and the one enchilada out of three was slightly stale. 
Would I go back? Most assuredly. This will be my stop for Mexican from now on.
