We decided to have Mexican food at Que Bueno's before the "trick or treat" kids came to the house. 
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. The server was friendly and really paid close attention to us, filling our drink and water glasses without having to ask. I had the Sanchez Special which was two enchiladas, one with chicken and the other with shredded beef covered with a cream of mushroom sauce. The enchildadas were packed full of meat and flavor. My wife had the taco and enchilada which were just as good. Not a bad place for good food, friendly and fast service.
