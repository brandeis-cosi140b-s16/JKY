Some of the best margaritas I've ever had. Even the simple 'classic' is dream-worthy. 

Great chips and salsa to start.  Lots of vegetarian and fresher-fare options. The Mahi Mahi on greens was amazing, great flavor and perfectly done.
Enchiladas are a bit heavy for a hot summer afternoon.

Genuine, kind service. 
Another win for FRC.
