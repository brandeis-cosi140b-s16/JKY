I have a fairly crappy memory, so I prefer to write reviews while I'm here.
I have never been here and decided to drop by with my girls (aka Crickettes) to check it out.
Very friendly and not busy at all. Sat us right away exactly where we wanted. They have the children's menus on the back of a couple of kids' books which is awesome.
Chips are typical and sauce is smokey but not very spicy. They did offer mild for the Crickettes immediately. Didn't have to ask.
Awesome.
Oh and the coup d'Ã©tat... They have paella!!!
You do have to wait a little longer... about 25 min. Probably not the best idea when dining as the only adult with two small children.
Ok. Got my paella. I would say 3.9/5 stars.
But since it is 1 of 2 restaurants in town that serves paella.... I'll take it and I'll be back.
Oh... Worth mentioning: Sandra was pretty axing considering she was new.
