It's the crazy chicken. You know what to expect when you go here. For those who don't know what to expect, it's a Mexican/American fast food restaurant that serves some satisfying flame grilled chicken at a low price. Remember that I said fast food, so this means it can potentially come with bad service (depending on the cashier) and crazy customers. I really do like this location though. I think I come here at least 1x/every week or every other week to get a fix of my pollo bowl, overly sweetened horchata, and some bomb guacamole salsa (I seriously think this is one of the best salsas I have ever had) 

They also have some great $5 deals going on every now and then. Not to mention the coupons they constantly give you for family meals and other smaller items. They also have a "dollar" menu but they are priced starting at $1.14 for a chicken taco, flan, a piece of chicken leg (yes just the leg), churros, and other things. It's quite a value meal deal. To me, if you don't like El Pollo Loco, then maybe your palate is just too fancy or just plain wrong. I support the crazy chicken!
