For Pittsburgh I am giving this four stars, there isn't much for mexican food here and that ain't lyin.

I got the stuffed Pico de Gallo and it was yummy, also tasted the Chimichunga platter mmmm no problems with flavoring. Way more authentic than Mad Mex, For example I cannot even find Pico De Gallo on most menus at "mexican restaurants" here let alone a whole pepper stuffed.

The portions are huge but they suffice, the service was good a little slow on gettin gour checks. Margaritas were not great stick with beer. I am not sure why all the bad Yelp reviews? I mean there are actual brown people working here, its a mexican restaurant and yes Pittsburgh sometimes brown people have accents.
