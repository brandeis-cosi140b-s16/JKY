Enjoyed our dinner there. Great service, good and prices. Had 1/2 dozen oysters with ceviche on top, grilled langastino with garlic butter, fried ice cream and strawberry margarita. Seafood was flavorful and fresh! Bill was only $40 for everything! There was a guitar player there, music a bit loud for my taste and they went around asking for tips.
