Their mole chicken was amazing and HUGE! Again, if I wasn't staying at the hotel on business, I would have packed that bad boy up for lunch the next day. The chicken was cooked perfectly - crispy skin and juicy on the inside. I'm a big fan of Mary Sue and Susan, so I will visit their restaurants any chance I get. So far, I have not been disappointed.
