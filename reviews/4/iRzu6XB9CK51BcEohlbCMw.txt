One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!  Their margaritas are top notch... homemade chips and killer salsa!  I am a fan of the bean burrito, fajitas (the meat is so tender and flavorful!) and pollo fundido.  A word of advice, chicken and pollo are different here.  Pay extra for the pollo.  If you can get a seat in the bar, enjoy their happy hour specials.  I love you Valle Luna!
