I love this Oakland location. As college students at Carnegie Mellon, we used to swing by here allllll the time for the half off big azz margs after 10PM and half off food at 11PM (which is totally the best way to motivate college students to frequent your restaurant).

This place is a must for margaritas! Some margs change based on the season, but all will knock you over! They are STRONG, but do not taste strong - so watch out!

My fave has and always will be the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito with chicken. Om nom nom. 

And you can't beat Pittsburgh prices. You just can't.
