Seeing as how I've been here multiple times, the only rating that seems fitting is the four star 'yay! I'm a fan' rating.  In their adherence to regional style (sonoran style cuisine), Ochoa's par for the course.  Decent-to-good red chile, good enchilada sauce, super-econo lunch special (not plural).

Their lunch special consists of a choice of three items from the usual list of suspects: cheese enchilada, tostada, taco (soft or crispy), tamale, rice or beans.  I think there are a few other choices.  What's nice is you can simply get three tacos and no rice or beans, if you're not one to eat rice and beans.  Or you can get two cheese enchiladas and rice.  Whatever.  The lunch special will run you about $6 plus a drink.

In terms of location, good luck finding this place if you're not from the area.  Atmosphere?  It's a dive, no bells or whistles.  Both of these aspects are major pluses in my book.  

Also, anytime I've been here the service is fast.  I've had my meal within ten minutes (or less) from the time I've ordered it.  And it's been served with the cliche' adage, "These plates are hot so be careful."

On the down side, the salsa is hit or miss.  There have been a couple times when I've been there when the salsa tasted like it could have been expired.  Then again, I went the other day and it was fresh.  You'll be able to tell.  It hasn't stopped me from returning.

Now then, if it's just you and an acquaintance and you want to try a spot that is 'authentic' and low key, this is the place.  If you're looking for someplace a little bit nicer with marginally upscale entrees, this ain't it.  

For me, Garcia's (the chain) vs. Ochoa's.....Ochoa's.  However, Ochoa's vs. Carolina's,...pssshh, Carolina's.
