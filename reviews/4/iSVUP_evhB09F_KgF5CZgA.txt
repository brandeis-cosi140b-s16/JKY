The Pico de gallo is gone, the water cups are big again and they have new green number tents.

Not much else has changed sinch my last review update. The flour tortilla chips are still the gem here. 

The red picante sauce is smooth and good enough to drink.

Al la carte is still where the deals are at.

The Patio is the place to be in this weather.

Chillie rellleno burrito is still eggy and unique.
