This small taco shop, open less than a week as of this writing, oozes with potential. 

The good? Quality ingredients. Clean functional d√©cor (Chipotle-like rather than Mexican taco shop). Friendly service. A simple menu with lots of variety. Indoor and outdoor seating. Breakfast available. Television. Great location on University just west of ASU.

The not so good? The taco sauce, both green and red, lacked flavor. Definitely needs to be addressed with a reappraisal of these sauces or with more variety. A salsa bar would be ideal. This is Arizona and we are used to heat in our Mexican food. I loved what I ordered and look forward to exploring the rest of the menu, but the taco sauce...

The specials seem to be the best values. The #1 (three tacos, rice, beans, tortilla and drink for ten bucks) is a much more substantial meal than ordering tacos ala carte. My taco was not nearly as generously filled as those in the photo posted on Yelp, an understandable consistency issue I suppose for a restaurant still in training and development mode. The tacos, however, are sized more like street tacos, so at $2.75 each it's important that they be generously filled if the nearby starving student population is going to be attracted.

I'm giving Taco Shack the benefit of the doubt in the star rating because the restaurant is so new. Hopefully I'll be rewarded over time.
