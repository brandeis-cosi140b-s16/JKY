Great spicy Mexican food! I'm always looking for something other than standard options, and they have enough variety to keep it interesting. The jalapeno poppers are hand-breaded and stuffed with cream cheese, which is the best way to do it! They're closed on Sundays and have some weird hours, so I check yelp before wasting any more time driving up there only to be disappointed.
