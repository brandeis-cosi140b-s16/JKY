I finally stopped by Pitic as I was traveling along I-17.  I sometimes find myself watching ch. 38 and singing along with old-time favorite videos from my youth.  Of course if any of you have ever tuned to ch. 38 you've seen the commercial for this restaurant as it's played like every other commercial.  I never gave it much of a thought until I saw some good yelp reviews.

I walked in at 5pm on Sunday and there was only one table with people, the rest of the place was empty.  A very beautiful sweet lady seated me and recommended the #8 combo.  I never stray if a server recommends something in particular.  It was a great way to sample a shredded beef taco, chile relleno and cheese enchilada.

First the taco....BOMB BOMB!  The hard shell corn tortilla was incredible!  The beef was so juicy and tender, loved every bite.  The cheese enchiliada was good, but what made it so good was the homemade enchilada sauce.  Now the chile relleno....superb.  I swear there must be a Mexican grandma back in the kitchen making different sauces.  The sauce on the relleno was to die for.

When I'm in the neighborhood and not in the mood to stand in line at Carolina's or wait for a table at Comedor Guadalajara, I'll stop in at Pitic.  Don't let the bars on the windows scare you!!!
