Is this the only Zaba's in Las Vegas? If it is, I am lucky enough to have it located on my side of town. In fact, besides the Chipotle in the UNLV area, this is the closest place I can go to get a nice, big, yum-tastic burrito.

Mainly I go to Zaba's for chicken burritos. I rarely deviate. It's the same with Chipotle and Qdoba. What can I say? I guess I am a creature of habit. But how can I not be when the delicious chicken, rice, beans, salsa, cheese, and sour cream are all delightfully wrapped up in an easy to handle and nom on burrito?

Zaba's is slightly different from other similar Mexican chains. I do believe they are locally owned (sorry if I'm mistaken in that). They also offer wheat tortillas (for no extra charge). I've never had a problem with service at this location. It's quick, efficient and for the most part the staff is friendly. 

Still, my favorite burrito-go-to is Qdoba. However, Zaba's IS good and its location so close to me makes it a favorite spot of mine.
