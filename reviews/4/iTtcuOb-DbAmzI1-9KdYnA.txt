I went to this place on the recommendation of a friend, and was not disappointed.  The sign reads "Mexican inspired cuisine" and, looking at the menu, the description seems to show in the form of a list of specialty items that are fusion dishes.  They do have more traditional Mexican dishes as well.

I can't personally speak to the quality of the fusion dishes, but the more traditional fare is quite good.  The service is excellent as well.  I'll definitely come back there when I'm in town again.
