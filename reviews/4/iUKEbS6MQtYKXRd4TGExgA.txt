They are trying really hard to be a higher class of Mexican restaurant, from the displayed special in the entry way to the theme dressed hostess and waitstaff and even the fresh guacamole cart that wanders the restauant (dude, get a tip jar, that plastic bucket thing is tacky).

The food is very good, as good as any other Mexican I've had in the Charlotte area. I had a shredded pork burrito, which was served with a generous portion of rice and beans though a small dash of guacamole on top. We also had a bowl of hot queso to go with the chips, but the bowl used to serve cooled off quickly, ending up with a chilled mass of mushy cheese.

The margarita was maybe not as strong as it could have been, served in a fishbowl sized glass with a wedge of lime. The follow-up beer was served with a chilled and frosty mug.

The prices were pretty good, maybe more expensive than the usual Mexican place, but they are a higher class of restaurant and so it was deserved. Would I return? Probably yes.
