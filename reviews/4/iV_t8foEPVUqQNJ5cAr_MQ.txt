Erickbertos is so clean that you wouldn't think the food was any good but we haven't been disappointed with anything we've ordered.  Favorites are of course CA and carnitas burritos.  Yesterday I took a chance on a lengua taco with a backup of a carnitas taco in case.  The lengua could have used a bit more seasoning but the texture was perfect.  Both tacos were so stuffed that I had to eat a lot of the filling with a fork before I could fold the tortillas enough to eat by hand.  My husband had his usual CA burrito.  Bill was a whopping $11.43 and we ate way too much.
