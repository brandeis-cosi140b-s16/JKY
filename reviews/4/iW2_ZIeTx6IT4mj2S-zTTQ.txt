We recently moved to the San Tan area and are so glad there is a Morenos here. We usually go to the one on Gilbert and Germann. I am happy to say that this one is just as good. Fajitas were great as always, and the staff are very nice. So glad we don't have to drive all the way to Chandler for Morenos!
