Here for dinner in April and had taken friends from east coast to lunch in February.  Never a problem with seating even when crowded.  Nice outdoor area. Everyone loved their food, but made traditional mexican choices.  Their guacamole is luscious and prickly pear margaritas very tasty.  Reliable favorite.
