I lived in New Mexico very close to the Mexican border for 10years. Good Mexican food in Las Vegas is not easy to fin which has always shocked me. This place is WONDERFUL! Don't judge them by only what is on the menu. They have things for the gringos but also for the die hard Mexican food lovers as well...you may just have to ask! I asked for a spicier salsa and was given the most incredible spicy pico de gallo I've ever had! Friendly service and good food and it's NOT crazy Vegas prices! We plan on coming here regularly!
