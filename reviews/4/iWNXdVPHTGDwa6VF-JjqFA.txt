Apparently I've stayed away from chains a little too long, because I didn't realize what I was missing. "gave-in" if you will on a trip and agreed to eat at a major chain restaurant (which I rarely, if ever, do). Wow, was I surprised. The chips came out hot and well salted, the service was prompt, courteous, and actually quite enjoyable. The menu isn't your boring fake Mexican food and had plenty of both traditional, healthy, and gourmet options. Since I was in a "give it a shot" mood, we sampled the ultimate loaded queso and could really have made a meal out of that. Not your typical white cheese boring, this conglomerate of cheese, refried beans, guac, beef, sour cream, and deliciousness was very tasty. For the entree, opted for the enchilada trio and was in heaven with the barbacoa, green-chili chicken, and sour cream version. Also sampled some of the tamales and while non-traditional, had a great flavor and the pork was very tender.

I don't normally say this, but this is one chain I wouldn't mind giving repeat business too! (and already have once before I could write this)
