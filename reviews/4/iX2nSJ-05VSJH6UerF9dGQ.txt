FINALLY, it took me two weeks to get to this place. Why? It closes at 4? PLEASE open till 5 or 5:30.

I am talking about the grocery store. I NEED good tortillas and YOU guys are, so it seems, the only place in PGH that has them.

And man, they ARE good.

The hot sauce selection is amazing as well. I kind of just wish you would treat this like a "real" grocery and not make it some tourist trap in the strip...some of us have legitimate Mexican food needs and you, apparently, are it.
