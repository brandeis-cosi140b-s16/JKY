I really do enjoy this place. As a business traveler if you find yourself returning to the same spot rather than seeking out new locations, you know that there has to be something special about it. 

Lets start with the salsas. Obviously homemade you get a red salsa with a bit of a kick and a refried bean salsa. I'm not the biggest refried bean gal, but I do really like this salsa. Last time I was here I finished that bowl...

I had 2 enchiladas with mole sauce and carne which the meat was perfectly seasoned and the cheese was stretching out of the enchiladas like a perfectly melted cheese should. Mole sauce had great flavor and punch and elevated the enchiladas to a new level.

Service was great, the lone guitarist was playing all night long and everyone was super friendly. Great atmosphere and highly recommended.
