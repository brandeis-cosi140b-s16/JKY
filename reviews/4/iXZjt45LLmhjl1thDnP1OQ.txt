Yeah, I'm giving 4 stars to a freaking Taco Bell. This Taco Bell is so nice and pretty that I feel the need to dress up a bit (wearing pajamas whilst going through the drive-thru here just seems too grungy). It's on the newer side. The staff are some of the best and most professional I've ever seen at a fast food joint. And the service is always friendly, quick, and accurate. So yeah, it kinda earns 4 stars.
