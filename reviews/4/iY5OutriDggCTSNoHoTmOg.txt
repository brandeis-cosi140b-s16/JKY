Food was good with a nice hot sauce and chips to start! It's hard to find a good hot sauce that tastes great and has a kick!
Server in the bar was attentive, but it was also a late lunch.
The waitress told me to come by on a day off or after work bc they have $3 Dos Equis drafts every day all day.
I'd come back if on this side of town again for lunch, fast service as well.
