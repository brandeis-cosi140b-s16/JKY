I'm torn between 3 or 4 stars but keeping it generous with 4. 

Traditional Mexican food place with older decor. Nothing fancy but it's fun because it's been here forever. I had the green corn tamales with beans and rice and thought it was very good. Fresh, well made, and tasty. Of course the Gold Margarita (with an extra shot on the side) may have influenced my taste buds. 

Another reason for the extra star was the fast efficient service. We were a group of 7 and everything went smoothly. Drinks and chips served quickly. All our meals arrived together so we could all start digging in without having to wait for the one delinquent taco platter! 

Nice traditional Mexican dining experience. I'll be back.
