HANDS DOWN, BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES EVER!  Yes, I went here at 5am.  Yes, I was drunk.  But still..best carne asada fries ever!  My first time in Vegas and my friend who lives out there took me to this spot after the club.  I couldn't even finish it, but I did kill it the next day.  And they were just as good if not better the 2nd day.  I also had a taste of the carne asada burrito-and yes, that was also a 10.
