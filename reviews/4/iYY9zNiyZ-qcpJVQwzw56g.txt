If you want to taste the best guacamole of your life, this is where you need to go. Hands down best I have ever had. I just go for their guacamole and homemade tortilla chips. Their burritos are great too, except their veggie burrito. The veggie burrito is pretty bland and it doesnt have their awesome guacamole. This is a great hole in the wall that serves real Mexican food. I have ordered from them for school meetings and they have been very organized and on top of things. You can count on them for your party food.
