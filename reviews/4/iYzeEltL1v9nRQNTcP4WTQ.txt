I stopped in after taking a final exam for their buy 2 tacos get 1 free Hooked deal.

I got a carne asada, a pastor and a chorizo taco. 

Out of all these, I would say the pastor was the best. The steak was decent, but not as flavorful as the pastor, and the chorizo was tasty, but in my opinion very very salty and greasy.

I make my own guacamole at home but ran out of chips, so I tried to order an extra side of chips at Maize. I thought the cashier understood what I wanted, but instead she gave me extra cups of salsa, and I didn't realize it until I got home. Oops!

The tacos were still pretty good and I'd say Maize is still one of the best spots for Mexican food at UIUC.
