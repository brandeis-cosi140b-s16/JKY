I purchased a groupon awhile back when they first opened and I'm finally getting around to using it. This place is located in a very small strip mall behind the gas station. The Christmas lights strung in the window is what caught my eye and led me here. 

We were warmly greeted by a husband and wife team. We were the only diners at the time, he gave us a very thorough run down of the menu items and had suggested the CC Sizzle, we picked Nacho Style. This was delicious. It was a blend of meat with onions, cabbage and cheese over their homemade tortilla chips. Our second item was the Green Chile Enchiladas, made with Hatch green chili's and chicken with creamy chili's sauce. I couldn't decide which one I liked more. 

We ended the meal with Sopaipillas. Probably one of the best I've ever tasted. I like mine with honey, and they had a few different types to choose from. 

This place is really casual. Even if you're dining in, your food is served in styrofoam to go container. The soda fountain wasn't working when we were there, bummer, I like a nice cold Coke when I'm eating Mexican food (only time I like soda). The owners were really nice, he was telling us all about where they're from in NM. I'm definitely planning to return and try some of their other dishes.
