I wouldn't normally review a chain restaurant, but this one is literally around the corner from me. In the year or so since they've opened this location, I've always received friendly, speedy, good service & my orders have been spot on! 

Great location too, there's a self serve frozen yogurt place down the sidewalk for dessert & other foodie places if your friends all don't agree on one place to eat :) 

The bowls & soft tacos are my personal favorites.
