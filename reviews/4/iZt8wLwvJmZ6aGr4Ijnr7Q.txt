Came for my first Taco Tuesday (ever). Sat by the bar -  the bartenders were nice and always kept a good eye on our beer.  Husband and I tried a bunch of tacos. The $2 ones were okay, but we both like the $1 tacos and ordered a second round of them. The crowd was mixed as far as age is concerned. Overall loved the experience!
