This is a great spot to hit up after the gym. It's located near LVAC on the South West Side at I-215 & Flamingo. It has ample seating and there are a few tables outside the front door if you want to eat outside.

You line up to order your food and they make your food to order as you move down the line. You pick the ingredients you want in your burrito, taco, etc....and you pay at the end of the line. I like it here because they have grilled chicken, veggies, brown rice, and other healthy ingredients. You can also get bowls if you don't want the wraps. The portions are more than enough. I can't even finish a burrito there. The tacos are also very good. You get a choice of soft or hard shells.

Stop in if you want a healthy meal after the gym.
