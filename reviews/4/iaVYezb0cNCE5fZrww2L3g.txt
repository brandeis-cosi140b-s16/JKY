We travel all over the country, love to try new places, as much for the ambiance (almost) as for the food. 

Love Mamita's - you never know who you may run into. Locals, tourists, Buffalo Soldiers. 

Big screen TV playing Michael Jackson videos or a Carlos Santana video. Decorated with Cuban and Mexican chatchkes. 

The food is great. My husband loves the chiles rellenos, I go for the burritos. We bring everyone there when they come to visit. 

It's an adventure every time, and an inexpensive one at that. Go!
