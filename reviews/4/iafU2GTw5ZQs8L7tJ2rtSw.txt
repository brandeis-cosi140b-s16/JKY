This is one of our local lunch and sometimes-post-gym spots, so my review has been long overdue.

Although the food seems somewhat pricey, especially the carne asada fries (never ordering that again when I can just get the carne asada torta w/ fries and a drink special), I have generally had pretty solid experiences here. The food is flavorful and the portions are reasonable. It might not be as "authentic" as some non-chain places, but it generally hits the spot and I don't mind eating here when Ross J's and Chicken Shack get a little boring or just aren't open late at night.

Overall, this is not a go-out-of-your-way destination, but a good local spot for Mexican food.
