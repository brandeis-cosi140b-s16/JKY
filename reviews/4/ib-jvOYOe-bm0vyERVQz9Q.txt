Our morning at work consists of Getting set up and preparing for the daily business prior to opening our doors and a few other small things. But most importantly we have to all come to Agreement on what to eat for lunch.. Well today we had a tough time figuring it out but the underlying theme was Mexican. Someone shouted Chipotle, then someone shouted, " Ugghhhhh, are you serious?" Then From the other side of the building you hear a faint, " Baja Fresh", and again you hear, " What? Are you kidding me?" and finally someone suggested Rubios and there was a moment of silence and  the tension in the room Mellowed and the calmness of Agreement was among us. 

We all put our orders down and I chose to devour a Veggie burrito. Veggie Burrito? You ask... Yep, Portabellos, peppers, beans, rice, and a nice kick to the hot salsa i had them add. Once the order arrived in our office we all headed back to the lunch table like a heard of Lions to a large................. salad..... Okay i know lions don't eat salad but just in case you are reading this as a bedtime story to your kid i did not want to say we headed to them like lions on zebra.. Moving on. The Burrito was plentiful, and they did not skimp on the portabello which i have to be honest I was expecting. This thing was stuffed like a thanksgiving burrito and was really really filling. Everyone elses food looked great and smelled great as well. I now think that this is going to be moved a little closer to the top of our lunch picks for the future feasts. 

If you have not been here, and are in a hurry and like Veggies i would recommend trying out the Veggie burrito that they execute with perfection.
