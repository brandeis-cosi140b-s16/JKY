As an avid Chipotle-goer, I'm rather fond of this location. The locale is perfect to stop by for a quick lunch or dinner on the way home. All of the Chipotle oldies and goldies are here. Massive burritos and perky salsas. 

The manager of this location is stellar. She is so kind and always loves to chit chat. Very ship shape shop. No complaints! The outdoor patio is very cozy and quaint. 

The only gripe with this location is the entrance/exit. Good luck getting back onto 51 if traffic is heavy. Near impossible to make a quick turn and head towards 485/Park Rd. Also, if traffic is moving, you'll most likely never be able to make a left turn onto 51 without a never ending line of cars waiting and honking behind you. Beware! It's a tough one!
