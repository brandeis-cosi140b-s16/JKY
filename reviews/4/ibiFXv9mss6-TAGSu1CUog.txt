$3 Coronas ALL OF THE TIME. 

If I lived closer to it, this would be a regular hangout for me. It's big and airy and open, but has a dance floor that I even stomp on occasionally (see above: $3 Coronas). 

It's a good spot to people watch or party in a big or small group. It's as laid-back as its Scottsdale location, with even more of the simplicity and openness that makes the whole thing work.
