24 Hour Mexican Joint! A plus! I love getting off work at 2-3 A.M. and being able to stop by this place for a late night meal. On Monday's it is buy one get one for Military Personnel and I definitely take advantage of that. The menu had a good variety to it but I love their Pollo Asado plate with a large Horchata. I will always be a regular here as long as it's on my way home.
