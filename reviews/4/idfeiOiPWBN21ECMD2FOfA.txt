After trying various menu items, my favorites are still the breakfast burritos (Either with bacon if you are in a meaty mood, or the bean with added potato), the shrimp diablo burrito (Piquant and spicy!), and surprisingly, the veggie burrito, which is a flavorful and filling mix of veggies, beans, and rice. As for the salsas, I like it, as people say from New Mexico, "Christmas-style", putting both red and green salsas on my burritos!
