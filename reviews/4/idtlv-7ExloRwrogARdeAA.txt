First time here.. Kept an open mind.

My mind was blown! I got the Soup of the Day and The Guild Chicken Taco. The taco itself looked pretty good but when I tasted it, it was gone within a matter of seconds. After I wanted another one it was that good. 
The soup was a beef and veggie soup, overall it was soup. The beef had a good taste to it and the cast iron bowl it came in was convenient and kept my soup nice and hot. 
The Hubs got a smoked pork torta. Which he thought was good as well.. 

My favorite part was the chips and salsa. I make homemade salsa all the time and am usually doctoring up restaurant salsa but this one. Nothing to change it was great! Spicy, Peppery. And just right! 

The only reason why I did not give a 5th star was due to the long wait. We asked our waiter for the check and it took him about 5 min to do so. Which we were in a rush that's why we asked. But besides that everything was good! 

Next time I will plan better but definitely going back.
