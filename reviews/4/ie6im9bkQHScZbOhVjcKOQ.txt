This is definitely one of my favorite late night, bad decision dining choices. I love the rolled beef tacos smothered in guacamole and cheese. Carne Asada tacos or tostada. The carne Asada nachos are awesome, but you need someone to share them. The green sauce salsa is my favorite. I could almost drink it. I eat here often enough but I never really thought about writing a review. I mean everyone knows what they are getting with a place like this, but the last time I was there, I changed my mind. The counter guy seriously washed his hands at least 3 times while I was there. I was the only customer. I was very impressed with this excellent display of good sanitation. He washed his hands before he took my order, after he took my order and again before he handed me my food. Cleanliness like this really makes me confident in a place.
