We made our first visit to Cabo wabo this past weekend. We were able to get right in and seated quickly. Service was friendly and fast. The food portions are huge. We could have easily shared a meal. My mom ordered the jack and coke ribs (it's a full slab, but they don't tell you!!!) and I ordered the portabello mushroom fajitas. Both entrees were good, but I favored my mom's jack and coke ribs. The ribs were tender and the flavor was phenomenal. The portabello fajitas were good as well. We did not think the prices were outrageous as others have claimed. It's the Las Vegas strip, unless you eat at McDonalds there are not really any "cheap" places to eat.  We did purchase a Groupon but would eat there again without one.
