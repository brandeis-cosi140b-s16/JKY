The only reason I had not been into La Paz's new location any sooner is because of some of the bad reviews on here. What's up with that? I didn't grow up on Mexican home-cooking, but I thought my lunch was delicious and I will absolutely be back. 

The chips and salsa were promptly brought to the table and were in my opinion, delicious. The chips were just salty enough and had a great corn flavor. Not greasy and stale like some Mexican restaurants. I loved the salsa, which was flavorful and not watery (a HUGE pet peeve).  The side of guac we ordered was up to par with fresh chunks of avocado so you know it was not from a bag (or if it was, how can I get my hands on that fresh avocado chunk bag?)

For my entree, I ordered the Baja Fish Tacos, with sauteed shrimp, ginger lime cabbage and mango salsa.  You had me at ginger lime cabbage.  This was seriously great! It was creative, flavorful and down right delicious. I had black beans as my side, served with a healthy sprinkling of cheese.  

The Cucumberita was my refreshment of choice (because it's 5:00 somewhere??). A delicious margarita with an extra pop of flavor from muddled cucumbers. An excellent choice if you are looking to mix up your traditional margarita. 

I had eaten at the old La Paz on South Blvd. and actually thought this was better. Maybe it was what I ordered? If that is the case, get what I had and you won't be disappointed.
