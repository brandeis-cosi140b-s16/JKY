First off let me say this.  It's not Roberto's so I don't want to hear it. If you want Roberto's go there. That being said : We love this place. This is the only location so far which means the food is all made there. They have enough choices to choose from and most people won't need to ask "What's in that?" The food is good and the portions are large. You can choose the meat and add pico free but sour cream and guacamole cost more. I don't use that fattening crappie so no big. Since they make their own salsa, hot and mild, it is consistent and the salsa bar has chopped onion, cilantro and then sliced jalape√±os so how can you go wrong. It is a small place and no real decor but go there to eat and leave. I won't talk about individual items because I mostly get the same things but family members are all over the menu without complaint. Just reviewing this has me wanting 2 chicken tacos so don't be surprised if you see a check in here from me tonight. Ciao........ Down!!!
