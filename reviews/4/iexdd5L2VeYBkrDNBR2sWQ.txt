I always love going to the oyster bar (Costa Del Sol) at Sunset Station. For a casino restaurant, it is incredible. The oysters (probably my favorite food on planet earth) are really great and always larger and fresher than expected. The boils are out of this world, and the gumbo is super extra yummy. And their crowning achievement in my mind? The AMAZING bananas foster. This is without a doubt the largest bananas foster I have ever seen, it is more than my  husband and I can finish. Mmmmm I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
