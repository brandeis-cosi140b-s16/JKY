Parking is a bitch, but this place is worth it! This place, scratch that, ALL their locations, are absurdly busy at lunch time, but it beats the usual downtown lunch grinds. 7th Ave location also has a great outdoor patio, so perfect for the unbeatable valley weather. Misters will be on full blast during the summer. Inside, it's a bit cramped, so I always try to sit outside (unless it's 110 out). 

Love love love the Al Pastor tacos, and their chips and salsa are also great! Mexican cokes, HELL YA. Carne asada is dope. The beans are also legit. They also have some pretty good ceviche and margaritas. Happy hour here is worth a check out. 

**Secret menu item- America's Favorites. Great for 2 people, gets you 2 al pastor tacos and 2 burritos. You can also substitute for whatever meat you want. Add in 2 drinks and it's ~$20.
