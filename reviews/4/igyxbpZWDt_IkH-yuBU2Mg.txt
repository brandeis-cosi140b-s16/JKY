Okay, so this is a two-fold review.  The green chili chimichanga is one of the top plates in the state.  Almost other-worldly.  The service is very much hit and miss though....sometimes excellent, sometimes really poor.   Still, an institution in the valley and a top spot for great salsa, chimichangas, machaca, and spirits.
