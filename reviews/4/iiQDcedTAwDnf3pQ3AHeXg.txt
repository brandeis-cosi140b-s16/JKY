I love this place. You have to know what to order, or else it seems like you get nickel and dimed for extras. I have eaten here as many as four times in one week. Four! I highly recommend the shredded beef salad with hot salsa, fajita vegetables and guacamole. It is paleo-friendly and delicious.  They raised their prices a few months ago, but this is still a great meal at a reasonable price. They don't make their tortillas like Cafe Rio, but I don't eat the tortillas anyway. I don't care for the chicken at all, because it includes the leg and thigh meat and I prefer white meat only. It is a little thing, but I just can't stand it.  One of these days I am going to get one of their coaster-sized double chocolate brownies.
