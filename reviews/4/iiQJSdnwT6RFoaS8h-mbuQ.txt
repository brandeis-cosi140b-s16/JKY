So, yes the food is good and the prices were very reasonable. The Surf & Turf Taco was scrumptious. The special white sauce is a mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream. The fish taco was ok, but I'm not a fish taco lover to begin with. I also ordered the shredded beef flauta... The beef was excellent tasting, but the fried tortilla outside was very fried, very oily, so I peeled it off and just ate the beef. The place looks clean and the staff is relatively nice.
