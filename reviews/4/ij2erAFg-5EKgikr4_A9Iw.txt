I've been to Otro a few times now and I have always received excellent service. I've sat at the bar, in the dining room and most recently on the patio. Every time the server has been friendly and attentive. Way to go Otro! In the same vein of Gallo Blano the tortas and tacos are excellent I don't have a favorite, I love them all. 

On my last visit I had the carne asada burrito and it was HUGE, I washed it down with a $4 Negro Modello and left full and happy. Ole!~
