This is a Las Vegas based chain of a build your own burritos/bowls/tacos. It's similar to Chipotle but with a few additional toppings (e.g. potatoes, sweet potatoes, more sauces). I like that they have a rewards card and kids eat free on Sundays. I've been to 3 locations--they all provided quick service and were very clean.
