Moe's-Shmoe's! Nah I love this place! Honestly, if you're looking for a well balanced meal with healthy options galore I think this is the best option. For me, it's close to home to boot. Gluten-free, hormone-free, organic, vegetarian/vegan - all these are options on the Moe's menu. My personal favorite is the standard burrito on a whole-wheat wrap loaded with chicken, brown rice, black beans and at least one (probably two!) of Moe's signature salsa-style veggie goulashes. Think pico de gallo and then some. And I'm certainly an add-vocado kinda guy. (Sorry Subway, I'm stealing this. It's witty. Be happy.)

Skip all the food court fare at Northlake and stop into Moe's on your way home from the mall and get a seriously healthy, seriously filling meal instead. I guess my next step to healthy-living would be to actually walk over here from home. Sounds like a day unwasted!
