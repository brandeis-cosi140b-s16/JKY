The mariscos here were hella good! I had an absolutely great ceviche and some bomb ass oysters! the margaritas were ok all though I prefer the aguas frescas. The limonadas are especially delicious!  

There was a live Banda Sinaloense playing and it was pretty loud. They were talented although not a full nor authentic Banda, but we aren't judging on the music but the food!
