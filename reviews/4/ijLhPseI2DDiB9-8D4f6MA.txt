We went to Blanco on a Saturday around 11:30 for lunch. The place was jam packed! If it isn't a scorcher outside, find a shady spot on the patio- the cushioned patio furniture is super comfy and the misters make the heat a little more tolerable. 

Definitely have the guacamole! It's fresh and flavorful and a good accompaniment to the chips and salsa. The cheese crisps are a must- kind of a Mexican flatbread the size of a medium pizza. The street tacos were good- tiny, but good! Several unique drink options are on the menu. The mixed berry marg seemed to be the crowd favorite. Give Blanco a shot if you're in the mood for Mexican!
