Coworkers introduced me to this place.  The food is really good.  Not that I would know, but seems authentic Mexican.  (Taco Bell does not have beef tongue soup on the menu.)  I usually get the quesadilla and wash it down with a horchata.  The quesadilla is thick and flavorful.  Lots of cheese and meat.  I have also had a couple of their sandwiches, but cannot remember their name.  There is a hot sauce bar with pickled onions and hot peppers.  I recommend the onions, they are spicy hot.  Free refills on the drinks.  Me and my coworkers are usually the only non-hispanics in the joint.  Beware: when your food is ready they will call your number in Spanish.  Menu is inexpensive.  Food and atmosphere are not high society, but I sure enjoy my visits there.  Be sure to save room for dessert.  There is a fantastic Mexican bakery next door with delicious pastries at a super cheap price.
