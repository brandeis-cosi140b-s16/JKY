Grilled chicken burro. Was great.  Keep the ice tea coming.  I usually go there for lunch as they have a $6.99 lunch menu with drink.  6 months out of the year you can enjoy there large patio and get some fresh air.  The lunch menu comes out quick, lots of great flavors and they keep the chips and salsa coming.  If you are ever in Gold Canyon area give them a try.
