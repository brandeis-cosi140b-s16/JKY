Dear Burrito Bandito, I miss you terribly! I know, I took you for granted during all of those quick dinners before class. I'm sorry! Had I only known that your food surpasses the best that San Francisco has to offer I would have visited a few more times before leaving. Your carne asada tacos were so good, and so affordable. And the El Patron burrito, which could feed a family of 4, was outstanding. I hope to see you again someday!
