This restaurant is a staple for the Madison west-siders.  It's nestled among all the cute-ass shops on Monroe, reasonably priced, and extremely tasty.  The annoying things about it are the stupid flags for crossing the street outside and the fact that my cell phone mysteriously doesn't get reception in the place.  However, the chili cheese dip and speedy service far make up for it.
