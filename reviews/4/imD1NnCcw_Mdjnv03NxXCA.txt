I love Los Cabos! I usually get their burritos and they are all fantastic. When you eat in they bring you freshly made chips and salsa. The only downfalls to this place are that: 1. Service is terrible on Fridays, seriously you will wait for a while (still worth it) and 2. They are closed on Sundays.
