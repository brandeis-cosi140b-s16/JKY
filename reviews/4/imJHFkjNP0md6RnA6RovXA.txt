I was at Lake Mead & Rancho and stopped into the gas station that this Roberto's is at and got a chicken Burrito $3.37 wt tax = AWESOME & fast. In South Beach that same Burrito would sell for $9. Just one more reason to be glad I moved outta that place!!

The guy who made it, in his haste to put out fast, did wrap some of the paper into the shell but whatever, it came out. The chicken was plentifull and very moist & delicious. The next time I will have to go wt a supreme wt sour cream & cheese. 

I'm glad there is not a shop close to me bcuz I can see me going there several times a week. Good stuff!!
