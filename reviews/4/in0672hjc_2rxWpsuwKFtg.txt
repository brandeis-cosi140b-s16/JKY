rhia: whoa, people gave it a four? i'd give it a five. it was delicious. we need to come up with synonyms for delicious. 

summer: (i am really glad there is spell check, i suck at dictation.)

rhia: i'd drop the f-bomb a few times about how damn delicious that food was. you can cuss on yelp, can't you? 

summer: i wanted my food to be hotter than it was. 

rhia: mine burned my tongue. temperature wise. but in a good way.

summer: i think my burrito was waiting for yours to get done. and thus, got lukewarm.

rhia: but, they made everything when we ordered it. it wasn't just sitting all day like some mexican grills. *cough chipotle*

summer: i love chipotle.

rhia: yeah, but sometimes it tastes old. but anyways. i liked how the owner took our order, and brought us our food and made sure everything was good. it also helped we had free coupons.

summer: i love salsa bars.

rhia: i definitely want to go there again. it was reasonably priced for what it is. plus the pico made me tingle in my naughty place.

summer: uh. i have left overs in the fridge. would you like to be alone with them for a bit?

rhia: maybe...*awkward laugh*.

the bottom line: it was tasty enough to frequent. wishing it was a bit closer to home.
