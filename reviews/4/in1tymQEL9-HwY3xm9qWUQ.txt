Nice place to hang out on the weekends and watch a band, which is exactly what we did last Friday - Past experience tells me to stay away during the week.

The food was pretty good, service was reasonable. The atmosphere reminds me of Dos Gringos, though the crowd was older and it's a little cleaner.

They have two bars (one inside and one out), and a huge outdoor patio area that would be great when summer is over.
