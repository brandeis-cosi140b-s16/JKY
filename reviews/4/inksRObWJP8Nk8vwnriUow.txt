In the universe of taco shops, I'm a fan. Good Mexican food at low prices. Try the adobado plate--really good seasoned, sauteed pork tips. Carrot and jalapeno salad worth trying--better than most. Somewhat shady neighborhood, especially after dark--best for lunch. Much better than typical fast food and even most sit-down Mexican restaurants.
