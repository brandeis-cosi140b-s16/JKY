Walking up to this place I was kinda nervous... definitely a hole in the wall. Almost like it was a baja fresh at one point but O M G I can't believe the food. We walked in - total noobs to this place and checked the menu while in line.  We sat down for about 5 minutes before we heard our number come up and it was BUSY. Busy as in 5-6 people were ahead of us but we were ordering within 2 minutes.

The food is served on styrofoam plants that are cheap but the food... man I'm glad I found this place. I put this on par with Si Senor and Rosa's Taco Shop but... more casual if you can get more casual without losing clothing.  My favorite was the tacos - the street carne tacos are so well seasoned. And the refried beans - unique taste and very flavorful. And for $6 I got a plate of food that filled me for two meals easy.  I actually didn't see the Diners drive in's thing until we sat down and saw the painted stamp that Guy put on the wall. I had seen this in a few other places in town which was a good sign. I'm positive we will be back here several more times.
