Waaay better than Taco Bell. Roberto's is one of the best taco shops in town. Reasonably priced, fast, good portions, and consistently good food. 

My faves are the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito, and carne asada fries...what can I say I like their carne asada. 

I also like their salsa bar which features salsa (love the green), cucumbers, radishes, limes, pickled carrots and jalapenos.
