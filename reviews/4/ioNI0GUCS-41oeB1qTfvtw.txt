I like this place, now I am not a big fan of overly busy, jammed packed restaurants. So I liked that I wasn't waiting for a table too long, even though I think they have the opportunity to do so. I thought the food was great, the service was great and would recommend this place to anyone. Angel, the owner is very friendly and nice. I am excited to take my girlfriend there on Wednesday's for Salsa dancing, which Angel said they started a month ago. Good room for meeting space as well!!!
