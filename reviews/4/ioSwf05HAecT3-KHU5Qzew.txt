When this first Rubio's in Henderson opened the first thing I sputtered was something like, "FISH tacos?  Gag me, like, with a spoon!"  Ok, so it wasn't the long ago, but that's the sentiment basically.  I could think of nothing more disgusting.

Then one day, at another taco place, I tried a fish taco and I loved it it death.  So then, I decided to try Rubio's.  Oh MAN!  This place is awesome!  Their Fish Taco Especial is heaven in a tortilla.  Their chips and salsa are good for a quick serve place and it's pretty reasonably priced.

If you're still one of those holding out from fear from the fish taco, just come here and try one.  They're awesome.
