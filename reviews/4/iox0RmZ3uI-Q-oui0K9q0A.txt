I have been a regular here with my husband for a long time and it never let's me down. The only down side is the price of food. Honestly I'd be still willing to pay because I love this place so much. We always get the filet and some sort of fish. You also can't go wrong with the roasted corn and sweet potato baked in the beautifully presented green chili. Love the beer and wine selection aswell.
