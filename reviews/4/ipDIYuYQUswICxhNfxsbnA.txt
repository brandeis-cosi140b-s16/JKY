I eat here once a year or two. It is always good. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long because it is very popular. This is a great place for groups and because of this, it can be pretty noisy. Love their thin chips and good, spicy salsas. I ordered the street tacos and they were delicious. All of my dining partners were quite satisfied with their meals. Pretty decent prices, too.
