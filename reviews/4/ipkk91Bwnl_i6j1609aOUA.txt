It's a tragedy this place only has 3 reviews (4 now!) because it's solid. Don't be scared of new restaurants Charlotte! I know you may be worried about not knowing what you're ordering but it's ok, folks are usually friendly and will help!!!!

Anyways, came in for a hangover breakfast and it did the trick. Got a taco, enchilada combo, will come back for more. This place is the real deal so step up your game Queen City folks.
