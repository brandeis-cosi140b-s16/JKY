Tried it for the first time with friends & found amazing. All of us were all praise for the quality of the food served. 
The only down side is cost & service - extremely slow. Also the description of the items in the menu are too cryptic to appear English. 
But if you are ready to really wait that long,  have got patience (& lots of money ;P )  then you won't regret dining here.
