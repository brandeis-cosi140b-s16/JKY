I found this place by accident.  The service was ok.  The guy who took my order wasn't very personable, but he wasn't unfriendly either.  I placed my order for the #3 lunch special (a crispy taco and burrito) and he asked me if I wanted green or red chile.  I chose green and was glad I did.  The taco was excellent with a homemade taco shell, shredded beef, lettuce, and tomato.  The side of the taco with the shredded beef was appropriately hot and the side with the lettuce and tomato was cold.  It had excellent flavor!  The burrito had a homemade tortilla with beef and green chili inside.  I asked for them not to cover it in sauce which they had no problem with.  The burrito was tasty and the green chili was very good.  The only thing I would have changed was that there was too much green chili and it was very messy.  I think it would have been as good with half as much.  I enjoyed my meal and look forward to returning again.
