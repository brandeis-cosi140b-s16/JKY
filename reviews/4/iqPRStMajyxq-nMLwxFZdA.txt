Oh man... I'm having a serious internal conflict on what I like better:
Don Tortaco or Robertos.  I know, I know, everybody seems to get really passionate about Team Don or Team Roberto.  I talked to a couple of dudes at the gas station once asking which one was better.  Big mistake.  Dudes almost got into a yelling match.  Of course, being a new local I've totally effed up by bringing up the topic.  I've even talked to a lady that smuggles in salsa from one place to the other, but I'm taking that secret to the grave.  Don't even ask.
  
Ok, both have great things going for them;
Open 24 hours, close to my house, cheap and hella bomb, surprisingly clean, cool super nice peeps that work there, and even great when sober (but even better faded and/or piss druuunk {and cheap responsible cab fare ppl!} plus huge portions for leftovers).

Ok.  My very fair conclusion which leads me to beg my dear Yelpers to refrain from following me home to throw molotov cocktails into my window is...  

I'm Team Don.  That being said; Roberto's escabeche is way better, ok, It's dope as hell and the salsa bar has more options and is amazingly fresh.  BUT and it's a close call here, Robertos is too salty for my personal taste buds, and not as greasy.  Ok grease may sound gross, but it's just how I was raised in the fair lands of Califonia.  Don is seasoned really well, and the salsa is really good, but Robertos has a lead on that.  It's so close tho.  I had a hard time figuring out what it was that made me lean towards Don, and it's the salt level really.  And I like a good protective coating for my stomach and we all know why ;-D

BUT, Robertos is bomb too.  DON'T TRIP YO!  Hello I gave it 4 stars for a reason.

I see you.  Drop that brick right now!
