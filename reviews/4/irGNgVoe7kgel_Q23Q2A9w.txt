My first thought when I walked in this summer was: "5,000 flies can't be wrong." I was grossed out a little by the number of our flying friends but I gotta say, that's what your second hand is for - SHOO EM AWAY!

This food is some of the best Mexican food I've had. They make homemade tortillas, and chips, and tamales, and, well..EVERYTHING! 

I love their shredded beef chimichanga, and their refried beans are to die for. Everything, actually, is terrific here. The FLAVORS are incredioble, the meat spicy and frangrant - the beans creamy and rich. Oh, it's like the Mexican Food equivalent of hearing Colin Firth swear undying love in "Pride and Prejudice"...you never tire of it.....well, except maybe the flies....

We make the drive to Carolina's because it's great and we always take someting home "For later" like chips or tortillas. Their homemade goodness can NOT be beat by any other "quick mex" place. Carolina's kicks the ass of all the "Ass Burrito" places in the Valley - (and you know who you are- all you "BERTO" places!!)

The only thinkg I would recommend to our friends at Carolina's is perhaps a fly strip or two.
