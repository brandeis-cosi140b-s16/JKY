Delicious Mexican food, plentiful portions, very. affordable and served quickly with a smile.  This was our first time in to this location and we were very pleased.  

The restaurant was clean.  Comfortable seating, easy to read menu.  I ordered the Carnitas plate that came with two enormous tortillas,and I also ordered a beef tamale. My wife ordered a fish taco and a chicken tamale. The food and sauces were delicious like what I grew up with.  Excellent value.  

I would have liked access to pico de gallo and more flavorful salsa on the bar that offered serve-yourself salsa, hot peppers, carrots, scallions and cucumbers.

In summary, this is our new favorite Mexican food joint!!! Food is very good, the portions are big, prices are very reasonable and the people inside are friendly.  If you like Mexican (not Tex-Mex) food, stop in and give them a try.  You'll like it!
