So this place is pretty new, like still figuring their stuff out it seems. Food was pretty dang good. The Carne Asada was very good, the chicken was big chunks so I'd suggest the beef instead. Everything else was typical mexican style food and flavor. All made fresh though so they've got that going for them. 

Prices were great btw! We'll be back for sure
