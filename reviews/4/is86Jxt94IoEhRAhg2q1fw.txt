When it comes to getting the bang for your buck, this place really knows how to satisfy a poor college student like myself. I came here on a Thursday and just in time for their 99c taco deal. The only meat option was ground beef, but you can choose between soft or hard shell. The tacos are pretty average, your typical Americanized taco, but the fact that it was only 99c per taco made it so amazing. Pour on some hot sauce for that extra kick! And the very best part is that the chips and salsa are FREE! 

My meal consisted of three tacos (2 soft and 1 hard shell), chips and salsa. I was super stuffed and the bill came out to be...(*drumroll please*)...only $3.15. Cha ching!
