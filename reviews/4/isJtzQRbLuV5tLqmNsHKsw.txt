I was craving a burrito and i've been to longboards a few times so I decided to visit moe's.  
It's a Moe's.  They greet you on entry with the signature "Welcome to Moe's" although much to my liking they aren't super loud in a meal disrupting way...or maybe I was lucky.

The food is very consistent from store to store so I wasn't blown away, but enjoyed the familiar...and got what I expected.  I had a burrito prepared the way i wanted in front of my eyes with nice crispy chips on the side.  I didn't try out their Freestyle coke machine but rather drank some so-called "Northern Tea."  I don't really like that designation, but oh well.
