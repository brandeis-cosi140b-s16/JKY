This is the closest Roberto's to us since moving up to the Aliante area and we love our breakfast burritos!  Glad to find out that this place makes them just as good as other locations we used to frequent before moving to this side of town.  The burritos are intact, this place has every kind of meat offered elsewhere and they are not dripping in grease from excess cheese!  Timely service and friendly staff.
