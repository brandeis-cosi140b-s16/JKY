Just had lunch here at Cafe Rio. I ordered the taco meal. Youu get to choose your own meat and I chose shredded chicken breast. The meal comes with a tiny bit of rice and beans. They are not generous with the sides.  The signs claims that the food is natural from scratch.  Kind of like Chipotle. What's cool is that a lady is making tortillas from scratch. I think this place is okay, worth trying.
