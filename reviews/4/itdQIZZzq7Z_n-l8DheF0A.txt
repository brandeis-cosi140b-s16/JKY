I'm sureee there's lots of opinion on best Mexican restaurant here in Vegas..let's review bonito Michoacan. NOT to be confused with, lindo Michoacan, that's just wrong. Atmosphere 8/10. Menu 8/10. Customer service 8/10. 
Trust me, if you want good Mexican food, I don't see how you'll leave this place disappointed, yes I've had better, but not in this city. So let's be fair, when it comes to providing all of the good stuff like tacos and tostadas, you'll find that here. I love the live music and friendly staff, adds to the experience. Get a margarita here because they do that veryyy well. Good food, good atmosphere, and nice staff...all three aren't easy to find.
