I love Mexican food, but most of the restaurants left me with a heartburn afterwards or the greasy smell and heavy stomach, but NOT Senior Taco. I love the freshness of the food and the the salsa bar. The price is very affordable and the portion is HUGE. It's around the corner from where I work, so it is convenient for lunch. I wish they open one near my house in Tempe. Just a thought!
