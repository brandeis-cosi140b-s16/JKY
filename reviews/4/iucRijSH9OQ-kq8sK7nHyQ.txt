Tried Rio Mirage for the first time.  My family really enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff.  We all ordered combo meals and were very impressed with how fast the food arrived and the bonus was it tasted great.  My corn tamale was fluffy and fresh, which I can't say for other places.  My chicken taco was not greasy which is hard to find.  We will go back!
