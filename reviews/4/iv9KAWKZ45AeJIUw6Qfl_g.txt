You would think that with a line out the door that the food would suffer, but nope! The tacos were stuffed and were as good as ever. Only a few things to mention, the side of the kitchen seemed a little dirty and the margaritas aren't frozen enough. They're always so tasty but the past few times I have gone they have been very watery.
