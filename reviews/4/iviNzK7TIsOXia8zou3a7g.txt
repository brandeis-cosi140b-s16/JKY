My friend were making fun of me for trying tacos in a food court, but after living in California for the last year, I find myself in a perpetual state of craving Mexican food. And I have to say that these tacos were legit. I had the bistec especial, and it was three solid, beef tacos. However, the serving of chips is ENORMOUS, and is really too much unless you are planning on sharing. But three good tacos with drink for $10 is a pretty sweet deal.
