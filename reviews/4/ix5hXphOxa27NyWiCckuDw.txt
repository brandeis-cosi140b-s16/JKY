I'm giving this place 4 stars for fixing their error. I'm highly allergic to avocado. I asked to ensure it was removed, but the kitchen put guacamole on my tacos. I let the waitress know (I always double check because of how bad my allergy is) and they sprang into action. They made me new tacos, took them off our bill, offered me dessert on the house, and gave me coupons for discounted tacos in the next visit. The food was very good and the atmosphere is very trendy.
