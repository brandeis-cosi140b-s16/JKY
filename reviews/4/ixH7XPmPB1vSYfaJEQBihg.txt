Pretty good lil place. Cheap food and the usual suspects. Had the 3 chicken taco lunch combo with rice and beans and a soda for $7. Came with free chips and salsa that had great flavor. No real ambiance its just a lil taco shop. No fountain soda yet. They are new so I suspect they will have some changes in the future. I would definitely go back.
