I've been bringing friends to this neighborhood find for years and only today learned it's not Via de los Santos! It's named after the owner, Delosantos. 

I went to Sunnyslope High School, so this is my old 'hood. 

If you like a place that's cozy and funky with nice staff and tasty Mexican food, go here! I asked our server whether she recommended the chicken or the shrimp fajitas, since I love veggies and chicken or fish. She recommended the shrimp. ($11.95)

Wow! I ate the whole plate...which should have been enough to have a small plate for leftovers. But no-oh! It was too addicting to not devour it fresh off the grill. Whatever they spread on the shrimp? I was in heaven.

The chips are decent. The chunky salsa was tasty. When I asked for a spicy bloody merry with a garden, they did put in two olives (no celery) and the server came back to ask if it was spicy enough. Nice, right?

It was yummy. 

They have $3 house margaritas all day, every day. And 200 tequilas, which I can't report on because tequila gives me a hangover before I go to bed. And I hate hangovers. Just like you.

It's located just north of Dunlap on Central, on the west side. If you can't park in the lot, park on the side street.

Enjoy!
