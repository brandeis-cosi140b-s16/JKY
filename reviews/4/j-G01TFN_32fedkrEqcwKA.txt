I went here on a whim while waiting for the train station to clear out- it was packed after Disney on Ice. 

I was greeted instantly at the bar and given a drink menu. I got a Skinny Margarita- very good. Their tequila selection alone takes up 2 of the 6 drink menu pages.

The menu selections were a little limited, in my opinion. I just wanted something quick, but if I came here for dinner I would want some more options. I went with the Lime Shrimp Salad. 

They brought out chips and salsa for me while I waited. The salsa was excellent, there was a little something extra in it, a rich bold flavor. I kept trying to figure out what it was but couldn't put my finger on it. The chips came out in a deep metal bowl with high sides- it kind of looked like a mixing bowl. I thought that was a little weird, like they ran out of bowls and just had to grab something quick.

My salad took a little bit longer than I would have expected a salad to take, but right when I was about to ask about it, it came out, so no big deal. Forgive the squealing but it was SO PRETTY, very nicely plated. I considered taking a phone picture of it for a moment, but then I was too hungry to wait. 

The salad was excellent- lettuce, mangoes, avocados, a very light cilantro dressing, and of course the shrimp, which were well-seasoned. 

I think the menu is slightly over-priced, but I guess that's to be expected for the location, but it's not outrageous. I probably won't be dropping by every day after work for $10 margaritas, but I'll be back for a nice dinner.
