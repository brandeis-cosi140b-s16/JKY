Food is OUTSTANDING....Decor is upscale and trendy...Service was slow , not attentive- however they were friendly...there was NO manager to be seen on the floor.
 
The music is so LOUD you can barely hear the person sitting next to you.

If you're a foodie...or just cruising(nice bar area)...definitely Go eat at SumoMaya....if you're on a date you can't possible chat with your date. Is this a place for a romantic dinner??...NO
