I have eaten at this El Pollo Loco ever since they opened back in 2008. I like this location much better than the one that is off Thomas Rd (4102 E. Thomas Rd) . The Mesa location is much bigger and newer which means it is cleaner. The staff during the day is friendly and your food order is called out within 10 minutes or less after you order. I enjoy a restaurant that serves up fresh bbq chicken that is not fried. I recommend the avocado salsa which is mild in heat but is packed full of flavor. It adds a nice touch to the charbroiled chicken!
