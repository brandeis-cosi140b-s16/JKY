Visiting frm Los Angeles, I ordered a chicken burrito and I split that with my friend and we both agree that it was excellent, we also ordered 2 fish tacos and to my friends surprise they were very delicious. Quick drive thru service...
I want to let ppl know that the chicken was shredded and juicy to our liking.
My only bad comment is that I am a big fan of green salsa and I thought there's was watered down and not even tolerable.
