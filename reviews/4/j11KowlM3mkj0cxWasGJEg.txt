This place is near my office so I have had the opportunity to try it 4 times in the last 2 months.  I love this place more than Chipotle and Q Doba (which are both tasty).  I have had the Vegetarian Burrito,the Papas Burrito, and the salad with chicken.

I love the options- wheat tortillas, brown rice or the white cilantro rice (I like the cilantro version), the 2 types of potato's, the yummy salsa's, the beans...  I a dying to try their nacho's and taquitos.  

They have awesome fresh brewed iced tea.  Lunch usually costs about $9 or $10.  The staff at this location are very friendly & helpful!!!!
