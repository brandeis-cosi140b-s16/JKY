Needed some food before we headed back to Cali.. My babe wanted Smash burger .. But the smell of bomb Mexican food was captivating.. So I decided to eat @ Robertos instead.. The burritos were bomb .. On a fresh giant flour tortilla... Carne asada pick de gallo and guacamole... Hmmmm .. My son ordered a a  carne asada breakfast burrito .. It only had carne eggs n cheese.. N was delish. Prices are more than what I'm used to paying decent for Las Vegas.
