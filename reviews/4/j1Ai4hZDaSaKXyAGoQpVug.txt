I went with my friend and business associate who hails from Mexico City and he absolutely loved it.  So did I.  I thought the food was great and authentic.  The beef tacos were excellent.  The salsas was perfect.  My buddy had the enchiladas and he raved about them.  We both had the sopa con crema...dinero.  We also got a chance to meet the chef's mom...super nice lady that simply exuded her love for cooking good, traditional Mexican food.  Cons: new place so service is trying to figure things out.  Pros: Comida autentica estilo D.F.
