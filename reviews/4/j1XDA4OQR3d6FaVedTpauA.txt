If you are looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go!

El Charro has been at this location for many years. My husband used to go there as kid and he's in his 30s. I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food but I do get a craving once in a while and El Charro is one of two places I like to go.

The price is right and food is even better. Everything I've had is delicious and their guacamole is one of the best. Lots of flavor and generous portions too. Their tamales is definitely one of the best ones.

The service can be really crappy. Their dining room and bar is completely separated by a door. The regular waitress in the bar is fantastic and never had a problem with her. The dining room however has been a disappointment many times. They're slow and don't like to come by very often. Last time we were there, we waited 20 minutes for a refill and container but never got them. We had to go ask someone for a container and just left. But it seems pretty consistent that we end up waiting a long time for any service once food is out.

They do close every summer for couple of months so be sure they're open if you go July-September.
