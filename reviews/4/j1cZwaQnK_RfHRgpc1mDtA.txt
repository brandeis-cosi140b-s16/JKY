Just moved to the neighborhood and my dad said I should go here. We are pretty Mexican and know what good traditional Mexican food should taste like and this was excellent. I had the Fish taco plate, which was crispy fish, excellent sauce and fresh lettuce and pico (so good, I inhaled!). The BF had Rolled Taco Supreme, which had high quality carne asada, rolled beef tacos, guac & cheese. We also had Tamarindo and chips. The salsa bar was soo good and very authentic. I felt like I was back at my Nana's kitchen. This place is like a block away from where we live and we will definitely be going back. PS we were sober and it was like 6ish at night. I'm never eating at the Taco Bell down the street again!
