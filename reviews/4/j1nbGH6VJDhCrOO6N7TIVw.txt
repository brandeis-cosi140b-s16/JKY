Tried Three Amigos for the first time with my girlfriend- the food was solid and the service was excellent!
I ordered the enchiladas mixtas, and all four enchiladas were very good. The mole poblano is awesome as many have said, but they were all pretty tasty. I almost wish I hadn't ordered the mixed enchiladas though because it was hard to get a true taste of each with only ~4 bites per enchilada. It came with a side of extra steak which was excellent (I ordered 2 steak enchiladas and 2 chicken) and a salad. I wish refried beans and rice would have come with it as well, but next time I can order those separate. My girlfriend got the chicken fajitas which were good but not great and didn't have much chicken. It was a HUGE portion though and came with both rice and beans, which was nice because I got to steal some of hers :)
The service was excellent! The owner talked to us twice to make sure we were happy, our server consistently refilled our drinks, and she even gave us more salsa and brought out two spicier salsas on the house (which I highly recommend) after she saw how much we loved their normal salsa. The food was above average Mexican, and the service will definitely bring me back to try more options.
