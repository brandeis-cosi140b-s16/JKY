It seems like most of the reviewers here expected much more than they got out of this restaurant. I've learned to not expect too much from any Mexican restaurant as it's unlikely to find a great one. Is it really authentic? I'm not certain I would know since I'm not from Mexico and don't travel there, so I t's not a factor in my choice of a restaurant. I would rank this one higher than many I've visited in the past. 

I had a decent experience here and the other four in my party did as well. It wasn't perfect as the wait was a bit long for the entrees and my husband had to wait even longer for his special. I wouldn't rave about anything but I liked the chips and salsa. They did not seem store bought to me.  I had the pica (shredded) beef tostada grande and it was good. Everyone else enjoyed their meal as well, however one person did not get exactly what she thought she ordered. I will most likely come back here again.
