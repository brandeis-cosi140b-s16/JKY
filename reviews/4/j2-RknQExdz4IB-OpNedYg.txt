I'm usually at this airport for connections that are long enough for a meal, but too short for a sit-down restaurant. This is my go-to for breakfast. 

I order the crab cake and eggs (comes with potatoes) for $12.99. It's actually a great quality crab cake with only a little filler, topped with pico de gallo and served on a bed of lettuce. The eggs come scrambled with some cheese crumbles on top and they also give you a side of salsa. It's pretty filling and not too pricey considering it's a crab cake at airport prices. 

They always tell me it will be about 12-14 minutes for it to be ready, but it definitely comes out faster than that.
