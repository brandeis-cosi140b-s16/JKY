I was really impressed with this place.  Cozy atmosphere and decent drink deals during happy hour.  We had the bean dip (great), I had quesadillas with gouda (pretty good) and my friend got the tomatillo salad, which she hated but was my favorite thing on the table.  Food was fresh and the recipes were good.  Would give it 5 stars if the service was a bit better.
