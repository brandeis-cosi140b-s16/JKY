Delicious little place where everything was a bit... sweet? Ordered the paradise cheeseburger and seasoned fries. Super tasty, but everything tasted like it was sprinkled with a good bit of sugar. Loved the picked onion condiments and heavy amount of sauce.

All in all, this is a terrible place for a diet but a great place for unique burger.
