Food was decent. They've got daily specials. Today the regular sized al pastor burrito was $4.99. I got the Free chips and salsa for my yelp check in. I think the flavors in the burrito were good, the meat was cooked well. Maybe could've used more cilantro-but that's my preference. 

The salsa was not impressive to me, I'm seriously glad it was free. I wouldn't regretted paying a dollar LOL. Very watery tomato flavored stuff. Little pops of cilantro here and there were nice, but no depth of flavors. I got the hot salsa, and it was definitely hot, but hot has to pair with flavor I think.

I'd go back. Hubs might like it, he's really REALLY into burritos.
