This place is my new passion! Pittsburgh has had quite a number of Mexican restaurants popping up in and out of the city. But most that I have tried have been disappointing. Bea's Taco Town is not a disappointment.

The menu is small the service is fast and the food is tasty. I ordered the chicken dorado's with refried black beans and both were very good and satisfying. The food also comes with a sauce on the side which I believe is a hot sauce. I was not afraid to pour this sauce on everything. Very tasty. I highly recommend anyone working in town to stop by on their lunch break.
