Tried Azteca for the first time Friday. Certainly an authentic Mexican feel. The staff was friendly, as we were seated right after a five minute wait. I ordered the camerones del mojo y ajo (shrimp with garlic and lime/lemon). I've had it at different restaurants and this was NOTHING like it. Be prepared that the onions are large pieces that come on a bed of lettuce. Only halfway through my meal did I realize there was rice underneath. They leave the shrimp in the shell, which is a pet peeve of mine, as it makes eating a chore. However, the taste of the shrimp was good and strongly garlic flavored. My date had shrimp and fish with some kind of nuts that he enjoyed. We also had guacamole, which was not good. It lacked lime and salt (date enjoyed it though). Overall, I would recommend Azteca. Just be careful about what you order, as it may not be what you expect. I'm probably overrating this place because the service was good and my date liked it more than me.
