Over the past year we have frequented this Garcia's location a handful of times and have not been disappointed in service or the food flavors.  We are huge Mexican food fans and this place, while not uber authentic, puts together nice, flavorful plates and solid margaritas at a great value and in a unique and convenient locale.  We recommend and will continue to patron.
