Thank you Casa Reynoso staff for saving 9/25/14.  
Our group was looking forward to a pre-game (ASU vs. UCLA) meal, but work schedule wasn't cooperating.  Phone conversations with CR staff got us a reservation and we ordered ahead. Right when we walked in our plates were waiting, dishes still hot to the touch.  All of us raved about our orders.  Among us: red chile bowl, tacos, rellenos, rice, beans, enchiladas, tamales.  Not one complaint.  Two of us who had rellenos agreed the best in memory. I liked that they were served home-style-- not covered in a sauce.  Nice to get that sweet green chile flavor.
I very much appreciated that a "kind of" off-menu item was dished up -- grandson likes going to Someburros where he always gets a bean burrito. CR doesn't have that on the menu.  Grandson also likes beef roasts, like from a crock pot.  So I asked if he could have a serving of plain machaca-- not in a burro or chimichanga and that was graciously provided.  Good moods all around. 
Then we went to the game and got our behinds handed to us.  Going home in different directions we agreed that our dinner was the highlight of our evening. 
So, why not 5 Stars?   Chips servings for 6 people kind of skimpy.   
Still, we most definitely will be back.   Thank you.
