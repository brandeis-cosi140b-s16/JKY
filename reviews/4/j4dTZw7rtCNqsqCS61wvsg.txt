wouldnt you agree that a key part of enjoying the dining experience in part depends upon the company you are dining with?!  having said that, the times i have dined at abuelos have been with my fellow co-workers, all female, and yes, we all get along!  needless to say, we had totally fun & memorable experiences, filled with great conversations, great food and good prices.  their corn chips are fresh and lite, their salsa comes in different levels of heat.  i usually request the hot salsa.  i'm partial to their chicken enchilada.  portions are just right, one is plenty for me, usually served with rice.  in all fairness, believe i need to sample other dishes, before i could rate it any higher.  found another great restaurant in chandler, az!  top3 reasons why...1- great tasting dish 2- good value  3- atmosphere (location, service, ambience)
