Poblano's errs on the side of caution. Nothing too spicy, nothing too daring. While the food is good and the plating's spectacular, the actual flavor seems to be more of an afterthought. This is a great place to take white Midwesterners who haven't been fully introduced to punch of great Mexican food.
