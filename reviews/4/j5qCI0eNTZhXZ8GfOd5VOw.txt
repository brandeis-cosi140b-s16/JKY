If you have a big crowd this is the place to go. The wiaters are used to waiting on large parties of sorority girls (pickie eaters). At times they get a little slow but they give you the free chips to make up for it. 
Pollo Fundido, taco salad, sopa de pollo, chicken taco, and the cheese sauce are great choices! You won't go home hungry, you could probably eat for a few days if you take home left overs. 
I used to eat here every Sunday, but I moved due to work. If you are in the area and want a great deal on a lot of good food, this is the place to go. 
The sangria and Margs are pretty delicious, ask for Sonja to make them!
