Aguas frescas -- Some of the best I've ever had. Get it. 
Food Court -- Walk up, look at pictures, order food, ENJOY. Seriously good food.  Great salsa bar too. Fill your plate with salsa, cilantro & onions, & pico de gallo.
Sit - Plenty of seating for you & friends. 
Groceries -- CHEAP, stock up on those fruit and veggies.
Pastries -- By the front entrance, grab a tray and load up.

It can be a little hectic, crowded and overwhelming depending on when you go but, that doesn't discourage me. It's a little spicy gem.
