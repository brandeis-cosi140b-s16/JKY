I'll admit, this place took me almost a year of driving by it before I finally stopped inside. It's one of those questionable hole-in-the-wall places that always seems to have the local fire and police crews eating there. (Must be good, right?) I've been back multiple times now and while the service isn't anything to excited about, the food is an incredible value for the price. We take all of our out-of-town guests there now as a "joke" that has everyone begging to come back for more.

Best Thing on the Menu: Pancakes! Hands down!
