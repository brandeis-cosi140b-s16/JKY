Had a Manudo with a knee of a pork. It was tasty, rich with ingredients, and good amount. Expected a bit different feeling with the knee, but was pleased. real pansita in Mexico is a bit more tasty. Here they also serve it with lemon not lime. 
The salsas they make: the green one - really good, the red one is precooked and a bit too mild. 
Michelada was great! 
Tried also a piece from combo, normal enchiladas and clasic tostadas. They had great red salsa with it, but otherwise pretty mild in taste.
