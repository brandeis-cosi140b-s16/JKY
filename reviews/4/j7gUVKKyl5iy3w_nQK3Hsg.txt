If you like Chicken and you LOVE cheese, and aren't counting the calories, you must get the Pollo Magnifico. It's a deep fried burro filled with chicken and topped with jalapeno cream cheese, cheddar cheese and served with rice and beans. So delicioso. Yea that was the lil bit of hispanic girl coming out, don't laugh. lol

The service is A-Ok but the Food I'm definitely a fan of!
