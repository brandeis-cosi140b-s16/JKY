We tried this on a Yelp!! Recommendation, and we were not disappointed. We were greeted and seated immediately hostess was very friendly. We chose to sit in the cantina area, and as soon as we sat down Vinnie our waiter was table side with drink order chips and bean dip and salsa. Also grilled jalape√±o and onion taster. They have 7 day a week half of drinks and appetizer happy hour. I ordered a beer Josie a Mango margarita. Both arrived promptly. Josie had a chicken taco and I ordered a Beef chimichanga. Chimichanga for me was really tasty. The guacamole was quite good. It was a smaller portion than most Mexican restaurants but that is good I did not leave overly full or waste leftover food. The staff was ON IT. Never had empty water. Bonus!! I recommend this place can't  wait to try other dishes. I also liked the fact that many regulars came in and were greeted by name and staff came through to say hi to the regulars. Have to say, best experience I have had eating in quite awhile.
