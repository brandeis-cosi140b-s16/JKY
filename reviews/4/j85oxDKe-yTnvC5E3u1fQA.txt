Went to Qdoba for lunch and there was a long line, which is to be expected around 12:30 on a workday. Didn't take too long to get up to the counter though. I ordered a burrito bowl with chicken, white rice, pinto beans, cheese, and a little sour cream. The girl behind the counter actually listened and didn't overdo the sour cream. Very much appreciated. They have the Coca Cola Freestyle machine, but I got iced tea. The drink station is kind of awkward with the placement of the lids and utensils. Not really a logical flow and feels congested. It was a nice day so we sat at a table outside. Lots of people eating around there. I very much enjoyed my burrito bowl. I think their chicken is so much better than Chipotle's. They really need a Qdoba on the west side in Avondale/Goodyear!
