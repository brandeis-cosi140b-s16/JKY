The green chili chimichanga is my fave! It's a cute little lunch spot. Counter service but it can be pretty busy. The remodel is better and they improved the parking lot as well. Will have to try their other dishes as well. It's a very low maintenance, no frills Mexican place. The churros were quite tasty as well.
