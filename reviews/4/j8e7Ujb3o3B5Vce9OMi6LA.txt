Good Mexican-inspired Mexican-ish food.  Not owned by actual Latin folks but rather, 2 guys from San Diego, apparently.  The carne asada burrito to me, is the best burrito on the menu and the guacamole was executed very nicely (so hit or miss at most PGH area  Mexican eateries - even the Mexican-run ones...)
The chips were delicious , the salsas were not so good - very thin - obvious they are cutting corners on the salsa .  No bueno  !
Parking is tricky as it's right on Federal Street .  watch your back, at night . friend of mine was held up / mugged near here awhile ago .

I'll be back for more burritos ...
