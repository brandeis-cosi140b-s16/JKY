I was pleased with my visit yesterday evening for dinner. The waitress was very nice. Started with a strawberry margarita which was very delicious. Chips were yummy but could've used hotter salsa and had read we are charged for the 2nd order..could've used more but wasn't gonna pay. Bean dip needed salt.  Husband was sold on the street tacos but needed to ask for limes and hot sauce..or should I say sauce as it had no hot to it. I would have been fine with a bottle of store brand hot sauce. I had the chimi which was great..and my daughter had the fried tacos..which looked good, she said they were great.  I would love to see a pick my own combination menu but was very happy to see our bill. Very very reasonable for sit down dinner. Fried icecream was small but good.
