For the price, it's pretty solid grub. Got a carne asada chimi and chile relleno. Didn't finish either since it's soooo much food. The chile relleno was one of the better ones that I've had and it was crazy-cheap. The chimi was good, though not spectacular. It's a good go-to spot for takeaway mex food. Can't wait to go again.
