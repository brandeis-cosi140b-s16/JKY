Duck! I mean ducks...all around...in the duck pond..quacking away...while I'm getting my margarita on. Ducks getting caught in the net. Ducks looking for leftover tortillas. But I duckgress. The food was cheesy..dope for being drunk off a few pitchers of Margaritas. This is the G Family Christmas and we're getting drunk at 2 in the afternoon..right before we have to go to a White Elephant party. Thanks Monica. 

The server was funny..even calling his helper Antonio Banderas. The heavier version of Zorro. 

I would still go with the blended margarita..at least at 2 in the afternoon. No need to get a margarita hangover this early in the day. 

Props on the heaters...it was actually too hot.
