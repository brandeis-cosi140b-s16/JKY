I've been there two times, both times I've had about a 7/10 experience. Their food is really good, I've always enjoyed what I've gotten. Their grande burrito is humongous & pretty cheap for what you get. They ran out of chimichangas  last time so I got the sobres I think it's called-which were really good.

The complimentary chips were cold last time I went there (granted they were busy) & they won't give you refills on chips unless you pay- so if you have a large group or a few hungry friends expect to pay more.

The margarita my sister & I split tasted like strawberry soda with a cup of sugar added in. So pretty darn sweet. 

All in all, good place to try near the Capitol & relatively affordable. I recommend.
