A neighborhood staple had returned and I could not be happier.  I feel the little 'hiatus' made me love them more!   Same atmosphere and awesome beer selection with the un-authentic TexMex that we all know and love. 

Wanna Iguana is still my favorite burrito - spicy and delicious.   Cannot wait to come back and get my cajun wings or dig in to some $1 tacos.

It feels good to be back in my old neighborhood bar... almost like we never left.  My stomach thanks you for coming back to Dormont.
