The whole idea behind Baja Fresh is that their food is made without microwaves, nothing frozen, it's supposed to be fresh food. Can you still put too much oil into something fresh? Of course. That being said, I do think they deliver on this promise. However, it doesn't mean that you can order anything you want and it will be "healthy" or "low-cal". You still have to be a consciencious consumer. So be smart and skip the chips, cheese, sour cream and you can have your lo-cal stuff. 

I'm going off on a tangent here so let me reel it back in.......our experience here this week was a little slow. We waited for our food for a little longer than necessary. Turns out there was only one cook. However, when the food did arrive the manager made it up to us with drinks (we were just drinking water) and an extra item that we had ordeded. It was a nice touch and the food itself was great. 

I had the grilled mahi mahi tacos and my man had the shrimp diablo burrito. We love the salsa bar and of course had to get samples of every one. We'll be back.
