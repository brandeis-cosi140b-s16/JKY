for a fast food burrito this place kicks butt over chipotle. the steak is incredible and cooked before your eyes (along with the tortilla). i love how they mix all of the ingredients together before they wrap the burrito. plus, the kids working inside are always really nice. take a day off from chipotle college brats and give it a try...its a freaking burrito, how could you not like it?
