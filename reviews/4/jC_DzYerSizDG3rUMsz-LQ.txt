Oh.  Mah.  Gawd.

Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason I'm dumping a star on America's Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.  

Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant.

Go to America's Taco Shop.  I will see you there.
