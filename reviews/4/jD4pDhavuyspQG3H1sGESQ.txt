When I was growing up Monterrey was the only Mexican restaurant around, and it's still the only one I ever go to when I'm in Charlotte. It's been a staple for many years and one of two places that I know I'll visit (other than Bojangles) when in NC.  Upon arrival, you are greeted with an overflowing basket of chips, salsa and some other white sort of cheese - sort of ranch dressing/sauce. I usually get enchiladas, but basically everything is good. Most noteable is the cheese that they put on top of everything. I'm not quite sure what's different about it, but I can't seem to find it anywhere else, it's delicious. Lunch plates usually run between $4-$7, so it's super cheap. You pay up front and they've got these little jars of chicklets gum - I used to always beg my Dad to buy me a pack when I was little. Yum yum yum.
