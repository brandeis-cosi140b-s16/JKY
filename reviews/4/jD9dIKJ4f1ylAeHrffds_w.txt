Great food and experience! We showed up around 5:30 with a party of 8 and were told the wait would be an hour, which was pretty much right on.

Server was quick, friendly and open with his recommendations.

Only a few in our party ordered cocktails (margaritas) and the were very tasty. The iced tea was good, too. Food was excellent; our party tried many different items and everyone was pleased. Start with the guacamole, it's prepared table side; a unique and delicious recipe. As an entree I had the cochinitas pibil and it was very good. The pork was tender and juicy and the sauce gave it just a bit of kick. Dessert was yummy, too; we tried the churros and chocolate cake...churros were the winner, hands down.

They did add an auto-gratuity at the end, which drives me crazy at a nice restaurant for a large, adult party. We always tip, usually better than the auto-gratuity; I resent the implication that we wouldn't or wouldn't tip as well, but maybe I'm just sensitive.
