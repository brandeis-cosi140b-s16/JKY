I ordered the steak fajitas for $11.99. I thought it was pricey for lunch, but no lunch specials on Saturday and Sunday. So when meal arrived it looked great! It was hot, fresh and very good. Had enough to take home for leftovers. Our waitress even asked us if we wanted chips and salsa to go. I would definitely recommend and will return. Nice place!
