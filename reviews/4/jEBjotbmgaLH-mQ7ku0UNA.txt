Now we're talking! There is a reason this place gets rave reviews and multiple "Best of" awards. This authentic Mexican food, no Tex-Mex here. Incredible offerings and a blending of flavors you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere.

We've been to both locations, but for whatever reason, prefer the 16th Street location over the Glendale location. Same food, same wonderful service - just personal preference.

Tacos: Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Oaxacan Black Mole, Chicken Asado. All excellent, super flavorful, seasonings not overpowering and well presented. The mole is probably the best I've ever tasted. Hint of cinnamon/spices, chocolate & chilies. Just the right blending of flavors to bring you back for more. Looking for something out of the box? Try the Arabe Burro. Al Pastor pork with hummus lettuce, cucumber and even some Tzatziki! Very refreshing. They also offer quite a number of vegetarian offerings.

La Santisima also boasts a homemade salsa bar unlike any you've seen. This really gives the customer the opportunity to try flavors and you just may find you've discovered a new favorite! The salsa made with peanuts is very good - really! And don't forget the adult beverage - the hand made house margarita is very good, too!

Restaurant is very unpretentious. Small in size. Glendale location has parking in the rear, street parking in Phoenix.

Neither location is close by our neighborhood, but worth the drive for great food.
