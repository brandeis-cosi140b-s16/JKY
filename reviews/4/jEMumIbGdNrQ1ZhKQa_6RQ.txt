I ventured over to Maricopa to visit some friends and found this little place.  I always like to give my business to locally owned and operated places, especially family places such as this one.  It's a cute little place, a house turned into a dining room, and it's cozy and warm.  The service was friendly and fast.  And the tacos were delicious!!  They have a lovely salsa bar with many choices but I am such a wimp when it comes to heat.  The pico de gallo was yummy and fresh and the chips were crisp and fresh too.  I don't get to Maricopa often but when I do, you will be sure I will be going back to Tacos N' More!!
