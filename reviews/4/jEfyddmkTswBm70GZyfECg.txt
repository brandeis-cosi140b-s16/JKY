Third time back.  Ordered the two flour Spinach Enchiladas special with pico de gallo, topped w/Baja sauce, served with rice and beans for $10.49.  I could only eat one and it was delicious!  The Enchiladas were stuffed with lots of fresh spinach & little cheese. Yum!  Also ordered a Carnitas special which came w/a ton of slow roasted fall apart pork, pico de gallo, sour cream guacamole and tortilla for $12.99.  Have also enjoyed the Chimichangas Machaca, Mexicana  Machaca Salad in a flour tortilla bowl, and Fajitas.  Food is amazing, Plates are delivered hot right out of the oven, and so is the food. Service is great & the waiters are flexible with ordereds!  Love the large free basket of warm chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. Can also order refill baskets of chips if you run out! The pop is in a huge glass and it comes with refills. The only issue I have is that the tables are made of wood and are very "sticky to touch"!   That is the only reason why I've given it four stars. Been around 45 years and have another location in Phoenix. Can also order take out.
