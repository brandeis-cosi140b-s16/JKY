They tacos aren't normal mexican taqueria tacos, they are SUPERSIZED! Its a great deal for the price, we had the fish tacos and the carne asada. The fish were battered well and fried to a crisp. The carne asada is chopped finer than what you'd normally expect for a taqueria taco, but it's marinated well. The carne asada also comes with gaucamole, the smoother (a little runny) kind. I prefer the chunky fresh stuff, so I would recommend asking for it on the side rather than on the taco.
