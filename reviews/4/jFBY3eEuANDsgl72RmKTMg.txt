Great little hidden joint just across Buster Boyd Bridge in SC.  Just like most all Mexican Restaurants they start you off with Chips & Salsa. The salsa was great! It was well favored with the right amount of kick. It you don't like spicy this my be a little hot. 

I ordered the combination #18 (burrito, taco, rice & beans). The ground beef was seasoned well. They were a little skimpy on the rice. The beans were favored as well and weren't dry. 

My wife ordered the Pollo Con Crema. It was really good as well. The chicken was well seasoned & grilled perfectly.  The Crema was good, maybe a little heavy on the sour cream size. Again they were a little skimpy on the rice. 

Overall. I will definitely come back & I recommend crossing the border for it!
