My group ended up at Casa De Lara because every other restaurant near State Street was packed on Friday night.

It was a gamble that paid off as the free chips and salsa were good and the meal of burritos was even better.

We also met some "tricks" at the casa who we later hung out with at Brothers Bar and Wando's... we got numbers. What can I say. Thanks Casa De Lara.

Notes: Beer was a little expensive, food came out quickly, restaurant is upstairs. Also, this is the second-best Mexican eatery I have been to.
