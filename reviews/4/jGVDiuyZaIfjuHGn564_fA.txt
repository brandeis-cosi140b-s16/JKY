This is a nice little neighborhood mexican food place that beats the nearest competition - Taco Bell - hands down. Most days, you pay prices that are what you would pay at any take out place that isn't fast food, except on Tuesday - Taco Tuesday is great! I'd take one of their tacos any day. The place is cute and always busy during happy hour. There is an area for sit down service and then an area for take away. Not a huge menu, but a variety of types of food under each category - tacos, burritos, etc. Add to this, breakfast service, and no wonder its busy. Salsa and chips are tasty. Add some hot sauce to anything to spice it up. 

Service is good - mostly young people who play around a little, but get the job done. I appreciate the fact that this is somebody who appears to hire high school kids so they get some job experience before the real world. 

It's close to home and quick. Who cares about what the food is served on. If you want fancier - then drive further. Or, take it home and eat it on your own dishes.  Its a good little place and I've been more than once. Oh and on this last Taco Tuesday - fed two people with a soda for under $10.00!
