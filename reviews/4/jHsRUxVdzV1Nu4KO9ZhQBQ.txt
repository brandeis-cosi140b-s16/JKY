This is a small restaurant, but the food there serve is actually very good, far better than what i thought i would get.  The plus side is that it's an actual Restuarant not one is the chain things they have in abundance or here. And what that means is that the food is all made to order and nor just heated up. 
The prices are fair and service is always fast, while the service is not exactly memorable or is still friendly, and overall pretty good. It's not too far from home so for me that's a plus. There's only a small handful of restaurants that are close to me, and this is one of maybe three thati go to on a regular basis.   The rest are not really worth mentioning much less actually go to.  It is with checking out though
