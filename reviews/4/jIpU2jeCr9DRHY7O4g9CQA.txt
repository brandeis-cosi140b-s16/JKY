Chipotle has the best burritos in town!  Seriously, much better than Qdoba's, Moe's, Salsarita's, et al (I don't include Phat Burrito in this, that's a whole separate category).  Offer great portions and I highly recommend the steak burrito.  Just remember to use some Chipotlaway once you're finished!!
