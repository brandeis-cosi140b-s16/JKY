Filbertos is a chain, but unlike many others this location has indoor seating with nice decor.  The food is cheap and good, portions large.
$1.00 tacos on Tuesday which I dare say are comparable to Garcia's tacos.  Massive burritos.  Not a fan of the use of enchilada sauce on the chili rellenos, however. 

In summary, cheap and plenty.
