A taco truck disguised as a restaurant...and it was exactly what I was looking for.

Food:  I had the carne asada taco platter.  The tacos were delicious, served with just a bit of guacamole, lettuce, and tomato, the meat was perfectly cooked (not rubbery or tough at all) on corn tortillas.  The rice was much better than any other local mexican restaurant, but the refried beans were nothing special.  It was very satisfying.  The drink choices were canned sodas or bottles of jarritos.  They also had a sangria flavored soda but they were out.  The owner offered to give us the display bottle, but my wife settled for the jarriots instead.  A nice offer on his part.

Restaurant: It was a bit chaotic with only a few tables and karaoke going on.  We got there just as another couple were leaving so we were able to sit down.  If not, not a big deal as we would have just gotten everything to do.  You order at the main counter (not a waiter) and the food is brought to you.  Very friendly staff.

The owner's name is Justice and I talked to him for a bit.  He seems very pleased with business so far and I'm hoping a place like this can succeed.  There seemed to be a steady stream of take-out while I was there, so only time will tell.

All in all, I really enjoyed the California Taco Shop...don't expect any James Beard awards on display, but if you're looking for some good quality street-food mexican and don't want to shell out $$ for a ticket to the west coast, this place will do it.

Good luck Justice and the rest of the CTS crew.
