I met a business contact here for lunch - it was delicious. We both had the street tacos on corn tortillas, each with a different filling. I had roasted chicken, pulled pork, and fish. They came with beans and rice. The rice was creamy and the beans were well cooked too. 

My only quibble with my experience is I don't like raw tomatoes and I purposely selected tacos that didn't have tomatoes on them, but 2 of my 3 tacos had diced tomato on them that I had to pick off. Next time I'll tell the server "No raw tomatoes anywhere on the plate, please" regardless of what the menu says.
