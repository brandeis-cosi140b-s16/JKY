Overall, good service.  Our server was patient and offered guidance in making my decision.
This evening the restaurant was fairly empty except for the large party that was there celebrating a child's (?) Birthday.
After we finally decided on what we were having and ordered I realized they actually close fairly early.  Eight p.m. seems like an early hour to close.
Our dinners were delivered moments after our beverages had been dropped off and they looked so good.  Mmm.  One of the items delivered was actually not what had been ordered.  She brought two (2) of the Tortas del Ray and one was a tally supposed to be an omelette.   It was discussed and then decided it would be consumed instead of sending it back and waiting for the correct entree to be made .
All of it was tasty.
And it was just too much.  
So of course we had to split the Esquimo.

I honestly can't recommend one thing because the few times I've dined here I've always had something different and they've all been really good.
So I would suggest you be adventurous, try something new.
