Went to this place on the Yelp "Hot New Business" recommendation.

For a Mexican Food Restaurant it was very clean and the people were very friendly.

Ordered the Carna Asada Burrito which had guacamole and Pico De Gallo and a few chips on the side along with the 5 Rolled Tacos.

The burrito was very tasty and a little smaller than filibertos. A good mixture of the guacamole, Pico De Gallo with the Carna Asada meat. The flour tortilla was also very good.

The rolled tacos were covered  with lettuce and Guacamole and very tasty.

The decor was a little better than a filibertos but nothing fancy.

There were posters on the windows for different specials and the shrimp quesidilla and Shrimp tacos looked very good and next time will try those dishes.
