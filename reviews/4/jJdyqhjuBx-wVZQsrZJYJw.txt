OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!
