Every time we are in Vegas for a trade show, we have to stop at this fabulous place. The staff is super friendly and very observant. I am not Mexican at all but my co-worker is. She is saying that this is the most authentic Mexican food outside Mexico. I enjoy the food very much. Always fresh and super tasty. Combined with yummy margaritas and a fantastic interior it makes a perfect place for a great dinner. Highly recommended.
