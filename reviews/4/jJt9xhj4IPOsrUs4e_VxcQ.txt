We came in for breakfast during Arizona Breakfast weekend, and it was definitely a good choice. At 7:30, we were the first people there, so it's hard to judge the service, but everyone was friendly. It's a very cool place, especially with the Yard all around it. We had the posole (pork soup) and chilaquiles (chips with eggs) and both were great, but watch out for the spice in that posole if you can't handle it. I've always loved Mexican breakfasts, and this is a great choice for it.
