We came here yesterday for lunch. Actually we wanted to go the restaurant next door but it was closed on Sundays so we decided to try this place. You get homemade fresh nachos with salsa and guac with the meal. We had their specials on the menu. It was Bulgogi Tater Tots consisting of tater tots, bulgogi, sour cream, bacon bits, tomatoes and green onions. It was crunchy and appetizing.

We also has Bulgogi skewers which was my favorite, very tender and satisfying. Pork belly skewers was ok. 

Interior was very casual. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. It's a great place to eat and doesn't break the bank.
