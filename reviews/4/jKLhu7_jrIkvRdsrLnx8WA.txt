When i first saw the signs for a place called Taxco opening up this time of year, i thought it was some new business here to do my taxes. Fortunately for me, it turned out to be a nice little Mexican restaurant since i was just saying how i didn't have a go-to Mexican restaurant in the area. 

Upon seating we were greeted with the chips and a nicely spiced salsa. We were given two separate bowls and a thing to pour salsa for ourselves. They had what appeared to be a wide selection of food choices, but we ordered off the combo lunch menu. The #3 came with an enchilada and burrito with your choice of either rice OR beans. Since having just one or the other is not an option for us, i recommend getting the beans with your meals and then ordering a side of rice to split. (The side of rice is 15 cents cheaper than the side of beans...yes i am a cheap bastard). At least it would have been enough for us to split. Not knowing we both ordered a side.
 
We had read the review for the Huntersville location that said the food was bland, but we thought all the food was great and we will be back.
