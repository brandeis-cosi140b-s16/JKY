I'm not a big fan of this style cuisine, but I've always heard this is the Mexican subway. I love subway so I figured I'd give this a try. It can be a bit pricey, however I always get a burrito and they feel it so full that they can barely wrap it in the tin foil and everything is always so delicious and fresh. I only took a star off because I ordered an alcoholic beverage once and it was about $8 and came in a much tinier glass than I expected. That has been my only complaint.
