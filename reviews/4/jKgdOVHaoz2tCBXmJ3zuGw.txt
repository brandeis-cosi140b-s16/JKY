Prepare to savor each bite when you visit Mark and Maria's - you'll have the opportunity as things move at their own pace here. Nothing wrong with that as the food is amazing. Just learn to work the system and things work out very nicely, ie be prepared to order, go to the counter to pay your bill! Only place in Phoenix I have as a 'must visit' on a weekly basis.
