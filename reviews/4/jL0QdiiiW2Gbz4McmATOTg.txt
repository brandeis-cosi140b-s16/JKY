Been going to this place for years about time I wrote a review. Basic fajita and chicken menu that has stayed the same, Great.  Love to sometimes just get the rice and beans if not in mood for meat, my vegetarian friends like it too. Love Love Love this place anyone I have ever taken has loved it too (ALOT  over the years).  staff always friendly. Would have given 5 stars but sometimes it can be a little warm and seats a little hard, so I get it to go.
