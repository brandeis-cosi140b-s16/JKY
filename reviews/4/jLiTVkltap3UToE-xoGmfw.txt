I stumbled across this restaurant when looking for food on a Sunday.  Nothing was open nearby but this Mexican restaurant so I thought I'd give it a try.  I ordered a Chimichanga meal which was very large and filling.  The food was very good for the money ($7) and the lady server was very nice.  There are TVs in the restaurant but none of them were working at the time.  If you want a quick bite of Mexican food, come here!
