The house margarita was great. Not too sweet. The salsa was nice. Spicy enough. Guacamole was fresh but not exactly Barrio Cafe awesome.  The food was pretty good. I'm sure they'll keep tweeking it.  I had the cochinita pibil taco which was a little bland. The service and the vibe are terrific. Lots of energy and everyone having a great time.
