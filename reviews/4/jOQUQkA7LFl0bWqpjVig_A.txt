My wife and I almost did not go here, because of so many bad reviews; however, we tried it anyway and we really like it.   The chips and salsa were excellent.  We shared the 3 taco meal and it was quite good.  The service was attentive.  Maybe the restaurant was just working out opening jitters.  We will for sure go back again.
