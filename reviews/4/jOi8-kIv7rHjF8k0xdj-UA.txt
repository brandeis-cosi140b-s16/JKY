Yummy in my tummy! We got a margarita picture which enough for our group of 5 to have 2 rounds for under $50. And the food was awesome. The nachos were huge, we could not finish as an appetizer. We sat down stairs which was lovely as the weather was nice, it is open air style. Not too expensive at all.
