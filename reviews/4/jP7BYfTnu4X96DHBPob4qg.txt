I went to Taqueria Canonita with a large group.  In our party was a 50-year-old, white southerner who, we later find out, eats nothing but meat and potatoes.  And has truly never had Mexican food.

It was hilarious watching this extremely polite man's reactions as we tried to explain what a burrito is or why anyone would slow-roast pork on a banana leaf.

He eventually settled on three soft tacos with rice but was perplexed with the color of the restaurant's cilantro rice.  "Now, I hope you don't mind me asking but is green a normal color for rice?"

I really liked Taqueria Canonita.  I tried the Pepita Crab Cakes and the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla as appetizers.  Both were very flavorful.  I was actually surprised with the crab cakes because I usually compare them against those found in New England.  They were solid, especially given that we were sitting in the middle of the desert.

The chips were just okay but the salsa was good.  And the guacamole was excellent and they give you a ton of it.

For my entree, I ordered the Mexico City Chicken Enchiladas.  It was good but nothing spectacular.

I had a couple margaritas and they were okay.  Nothing to write home about either but it did its job.

The inside of the restaurant had a really fresh, hip vibe.  We sat on the patio, under the Venetian's stars and next to the canal.  After the second drink, I almost forgot that I was inside of a mall.

For a place that serves green rice, this place was definitely able to please the crowd.
