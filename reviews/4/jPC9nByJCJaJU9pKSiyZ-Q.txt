Ive been to Loco once when it wasn't a Tuesday, but other than that I only go on Tuesday Nights... and by only, I mean every Tuesday.  My family and I go to Loco every Tuesday.  Kelsey and one other lady (im sorry I forget your name) are always our waitress.  Kelsey is awesome, I want to be friends with her! ha!  They always remember what we order.  I used to always get a margarita (one of the best frozen margaritas I have had at a restaurant) until I went on a health kick.  The atmosphere is awesome, they owners are always there checking in with people, and everyone is super friendly.  Tuesday nights are packed, luckily we get there early.  

Food: I always have chicken, steak and fish tacos! Ha! I don't mess around.  Chicken tacos are $1 on Tuesdays, steak and fish are $2.  What a deal!! I have also had their wings, which are phenomenal at a Mexican restaurant! Definitely try their pretzel sticks at least once with the queso, also another fave! 

Loco gets loud on Tuesday, everyone is there for a good time!! This place is great for families, since its in Ahwatukee.  And the service is fantastic!  Can't speak for any other nights, but Tuesday is definitely Poppin!
