My husband and I came to Rio Rico for the first time last week. We were even lucky enough to make it in time for happy hour. The house margaritas were delicious!  We had the carnitas as well as the chile relleno with beef flauta and every single bite was great. To top it off, we received awesome service by our waiter, Mario. When we return we will definitely ask for him!
