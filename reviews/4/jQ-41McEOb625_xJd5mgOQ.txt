So cheap and not in the sense of crappy I mean inexpensive for what you get. AWSOME drink specials and decent portions for the dough you toss down. This place is a good 2-3rd date kind of place. Sometimes the service if a bit slow and inattentive but for the most part good service. Got through down the gauntlet and get the "Elvis" plater. You will not be disappointed.
