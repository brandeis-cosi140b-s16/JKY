The last time before this visit that I went to a Rubio's, it was in Long Beach and they were hella rude when I asked if they could make tacos without meat.

While vegan tacos aren't on the menu at all, this location is perfectly willing to not only meet my request, but make it just as delicious as anything else they offer. All their tortillas are dairy-free, and their corn tortillas are gluten and dairy-free, with the nutrition info made easily available on their website, and the staff is careful to make sure you don't accidentally get cheese on your order.

Not too shabby for a chain. Come to Canada, please.
