We ate there last night and the food was excellent! The salsa is one of the best I have had at a restaurant like this. The food was delicious, it was properly timed (in terms of courses). Despite being very busy, our waiter was excellent and the staff was appropriate at checking in on us and quick to bring more salsa/drinks. My boyfriend said several times that this was one of the best Mexican meals he has ever had. I don't know if I agree with that, mostly because I have had too many good Mexican meals...but it definitely was excellent and tasty and I would love to eat here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: the hostess was a little curt and had a bit of an attitude. She said there was an hour wait (which we understood and were OK with), made it sound like our request to be seated inside was something she probably wouldn't try to do, and said she would call us when a table opened up. An hour later we returned to find our name crossed off. She said she tried to call but it didn't work. My phone was with me and on the entire time we waited. I was receiving emails at that time too so i know it had service. I checked the number she had and it was right. I am thinking she didn't call...despite that little issue I would recommend this place.
