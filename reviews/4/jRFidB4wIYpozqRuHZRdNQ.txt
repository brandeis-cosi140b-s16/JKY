I'd wanted to eat here for the longest time and when JD's mom wanted to take us to dinner on Tuesday- this was our destination of choice. Didn't even know that on "taco tuesday" if you order two tacos the third is free- Bonus!! Mom had a grilled halibut and a shrimp taco. JD had the freebie-a steak taco. All three were very well received. 

We also had an order of the much heralded guac and it definitely lived up to its hype! It was chunky and perfectly concocted and I was tempted to lick the serving bowl, but refrained in the presence of my *hopefully* future mom-in-law. 

I am obSESSed with chilaquiles so natch I ordered that. When asked how I preferred my eggs I said "as hard as possible" to which our server suggested scrambled. I decided to go for it. My plate arrived and it was really good, but admittedly, something was lost from the overall taste of the meal without the fried eggs. I'm glad I tried it and I did clean my plate, but I think fried would have made the dish even better.

JD had the carne asada burrito and was sad when it arrived all beany (he despises beans of any kind and the beans weren't noted on the menu). Our server quickly rushed away the bean filled burro and replaced it with another bean free one. This was amazing- I tasted it. So in the end, everyone was happy! 

I love the laid back vibe, the cool location and the super friendly servers. I will be back to have the chilaquiles again with fried eggs. And I wouldn't mind having some tacos as well!
