I love this place!  So much better than Top Shelf across the street and it's a good feeling to be able to support a local business!  My favorites are the chorizo breakfast and the chicken fundito.  The chips are great too.  The staff is friendly and always accomodating.  I will be a regular here as long as I live in the area.
