So Christmas "dinner" was kind of an afterthought this year...travelling and a time warp sort of forced that on our little merry band and we were famished by 9PM.  We went to a couple of other places first, one had an excessive wait and one was just a perfect storm of a bad idea (more on that in another review).  We ended up back at Arriba and, I must say, the reliability of a good Mexican meal (combined with a good marguerita) really helped save the day.  The staff was upbeat, even though they were working and (as always) the pricing was really reasonable.  So thanks, Arriba, for helping rescue our Christmas "dinner"....it was yummy!
