This place has some bomb ass fries and tacos.

I decided to try this place because I was craving for some late night tacos in LV so I decided to travel down the strip to find some.  

The tacos here are on the pricier side ($2.00) but they are GOOD!  But, the carne fries or adobado fries here are A STEAL! I got the half for $5 and it was huge!!!!! Totally worth the money!!!

If you want some bomb tacos in LV definitely venture out and try tacos el gordo! I must say it's just as good as the tacos over here in Socal!!
