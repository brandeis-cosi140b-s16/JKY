I am a huge fan of all the two hippies locations.  I happen to see this location when I was driving home one night.  It is definitely the closest one to me.  
When I walked in I was amazed.  All the others look cluttered and like they need a good wash but this one is clutter-free but still holds the charm that makes 2 hippies fun.

The food and service were amazing. We were even brought complimentary brownies.   I love the cactus tacos!  I do wish they had a veggie burgers and  hot dogs.  That is the only thing missing from a wonderfully pleasant time.
