Had a great experience at Border Grill a couple of nights ago. We had just come from the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay so this was a convenient choice right around the corner.

We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was nice. It was dark but intimate and quiet. Our waiter was not the friendliest guy but he did let us know about the drink menu and the special of the night. I feel like when he found out that we were going to only get an appetizer and one entr√©e (two of us) his attitude got even worse.

We started with the raja potato tacos appetizer which was amazing (there are only two tacos as an appetizer so not really enough to share.) They were different than any other type of taco I have had and really a flavor explosion. I'm not sure how to explain the texture of the potato but it was almost like a mashed potato that had been fried on a hard fried tortilla with chipotle crema. It also came with guacamole and a corn salsa. I would definitely order these many times again. In fact I think I will be craving these with no way to get them :(

We also had the carne asada quesadilla. It was also delicious. The carne asada was probably the best I have ever had. The meat just melted in your mouth along with the cheese. It was a tad bit on the too salty side but the guac and sour cream countered that a  bit. Overall the flavor was great, just cut down on the salt a bit.

Overall we had a good experience. Our service was just okay. The food was great. I would come back on another visit to Vegas.
