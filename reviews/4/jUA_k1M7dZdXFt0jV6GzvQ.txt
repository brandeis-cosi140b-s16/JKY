I love Baja Miguel's for lunch.  They have a lunch special for $8.95, which consists of two items, beans and rice, fideo soup, and a margarita (or substitute drink).  Since I am usually here during my work lunch break, I get a virgin margarita, which is still delicious.  They also bring out chips and dip pretty much as soon as you sit down.
