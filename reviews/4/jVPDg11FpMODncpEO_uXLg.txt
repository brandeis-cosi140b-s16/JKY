Took the light rail to Phoenix today and on the way home I had a craving for carne asada ...  so while waiting for my transfer bus to take me the rest of the way home I decided to grab a burrito from this location . It was delicious, not too much pico de gallo, or guacamole, plus the pieces of steak were tender, and there was plenty for lunch tomorrow. I can not complain about the food, or anything, really. The outside tables were clean, and the staff was pleasant and attentive.
