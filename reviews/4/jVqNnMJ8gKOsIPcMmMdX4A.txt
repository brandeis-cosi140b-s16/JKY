It looks like everyone's experince here differs greatly.  It is a novelty to say the least.  Where else would you find asian/mexican/carribean food?  

When we first arrived there was no one there.  The guys behind the counter were super helpful in giving out samples and showing me how the ordering process worked.  I placed my order, got drinks, and sat down to wait.  My daughter waited patiently while looking at pictures posted on the wall.  

When the food was ready they brought it out to our table.  My daughter had a cheese quesadilla and white rice.  Ya, I know, but what can you do?  I was a picky eater as a kid too.  I had a jerk chicken quesadilla, carnitas, black beans and pork fried rice.  Was it the most amazing food I've ever had?  No, but it was good and it was cheap and better than Micky D's any day.  My daughter gobbled down her rice and quesadilla.  It was tasty, the jerk chicken had just enough heat for me, the carnitas were tender, and the rice had nice flavor.  

The decor is a bit different.  It's a huge area with lots of seating.  It feld kind of echo-y when we got there because it was empty.  The kitchen looked clean but I noticed some of the table needed to be wiped down better and the soda station could have been cleaned up a bit more.  This is a great place for families.  Mid way through our meal more and more came in.  There is a little children's play area in front of the asian/mexican panda bear in the corner.  My daughter took the opportunity to make some new friends.  

Am I going to go back.  Yes, I will.  Cheap eats other than fast food are hard to find. And you get a cookie with your meal.....Snickerdoodle please!
