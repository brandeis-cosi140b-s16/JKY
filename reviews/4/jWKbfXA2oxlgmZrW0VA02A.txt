Went there for Dinner on a Friday night and I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the food and the reasonable prices.  There's a great deal of variety and some creative New Mexican dishes.  I'd go so far as to say this is the best New Mexican restaurant in the East Valley!  Its not super spicy like Los Dos but there's a lot more flavor and you'll still feel the burn.

Pro's:  The Food and Service
Con's:  Ambiance & decor could use a little jazzing up, location is not ideal
