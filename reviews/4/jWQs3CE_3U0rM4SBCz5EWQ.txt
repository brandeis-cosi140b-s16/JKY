Some times taking a chance on a restaurant with an empty parking lot pays off. Take this morning, for example: we found ourselves with an open time slot and Robert M asked what I wanted to do. Let's eat, I responded, and suggested El Mana Restaurant (truth be told, I just said the restaurant at 15th and McDowell, but that's besides the point). After doing a drive-by and confirming this is where I wanted to eat, we pulled in the empty parking lot and entered. 

We were soon served chips and salsa. Standard chips but great, spicy salsa. I ordered the huevos rancheros and Rob the rojo chilaquiles. Both were served with beans and rice. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, with the eggs cooked perfectly and the spice level just right. I found Rob's meal to be a touch on the sweet side, but still good. 

El Mana is a byproduct of La Luz del Mundo House of Prayer, and all proceeds are donated to the construction of their new church. The employees volunteer their time for this cause. 

I'm already planning a return trip. Plus, they offer free Wi-Fi.
