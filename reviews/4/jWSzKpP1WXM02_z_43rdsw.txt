Very cool concept! Chipotle style enchiladas, but with much more creative offerings. I came here for dinner tonight with my husband and I decided on the tortilla soup, and my husband ordered the enchiladas. I chose the short rib as an added option which was fantastic, very juicy and flavorful. The soup had a ton of vegetables and herbs in it and was quite filling. My husband went with a spicy cornbread stuffing enchilada, and a green chile pork with white cheese, red sauce, and sour cream. The cornbread had a similar flavor as a tamale, I couldn't stop stealing bites of this one. I really like how you can customize your order and there's plenty of options if you want to go dairy free or vegetarian. It was also very reasonable, dinner for 2 was $15! I will definitely return.
