Mon-Fri lunch hours are filled with state employees, lobbyists, senators and representatives (during the legislative session).  This is the only times I go here b/c I work down here and it's a great place to grab lunch or to eat there.  You are not there for the ambiance.  Some construction has been going on for the past year or so to add on to this place but I really have no idea if and or when the new addition will be opened up.

Let me recommend a few things:
1. The Chicken Soup-- this is white meat, rice, chicken broth and pico, with fresh avocado. It is my favorite thing on the menu.

2. Tacos and Enchiladas-- you can't go wrong.

3. Do not order quacomole.  It is a green avocado-ish spread with cottage cheese.  Not sure why or what this is about.

4. Lock your car in the parking lot.  And then double check to make sure it is locked.
