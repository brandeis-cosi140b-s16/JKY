This is our go to place on the weekends when we want a big breakfast. We have our usuals every time. Even though we have tried to eat other things from time to time. The sourdough bread is the best that I have ever had, thick cut and delicious. The staff are all wonderful and have been there forever, it's nice to have a place that feels small town in such a large transient city.
