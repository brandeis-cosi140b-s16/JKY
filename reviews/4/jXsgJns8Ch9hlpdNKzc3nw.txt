I loved what they have done with the interior since opening gallo. I finally had a chance to check it out this week and there was some hits and misses. The tacos were very tasty and reasonable but on the smaller side..but tasted fresh for the small bite. For some reason we then ordered the cheese plate and I was shocked with what came out! Big ugly blocks of  cheddar cheese with corn nuts! There were nicely cut strawberries but then backed by blue cheese as the second cheese selection, ugh. I want my money back after spending almost $70 on drinks to be confronted with corn nuts. On a positive note -Flamingo on Wed nights, fantastic!!!
