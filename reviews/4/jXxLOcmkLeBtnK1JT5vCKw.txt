If I could I would give them 5 stars on their salsa and chips...but I have to take the whole dining experience into account.  I really liked their food.  Their service was wonderful.  I was there for my daughter's rehersal dinner and they did a great job accomadating about 30 of us.  Then did an awsome job embarrasing the bride and groom by making them stand up and singing something to them...don't know what they were singing because it was in spanish.  

The parking is horrible.
