As a native of new mexico i appreciate the attempt at authentic cuisine. As with any restaurant, the green chile is going to vary. Sometimes hot, sometimes mild. But, good flavor. They lose a star because the bar tender brought me the wrong beer twice. Then charged me $7 a piece, during happy hour. After a whirlwind of criticism he finally took one off. But, great wine list during happy hour.
