Great place in Lawrenceville - just across the street from Children's!

Menu is a bit overwhelming, but nothing different from most mexican places - there are infinite ways you can mix it up with different proteins and sides here! Food has always been awesome whenever I've been here - proper portions (not too big, but not too small either...) served at the correct temperature, and full of wonderful flavor. My personal favorite - carnitas burrito. Good GOD, it is delicious!

Chips and salsa or guac are great - I've always liked chatting with the owners about their business; it's clear they have a passion for this, and I am always happy to do my part to keep their dream alive by enjoying their awesome food.

I know everyone loves BYOB, but I will say this - having Corona, Negra Modelo, or Simpatico in the fridge would bump you up a star in my book!

Will definitely be back...
