Cheap fast food that you should not eat everyday - unless you want to get fat and have a heart attack.

Food quality at this location is on par with all other Taco Bell's. It is the service that sets this one apart. Orders are always accurate....and FAST. 

LOST STAR - I almost always use the drive-through here. But a couple of times I have eaten inside, the dining room was not clean. I hate having to clean up after someone else before I eat.
