Flew into Phoenix to see family.  And on my way home from the airport we stopped here.  It's been at least 20 years since I've been here.  Though it has been painted and some modern fixtures added, it's the same joint--and that delights me!!  Food was fresh, plentiful, and reasonably priced.  Our server was diligent and cheerful.  The restaurant was clean and bright.  My dad and I got to catch up over a nice meal and really enjoyed our visit.  Didn't visit the restrooms or the bar, however there was a table-tent on our table speaking about Happy Hour Specials.  That's a plus!!  Thanks you guys.  Hope to make it back sooner!!
