Aesthetically this is the most beautiful Mexican food restaurant I've ever been to. It is very quaint on the inside. It is definitely a good date restaurant. The server was very friendly. The chips and salsa were pretty good. I got the shredded beef burrito. Most Mexican food restaurants don't do shredded beef right. Most of the time it is overcooked and dry. Their shredded beef was not as dry but still seemed a bit overcooked. The food presentation was nice. The beans were good. The rice was okay. The portions were pretty normal. The dessert was amazing. They have sopapillas and churros. If someone asked me about going to this restaurant I would recommend giving it a shot.
