I stopped in randomly one morning to pick up a few breakfast burritos. Having never been before, I was pleasantly surprised. They had a nice salsa bar and there were a few tables to sit at. My 4-star rating was caused my the fact that the wait time for my food was a bit long.  

The burritos were delicious though. Not anywhere near as greasy as the "bertos" in the area.  

I would definitely go back, if I had a bit of extra time in the morning.
