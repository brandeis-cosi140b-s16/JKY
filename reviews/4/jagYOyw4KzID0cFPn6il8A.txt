I met the original owner, Joel, who would not ever have served watery re-fried beans.  Aside from that George (Jorge) the new owner has worked hard to own this piece of an authentic Mexicali  franchise.  My personal recommendation is the combo "with one extra" -- cheese enchilada, rolled tacos and the tamale.  Also, don't overlook the pollo floutas!!  A special request, but it's my favorite at a restaurant such as this.  Great salsa.  Mix the hot and mild for a real treat!  Make sure to eat in, rather than take out, as you get free chips + salsa.
