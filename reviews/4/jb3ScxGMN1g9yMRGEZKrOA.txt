Chipotle is the best. We all know it. But the thing is, this Chipotle could run a lot more efficiently. There is a lot of time waiting in line because the efficiency of getting more food on the line isn't as fast as it should be, especially for a fast-food chain 2 blocks away from campus. Why still four stars? Because it's delicious! I still go here all the time because the food is so fresh-- it must get replaced very frequently because of the amount of people that go here, so it's in its freshest state. All in all, good place, but could use some better efficiency.
