I like this place... When you go there you know what you are going to get; warm cheesy comfort food, that is definitely not mexican. But if you go there knowing what to expect, you won't be disappointed.
Check their name of the day, you get a free meal! 
And its fun to go for half price margs on Tuesdays and Thursday, which usually coincides with karaoke or the fueling pianos.  I like what one reviewer said though, def don't dress up of you are going to drink here... You will get hit on by creepers and townies.
