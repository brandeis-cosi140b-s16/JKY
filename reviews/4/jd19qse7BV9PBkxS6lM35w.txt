I'm picky, but I've found that there are two things Tia Rosa's does really well:  their chile rellenos, and also anything with beef in it. their chile rellenos are non-traditional, almost, I would say, New Mexico style, but they are now my favorite rellenos anywhere. and the beef comes out nice and tender and flavorful. I would highly recommend this place, but it does get crowded on weekends (way crowded!). I try to go for lunch. :)
