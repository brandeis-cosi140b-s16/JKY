I really enjoyed the food and service, excellent food but I do agree with other reviewer about the music. 
Music makes a huge difference while you are dining, and in the case of this restaurant continuous classic rock does not match the food served. Literally I want to go in, have excellent food and get out ASAP, because the music is draining. Hope they change it or mix it at least!!
