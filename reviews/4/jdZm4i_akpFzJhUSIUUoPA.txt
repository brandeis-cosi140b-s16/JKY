Walk in... and just smell the authentic Mexican spices permeate the air.

We ordered the flautas and the fish tacos... both well seasoned and nicely cooked.

Their guacamole is very very creamy and reasonably tasty.  I like chunky guacamole, but I know others that really like creamy, so if you like creamy guacamole, this is good.

The tacos had a nice spice to them with a lot of cilantro (which I absolutely love) so these definitely beat chain restaurants.

They were fast and nice.

Horchata is awesome and they offer other Mexican soda's as well, like Jarritos.

We had a large horchata, two fish tacos, and 6 flautas for less than $12.

Definitely worth it.
