Solid Mexican food spot located in a nice Tempe location. I've gotten orders for dine-in and take-out and have been pleased with both experiences. 

Nothing stands out on the menu but I've tried the beef tacos, enchiladas, chili rellano, tostadas, green corn tamales, chimichangas and thought they were all tasty.

Consistent food spot and will continue to go there in the future.
