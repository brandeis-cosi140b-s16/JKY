It's me and my girlfriend's new favorite spot. She's from Texas and loved the Mexican cuisine while I love beer and those buffalo shrimp street tacos rule me. 

The only reasons I mark it 4 outta five is:
-i will never like TVs in a bar. I understand there purpose but I don't care for sports and they are incredibly distracting. 

-The street corn should, in my humble opinion, be grilled. It was way too watery when I bit into it.
