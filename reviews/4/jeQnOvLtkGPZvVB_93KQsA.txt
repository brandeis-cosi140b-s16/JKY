I usually don't write a lot about chain restaurants, but this particular Z'Tejas deserves one from me!

I think over Z'Tejas serves up some good eats in general.  I particularly love their cheese dip in their nacho cheese and chip appetizer.  Warm, creamy, and cheesy along with some guacamole pop; great start to the night and I would totally recommend.  They're known for their margaritas, but I felt like a beer so didn't have a chance, but definitely next time!  

For entrees my friend and I shot for the Salmon salad, fajitas, and for myself I ordered the Smothered Chicken Burrito.  I rather enjoyed my burrito filled with rice, chicken, cheese, and doused with warm red chile sauce.  

However, the love I give here is because of their service.  We had a party of 11 and they did their best to accommodate us on a busy night; even having a server come out to the front of the building taking our drink orders.  Service did not slack all night and that's what I appreciate; plus they were knowledgeable about their food.  I've worked in the food industry all my life and in the end there's never excuses just get it right and Z'Tejas Paradise Valley did! - Enjoy!
