It's always nice to find food and drink that you can pretty much pay for with pocket change - Border Grill takes happy hour to a new level of ridiculous. Much like the first time I discovered 99 cent pizza in NYC (and realized it was actually good), I did a serious double take when I saw the prices.

As you would in any Mexican restaurant, start with chips and salsa. Free.
Move on to a tamale or two or three or seven. Hot, delicious, fresh. $1.
Order one of the tacos, or order all three. $2 each. Brisket was the favorite, but they were all good.

Classic beers on the menu, but we went with margaritas and sangria - both definitely worth getting. I'm a big fan of good sangria, so I remember having two or three while we were here. Big glasses, extremely aggressive prices.

We ate and drank for almost an hour, and the bill was no more than $15.

Crazy. Well worth it.
