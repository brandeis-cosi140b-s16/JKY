Delicious Mahi Mahi Tacos! I love that they have late night chips and salsa. For the most part, this is our pre-game spot for friday and saturday nights. They even have my favorite Tequila, Cruz Tequila! Cruz is always a good start for us and they make the best margs with it. Good service but sometimes the bar gets really crowded.

A + in my book
