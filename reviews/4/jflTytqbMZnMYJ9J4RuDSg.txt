Ya know, I just love this place.

It ain't fancy, but the food is always solid, and the people that work there are very friendly.  I appreciate someone that has a smile on their face at work!

Last night, my 'seester' and I decided to go there.  They don't have Rubio's in Prescott, so she almost always wants to go when she's here.

Right now they have several langostino lobster items.  Run, don't walk, to your nearest Rubios and try them.  Oh.  My.  Gawd....  My sis and I both got the surf and turf taco platter.  The lobster taco has incredible -- garlicy lobster chunks, shredded cabbage, onion, and cilantro.  It was truly wow-worthy.  The steak taco was pretty damn good too.  It was kind of cool -- they bake the cheese onto the corn tortilla -- so it gets sort of chewy.  It was AWESOME.  It also has bacon bits (life just isn't worth living without bacon), and this chipotle crema on it.  Woo-freakin-hoo!

During our meal the manager came over to our table to check on us.  She wanted to see what we thought of the lobster.  It was just nice that she wanted to know we were happy with our food.  How refreshing!
