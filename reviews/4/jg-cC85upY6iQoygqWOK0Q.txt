i love filiberto's. as a hispanic American i think the good is pretty authentic for a chain restaurant. the only thing different locations vary in quality of food. this one is always busy which in my experience means the food will not be old, cold or overcooked. the only problem i've had with this location is that sometimes you can wait for a long (sometimes really long) time for your food. if you are in a hurry be aware of that...
