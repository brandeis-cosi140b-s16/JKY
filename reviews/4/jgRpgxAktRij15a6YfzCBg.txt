Los Gringos Locos is my own personal desert oasis in the Far East Valley! This larger-sized, but cozy-feeling restaurant is "just right" if you're looking for a casual Mexican sitdown where you and your friends and family can enjoy loads of complimentary chips and salsa, interesting daily drink specials from a fully stocked bar and an assortment of very tasty south-of-the-border food fare at a price that won't break the bank! 

Though the menu selections consist mostly of predictable Mexican restaurant favorites, portions are generous and the quality of the food is very good. 

My personal suggestion is to grab a hot n' flaky, sour cream and guacamole-topped Chimichanga and split it with your significant other! The Chimi, like most of the entrees, comes loaded with lots of meat inside, plus rice and beans on the side, for around $10. With the complimentary chips and salsa, neither you nor your loved one will leave hungry! Plus, you can each toss a mixed drink on the tab and still get out for under $20! Now, that's a "cheap" date that she'll actually thank you for!

For a solid and safe choice when it comes to restaurant-quality Mexican food, Los Gringos Locos is certainly an excellent value at the Far-East end of the Phoenix Metro area!
