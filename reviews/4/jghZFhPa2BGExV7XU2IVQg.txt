It's been awhile since theirs been a review. Went for fish tacos. They by far the best in Las Vegas. Service is prompt and courteous. Order was "right on".  Fish comes on two tacos a bed of cabbage, with diced tomatoes/onion and celantro and a white sauce. They are delicious. This is a seafood restaurant. Everything is freshly made to order. Whatever you order you will enjoy. For the price you can't go wrong. Fish tacos are 3.00 each....go for it.
