Clearly a LOT of happy diners here. Lovely Mexican waitresses who know what they are talking about. Food is superb (best we've had in Charlotte in terms of Mexican). AND plenty of leftovers for two more large suppers! Fresh veggies & meats, yummy sauces, very moderately priced menu and excellent service. We'll be back soon! Our waitress's name was Arancia. She couldn't have been more delightful. Most gracious and kind. She checked on us often (they were busy) and made sure our doggies always had fresh water. I had Arroz con Pollo (which I'll also be sharing with the hubby this evening along with a fascinating chicken dish he ordered (some chopped pecans in the green amazing sauce - he asked for extra to go, no problem). We highly recommend Zapata's, but if the weather is nice and you want to sit outside, please don't take our favorite table - Arancia will know which one it is!
