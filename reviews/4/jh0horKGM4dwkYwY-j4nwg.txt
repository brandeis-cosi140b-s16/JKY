Very good Mexican food 
We recoment the nacho's  lunch order was more than we could eat. We shared an order. 
we had eaten there year ago. We would eat there as regulars but we are from Florida.
Carolyn our very good and helpful server said the lunch order came all decked out, the dinner Nachos are chips and cheese or build your own. 
Lunch for 2 was $13.48.
