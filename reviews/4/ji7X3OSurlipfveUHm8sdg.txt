America...the beautiful. Ok...America the Delicious!

Ordered the al pastor burrito w/ spicy chips & salsa. Also got one of the corn on the cobs. 

It was fantastic, but the corn is really the only thing that I dream about. 

Several nights ago, I woke up in a cold sweat. Why? Well, it was because in that horrible nightmare, the only thing that happened on 12/21/12 was the end of corn...cornmageddon is what Conan O'Brien called it (Jay Leno quickly claimed the phrase as his own)...and since I'm a Cornhusker, it was a really traumatic vision, made worse that I knew deep down that I would never again have one of America's delicious, succulent cobs of heavenly goodness, those sweet sweet ears would be no more. *boo hoo* 

Today, I made a decision to sell everything I own and start stockpiling. We're only 2 months away from the end of the world as we know it, don't just sit there, do something about it. Go order the corn!
