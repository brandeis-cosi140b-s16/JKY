Awesome !!! After months and months ... What felt like years we finally made it back to the old revo burrito!!! We used to go here all the time .... 
The food was great !!! The only slip was that they have taken the hard shell tacos off the menu as an option ;( 
Food is fresh, simple and everything u want for a mex fix!!!

The service was exceptional !!! Our server Patrick was sweet, fast, kind, funny and a true pro !!! Thanks !!!
