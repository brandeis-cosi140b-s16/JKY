Ok, so Filiberto's is my kinda joint.  It's open 24 hours and has tasty, inexpensive food.  It reminds me a lot of my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas, Roberto's.  I stopped in at a lil after 11pm the other night and got a Chicken Chimichanga.  I played some old school Pacman while I waited a very short time for it and when I got it, it was delicious.  I loved how the chicken was well seasoned and had a lil spiciness to it. :)  The beans and rice were also good.  I'll definitely be back.  

See ya there!
