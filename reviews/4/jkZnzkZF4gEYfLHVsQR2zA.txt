Picked this restaurant because it was close to my hotel and was very pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the wings and they were excellent and the portion was huge.

I then had the beef fajitas and they too were excellent and I washed them down with the special margarita of the day.  I will repeat the next time I'm in town.
