Quick Review™
+   Dollar tacos on Tuesdays: this past Tuesday was Kalua pig (Christmas came early!); however, I am not certain if it is the same every week or will remain the same in the future. These aren't skimped tacos for the promotion offer: they are loaded with enough food to keep one full for days if one orders a bunch.

+/- This is nitpicking: there is no way to directly enter the strip mall heading south on Durango Drive. A U-turn must be successfully completed. 

-    N/A.

KEY: 
+   Positive observation
+/- Neutral note

In A Sentence™
A taste of Hawai'i at a fraction of the cost of a direct flight to Honolulu from Las Vegas + accommodations + rental vehicle + eating out once there.

Personally, I wouldn't compare this to Chipotle® because Chipotle fucking sucks. No one patronised Chiptole with the intentions to remind themselves of a taste of Mejico. I patronise Braddah's because I lived on the island for five years and this is closer than what I am going to get anywhere else. And, it is much better than the Chipotle chain. 

Pro Tip: Taco Tuesday. 

Pro Tip: My favourites rank in order of precedence: chicken, pork, fish. 

Pro Tip: They have local magazines such as Las Vegas Weekly (http://www.yelp.com/biz/las-vegas-weekly-henderson) and Sunday (http://thesunday.com/) here.

There is a drive-thru.

This is where Sliding Thru was previously anchored yet they didn't make it. Here's to hoping that this is not a cursed location and Braddah's can make it in the extreme NW with continued support from the locals. No tourists here.
