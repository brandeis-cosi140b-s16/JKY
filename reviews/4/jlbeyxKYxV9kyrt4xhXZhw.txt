Visited Leticia's 8/3/12-  Been wanting to try Leticia's for awhile now but they are a drive from our house so kept putting it off and I'm kicking myself in the "trasero"!  We took my niece there for dinner.  We got there a bit early so seating was no problem but when we left there seemed to be a wait.  

Started off with their chips, bean dip and salsas.  LOVED the salsa verde.  My niece raved and she is 8!!  The beans and other salsa were just fine.  My niece ordered off the kids menu and had the chicken burrito (came with beans rice, a beverage and dessert).  She really liked the burrito.  

My husband ordered the Latecia's Quesa Tacos which had a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese stuffed with shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce "and topped with a chipotle cream sauce.  It came with a  small individual cheesy rice casserole  topped with crema and chile and a side of beans (he picked refried).  I stole that tasty little rice casserole right from under his nose!  I would come back for that and their grilled mexican corn on the cob!  That corn was super tasty!

I had their Taquitos dinner which gives you a good variety to choose from.  I chose the beef picadillo, chicken, and the most delectable  Potato and Cheese wrapped in  corn tortillas and fried crispy. All were topped with guacamole,  Oaxaca cheese, cotija cheese, crema and pico de gallo.  I had a side of black beans and cilantro rice.  

Service was good and the decor was really nice.  Wished they were closer but they are worth  driving out to.
