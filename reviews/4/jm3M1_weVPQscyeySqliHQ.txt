Good grilled burger spot. Nice smell of grilled goodness when you walk in. 

I tried the Green Chile Burger (they spell it with a chil"i" but that should be more for the chili you put on fries or chili dog). The burger seem to be about quarter pound in size, it had one large roasted green chile(be nice if it was more spicy) split in half,  nice thick cut bacon, pepper jack cheese lettuce onion and tomato. Very good burger (once i added mustard) didn't blow my mind but it was tasty and fresh.

Had waffle fries which were good as well.

Place is very simple inside, fast food/order then pick-up type place with plenty of seating.

I sampled the 6 salsas they had, they were pretty good as well (nothing real spicy though), i am gonna have to come back and try the Mexican food.
