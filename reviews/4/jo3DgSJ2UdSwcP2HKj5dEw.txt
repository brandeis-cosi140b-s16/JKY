Los Molcajetes is a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant that is off the hook!!!  A Molcajete rock filled with your choice between Chicken, Beef, or Seafood w/onions and tomato broth.... Soooo good.  One Molcajete can feed at least two people.  The service is quick and the food is amazing from the tacos/burritos to the signature Molcajetes.  This place is a gem hidden in the valley and deserves your appetite.
