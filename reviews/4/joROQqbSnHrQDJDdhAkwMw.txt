had a bogo from the library reading program, so my hubby and I used it along with his free movie passes at Harkins for a special Father's Day/Date night.  It was fast, clean and it pleased my carnivore loving husband and me the vegan!  I made a salad with the sofritas, which were quite tasty and had just the right amount of heat.  My husband tried the barbacoa burrito.  he like it a lot.
