Yum, yum, yummy! This place serves amazing Mexican food. Nothing fancy, just high-quality ingredients simply prepared so you can really taste their wonderful flavors. The vegetarian burrito is delicious. Dip it into the yummy salsas, and eat the spicy carrots with fresh lime juice squeezed on top while you wait for your food. This place gets busy at lunch and dinner time, so plan around that if you don't want to wait.
