El Pollo Loco is a chain restaurant specializing is Mexican fast food. I've only had the roasted chicken combo, and it's great.  There are several sides you can get with the grilled chicken. If you go, ask for a coupon. Currently, they have a coupon deal with discounts starting at $1 all the way up to $3 off.  They punch the coupon after each visit, so as you return, the discounts get higher. First visit, $1 off, second $1.25 all the up to $3. Staff at the N 56th Street location are very friendly.
