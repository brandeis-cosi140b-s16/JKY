This is a very nice Baja Fresh...the one I normally go to is the location on Flamingo.  The Eastern location seems to be newer.  Staff is just as friendly here and the food is just as fresh.  Loved the taquitos and my husband enjoyed his summer shrimp tacos.  As always, love their chips and salsa bar!
