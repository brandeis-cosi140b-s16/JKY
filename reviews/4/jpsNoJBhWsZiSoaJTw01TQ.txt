We decided to go to The Mission for my 24th birthday. When we first parked, we were having trouble finding the restaurant, so a nice guy asked what we were looking for. We told him we couldn't find The Mission, he smiled and told us to follow him. Along the way, he recommended several of their dishes. After we were seated, he came over... turns out it was the owner, Brian! He was such a sweet guy and even sent over chocolate cake at the end of the meal, complete with a sparkler. 

The food was beyond delicious. I absolutely HATE guacamole, but their homemade guac was absolutely amazing... very complex and flavorful. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos, which were really good. My husband had the steak tacos and my parents had the pork shoulder tacos. Everything was so tasty and helped make it a really memorable evening. 

What really made it, though, was how friendly and attentive the staff was. I was double impressed that Brian took the time to come over and talk with us. These are the little things that can make or break the dining experience.
