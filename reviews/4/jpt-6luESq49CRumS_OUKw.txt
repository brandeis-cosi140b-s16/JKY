Burrito Express...how do I describe you? You're like a dive bar...that only serves Mexican food and no alcohol. You're not in the greatest part of town. You're located in a less than reputable shopping center. Your parking lot is treacherous (only one way in and out with minimal parking). But I'm not here to review your atmosphere. I'm here to review your awesome burrito! 

I stopped in one afternoon to grab something quick. I didn't expect that when I ordered my food that it would be THAT quick, however. From the time I made my choice to the time I sat down, I don't think five minutes elapsed. When my Chicken, Potato & Cheese burrito came out, it was piping hot! 

My particular burrito was on the spicy side...which is how I like it. Now, I know that the menu had the little "hey, idiot...this is spicy" symbol next to this burrito. However, I was caught a little off guard at how spicy it actually was. To put it mildly, it's been quite some time since I ate something spicy enough to give me the sniffles.The burrito was quite sizable, too. For comparative purposes, I'd say it falls right between a Chipotle burrito and one from Q'Doba. It was definitely very filling. Couple the size of the burrito with the massive amounts of shredded chicken and potatoes inside, and I was full for quite some time afterwards.

Price wise, I think I ended up spending around $8.00 for the burrito and a "medium" drink that would make a camel think twice before drinking it. Couple that with the awesome red and green salsas they keep in the refrigerator, and you're set!

If you're looking for quick Mexican food for a decent price (and  you're not overly-concerned with ambiance or location), then stop by Burrito Express. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner (combination plates), so you can come any time of day. If you don't want to stop by, they deliver, too!
