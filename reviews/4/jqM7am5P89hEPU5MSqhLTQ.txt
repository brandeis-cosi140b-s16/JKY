First, I have to say this is my favorite place to eat. I usually bring girls here on my first date with them. I tend to make my reservations later in the evening.

Last night my dining experience was sub par. The server waited on the two tables next to us but we were there at least 15 minutes prior to those guests arriving. 

Before I go on to set the stage, I am a parent and understand the challenges when attempting to bring a baby to a place to dine. 

I usually get seated in the same table that I am always seated at, the tables are pretty close together so sometimes folks can bump your table spilling drinks. This happened twice last night. It happens, no big deal. The problem last night was that there was a family at the front of the place. This family had a infant that had a ear piercing scream and the child screamed a lot, so much so that everyone around was just staring at each other. Again, I understand the challenges of having a child but it is up to the staff at The Mission to make sure that the environment for the guests is enjoyable. Clearly this was not the case from 9:15 to 10:00 last night as many folks finished their meals as quick as possible to get out as did myself and my date. Maybe i am being a jerk but I think I would expect this from Chile's or Olive garden but not The Mission.
