I always go to this chain of restaurants to order my pupusas. They come in a range of flavors: shredded pork, with refried beans and cheese; cheese and beans; just cheese; just beans; or all shredded pork. Basically, you can get then in any combination possible with your pickled cabbage on the side, called "curtido." Topping it off with a home-made fruit drink, or horchata (various seeds that are roasted, sugar and milk). If you want something lighter, you have a selection of soups depending on your mood that day. Cheap food and tasty. Service could be better, but the food make it up. Very casual setting.
