Saw this place pop up while browsing Yelp one day for new eats and decided to swing on by. The joint offers five different premade taco options with fixings made to order: carnitas (pork), pollo (chicken), molida (ground beef), Americano, and vegan, along with a side of beans or nachos as additional paid extras for those wanting a little more to their taco fix. Tacos are $3 each and from what I remember of the sides, I think the beans were $2 and the nachos were $5.

I came and ordered four tacos, one carnitas, one pollo, one molida, and one Americano. Also got them with three corn shells and one flour shell. I will say that I definitely liked the corn shells better ... not as starchy as the flour shell and it has a bit more flavor to it. As for which taco was my favorite? Probably the pork one. The pulled pork in it was tender, juicy, and delicious. The slaw and farmer's cheese in it made each bite all the more tasty. I personally found the chicken to be a bit dry ... might do better for them not to overcook it. The beef one was alright ... it might have tasted better with a bit more cheese in it to offset the acidity that comes from the beef and its juices. Overall I found this place to be a great place to get Mexican tacos ... not sure I'd put them above Las Palmas, but definitely a decent option for those around in South Side!
