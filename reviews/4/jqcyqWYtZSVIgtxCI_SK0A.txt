We came in for the  $4. 29 breakfast special and 99 cent bloody marys or coffee. It is available everyday from 8 a.m. til noon the food was decent the portion was ok and the service was good too it is nice to sit on the outside bar and watch people walk through the mall you can see the fountain and everything that's going on I do believe we will be coming back.  Side note the wife loves a spicy Bloody Mary
