The food here is great!! I was quickly seated the server was friendly the chips were warm and the salsa was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable chimichanga that was amazing .. My favorite part after the meal is that you are brought a cinnamon chip with whip cream and strawberry sauce . This place is one of my new favorite places..
