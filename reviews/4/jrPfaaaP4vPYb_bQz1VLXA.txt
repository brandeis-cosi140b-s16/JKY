I was kidnapped and taken here by my boyfriend who thought I'd turn it down if he suggested it. I was skeptical walking in (not a lot in terms of atmosphere), but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was very helpful and brought over a bunch of samples for us to try. I ended up going with the plate with carnitas, and machaca in a burrito, jerk fried rice, and black beans. It was a lot of food and everything was packed with flavor. Definitely not a light, healthy meal, so I probably won't go often, but I'll be back.
