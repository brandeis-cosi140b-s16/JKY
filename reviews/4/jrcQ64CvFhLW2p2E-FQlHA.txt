The fish tacos aren't miss leading. Best Fish Tacos!!! I've ever had. These are not your run of the mill deep fried rubbery fish tacos. They use well seasoned fish fillet not fried and not little bits and pieces. Big and fresh. I highly recommend them and that's coming from picky of an eater. Another big plus it's right next to chase field parking is free if you dine in during events.
