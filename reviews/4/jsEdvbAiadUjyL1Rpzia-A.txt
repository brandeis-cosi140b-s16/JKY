This review is for the Salsitas at the corner of 16th and Roosevelt. For some reason I couldn't find it on Yelp. This place has serve yourself beans and is open 24 hrs. I've been to other Salsitas but this one seems better. 

I'm taking a star off for their late night service. I was there at 2am and the lady was very unfriendly. It could be that it was late and she was tired. 

However, if you're looking for a place to grub late night this is your spot.
