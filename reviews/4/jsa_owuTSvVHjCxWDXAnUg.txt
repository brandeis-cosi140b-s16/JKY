I came here with my parents and all three of us love Mexican.  I must admit at first I was leery since I've driven by so many times but never have stopped in to see it.  But once you enter it's quite an impressive restaurant and has a very polite and attentive wait staff.

The menu isn't something your ordinarily see in a Mexican restaurant and a bit pricier, however the caliber of the food and slight changes on traditional dishes made it worthwhile.  I really enjoyed the Boracho beans and Cilantro rice.  I had the traditional fajitas which were both flavorful and aplenty while my parents had the fish tacos.  I must say nobody left here hungry and we all were satisfied with vows to return. 

If you do visit and I recommend that you do, I suggest getting the Tres Leches for dessert.
