I always have a great time at Dos.  Friendly little outdoor/indoor dive with generous and tasty adult beverages, Fun staff and yummy Mexican menu. The decor is a work in progress - straddling the fine line between ghetto and some guy's tree house.   It's dog friendly on the patio which only adds to the "What is this place" atmosphere.  OK, it's a little quirky. But I like quirky.   But when I need a bit of South of the Border and can't afford the time nor the $$, a trip to Dos can be a great afternoon away. After a couple of shots, the eyes glaze over, the sun is warm, the music is good , the tacos are tasty and I'm happy.  They say it's a good place to day drink.  I say if you can't relax here, you'd best check with your physician.  What more do you want?
