Salsaritas, Qdoba, Chipotle, Moe's. They are the same and they're different. Of the big chain burrito places, it is not easy to choose a favorite. Moe's has a big plus in their column for the unlimited salsa bar, which is, in a word, awesome. I've been here and poured salsa over my nacho chips and just taken the burrito home to have for dinner. The salsas - yes, more than one - are excellent. Flavorful and tasty and yummy.

This is a nice little Moe's in Ayrsley. Expect the "Welcome to Moe's" and the magnificent salsa bar. The staff are super friendly and super fast! My Joey Junior burrito was assembled nearly instantly and was the right size to just barely wrap up without spilling contents.

Parking can be a bit of a challenge in the evening - the wings place across the way overflows parking into this lot.
