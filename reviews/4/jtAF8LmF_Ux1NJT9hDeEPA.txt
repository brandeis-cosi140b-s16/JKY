My dad was visiting from NY and we were looking for Mexican, so we tried this place. Overall, I like it. The chips were ok, I like thinner chips, the salsa was ok, again I've had better, but it was good. I had the fish tacos...they are made from grilled cod. I asked if I could get the cod deep fried, but that was not an option. The sauce was a tarter based sauce-which seemed very 'American' to me (disappointing), but I have to say, I liked the tacos. Decent flavor on the fish and I liked the rice and beans. (I am not a huge fan of rice and beans, but these were decent and unlike the rest of the table, my beans were not deep friend, but more like pork-n-beans. My son had a grilled cheese-which was good. My father had the pork carnitas, which he enjoyed. Dave had the carnita enchilada, which also looked picture perfect, but I didn't try. The only hiccup with the entire meal was the waiter brought a Chardonnay, instead of a Cabernet  Sauvignon ... and he didn't know the difference between white and red wines, and he should have really known, given they only have a handful of wines. Otherwise, good service. 

Overall, I enjoyed dinner and would get the tacos again, they were good and filling!
