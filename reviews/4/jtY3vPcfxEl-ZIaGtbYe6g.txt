So, here is what I propose you do. First, the breakfast burrito with ham, cheese and potato. Then Lunch - the giant burro with chicken, a fresh lemonade and tres leche cake. Go into a food coma for 3 days, repeat... No you will not live long, you will not be productive and eventually you will outgrow your pants, your bed, your house  but you will die happy and really that is what is all about...so, I repeat, the breakfast burrito...go for it!  

El Sol is found in some dumpy strip mall on Arizona Ave next to a trophy shop and a defunct piano tuner betw/Chandler Blvd and Ray. Parking is maybe the 3 spots in front. It is the perfect lunch spot when you want to take the afternoon off and sleep, the perfect breakfast when you want to eat and nap directly afterwards.  It is not heavy food, it is not greasy food, but whatever turkey dinner has in it, it has got it in spades! It is that full, I really should take some time to enjoy this meal type of feeling. Enjoy.
