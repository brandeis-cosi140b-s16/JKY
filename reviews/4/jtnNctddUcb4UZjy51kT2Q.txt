So, I was house sitting in the area and was looking for something different for lunch. Pizza was out of the question, and I wasn't in the mood for Chinese. When I found Asadero Toro on Yelp, I about freaked out! Since I wanted something out of the ordinary, this place offered up some awesome options. Aside from the quesadilla chica (which was pretty standard), I ordered two lengua tacos and two cabeza tacos. While I was waiting for my order, I filled up a dish with shredded cabbage, limes, cucumber and radishes as garnish for the tacos. After returning to the house and dogs I was watching, I dug in. Both meats were perfectly cooked and amazingly flavorful!

I'll definitely be back. But at just over $12, it did seem a bit expensive for lunch that wasn't downtown. And the cashier threw away my receipt without offering it to me, so kind of dick.
