I've eaten here a few times and have always enjoyed the food, which is a lot more authentic and flavorful than your typical Mexican restaurant. The burritos are great as well as other items on their menu. Their salsa bar is fresh and flavorful. I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order on the menu.  

The Original Burrito Company is in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you. The food is served in red plastic baskets and the cleanliness is about what you might expect, verifying its authenticity. Still, the price is very right for the meal. The employees are all really cool too. 

This is a local favorite for Ahwatukee. But if you are expecting a bombshell, you may be disappointed. The Original Burrito Company is good and reliable. You can't go wrong with it.
