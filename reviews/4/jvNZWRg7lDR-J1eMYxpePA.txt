Let me admit one thing....my review is purely based on the fish taco..and a couple other things!
My wife and I cant get enough of the fish tacos....2 of my favs: fried tilapia...ummmmmmm....smoked salmon...yummy.

I had their chkn quesadilla once and it was really good too.

Also I like their guacamole...it comes on a tostada when ordered as a side...which is awesome with the guac.
