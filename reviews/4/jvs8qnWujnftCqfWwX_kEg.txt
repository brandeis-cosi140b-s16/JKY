Just moved from San Diego, CA and trying to find a good Mexican food restaurant. Went here and was bummed that they didn't have Chile Colorado but they made up for it with how great their Garden Fresh Burrito was. It had tons of veggies grilled perfectly and it was more food than I could even think of eating. My husband had a shredded pork burrito and even though his was a bit small he said it was tasty. Definitely going to be visiting this place again.
