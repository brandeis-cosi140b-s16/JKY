This place gets 4 stars just for having the best tasting salsa I have had in Las Vegas to date.  Best part, you get a lot of choices.  Bean dip, chipotle flavored salsa (my fav), avocado salsa, regular salsa.  Very nice.  The chips were crunchy and salty.  

Went here after seeing how crowded Agave was on cinqo de mayo.  I had Lettuce Wrap Tacos knowing I was about to eat a pound of tortilla chips.  They were really good.  Came with red jalapenos, tomatoes, cheese, avocado and cilantro.  The chicken had a great flavor and nice char.  And I didn't have to feel guilty about all the tortilla chips I ate.  We also had some excellent margaritas for a great price.  Sure, we were hanging out with senior citizens, but I can hang with the nursing home crowd.
