My dad held his wedding reception here at one of their private rooms, and it was a great time. We had a three course meal (then cake later on) including appetizers of  lots and lots of awesome guacamole and veggie and meat quesadillas, followed by some salads, and then followed by the main course of steak and chicken fajitas mmmmm

Their drinks are good too, but a bit on the pricey side (around $7 for a small margarita!) I figured when you're in vegas, everything is expensive anyway. But our waitress was really cool and the catering manager, Kori, was tremendously helpful. They both came to our room often to make sure we were ok.

I definitely plan on coming back here with friends and trying that tequila tasting!
