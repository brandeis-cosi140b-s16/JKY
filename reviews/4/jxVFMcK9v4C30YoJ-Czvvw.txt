So I've decided that El Charro, Los Amigos and El Torero will be my hold-over until I can go back to Los Angeles/San Diego--land of taco trucks, places ending in -ertos, and un lugar donde puedo hablar en espanol, damnit--for Christmas.  

Amigos is pretty chill.  I had a delicious Torta Milanesa (Pollo), with just the right amount of cheese, avocado, and chicken.  The staff was quite friendly, and the while the service was slow, my torta DID come with a free Coke.  And my standards are occasionally low, so that garnered its fourth star.  I'll probably have to reassess after a second and third visit, but so far I haven't been let down.
