We have passed by this place over the last few weeks and have been wanting to try it. Jeannie and I pulled the trigger for a Friday happy hour and glad we did.  Great service and good food.  Sampled the carne asada nachos, chips and salsa, wings, and several margaritas!   The wings were super good! Enjoyed all our food and the house margaritas are served up perfectly.  

This will probably become our go to happy hour place in the area.  Prices are right  and the Renee has the staff really focused on customer satisfaction.  

Thinking this will be a good place to watch football or any sporting event.  The tvs are set up well enough for it and all day happy hour on Sunday.  

Get in here and see for yourself!
