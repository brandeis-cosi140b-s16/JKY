Went here for my first time with a coworker for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered off their value menu which ranged from $1 to just under $2. I got a salad, chicken leg, and a small taco for around $3 - not a bad price, especially if you're low on funds or just cheap.

The people were really friendly and had our orders out right away. I liked that they had a little salsa bar with lemons and peppers that you could take to go... not a bad option for a nice quick lunch!
