Margaritas can't be beat. They are truly delicious. Tacos are awesome. Chips and salsa (especially pico de gallo) are terrific. Prices, particularly for the margaritas, are very reasonable. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the service is consistently sketchy and sometimes you show up and it is a restaurant, other times it seems like it is supposed to be a club. As a restaurant, this place can't be beat. One of the best places to stop for a drink on Mill.
