The food is good cheap Mexican food. Dicey for sure. We love coming here! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I've been here multiple times were the cashier is using inappropriate language (not directed at me) while I'm standing there paying for my order. It's unprofessional and rude. 
We like to order the rolled tacos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, green chile burrito, carne Assad burrito, and bacon potato and egg breakfast burrito. 
Try the food if you're in the area! Just expect a long wait. Sometimes we just call ahead and then the wait time is super short.
