First, Maize is very good in the authentic Mexican taqueria tradition. They have a number of grilled or fried items from which to choose, as well as  a couple of good sides like guacamole. On each item, you can choose from the following meats: carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or pastor. My favorite is the flavorful pastor (marinated roast pork). Common co-toppings include a wonderful fresh, salty cheese, salsa fresca, sour cream, and cilantro. A variety of salsa comes with, and each bite of every item is delicious, with or without the salsa, which is very good. 

Tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, tlacoyos, challupas, quesadillas, gorditas, flautas, and huarches are all available. Honestly, they are variations on a theme, rather than distinctively different. Choose your texture. I'm an especially big fan of the tlacoyos (stuff served on top of a piece of grilled chewy flat bread -- you can get the bread fried, but grilled is better). Some of the items do offer interesting add-ons. For example, you can add pumpkin flowers or or mushrooms to the quesadillas.

Maize is located in a small converted space, with just a few seats around the main counter and a counter that runs immediately behind along the back wall. Seats are counter stools. At busy times, customers who are waiting for food get packed in too, or wait outside. The parking lot is equally small. We prefer to get our food to go, and it is always well worth the trip. Prices are inexpensive for the quality -- an excellent value.
