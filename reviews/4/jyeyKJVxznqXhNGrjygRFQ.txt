I call this place and ask if they have pupusas and the girl, gretchen was her name I believe If I heard correctly hangs up on me! I call back and she doesn't pick up! I call private and ask why she hung up on me and she hangs up on me again! Super rude place! I'll be contacting the manager in the morning about this!

After speaking to management and reading the business's response I can understand what happened.. Im still not the happiest camper about an employee hanging up on me instead of trying to clearly understand what I'm saying, but the situation is comical at the least... 

Poo Poo sauce.. Lol 

That's what I get for calling a Mexican restaurant looking for pupsas.. Haha
