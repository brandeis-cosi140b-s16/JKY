I LOVE this place!!! Fresh ingredients, paleo-diet options, free range chicken, grass fed beef - does it get any better? A "healthy" burrito??? It sounds like an oxymoron, but this place does it!!! I love that you can pick how much of everything you want, and can even have seconds of different salsas. If I am craving a burrito, there is where I go!!! YUMMM!!!!
