Don't freak out... You are not going to a strip club. It's just right next to it. 

Really great food and drinks!! I like the decor and the vibe. However they were super slow. A table of 6 took 2 hours to eat. Would be ok if drinks were flowing but those took forever too. But would go again for sure!
