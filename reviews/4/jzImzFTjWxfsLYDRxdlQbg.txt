this place is great for Breakfast and Lunch.  we stop by about once a month, usually for breakfast (the nana's breakfast w/green chili)  The inside is small, and not many seats inside, but we always make it work.  The area is very "questionable" though, and i think it's the reason it's not open after dark.  

major downside to this place is the parking.  the small lot is SMALL, tight spots, and anytime i pull out we almost get hit cause of the blind exit so be careful
