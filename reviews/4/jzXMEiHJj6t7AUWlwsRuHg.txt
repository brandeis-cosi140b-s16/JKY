Friends in town from Ohio! What better visitor friendly Mexican place could you POSSIBLY take visitors from the midwest? MI PATIO!!!!  Extensive menu, bursting with flavor, and chock-full-of-choices in the realm of Mexican comfort food. Reasonable prices, super friendly and quick service, and $1.75 MARGARITAS. ZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love the location, the vibe, and the classic Mexigrub restaraunt decor!!!
Finally the SALSA is killer!
