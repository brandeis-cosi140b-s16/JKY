My coworkers and I often order take out for lunch. Today was my turn to pick it up. To my surprise, besides great food, the restaurant was very clean, my order was ready at the scheduled time, and the customer service was good. My favorite is rebuelta pupusa (with everything) and a "salad" drink. I would have given 5 stars if they delivered.
