As usual I always get the same thing....NOT TODAY!

I ordered one of their salads instead of the (grilled) fish tacos, which I love.  I was not disappointed though.  Their salad was fresh, plentiful and a perfect blend of different greens, tomatoes, avocado and a nice skewer of chicken breast.

If I were to make a recommendation I would just tell them to not overcook the chicken.  It was borderline dry and crispy.  Dressing came on the side as I requested and it was delicious as well.

Great service and friendly staff.
Thanks Mucho Gusto!
