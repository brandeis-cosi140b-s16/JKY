Solid restaurant close(ish) to home.  No nonsense taqueria style food.  Definitely some of the best horchata in town.  Weekend specials are not to be missed.  Yesterday, opted for the carnitas.  How can you argue against unctuous braised pork?  Served with rice, beans, corn tortillas, and some cilantro, tomato, and onions it is the epitome of comfort food.  Always friendly waitstaff and the owners are typically on hand.  One of my go-to mexican places here in town.
