Very good greasy-spoon Mexican place.  My husband and I both had margaritas, and they were great- not too sweet, nice amount of salt.  Make sure you look at all of the options- we ordered "fresh" which uses fresh lime juice.  They have tons of tequila choices.  Nachos we shared were good, and the small order was more than enough for two of us.

My husband had the mixed fajitas, and enjoyed them.  Portion was huge, and we brought about half of it home. I had the pozole and Alex taco.  Both were flavorful.  Pozole had a nice amount of spice.  

We'll return.
