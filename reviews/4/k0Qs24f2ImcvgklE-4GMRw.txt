Pretty good food, Filiberto's style.  The breakfast menu is very good.  It's a shame they caused the closing of Zef's, a nearby competitor, the two contrasted each other nicely.  I've not been impressed with their chicken but the carne asada is very good.  Try the land and sea quesadilla, my favorite.

Would be nice if they'd spend $50 and develop a website with their menu etc on it.
