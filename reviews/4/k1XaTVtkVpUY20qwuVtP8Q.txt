I've never seen a place change its menu as much as they do. 
Generally great food.  The prices are ok. My partner just orders Shrimp tacos with nothing on them. Which they only seem to have a price for the gourmet Shrimp Tacos so that is irritating.
The chips the last couple of times have been a bit chewy and tasted like they were fried in old grease. Growing up in a restaurant i know old grease when I taste it.
Nonetheless, we like our Rubio's!
