This Filiberto's is one of the best ___berto's in town.  In particular, it blows away the nearby Eriberto's on 7th St & Bell.  

Phoenix n00bs will have to decide whether they like this style of taqueria at all. It's the real Mexican food, in my mind. And for the initiated, the byzantine collection of Filiberto's and *berto's look-a-likes makes for an interesting hobby of experimentation and evaluation.  Some people love to take up wine as their culinary passion. But I'm drawn to the in's and out's of the 24-hour Mexican taqueria world. I'll publish a magazine on the topic someday.
