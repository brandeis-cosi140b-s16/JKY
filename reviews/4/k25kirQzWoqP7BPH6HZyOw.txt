The Sandbar is always in our list of restaurants to visit when we are in Phoenix. The patio is great- the misters do the trick when the sun is hot. Prices are ok- not fantastic, but the thing that brings me back are the Baja Tacos. Awesome. We've gone as a couple and have also had family dinners there with the kids and have never been disappointed in the food. We're not partiers or dinkers, so that has never factored into the equation.
