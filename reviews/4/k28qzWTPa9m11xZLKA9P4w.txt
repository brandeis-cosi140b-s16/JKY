Most unlamorous location.
Open for breakfast catering to the Vegas lifestyle and sleep-eat cycles. 
Very friendly staff that actually listen to what you are saying you want and don't want on your bowl. 
The fajita veggies were tender and juicy. The barbacoa was full of flavor.
At first sight, not the best chipotle, but the quality and the service give it the well deserved 4 stars. Maybe if I came during lunch rush the service would be different but at 10:30am on a Saturday morning: RIGHT on the money!
