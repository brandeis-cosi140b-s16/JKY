Whenever we drive by here, the place is always packed.  Taking that to be a good sign, we decided to stop in for lunch.

Even though there were a number of people there, they took our order quickly and overall service was excellent.  The combo of the three mini tacos was delicious.  The refried beans were the best beans I've ever had, and everything was steaming hot and fresh.

Prices were very reasonable and atmosphere was good too.  Definitely going back again.
