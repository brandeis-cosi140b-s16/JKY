This is usually the Chipotle I go to when I'm on/near campus. It's convenient for students since it's right across the street, and while the place always seems to be busy, then again the lines move fairly quick. I've never had a problem with finding seating even when this location is busy. This is your standard Chipotle, and I've always have time to head here when I'm in a quick mood for lunch or get together with friends on campus.
