Awesome food & drinks. Packed Friday night, I can see potential as good place to chill and meet peeps. 

I ended up just ordering bunch of appt and drinks since it was biz dinner, turned out perfect with portion of the food. 

It's tad noisy for biz lunch / dinner, but service was excellent and will come back again.
