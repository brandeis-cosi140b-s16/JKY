I came here today to check out Bueno Burger and yes the mesquite smell is powerful near the kitchen.  I have to say that I did like the burger though.  I ordered just a Gringo which is a bacon cheeseburger and fries.  The meat was cooked well and very thin (I like it this way), it wasn't like "where's the beef" because we know where the beef is...just look around you see it on our legs, ass, and stomach.  So I enjoyed the meal and the service was good also, I came at about 11am so it wasn't busy and the lady at the register came out to me and told me what she liked, I like it when they do this.  They also have a computer where you enter your email or phone number and you get every 8th or 9th burger free which is great so I dont have to carry a stupid card around with me.  I will definitely come back for the Arizona and Bueno Burgers then maybe even a burrito at some point.
