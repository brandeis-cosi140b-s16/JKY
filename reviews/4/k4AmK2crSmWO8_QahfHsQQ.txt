Que Bueno!  We got the opportunity to enjoy El Encanto recently (for brunch) and we really did enjoy it!  We had different selections along with some traditional brunch selections/offerings.  The Chorizo and eggs was very tasty, the fresh fruit, the made to order omlettes all were very good.
We love the courtyard patio, such a nice touch and makes you feel like you are probably down in Mexico.
Can't wait to come back for lunch or dinner sometime soon!
