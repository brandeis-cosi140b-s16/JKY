Love love this place!  My husband and I go here on fairly regular basis when we have a hankering for Mexican food.  We take out of towners here when they are looking for an authentic Mexican food experience.

Food
The food is excellent, always served hot and very tasty. We love the Tacos Durados (fried tacos), the Beef Soup and the Shrimp, Chicken, Beef BBQ bowl served with fresh avocados and cactus. The margaritas are DEE-Li-Cious! 

Ambiance
If you go for an early dinner its usually never too full, the later in the evening the busier it gets.  Make no mistake this place gets LOUD - even when there aren't very many customers in the place, the music is loud - so don't go here if you want to have an intimate conversation with someone.

The staff are very friendly - helps if you know a little Spanish.
