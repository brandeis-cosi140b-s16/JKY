went here today with my son and his girlfriend, we had the buldogis fries and the buldogis and spicy pork cheesesteaks.  I thought they were absolutely yummy and my son loved the spicy pork.  It was sooooo much food we took half of it home.  They were very friendly and service was great.  We will def be back to try other menu items.
