I was here shopping in Scottsdale's Old Town just around lunch time. I got hungry so I checked the best place for lunch in the area on Yelp and found The Mission, was highly rated. It was across the street from where I was standing so we headed that way.

When we arrived we were able to get a table in the outside courtyard in the front of the restaurant. We informed the waiter we had very little time for lunch. The three of us ordered margaritas with salt at $8 each. They charged an extra $2 for one with Cointreu. We ordered two Almejas Al Vapor stews for $14 each and one shaved Kale salad for only $10. The shaved kale salad consisted of aji amarillo vinaigrette, baby heirlooms, blood orange, goat cheese & marcona almonds. My friend loves kale. The Almejas Al Vapor is a peruvian clam stew, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo & roasted corn. I especially enjoyed the unusual appearance and spice of the stew. See my pic. The stew made me want to go to Peru for some more. I have never been to Peru. 

The waiter was very expeditious in serving us.

My total bill for the three of us for lunch was a very reasonable $69 without gratuities and we were all happy with our meals, margaritas and service.
