My husband and I go here almost every date night. So... The service isn't exceptional and it's almost always busy but you can't beat the vibe. It's cozy and unique. The food is good. It's a matter of personal preference and we do love it, our friends love it (especially when we're down in the basement sitting by the fire enjoying a bottle of wine and socializing). The Rokerij and Richardsons (same owners, sit side by side) are worth visiting. Oh, and another unique spot that's owned by the same is Dick's Hideaway... My husband loves this place.
