You've probably seen this place a lot if you drive on Power Rd at all and always wondered if it was legit (given the sign streetside usually always says open).  I was one of those folks as well.

It's changed ownership a few times is what the local story has it, but the current owners are kind folks who are cranking out burritos, grande style.

I've been there a few times opting for the carne asada/potato, chorizo/egg/bean burrito options  Chorizo for me is a benchmark.  Burrito Shack didn't blow me away with the chorizo offering, it was good, but not great.  Return visits will have me sticking with a variation including carne asada.

The burritos are large...you can split one with someone if you want.  I'm not sure why restaurants feel the need to wrap everything in a 36-inch tortilla, but the Shack is no different.  Just prepare yourself.  Cut it in half to start to save the rest for later...unless you are muy hungry.

The name states the ambience.  It's a shack.  That covered stuff you see -- it's like the covered parking in a medical parking lot...not enclosed.  If it's cold outside, the Shack will be cold because, well, you're outside.  There is no 'inside' dining.  This is fine by me and I love the 'get your food and find a chair that isn't broken' type places.

So stop passing the sign by, pull in and grab some burrito.
