We tried Doce Taqueria this past weekend after hearing about it from a neighbor/friend on the Southside. We were very happy with our dinner and the price was great. Everything was very fresh and we both agreed that the pork tacos are the way to go (much more flavor than the chicken). You MUST try to the black beans! The restaurant is small, so consider ordering to-go if you have a group.

My only complaint is the lack of drink options. They only had a cooler stocked with bottled sodas and iced tea. I would have loved an ice-cold fountain drink to go with my tacos. We even considered going across the street to DQ to grap a diet coke. 

Overall, it's definitely something you should try. There's nothing better than fresh, flavorful Mexican food.
