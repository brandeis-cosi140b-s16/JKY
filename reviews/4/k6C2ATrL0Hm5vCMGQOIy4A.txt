I live in the area and have been here over a handful of times.  I agree that some of the entrees are slightly over priced, however, the food is quite delicious! The Macho Nachos are superb and can easily feed 3-4 people. Don't forget the chips and salsa...yum! The service has always been great. Very friendly, outgoing and really welcoming.
