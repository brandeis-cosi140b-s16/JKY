Came in a few weeks ago for breakfast. After having a time figuring out what they had on offer based on the picture-sign on the wall, a very pleasant woman asked us what we would like and I asked if they had a menu we could look at, She smiled and shook her head and said "we can make whatever you want, ham and eggs? On a tortilla? With beans sound good? OKAY :)" 
This interaction was charming. Not what I'm used to when I walk into a restaurant, but that's okay, it felt homey. We ordered a couple of pastries while we waited. When the food came out it was a generous portion, and eating eggs and ham and refried beans with feta cheese on hot corn tortillas was new to us, and we were pleasantry surprised at how much we enjoyed it. 

When we left the lady said "next time you can try the chorizo breakfast". Ok!

Each breakfast was around 7 dollars I think,  a fair price. Would have been nice to have the different breakfast options with prices displayed or printed somewhere. Also the water had a faint strawberry taste to it. Might have to order horchata next time!
