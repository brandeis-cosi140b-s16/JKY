Ninos is a great little spot in a very busy corner center. Due to limited seating it does get busy at prime times and parking can be a hassle but is worth the wait. Salsa is tasty and food always comes out HOT!! They heat their plates so it stays hot...I love their chile rellenos. Even my mom who hates mexican food will eat their tacos. Good food at a very fair price. Only drawback is the early close times....
