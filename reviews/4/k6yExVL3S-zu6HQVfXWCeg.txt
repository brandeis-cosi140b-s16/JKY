I was going to go to Wendy's based on these reviews,  but I decided to give it a go. I was happy I did. Is it airport food. ..of course!  Was it super fast. ...soooooo fast!  The salsa was great, and so was my chicken quesadilla...the very best part of my experience was hands down,  the service. The guy was out going and cheery to every guest in his presence. He was accommodating,  funny and FAST!  I was super happy that I decided against Wendy's.  Terminal 3 doesn't have a lot of options,  but this one was one that I wouldn't mind having again! They get the extra star just for this guy! Bruce, you're a ROCK STAR!
