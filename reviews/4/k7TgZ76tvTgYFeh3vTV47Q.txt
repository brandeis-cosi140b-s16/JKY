Pretty good food. Our server, nice young lady, was very helpful. Our January 10, 2015 dining experience was compromised, however, by a different young male server, believe his name was Josh, who couldn't get away from a table of HIS friends using junior high-level language/humor and talking excessively loud about pretty much nothing.
