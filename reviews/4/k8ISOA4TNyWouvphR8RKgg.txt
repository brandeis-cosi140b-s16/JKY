Los Favs is an amazing cheap Mexican place. I go there more than I should. The girls that work the register are all very kind and I have never once had an order that came out incorrectly. The carne asada burrito and carne nachos supreme are my favorites. Their breakfast burritos are the best I've had (I'm a ham fan) and their tacos are also delicious. A great place for anyone looking for inexpensive Mexican food that tastes authentic.
