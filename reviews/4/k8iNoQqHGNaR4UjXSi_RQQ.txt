Went back again for dinner on Saturday night during prime time. The place was packed and I thought we were going to be in for a huge wait, however, we were sat immediately and service was faster than expected for how busy the place was. Food was great, even better than the first time so we enjoyed it even more.

This is our new favorite Mexican food place.
