Truly one of the great collegiate spots for Mex-American cuisine! 

I love chipotle. I loved it more after watching their documentary on Netflix. If I ever forget to bring my lunch to school, I usually come here for their bowls with a tortilla on the side. For my bowls, I usually get chicken because it's the cheapest, but I've had the sofritas too, which are pretty tasty (and cheap!). Love that they have brown rice options too now. 

I think this is a great location because you can call ahead and pick up your order, if you're in a rush. It's true, this place usually gets high influx around normal eating times (12p, 5p) with all the array of interesting bodies Maryland Pkwy has to offer. One down side is that sometimes the staff are slow to clean up the tables, but it's a small issue for a reasonably priced, fresh, "fast food" go-to for college students like myself :-)
