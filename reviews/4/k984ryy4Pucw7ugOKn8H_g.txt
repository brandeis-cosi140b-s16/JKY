I've been eating here once a week for about two years- it's a lunchtime staple. It gets very busy at lunch, so I always call ahead. I live nearby so I can usually get away with calling, immediately leaving, and arriving at Rubio's just in time for my food to come out. 

I like the bowls the best, and I love the liberal amount of guacamole that comes in them! I also eat the salads, and if it's Tuesday, i'm eating fish tacos ($1.25). I'm not sure I'll ever get sick of the food here. I like their black beans, especially if I dip tortilla chips into them. I tried the gourmet tacos recently and they were tasty, but I crave my usual orders! 

The only problem I ever have is calling in my order sometimes. Once I was hung up on (although pretty sure it was accidental...CRASH...*click*...*ambient restaurant bustling noise*....*silence*). A few other times i've had to hold for enough time I felt like it would've been quicker to go over and stand in line. I assume they don't get enough regular phone-in orders to have anyone dedicated to it, and the guy at the cash register just can't constantly be on the phone and help customers in line. The prices have also gone up a little over the last couple of years, but the food quality has remained high so I won't argue. Look forward to eating there again next week!
