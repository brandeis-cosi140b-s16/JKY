I can't speak for the food, but I can say that the margaritas they have for Happy Hour are dang good!  They're only like $3 on happy hour which is basically a steal.  We were served complimentary chips and salsa even though we weren't ordering food which was really nice.  The bartender was very attentive and had a great repoir with all the patrons.
