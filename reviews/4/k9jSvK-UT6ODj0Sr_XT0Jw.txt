If Dagwood Bumstead was Mexican, the Torta Del Rey would be his sandwich of choice. It has ham, cheese, pork sirloin, milanesa, sausage, chorizo, eggs, avocado, jalapenos, onions and tomato (hold for me). Whew! All of that comes on a soft telera with a side of fries, plus chips and salsa for around $9. Sound like a deal? It gets better because it's enough for two meals. I ate the first half for lunch at the restaurant and the second half for dinner at my hotel in El Paso, some 430 miles later. The second time around was even better - the sandwich ingredients had all that time to intermingle, kind of like a day old burrito. Yum.

And be sure to get extra tomatillo salsa. It's the one that comes with the torta, not the salsa they serve with the chips. One taste and you'll want to drink the stuff straight from the bowl!
