Non-descript, little family-owned restaurant in a strip mall.  Very friendly, courteous, and efficient staff.  I ordered chorizo and two eggs accompanied with lime wedges and arepa.  Colombian food is less spicy than other south-of-the-border fare, so the lime added a unique twist to the chorizo.  I really liked it.

Several items on the menu intrigue me, so I'm saving them for a return visit.  That won't take too long!
