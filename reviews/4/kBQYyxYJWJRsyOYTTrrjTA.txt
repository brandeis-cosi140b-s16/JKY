This is a favorite for us.  The menu is varied so you are not limited to just tacos and burritos.  They offer 2 types of salsa.  Used to get pico automatically, but now we have to ask.  I don't care for the regular, but LOVE the pico. Miguel makes terrific guacamole and will adjust it to your taste by adding more or less veggies and spice.  Just tell him how you want it. If you want an quesadilla  that is really a meal, theirs- on the appetizer menu are fantastic. They will adjust any menu to your tastes.I can't eat green peppers and they will even substitute red if they have them that day.  Read where someone complained about the Deluxe taco salad,  Trust me, you  do not get a better one at taco bell.  These are so full of meat that I am actually not hungry an hour after eating like other salads and the shredded beef is fantastic..  I order chicken when I am trying to sort of behave and beef when I just don't give a rip. I add a few crumbled chips and pico from the table.  Perfect.  Prices are OK.  Don't expect the kinds of prices you get at the little dinky places, but you will get a true selection of foods and will be treated to a nice evening.  No rush.The staff is friendly.  They will offer the quick order if you know what you want, but if not, they will actually let you read the menu which is extensive.  The sangria is delicious.
We started going to Azteca on Woodlawn years ago at a coworker's recommendation and then earned the Steele Creek location was connected-partly the same owners and loved the convenience.
