I actually found this place via a search on Yelp. Located at Cimarron and Farm, it's much the same as any other taco shop. There is nothing fancy here. A few tables, a menu board and a self service fountain soda machine featuring Pepsi products. But do you come for the decor or good Mexican food? Having had my fair share of Mexican over the years, I can honestly say you won't be disappointed. I have been a few times now and it has always been bueno. My most recent visit was my first experience with their carne asada burrito. I must say it was better than the last CAB I had at Roberto's. My daughter echoed those same thoughts about the bean and cheese burrito. I will definitely be frequenting when the craving for Mexican hits.
