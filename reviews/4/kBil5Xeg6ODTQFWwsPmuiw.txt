I like the place so far, the breakfast burritos are awesome.  I had also ordered the pollo fundido but that is just okay.  The chips and salsa are fantastic and the service is always good.  I like the casual atmosphere, you can tell it was a fast food place because they have a drive thru but I think that is only for pick up now.  I would have to say it is the nicest casual Mexican place I have been too.
