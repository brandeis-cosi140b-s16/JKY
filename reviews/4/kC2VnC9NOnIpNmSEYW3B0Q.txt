I have stopped at this Taco Bell location 3 times this week and each of those times I was satisfied! I love the new $1 cravings menu. I always order the spicy potato soft taco! It's a soft shell with crispy potatoes, lettuce, shredded cheese, and a creamy chipotle sauce. The original potato soft taco was good but I love spicy foods so the creamy chipotle sauce really makes it. The spicy tostada is also good! I tried the new cheesy bean and rice burrito the other day. It's a new $1 item too. If you like refried beans, rice, nacho cheese, and a creamy jalape√±o sauce then this burrito is for you. It is definitely worth a dollar, it's pretty big. I will be back because this location is great. All of the staff I have encountered have been nice and my order was right every time. The food is also yummy for fast food! It's also open until 2-3am which is convenient.
