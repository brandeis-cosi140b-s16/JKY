Let me start by saying service here was pretty impeccable. Not MIA and not over-bearing, a good mix. Refills on the waters/ soft-drinks and, my favorite, the salsa. Very friendly servers. 

The food is pretty decent (from what I can tell). You won't be disappointed with the Fajitas or a Taco Salad. However, think twice about the Quesadillas. Unless your into a Quesadilla SOUP you may not be thrilled with this dish. The runny, "cheese dip" cheese is like a pure swimming pool on your plate. I had to eat the entire Quesadilla with a fork and knife. 

But yeah, other dishes look good. I'd be back.
