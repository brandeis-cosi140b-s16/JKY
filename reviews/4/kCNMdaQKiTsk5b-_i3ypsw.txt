When in Maricopa and you get that hankerin' for some Mexican food done right you steer into Penascos. 

I was able to visit this little gem with Canadian celebrity chef Jonathan Collins (his second visit) and what can I say...? We were pleased.

I had grilled fish tacos and a Tecate brewed in Monty., MX. 

It was well executed and the service was on time and friendly. 

Nothing out of the ordinary here, just good mexican cuisine done right.
