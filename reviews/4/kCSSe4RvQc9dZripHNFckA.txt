Stopped by here for a quick snack.  I have had the Carnitas and Chicken before and I liked them.  This time I went for the Barbacoa soft Taco.  I would probably recommend having this in either a Burrito or crunchy Taco due to the moisture factor of some of the ingredients.  It was a messy eat.  Other than the assembly issues the flavor was good.  The Guac has a good amount of citrus in it, just the way I like it, so I didn't mind the extra topping fee.  Sustainable and organic ingredients make me feel a little better about the six tacos I'm eating.
