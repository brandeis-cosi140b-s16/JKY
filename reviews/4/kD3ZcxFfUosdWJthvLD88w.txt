Is it the best Mexican food in the world?  No, it's not.  But it's good tasting, you get plenty for your money, and the price is right.  Their bowls of menudo are huge, their breakfast burritos are really excellent, and their entrees give plenty.

Full salsa bar that's always clean, serves alcohol, has Jarritos and Mexican Coke?  Probably the best Mexican in town at this point.
