Let's be clear, the "torta ahogada" is a typical dish that is not suited for everybody.

It's a pretty hard roll filled with pork meat and soaked in tomato base salsa and then ultra super mega spicy sauce (like 3 days of stomach ache spicy if you're not used to it).

So what people need to do is first think if that's a dish they want to try and second make sure you order your torta ahogada not spicy at all and order the hot salsa on the side.

Squish some limes on top and put red onion to have the real mexican experience. 

Pretty good flavor, serving and price.

All in all, it's almost as good as in Mexico.
