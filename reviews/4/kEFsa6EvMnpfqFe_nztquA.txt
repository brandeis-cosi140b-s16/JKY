This place, I gotta say, is quite the hidden gem. The food, I think, is excellent. I got myself a Carne Asada burrito and it was very flavorful (although I will say the pico de gallo needed a little more kick, but the excellent guacamole made up for that).

The only thing I can see wrong with it, really, is the fact that it IS hidden. It is located behind Discount Tire and is easily overlooked (it's the last business on the left in the plaza). I believe they have other locations around, but this one is right around the block from me. No one really goes there, though, and is usually empty unfortunately. If it was in a better location, it would probably pick up a customer base.

With that said, I only tried this place because a few months ago, I was getting my new rear tires mounted and balanced at Discount, and one of their workers stopped by Los Favoritos and picked up some lunch. As he walked by, the aroma hit me. It smelled awesome and I wanted to try it.

Since my brother's tire went flat yesterday, we went to get him a new one, and while waiting, I suggested we stop by for lunch. It's not the best looking restaurant by any means, but I don't go to those for appearance (Mickey's Hot Dogs by downtown Mesa is another prime example of good food, bad location, and underwhelming aesthetics). It's all about the quality of food, and this place is excellent as far as that goes. I'd like to go there again and try something else!

Also, there are other restaurants called Los Favoritos Taco Shop. Are those part of the same chain or something, or completely independent? Having never been to one other than today, I can't say for sure. Since every location for every business runs completely different than the, next, though, just refer to this review for this particular location, since I can't speak for any other potential ones.
