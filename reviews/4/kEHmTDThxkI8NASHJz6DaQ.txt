Service was fast and friendly on a Sunday lunch. Chips and salsa were good. Homemade salsa had a nice kick.  Had the combo enchilada suizas. Came out fast and hot. All good. Waitress checked back often to see if I was happy. 

All a great deal for a $13 lunch with beer and tax!  

Would love to see the bar going. Looks like a hopping place for later.
