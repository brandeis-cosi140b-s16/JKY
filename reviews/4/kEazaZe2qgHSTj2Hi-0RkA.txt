From the airport my family picked me up and we went directly to this great Mexican restaurant. This was a good break from all the TexMex I've been enjoying in Htown. The view was great, the dining room buzzing and the wandering mariachis come over to sing you a 'Happy Birthday!' plus a shot or two of tequila. My Carnitas plate was just right but what got me going were the chips and their flavorful, hot salsa! The 'made-to-order-at-your-table' guacamole was a sight to see and taste. GO ALREADY!
