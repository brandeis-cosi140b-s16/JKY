Tried this place soon after it opened. Was seated very quick when we arrived but it was not packed that night. Staff was all very nice and seemed to know the menu well. It is pricey but you should know that eating on the strip. Split the meat dish @ $50 (forgot the name) but it was excellent. Pork, steak and chorizo with vegetables and sides. Chips, salsa and Guac was all above average as was my drink. Sugar cube with orange bitters and tequila, small drink but tasty. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars at this point was the fact that we had servers bring us the wrong thing on 4 or 5 occasions. I believe they still had yet to learn the tables and as the place just opened I wasnt that bothered by it. If they have that little problem fixed the next time I am in (which I will be) Im expecting a 5 star experience.
