I am a fan.

Aside from the tacky decor.

Me and my mom can come here for a casual lunch.  Spend $6.99 for an order of mini chimichangas, split it!, and then leave full.
(Always get a side of the delicious Baja sauce... mmm.... clogged arteries....)

Their portions are GIGANTIC, but it seems like they're working on that and may have improved.

I do love you Macayos.  You're easy, consistent, cheap, and tasty.
