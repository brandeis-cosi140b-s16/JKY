Viva Zap is the type of restaurant I love to frequent.  It's not part of a chain, most likely a mom and pop (and grandma and grandpa) establishment that doesn't serve fast food, but good food fast.

Growing up, I didn't have the maturity to eat other cuisines. Having lived near the Mexican border years back, I had access to this incredible food made by people who took humble ingredients and made them taste great. Mexican isn't one of my favorite cuisines, but I appreciate it being available when I have that urge.

I originally wanted to get menudo, but it's only available on the weekends. Instead, I picked what I remember from the menu as "goat soup" or something. Braised goat meat in I believe is a tomato-based liquid.  Was a tasty meal, but I left looking like a crime scene happened on my clothing. Good thing I tend to wear darker hued clothes. Was going to order the quacamole, but thought against it, too much food for me to eat.

Will go again.
