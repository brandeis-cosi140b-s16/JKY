Food: I have been eating here since the 8th grade. This place is definitely a guilty pleasure. I generally get the carne asada burrito or the California burrito, both are great. Furthermore, these burritos are about 5 dollars and are HUGE; you will always get your moneys worth here! Since I have started eating here the quality, food, and service have stayed the same. I actually am Hispanic and I personally find their tortillas to be amazing. If you're looking for gourmet Mexican this is not for you! However, if you're looking for better quality fast food Mexican this is awesome. It is about the same price as Filibertos but WORLDS BETTER! (Quality from location to location is always great)

Service: It is primarily Hispanics working here and for someone who is not Hispanic it can be difficult to understand them from time to time, but they are always friendly. This being said the food is authentic and I Have yet to have an incorrect order in 8 years.

Location: Its the strangest thing I have began to notice that the majority of Los Favoritos are located in Bashas plazas. The location is nothing fancy its just a hole in the wall, but worth going to. There is not much seating, but take out is always an option.
