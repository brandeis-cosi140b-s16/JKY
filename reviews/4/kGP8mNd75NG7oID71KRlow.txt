Richard is the only reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of one. Actually, he's the only reason I'm even reviewing this place. It's extremely rare to have someone talking through the drive through speaker put you in a good mood. In fact, it's probably usually the opposite. There were 4 cars ahead of me waiting at the window. They were all gone in about a minute. Richard was at the window and was very cheerful and smiling, while getting the job done quickly. I assume this guy is the Manager by the looks of his shirt. (And to be honest, I hope he is the manager, otherwise, complete waste of talent). My food wasn't missing anything, all portions were perfect.

  Unfortunately I can't say the same for the other visits I've had here. Usually I end up waiting FOREVER in the drive through. I would absolutely never take the chance of the drive through even if i had an extra 30 minutes to grab lunch. It makes you wonder what they could possibly be doing in there. Occasionally things are missing, and the drive through people are always such a bummer.
