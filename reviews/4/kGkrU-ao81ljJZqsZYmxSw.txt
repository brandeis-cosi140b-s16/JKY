I remember there was a Tijuana Flats up in the university a few years back, don't know if it is related, but I did miss them during lunch times at the office.  East Blvd is a good new home for this tex mex restaurant.  They do things a bit differently where you order at the counter and they bring it out to you once the food is ready.

The atmosphere inside has tons of stuff to look at, especially the crazy celebrity photos on the wall near the register line.

Definitely should try their hot sauce bar with stuff ranging from okay to "death".... I just like looked at their hotness markings cause the death icon is a black smiley face with two x's across the face's eyes.

I had the "no"rrito chicken bowl with everything on it.  Pretty darn good and decent kick - I could have added more heat, but decided to play it safe that evening.  Also had Tripple C Brewing's Baby Maker on tap so I was a pretty happy camper after dinner.

Servers and cashiers are super nice and really check on you if you need any refills or plates cleared.  Definitely will be back!
