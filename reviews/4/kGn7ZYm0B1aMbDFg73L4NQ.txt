I would give 5 stars based on food only, but I am also rating decor.
A very friendly family owned and operated place.
Tables & Chairs are a bit old, but everything is very clean.
The Mother, Father or Adult Children are the people serving and preparing your food. It is truly from their family to you and your's.
Shrimp cocktail (de cameron) is great! The shrimp octopus cocktail is even better. Taco de Carne Asada ( Steak) or Taco de Lungua with pico de gallo are superb. Caldo de Res ( Beef SOUP) is too die 4. Everything is made to order. If you like heat try the Camarones a La Diabla (Deviled Shrimp). They Serve Beer & Hard Liquor. I have been going to Asi Es My Tierra for many years now, and have never walked out unhappy with my food or service. R. Read
