This place needs a warning label. The flight means your stomach is going to be screaming for a break. That is a lot of food! The flight includes a drink, chips and salsa, an entree and a side tapas. It might be because I ordered the bowl. I'm not sure how large the burritos or tacos are.  I don't know if I ate the food in the wrong order, or if I just shouldn't of eaten all of it. Make sure you ask all of what is in the bowl. The menu board is not clear and you'll be wondering what's on top. The bowl container is a lot deeper than you think it is and which makes this a heavy "salad".  I enjoyed it, but next time I'll just order the bowl and the papas fritas or the bowl with the chips and salsa. Oh yeah, the Papas fritas are great so you might want to save those for last or you might want to not want to eat the rest of your meal because you'll be thinking about eating more of those.
