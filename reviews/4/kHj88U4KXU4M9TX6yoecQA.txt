I will start with saying no matter what happens at Three Amigos I will always love Three Amigos. I always order enchiladas (mixtas) so I really can't vouch for many other items but they are so good I feel no need to try anything else. I do not do this at any other restaurant and do admit it is lame.  It is 4 enchiladas with four different sauces and I always finish with the mole (it's my dessert). I also always order them with steak because I love the seasoning and it always comes with a little piece of bonus steak on the plate. The chips seem like the fryer may need to be turned up because they always have a little residual greasiness to them. The Mexican Coke and  Victoria beer are always cold and delicious. The service is always pleasant and entertaining. The music can be very inappropriate (Lil Jon Shots- YouTube it) but I find it HILARIOUS!! The Moby look-a-like across from me did not and insisted on his food to go. He looked like a hipster but was apparently wound a little tighter than his horn rims, Apple, tattoos, and  Indy Rock shirt conveyed. Without a doubt I will be back for my dose of rap and enchiladas.
