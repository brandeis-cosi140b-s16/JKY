Ill say its Delicious. Ordered a Carne Asada Burrito. Its a little pricier than other locations. It came out fast and fresh. The Carne Asada was fresh and moist. I got it loaded with Guac and Pico De Gallo. The Staff was friendly and speak good english so no worries with a language barrier. The Menu is expansive with Breakfast,And Lunch/Dinner items. Nice Seating area. And The restuarant is spotless which is always a good indication of how the food will taste.
