I read the reviews (focusing on the ones with okay or bad experiences) and wasn't excited to try this place. I had a negative opinion going in. I was WRONG again. This place was really good. Better than my top Cuban place in Las Vegas. I will be back for sure. The inside is nice and large and spacious. The service was good and on time and the food was even better. Authentic Cuban.

PROS:  
*Yuca con Mojo y Chicharrones - Sauteed tender yuca smothered in onions and garlic sauce with fried pork skins on the side. Eat them together and it's a party in your mouth. 

*Lechon Asado Al Despelote - slowly roasted leg of pork marinated in a mojo of limon, garlic, lime, orange juice and spices, served over fried smashed yuca. The fried smashed yuca is a meal in itself. Wonderful when eaten together. LARGE portion. 

*Fricase de Pollo Con Papas a la Havanera - Chicken simmered with tomatoes, potatoes, red wine, olives and spices. 

*They were on Groupon. 

CONS:
*Far from my home distance wise.

*Food arrived almost all at once (appetizers and dinner). Didn't matter that much though.
