I went into Moe's today and didn't get the usual "WELCOME TO MOE'S!!!" and you know what? That made me sad. Have they stopped doing this? I've always enjoyed being yelled at when I walk into an establishment but I guess others don't.

 Anywho, this is a pretty standard Moe's but it's baller status in my book because they have an outdoor patio on the side. Plus they give you free chips and have a variety of salsa to try. They even have one named the El Guapo and any salsa named after a character in Three Amigos rocks my world. Definitely stop in for Moe Monday--burrito, chips and a drink for $5--nothing wrong with that!
