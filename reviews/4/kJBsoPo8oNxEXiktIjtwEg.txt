This place is new, but wonderful...

The location has changed hands several times over the years. I think this will stick -- the food is prefect and reasonably priced (amazing tacos and enchiladas). Great specials on beer and tequila. Plus, the upstairs bar area is really neat (on weekends). This is a huge step up from Dos Gringos! Not a real busy place, but a classy joint for tacos, beer and tequila. I eat here at least once a week -- it is also close to a 1/2 dozen of Scottsdale's best bars.
