Did the takee outee routine with the cheese enchilada and  bowl of brown rice, black beans, and grilled chicken and an appetizer size of chicken quesidellia.  Was just the right amount for 2 of us.  Worried that the grilled chicken on the bowl would dry out on the 15 minute trip home, but not the case.  Yummy for sure!  Had the fish bowl on another trip and it was a little dry, but as someone else said-the black beans were terrific.  Definitely will return.
