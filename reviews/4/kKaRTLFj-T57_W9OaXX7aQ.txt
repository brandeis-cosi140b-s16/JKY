my new favorite drunchies place when I'm in vegas! as a first timer, it can definitely be overwhelming with the large swarms of hungry/drunk people and the confusing line situation (theres different lines for what type of meat or food you want). although the wait was kinda long, it was entertaining to watch the cooks make the tacos. the legit taco chief was seriously throwing guac/sauce in the air and it always landed in the tacos PERFECTLY. i was in awe! the tacos are decently priced and are bursting in flavor. my only regret was not ordering 10 more tacos
