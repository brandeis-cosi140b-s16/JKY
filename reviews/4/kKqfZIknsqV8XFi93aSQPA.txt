I would say 3.5 stars out of 5- Food was not too bad, not too bad at all. 
My server? I remember was not too good, not too good at all. She was around my age so she was treating me sorta idk, "weird" --  I ordered some kind of sampler plate, meh - mediocre. The Pico was yum yum.Not in a rush to "run back" to this place. Service needs improvement...
