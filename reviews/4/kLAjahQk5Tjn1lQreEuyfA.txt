Don't be fooled by the "grill" at the end of their name; Fausto's offers authentic mexican food much like you could find in your mama's kitchen (well, not my mama's, but someone's...) It's simple and tasty here. Good, cheap mexican food: My favorite! It doesn't try to be fancy, nor is it fresh-mex like Chipotle or Baja Fresh. This restaurant is extremely similar to Roberto's (right down to the salsa bar with fresh veggies), yet I think their flavor is just a tad better! If you're in the mood for homemade Mexican food, this is the closest you'll come (unless your mama cooks tamales better than mine...)
