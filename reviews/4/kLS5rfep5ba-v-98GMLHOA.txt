Had dinner a few nights ago for the first time at Lindo Michocoan. I love the view (I went during the day so I'm sure at night the strip looks beautiful).

I ordered the tacos al pastor. They were delicious. My only complaint would be that they use corn tortillas to make it more authentic. I hate ordering tacos and getting them in flour tortilla. 

I also ordered a margarita on the rocks and it was delicious. Nothing special that "wow" me but I enjoyed it. The alcohol didn't overpower it. So if you like strong drinks then you probably wouldn't enjoy it because you hardly taste the alcohol. 

My husband ordered goat meat and I tasted his food and I must say I didn't really enjoy it at all. The texture was very chewy and lack seasoning. 

Overall our Experience was pleasant and will be going back to try a few more things off the menu. 

The fidello soup was helpful to keep my toddler entertained while we ate. He seemed to like it but he likes pretty much everything. I'm not a fan of fidello soup... Don't like it's flavor.
