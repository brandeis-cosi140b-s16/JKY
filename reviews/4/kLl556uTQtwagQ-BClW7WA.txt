The tortas are bomb. Tiny hole in the wall place in a somewhat suspect part of town. The employees don't speak English, but it really doesn't matter. The food is delicious and they make it super quick. The tortas have heaps of fresh avocado (more than more places would ever put on a single torta). You can get gut busting full for about 5 bucks.
