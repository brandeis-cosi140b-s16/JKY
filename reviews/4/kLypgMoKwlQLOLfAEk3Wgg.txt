While I wouldn't recommend every pretentious hipster foodie come running to Phoenix (not that I would wish that horror on the lovely city of Phoenix- maybe a plague of locusts would be easier to deal with)- there are some great places to eat there. I say "there" because I am from NY and I am here now so there is there. Anyway- I loved it here (there) and went twice in my 6 days in Phoenix. Fantastic tacos- shark, smoked marlin, steak, slow-cooked pork, chicken with mole- most at $3.99 some near $5 but all nicely sized and overflowing with ingredients and deliciousness. The horchata was damned fine also. Love the d√©cor, reminds me of Baby Bo's Cantina in NYC except obviously the food at La Santisima is much better.
