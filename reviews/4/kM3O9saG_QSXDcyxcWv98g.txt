My children and I have been going here for about 12 years, since before my two youngest were born...so obviously we love it. So many things in life have changed and yet our favorite places remain. When I was pregnant with my, now, eleven year old son I craved El Burrito constantly, especially the meatball soup. This same child now loves this soup and craves it as well and has ever since he started eating real food. :)
The food here is traditional "Amurrican" Mexican fare, maybe not authentic but comforting. One thing worth mentioning is that the shredded beef filling for burritos, etc is almost all yummy juicy meat and not dry or full of fillers/onions and peppers or rice and beans. 
We always get the same few things and find the food quality to be very consistent. Service is spotty but friendly. I wish they gave some indication that recognize us when we go there since we always recognize them...and I tip 20%....for 12+ years.
Decor is aging but for some reason I don't care. Lol. It's just that kind of place.
Parking is easy for dinner since they are in a strip mall with businesses that are closed in the evening.

Like: 
*Cheese Nachos + jalapeno's. Sauces on the side.
*Mexican Pizza
*cheese enchilada
*Fajita's (nice and smokey coming to the table)
*Kids Meals

Best:
None of the savory sauces are sweet!
*Shredded Beef Burrito Green Chili style 
*Frozen Margarita...my Favorite in town...strong enough and not too acidic
*Mexican Meatball soup...only made on Fridays

Worst:
Sometimes the cheese on the Nachos is not melted all the way. I hate that!
The "mild" of the house salsa's is too watery and varies in heat level and cilantro flavor.
I wish the chips were warm and salted.
The awful, rubber place mats are often wet! Yuck! 
Eating with kids, I am partial to cloth napkins that are somewhat absorbent...theirs are not.

In all we really like it here and will continue to dine here every few months, probably forever.
