I came across this place the other day while shopping in the plaza nearby and we decided to head here for dinner. I was surprised by the fact that it wasn't that busy inside given that it was a Saturday night but I actually enjoyed it that way. The restaurant was very clean which was also nice. This was just the kind of mexican food we were looking for, nothing fancy about it just your basic kind that you would expect to find at a place like this. Their salsa was good, not too chunky and their cheese sauce was also delicious. My husband and I both ordered two bean burritos with cheese sauce and a side of rice and we were both pleased. The bean burritos are a good size too so one might be enough for most people, we were really hungry! 
We will def. be going back here when we get cravings!
