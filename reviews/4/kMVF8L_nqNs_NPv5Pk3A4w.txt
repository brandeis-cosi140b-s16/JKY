Always loved Baja Fresh.  I do feel like it's a bit expensive compared to some other similar places, but I love the food here better.  I ordered the Nacho burrito enchilada style.  I always get enchilada style, it adds so much yummy flavor, and I especially like the chips covered in sauce and cheese on the side.  My burrito was huge and yummy!!  We were politely asked if we wanted some free chips while we waited for our orders.  Chips and salsa are great while you wait.
