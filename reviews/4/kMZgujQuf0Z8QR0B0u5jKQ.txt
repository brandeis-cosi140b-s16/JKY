Went back to Loco Patron last night.  My husband had to have the Salt and Pepper Wings!  Even though it is a 42 mile one way trip to the place.  For a Wednesday night, they had a lot of things going.  The hockey and basketball games were on TV and Wednesday nights is their poker tournament events.  There was a steady flow of people for the time we were there.  Even with all the activities our service was still GREAT!  Seth ROCKS!

Ok down to the good stuff - FOOD review:

Salt and Pepper Wings served with carrots, celery and chipotle ranch dressing
- The wings were fried to a golden perfection.  The wings were cooked through & through but still juicy and full of the simple balance of salt and pepper.

Baked Mac & Cheese with grilled chicken breast
- Spiral macaroni cheesed out with a creamy comb of smoked provolone and cheddar jack.  It is topped with toasted bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The grilled chicken was still juicy not dry.  The combination of the cheese and the toasted bread crumbs was so cheesy and GOOD.

Hubby had the loco soft tacos with the shredded pork and told me that they tacos were just RE-DONK-U-LIOUS.  I am not sure if that is a word but OK we will go with that.

Next time I need to save room for dessert.  The Sopapilla and ice cream has been calling my name.
