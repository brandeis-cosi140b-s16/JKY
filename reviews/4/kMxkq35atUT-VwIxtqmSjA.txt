I genuinely love coming here every time I can make it to Charlotte.

The restaurant is nestled squarely in an eclectic and laid-back arts district on the outskirts of Charlotte proper.

Their beer selection is always one of the best in the area and they always feature local and NC breweries. No-Da and Birdsong brewing are just a few blocks away from Cabo. 

Their menu selections area always packed with a wide variety of fish tacos, burritos and their new tortilla cornucopia bowl. Some excellent flavor combinations that will appease your fish taco cravings. The staff is always pleasant to talk with and the bartenders very knowledgeable about the beer selections on tap. Don't skip this place if you're on the East side of Charlotte.
