My wife and I stopped by to grab a bite to eat, with so many places we were worried about picking a good one. We are glad we picked this place. We showed up a little before the dinner rush, so we were seated quickly. The waiter suggested we try a couple of the apps to share. We tried the chicken street taco(so good), empanadas(the wife loved these), and the pork sopes(we both liked these). I tried the Buenos Dias drink, good drink to start the night off with.   
I am not sure why all the negative reviews, it looks like they are from about a month ago, so maybe they had a staff change and are back running better. We had a  great time and would go back again. The prices are a little high but it's vegas, eat drink and be happy!
