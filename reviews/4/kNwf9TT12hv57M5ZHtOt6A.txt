My girlfriend saw Barrio Cafe on "Diners, drive-ins and dives" and wanted to go while visiting Phoenix.  Not your typical Mexican fare. The bread and salsa an unusual twist but very good. The table side guacamole was amazing!! We ordered the enchiladas suiza and a pork dish. Both dishes incredibly flavorful. Portions are large-you can definitely share.  I had their signature margarita which was more sour than most.....but great.  Not an inexpensive dinner out, but a must try!
