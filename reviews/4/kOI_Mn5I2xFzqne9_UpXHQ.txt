If you want spicy salsa, try Los Dos Molinos. It was tasty and the chips were good. The food was pretty good and I would definitely go back.  My friend and I are both from NM and we were happily surprised. It is the closest to NM food so far that I have found here in AZ. If they had ground beef as the norm for the tacos, enchiladas and burritos it would be right there. I liked it and so did my friend. I will take my girlfriend there and we will probably make it a regular place to eat for our NM food craving.
