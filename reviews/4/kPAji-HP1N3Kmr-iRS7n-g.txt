This place so far has not been a disappointment. This is my second time coming for breakfast. This time got a steal burrito and it's bombbb! The price is fair seeing that the size is massive! Thy have a small salsa bar and the red is on point. I recommend you try this joint out if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican food!
