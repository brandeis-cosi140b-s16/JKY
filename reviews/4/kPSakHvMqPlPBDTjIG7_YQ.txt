We went with friends for restaurant week. It was a later reservation then we would normally make, but the place was full. The service was good. The food was good. A special request due to allergies was the one downfall. It didn't occur and one member of our party unfortunately had to leave early with benadryl in tow. Except for that it was a very good meal and we'd likely give it another try. The 4 star rating is mostly in regards to their inability to manage a simple one ingredient food allergy.
