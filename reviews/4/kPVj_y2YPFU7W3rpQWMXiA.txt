Good, but not amazing, "traditional arizona " mexican food.

for some reason, i've had about five friends who have worked here as servers, and they all stuck around for at least a year, so i imagine the owners/managers are pretty cool.

on sundays they have discounts on pitchers of beer and margaritas all day. the food is good and relatively inexpensive, and the select apps are half off during normal HH times. 

located right on hardy and university (wedged between Cornish Pasty and Cheba Hut) it's convenient and has good service.
