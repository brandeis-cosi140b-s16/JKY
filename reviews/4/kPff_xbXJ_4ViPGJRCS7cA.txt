Mostly icream and other sweets but they have some dinner plates and specialty hotdogs! 

Tonight I got two scoops of ice cream, Rose petal and eggnog! The rose petal smelled like roses, was pink and had small bits of rose petals! Small bites was really good but big bites, was slightly soapy tasting. 

The egg nog was very good! Small raisins and had a rich creamy taste, would get this one again. 

Very easy menu order by site or if you read spanish, but if not staff very good at helping you understand whats what!
