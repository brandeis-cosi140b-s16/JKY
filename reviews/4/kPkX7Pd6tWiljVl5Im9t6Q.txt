This place is pretty bangin' - decent prices, good food, and most importantly great drinks. Four of us went here for dinner and waited about 20 mins on a Saturday night around 8 PM ... while we waited we got some of their totally fantastic margaritas out front - they come in a giant Diablo's margarita glass and the price really wasn't too bad. 

Once seated our waitress was on the ball the whole time - she was quick, our orders were right, and she was pleasant. The food was pretty good too - we got the bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada taco plate.  Overall I would definetly recommend Diablo's!
