To steal a phrase from another reviewer, definitely a solid experience. We rarely go to any sort of chain restaurant for a nice dinner and were pleasantly surprised by Z'Tejas. This one is located in Fashion Square, a beautiful and very busy part of Scottsdale. 

We had a couple frozen chambord margaritas...wow. Absolutely delicious and somewhat lethal! Had a wonderful server, all smiles and at our table just the right amount of times. Started with the table-side guacamole, where the server brings all the ingredients and you choose what you would like to be included. We said "Just throw it all in!" and were not disappointed. A little less "authentic" than some would like - it included cheese and jalapenos - but we thought it was tasty nonetheless. It also included a bowl of salsa that was on the good end of pretty standard. The cast iron cornbread that they start you off with is pretty drool worthy - has pieces of corn in it and is perfectly warm and moist. 

For dinner we ordered the Southwestern Caesar salad with Ruby Trout instead of chicken. The dressing definitely has a little kick to it. The salad was huge, definitely big enough to split between two people. The fish was well prepared, very tender and a perfect addition to the salad. It arrived tossed in the dressing and we both asked for an extra side of dressing as it was a little bit dry. 

Medium price range for large servings and very good food/drinks. Happy with our experience and will probably go back at some point if we have a visitor in the mood for southwestern cuisine.

EDIT: Went to the Tempe location last night, split the seafood enchiladas and they were VERY good. Of course had another Chambord margarita, just as good as the last ones! And oh, that cornbread...wow.
