We all know there are good Berto's and bad Berto's, this place is a good one for sure. Everything is always good and they are usually really quick and always friendly. The breakfast burritos are my favorite and the rolled tacos are as well and always so crispy. The only thing is I have noticed with all Berto's is the guacamole is horrible. I don't have to have it but if it was good I would like it with my rolled tacos. I always get a horchata to. This is a must. I posted a pic of my happy burrito!!!
