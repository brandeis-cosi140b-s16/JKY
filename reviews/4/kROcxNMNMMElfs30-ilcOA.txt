Went for the first time not long ago, which is crazy because I'm obsessed with fish tacos. One of my good friends always talks them up but I just never got around to going. Grilled fish taco was great as was the orange shrimp salad. Quick for take out, reasonably priced, good service. I liked the little salsa bar too always a plus. I'll be going back!
