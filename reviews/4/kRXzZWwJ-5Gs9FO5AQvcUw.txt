I've been here twice, and was not disappointed either time.
The food was very good, the service was good, but the atmosphere was very dark.
I guess that one would call it a "romantic atmosphere", but I went there at lunchtime, and I prefer seeing my food, over romance (plus I'm married...'nough said.)
The prices were also quite reasonable.
It's sort of "off the beaten path", and the only reason I even noticed it, was because I was at the Petco (or Petsmart, I can never tell those two apart), which was within eye-shot.
And the second time I went was also when I was shopping at the pet store.
But, all said, I would recommend it.
