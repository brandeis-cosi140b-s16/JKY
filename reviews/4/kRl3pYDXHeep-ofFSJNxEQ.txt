This Taco Bell, located in the Arboretum next to the movie theater, on the Providence Road side of the shopping center, is great if you desire a run to the border.  Built a few years ago at the location where the original Taco Bell from my high school days was torched, it serves as one of three drive-thru fast food joints in the Arboretum.  In several visits to the drive-thru at varying times of day/night, my orders have always been correct (my no-tomato request has always been honored) and delivered quickly.  (Taco Bell,  which is owned by Yum! Brands, which is a spinoff from PepsiCo, serves Pepsi Products - be prepared).
