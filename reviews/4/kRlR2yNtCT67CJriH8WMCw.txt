Good service, food came out quick and fresh. I had the lunch fajitas and my husband had the lunch acp and they were both good. Just recommend coming for lunch so you have the rest of the day to digest the food since portions are big. After speaking with my husband he recommends not sitting at the booths unless you like playing seesaw with the person on the other side lol
