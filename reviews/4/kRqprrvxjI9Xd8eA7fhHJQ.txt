Flew in from out of town and stopped in with fellow travelers who have eaten here before.  For a quick lunch with a Mexican flair this place hit the spot!  Bright and inviting little place in a strip mall, with very friendly staff.  Service was pretty quick and the food came out hot and fresh looking.  I ordered the Grilled Chicken Enchilada and it was delicious.  Only negative to me was that the two enchiladas were on the small side, so if you are really hungry, try the 'pick two' enchilada meal.  It came with rice and beans, which were typical fair, but worked well with the what was a really good enchilada.
