I was really craving Rubio's new shrimp tacos but for some odd reason, they were "closed until further notice." Needless to say, I was pretty bummed out. But I drove down a few streets because my boyfriend wanted Hot Bagel and I remembered Señor Taco! So I decided to give it a try. The place was pretty empty. I got the Surf & Turf, which included a shrimp and beef burrito and a fish taco for only $6.99 (only available at this location). I had a pretty good amount of food for cheap. I haven't gotten sick off of it yet, so I'm going to say that I will be going back to this place! Now I'm glad Rubio's was closed because I got to try Señor Taco!
