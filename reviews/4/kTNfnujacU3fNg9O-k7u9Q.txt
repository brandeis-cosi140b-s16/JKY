What is up with yummy places closing at 8pm?! Chicago Burger Co and now El Molino! Instant star loss for early closures!  Though that'll be the only star loss.. the food here is fresh, home made and tasty! They make the best green chile in Old Town! 

Cheap, tasty and friendly always has a place in my heart!
