As a true San Diegan, I can tell you that the closest you'll get to a real fish taco outside of San Diego and Baja is Rubios.  Real fish tacos are deep fried, not grilled.  Real fish tacos use corn tortillas.  Real fish tacos use cabbage, not lettuce.  The only reason its not a 5 is due to price, and the fact that this location does not have alcohol (Pacifico goes great with fish tacos)
