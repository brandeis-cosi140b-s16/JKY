Pros: It's Chipotle so you know the food is standardized and GOOD. Before dropping off my rental car, I needed to get some gas so this is probably the best restaurant nearby to the airport car rental place. The service was pretty fast and the staff is very friendly with generous helpings in their burritos! The inside is pretty standard and spacious if you have the time or desire to seat down.

Cons: Nothing really wrong with the place but not "as good as it gets" per say.

Overall: Yeah, come get some fast but good food at Chipotle (especially if you want a cheaper meal in Vegas!)
