Four and a half stars, actually.  This is one of my two go-to Mexican restaurants in Charlotte, depending on what part of town I'm in and which one is closer.  Love the salsa, almost always get the Carnitas, never had a bad meal.  Have taken groups of 8-10 in for lunch and still got great service.  Can't go wrong here.
