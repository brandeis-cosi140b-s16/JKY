An update is in order here. 

In the past, I patronised this business only in the late hours. I exclusively ordered the chicken burrito and rolled tacos. And I was certainly not a fan. 

At this juncture, I have experienced more thoroughly their menu here than at any other Roberto's and I am a fan. 

It could be that their staff was turned over. It could be that I should have always just tried going before midnight or late-night. It could be that the growing competition from other businesses in the neighbourhood caused them to step up their proverbial game. 

It could be any number of those factors or a combination thereof. 

In any case, they have an unannounced Military Discount for those with DOD cards. 

They have excellent chicken, carnitas, and carne asada burritos. 

And, there is a doughnut shop right adjacent to Roberto's in case you feel like dessert. The ladies who work here are very nice (at Roberto's I mean, I have never eaten at Pink Box). 

On an administrative note, there are only five small tables with two-to-three chairs each, but there is that car wash lounge to the North end of Freddy's where one can sit with no problems being raised. Â¡Buen provecho! - E
