If you want great, fresh Mexican food, stop here. I know you think it won't be as authentic as the more authentic LOOKING places, but it's right up there. 

My favorite go-to-must-haves are the baja style tacos (two corn tortillas) filled with a fair amount of carne asada, mild sauce (though hot is available), onions and cilantro. Just like those other places, but they are always spot on with their deliciousness. 

A friend used to get all of his burritos 'enchilada style' and he loved it, so I'd recommend that if you're a burrito guy or girl!

I also usually order a small side of guacamole with chips, but man, the guac has a really bitter aftertaste that I can't take anymore. But definitely get the chips, they are salty and crispy and sometimes warm...mmmmmmmmm!

Also, the service is quick and friendly as heck! I love these people. They are on the ball and I've never had them mess an order of mine up. Super, super nice people here!

It's a little off the beaten path, buried in a strip mall, but pretty easy to find. 

I have loved Baja Fresh for a long time, they never disappoint!
