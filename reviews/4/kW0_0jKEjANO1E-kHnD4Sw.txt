I've been to the Central location of Three Amigos many times.  The new location on North Tryon did not disappoint.  My girlfriend likes their margaritas, as she puts it "they don't have a lot of BS in them".    Chips and salsa are always fresh.  I had a tostada and enchilada this time out, both great.  The marinated pork is excellent.  We also ordered the mix of enchilada's.  I still think my favorite dish is just the pork tacos with a little lime.  

Congrats on the new location, we'll definitely be back :)
