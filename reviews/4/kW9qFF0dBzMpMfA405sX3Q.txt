Ada G. and I come here often and she's right on about the salads and the soup. I don't know why we still always order a salad (maybe someday we'll learn), but their margaritas are great, their nachos are awesome and I love their salsa - it's really fresh tasting. So fresh tasting ion fact, I once caught the toddler drinking it straight from the bowl, but hey, it's a vegetable, right? 

I have no idea how their "real food" is but their happy hour fare is delicious and cheap and that's all I ask.
