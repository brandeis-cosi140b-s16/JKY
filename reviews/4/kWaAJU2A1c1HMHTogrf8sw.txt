Wow, I'm impressed! What a great little spot! We stopped in were looking for something new in the area. this place is a bit confused (It can't figure out if it's a drive through, walk up counter or sit down restaurant) but the food and service was great! We started with the cheese crisp, that was awesome. They also brought out chips and three house made salsas. One of them, which I've never had, was by far and long the best salsa I've ever had!!! It was roasted garlic, onions and chunky green peppers. I had two litle containers of it, super awesome! I also had the soup of the day, which was a creamy pepper soup that was fantastic! My wife had the grilled shrimp that were great and I went with the grilled steak torta. The torta was just okay, but everything else was awesome! The service was a touch slow, but no biggie. All in all, great little spot to get takeout, sit down or drive through hahaha
