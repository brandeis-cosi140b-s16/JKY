Just a little dive on Indian School Rd. with a lot of history. Now I might have been born here, but I grew up in SoCal! My father was born and raised here, never leaving this area. He had told me a story how as a little boy is mother sent him to the neighbors to get some tamales. As it turns out it was Sylvia? He was a devoted customer and has brought some of their food home to share with me. I really enjoyed their tamales and chili Verde! Wife and daughter enjoys their enchiladas, their sauce is almost like a mole sauce. Over all, very good food, location is not that great, but don't be scared!
