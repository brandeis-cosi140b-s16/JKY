Inside the Fiesta Henderson. There is a good size bar that you can order from too. Chips and salsa bar is awesome, service was good.I Ordered the chicken enchilada, chili relleno, and mini shredded beef burrito. The Enchilada was excellent as well as the chili relleno which had sauteed onions and peppers on top. BF had the carne asada burrito and may have found one of his favorites . Over all this is our new favorite Mexican Restaurant. Just beware if your order the Sangria Pitcher, $36
