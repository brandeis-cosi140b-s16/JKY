So it looks like from the other reviews I've had a pretty decent experience every time I've been here! Being that this is the closet location to me and the limited amount of food that is available in the late hours Roberto's is always my 1st choice! Carne Asada fries are a hit!! I usually get the nachos but them chips are extremely fried and hard! Even though As far as calories are concerned the fries are more.. But who's counting calories right?? RIGHT! Service for the most part is what it is.. If you don't speak Spanish at least know how to communicate the # of your item! They definitely nickel and dime you for every one of the extras and it's expensive for just a regular burrito once you finish trying to add in all the extras and substitutes! Portions are always equal to what you pay for! That's why the nachos or fries are the best! Seems everytime I go though the prices increase!
