came her on December 30, 2014.  service was good and come to find out the the place has only been here a few months.  Ordered the egg/chorizo breakfast burrito an d it was awesome. Also order the carne asada burrito for my wife and it was a hit. The enchilada combo plates for my two kids were also a good value and had very good flavor. Would have given them a 4.5 but that is not available here. I wish them the best of luck and I will be coming back.
