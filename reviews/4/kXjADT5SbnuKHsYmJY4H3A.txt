Food tastes good, service is good, what not to like. Unlike some places the steak on the tacos is not really chewy. The salsa has good flavor. I guess they have dancing on some nights after hours but not sure when it is, I only found that out when I showed up late one night to eat, they still served food, too. I usually get the enchiladas, ask for the bottle of green sauce!
