I love my chicken fajita bowl, but.....

Dude on the salsa:
COULD YOU PLEASE NOT SLOP WATER WITH THE PICO ONTO MY BOWL?!
I mean this is your ONE JOB.
Do it with more care than a slop server in a death camp.
Do you have some gringo hatred or something that makes you not give a F***?
Please do it right and not drench my food.
Thanks.

No matter what you do in life, do the best you can at it while you're doing it.
