Based on the previous reviews I would not come here.  But, I'm adventurous so I'll try it anyway how bad could it be.

Service:  above average
Cleanliness:  perfect (new place so expected)
Devour: combo appetizer (pica (shredded beef) nachos, chicken quesadilla, chicken Taquitos), enchiladas combo and a single pescado taco 
Quality: first off the salsa is delish.  It has a texture and about a medium spice.  The combo platter was huge, everything was great.  The best thing that stood out was the taco.  By far the best fish taco I've had in a very long time.  I'm getting a fish taco combo next visit.  

I will definitely return.
