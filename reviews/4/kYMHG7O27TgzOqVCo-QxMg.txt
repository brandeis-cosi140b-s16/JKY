Had dinner here on a Sunday night. Made it in time for the $5 happy hour margaritas too! I got a chicken burrito which was flavorful and fresh and my boyfriend was pretty happy with his chicken enchiladas. Service was good and the outdoor patio was great! It only looks out over Paradise road but it's still a nice break from the strip.
