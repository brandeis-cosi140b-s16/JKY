'Chipotle sucks!' - said no one ever.

Seriously... everyone loves Chipotle.  I don't even have to write this review.  That's how much everyone loves it.  it's fast, moderately priced, you can get exactly what you want, fresh ingredients and it actually tastes good.  Definitely great if you are looking for a quick & fresh meal!
