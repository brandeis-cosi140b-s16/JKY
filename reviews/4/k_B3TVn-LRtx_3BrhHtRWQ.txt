Dos Reales was my favorite Mexican restaurant in the C-U area (as well as one of my favorite restaurants period) when I lived there a couple of years ago. This had a lot to do with the price point. Without fail, you can always get an entire meal at Dos for under $10. That is including drink and tip. What's even more amazing is the amount of food they give you for how little you pay. First, they start you out with free unlimited chips and salsa. Then, I would always chuckle to myself when they brought out my giant quesadilla I paid ~$3 for. I always felt like I was ripping them off...

The thing that really put this place over the top for me though was when we went there for a friend's birthday. They were incredibly nice and gave him a free margarita and tequila shot. Can't beat that!
