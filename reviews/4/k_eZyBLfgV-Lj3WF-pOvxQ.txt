Since I'm from CA and married to a Mexican woman, I would have to say this place is pretty good for Charlotte.  I love my local burritos and there was actual flavors at this place.  The carne asada had a lot of flavor and the salsa/guacamole definitely helped add flavor.  In CA this place would get 3 stars, but because I'm in Charlotte it's definitely 4 star worthy.  Good job bringing the flavor to the South!
