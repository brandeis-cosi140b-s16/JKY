My fav here is the Carnitas Burrito, My only complaint would be that one of the cashiers is really moody. She can be nice one day and very aloof  the next. 
Anyhow, I find the food to be tasty and you won't go away hungry if you order the Carnitas Burrito. 
They also have a nice albeit compact salsa bar next to the drink machines. That area is a bit of a problem when the lunch crowd hits because you're bumping and shimmying with people trying to get their drinks and salsa.

The place is bigger than the photo shows.
