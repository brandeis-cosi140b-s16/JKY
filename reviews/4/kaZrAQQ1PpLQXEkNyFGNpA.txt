Open at 8am, it's Sunday morning and we are craving tacos!  We're one of the first few in the door, and ready for some good food.   It was ready pretty quick, we got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla.  The taco's are one of each, pastor, and lengua, or tongue, and very good, the meat is seasoned very well, and it's tender.  With the added chopped onion and cilantro, it gets even better.

The quesadilla is asada, very tender, smothered with cheese and very gooey.  I absolute love this place.
