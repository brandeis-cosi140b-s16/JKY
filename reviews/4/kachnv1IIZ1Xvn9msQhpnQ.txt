This is a completely bias review.  If you want an unbias, read the next reviews.  

I am a simple guy when it comes to food and the food I've eaten there has always been excellient.  I love it.  Honestly, probably my favorite place to go in Vegas for food.  I love the enchilladas, they are simple and delicious.  Not full of random ingredients where the cooks are just trying to make them more exotic.  Simple, and great.  

I think with Mexican food, people probably would think it is too simple, so that's why I say I'm bias.  

I give it a 4 because I don't know if I have ever come across a good server there, waitress, waiter, anything.  They are normally pretty bad.  And I And I know how bias I am to the food, so I automatically took down the 1 star to be fair.
