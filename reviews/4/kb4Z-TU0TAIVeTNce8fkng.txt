My mom is obsessed with this place! Needless to say I've been force fed Carlos most of my life, but you know what it's pretty good! There is nothing super special about this place, but the food is reliably good so I like that. I would recommend going in for their lunch specials or after a long day at work. My mom is particularly obsessed with their margaritas so try to stop by for happy hour if you can. Good chips and salsa too which is muy importante.

Careful for long waits at night!
