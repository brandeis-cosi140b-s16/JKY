I love Mexican food. I could live off of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. From awful (not even close to real Mexican) Taco Bell bean burritos, to some of the most amazing food (Mexican or otherwise) that I had in a variety of restaurants in San Diego... GIVE ME TACOS NOW.

Yesterday in the full on miserable chaos of Pittsburgh's Southside St. Patrick's Day celebration, we decided to go for Mexican rather than bar food. I could not have been happier. This was, without a doubt in my mind, the highlight of a rainy obnoxious holiday that the majority uses as an excuse to be poorly mannered. 

Walking into the establishment in an area of the Southside that I rarely venture to (Not a big fan of gentrification of most city's neighborhoods.) was a pleasant surprise. The hosting staff was friendly and attentive even on a very busy day like Saturday was. We were immediately seated and our drink orders were taken. Truth be told, I'm a beer girl at heart. I can no pass up a decent margarita on the rocks. While $9 was a little steep for me as far as drinks go (mainly because I rarely want to have just ONE margarita), the pomegranate margarita on the rocks was delicious. Served the first time with a slice of lime and the second time with a slice of orange, I preferred the pomegranate with orange slice combo best.

The menu is a little pricey but this isn't Taco Bell. They have a lot of authentic Mexican choices and I honestly had a difficult time choosing. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious, fresh, and quickly refilled. In the end I kept it simple and went with the grilled carne asada tacos. The meat was delicious and the salsa and beans/rice/etc was really well cooked.

In all the service was great, the food was delicious if a bit pricey, and the drinks were spectacular. While not an "all the time" place for me, it's a great once in a while dinner.
