Went here with some out of town friends and liked it very much. We made it for happy hour, before 7pm, so the apps were half off. We got the guacamole and ceviche, which were probably the best part of the meal! Btw, Thanks to the yelper who told us we have to REQUEST the free salsa and chips that come with the meal, otherwise, we would never have gotten them! I ordered 2 chicken tinga $2 tacos and one grilled Ono taco. I really liked the Ono, but the tinga was just ok. My friends ordered the spicy shrimp taco and liked it. I would definitely come back another time, but make sure it was for happy hour!
