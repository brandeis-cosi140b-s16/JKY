Made our first visit to The Mission a few weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  Our reservation was for 8 pm and my hubby and I were about 20 minutes early.  The table wasn't quite ready yet so we had a seat in the little "waiting area."  The sweet hostess brought us some cute little complimentary margarita tasters.  A nice touch I thought for waiting.  The cantelope one was nice and refreshing.  

Once our table on the patio was ready we were escorted outside to the nicely lit back patio-it had a nice vibe to it.  I was pleased to find out our waiter was Sam.  I had read in other Yelpers reviews that Sam was the man.  And he was! He was very informative, checked on our table at all the right times and didn't bug us too much.  He had a great personality and made our experience even more enjoyable.  So all in all our service was top notch!

The food:  I see other people complaining-maybe they don't understand that The Mission is more of a gourmet latin american restaurant (read: smaller portions).  But that didn't bother me.  My barbacoa tacos were absolutely delicious!  Small tortillas but piled with barbacoa-just the way it should be!  

We all enjoyed the tableside guacamole-made to perfection.  For my drink I had The Missionary-a perfect blend of margarita and sangria.  (I had a few of those actually).  Everyone at our table raved about the excellent food and drinks-we were all pleased.  

Sam ordered a pumpkin bread pudding for my friend the birthday girl.  We ended up ordering two more as they were absolutely amazing!  I don't even like bread pudding but I do love pumpkin so I tried it.  

The Mission is an ideal spot for a date night or for a nice spot to gather with friends for a special occassion.  We will be back several times in the future!
