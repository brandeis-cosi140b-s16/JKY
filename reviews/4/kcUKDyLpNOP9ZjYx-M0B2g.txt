The Tequila Bar boasts 50 kinds of Tequila.
In addition, they have an extensive selection of Mexican beer.
The bar is located at the rear of the casino, on the way to the sports book.
I tried the Blackberry margarita ( among several ) and it was supurb.
The bartender is "old school vegas" having tended bar in the city since 1959. He has seen the change in the city and it was  terrific to visit with him.
The service is great.
They have a happy hour from 4 PM - 7 PM with the house margarita for $4.50. The house margarita is made with Hadura Silver, so it is not your every day house drink.
The chili dusted shrimp looked excellent at several of the nearby tables, but I did not try it myself.
A very enjoyable bar on the strip......
