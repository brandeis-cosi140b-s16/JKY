First of all, what a lovely location!  Outdoor seating with a view of the lake available.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with Mexican rice and retried beans.  Creamy, simple goodness.  Pre dinner, the customary chips and salsa arrive.  The salsa is a bit bland for my taste, but I like over the sand dune hot, which sets me apart from the general public.  Good, courteous service earns points.
