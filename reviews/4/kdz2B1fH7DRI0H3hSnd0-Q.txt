Boy the reviews for this place are all over the map.  Well I just finally ate there and I thought it was decent.  Guy working was cool and friendly, had RUN DMC playing I thought that was a nice throwback.  Anyway, had a "Nate Dog"  a pork taco and the sweet balls.  Nate wasn't really my thing, was a grilled hot dog with mayo-ish sauce, and I am not much of a mayo fan.  However I thought the pork taco was REALLY good, somewhat spicy but very meaty and fresh.  And the balls, well, they were good too - served very hot with a sweet sauce. 

I suppose it is worth trying if you are into this kind of food.  I'd probably eat there again but these comments about cheap food - no.  It was $2.50 a taco.  For me "cheap" is Del Taco and a 59c taco which is basically across the street.  Yes Mr. Hanshishtaco if you read these, your pork taco was better than any taco at Del Taco but I would guess most guys especially, to fill up at this place, you are looking at $10 easy.
