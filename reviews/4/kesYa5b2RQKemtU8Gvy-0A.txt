Tamales are excellent!  Staff is friendly and the place is pleasant.  I had the taco dinner with an extra tamale to go.  The rice and beans are authentic and I really did like the tacos very much.  The only complaint I had was their hot sauce really wasn't hot enough for my taste but all in all, I will be back.
