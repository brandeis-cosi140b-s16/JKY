This place was super packed, which in this case turned out to be for a good reason.  Service did a decent job anyway and were flexible in how they seated us outside, since we didn't want to wait - but it was plenty comfy and service was plenty attentive anyway.

The margaritas were great, and everything we ate was really good.  I'll definitely go back, but maybe on a week night...  Recommended.
