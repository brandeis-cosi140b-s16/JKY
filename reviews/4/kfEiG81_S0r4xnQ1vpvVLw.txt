I don't know about you but I crave a great breakfast burrito, and have found a favorite one at Filibertos, a friend from Colorado just moved into my hood, very excited to have her here! she asked me if I wanted to go get a fast breakfast and where to go, told her you got a spot right up the street from ya! So off we went.

Now my favorite is the country breakfast burrito, its eggs, potatoes, cheese, simple like I like it, but I have them toss in some fresh jalapenos and pico de giao and man that is pure heaven! Love it!

My friend ordered the bacon burrito and halfway through it she was like damn that's alot of bacon lol good to know the bacon burrito really has bacon in it and not just a strip or 2.

Yep I'm sure I'll be back!
