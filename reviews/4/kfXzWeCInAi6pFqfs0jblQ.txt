Eating at Manuel's makes me feel like a boa constructor that just swallowed a barbell.  I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Manuel's is comfortingly chintzy, with dollar store Spanish decor like plastic chili peppers mingling with paintings of bullfighters. 
The three piece band is a nice touch and elevates Manuel's above other Mexican restaurants. The guys did their very best to liven up musical clich√©s like "La Cucaracha" to the mostly older clientele. The servers were all very friendly.
The food was freshly made and delish, and not greasy at all... not even the deep fried cherry burrito. Get this dish with a side of deep fried ice cream, and you've got a meal sized dessert.
The downside? I'll be laying on the floor, inert, for the next several days.
