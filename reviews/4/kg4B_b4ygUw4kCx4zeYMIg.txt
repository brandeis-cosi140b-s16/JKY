I got the chicken taco salad this time instead of the shredded beef.
They have huge chunks of chicken breast in there.
It was a little too much for me so I gave it to my man.

I went through the drive-through,
they couldn't hear me very well so told us to go to the first window.
They took our order and were reasonably fast and very friendly.

The taco salad came out to 5 dollars.
Reasonable/ affordable price and the food is VERY filling, and I couldn't finish it. (box it up for later!)

They gave me tons of hot sauce yay.
Fried tortilla shell was very fresh.
Pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, shredded cheddar, chicken.
My tummy wasn't too happy later but it was worth it!
