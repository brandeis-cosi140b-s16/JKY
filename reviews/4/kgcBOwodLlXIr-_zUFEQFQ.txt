El Burrito Loco is your run of the mill on every other corner type burrito places typical in Los Angeles, but it is very good for that type of restaurant.  

My food is always piping hot and fresher than I would expect for this type of joint.  Their green chile pork and carnitas (plate, burrito, taco, whatever) are the best items here.  The carne asada is okay, and the pozole is passable.

All in all I wouldn't make a special trip but if you live in the neighborhood and want some good, fast, drive thru Mexican food there is NO reason to go to Roberto's.
