I flippin love this place!!! I have a weird love for Mexican Markets and this place kicks ass!!! You walk into this place and bam! Mexican Sweet Breads!! Oh, it's just starting there. Grab a few sweet breads (good luck trying to figure how it do it in a sanitary way) and make your way to the CANDLES!!! Yeah, they got every imaginable candle. Picked up a Pope John Paul candle and what's that? A wall of chicharones. Now I don't eat those, but shit they are very impressive! Now my A.D.D. is kicking into high gear!!!! Tortillas, salsa, tamales, more candles, crazy ass looking fruits, crazy ass looking marinated meats, I don't know what that is and my 4 years of Spanish isn't helping me read the label, pacifico, corona, tequila and so so much more. Phoenix Ranch Market is my Disneyland! Buckle up and enjoy the ride.
