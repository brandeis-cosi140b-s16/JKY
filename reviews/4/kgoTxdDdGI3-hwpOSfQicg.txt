The food here is perfecto and the chips and salsa are very addictive. My favorite is the muchaco tacos and a margarita. We always get great service in the bar area. However the hostess ladies for the dinning room can bd hit or miss. So unless you have to sit in the dinning room I suggest the bar area! Oh ya, try the green chili burro, it rocks.
