This is good Mexican food.  The family ate here for a birthday.  Everyone like the food.  They speak of returning.  That's pretty near to a miracle in my little universe.  The chips were thin, crispy and delicious, the salsa warm, not scorching but as I said in my check-in, probably not suitable for the average Canadian.  The Sonora Enchilada is an excellent vegetarian meal here.  We're coming back.
