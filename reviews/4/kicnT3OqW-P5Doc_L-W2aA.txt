The food we ordered was really good. It's not super authentic or anything but definitely a lot better than other Mexican-American places in Phoenix. Our server, Matt, was super polite and attentive. 

Side note: Our early dinner entertainment was provided by the table behind us. The woman was explaining, (practically yelling) to the man that she was with, that she steals from the adult bookstore that she works for (and that they should expect her to) because she isn't paid well enough. Oh, okay. Then she offered to steal some porn for him and asked his preference. After first choosing heavier white ladies, he changed his mind to "blue, green, whatever..." After they left, people on the other side of us started talking about cysts and boils! Then someone did the whole horn nose blow routine. It blows my mind that people still (in 2013!) don't realize that nose-blowing is meant for the restroom while in a restaurant. How many comedians have to talk about it publicly before it reaches everyone? Anyhow, I'm not holding any of this stuff against the restaurant, I just felt compelled to share.
