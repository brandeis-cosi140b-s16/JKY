Loved this place!  Great ambience, nice and relaxed with a hint of sophistication.  Hubby loved the extensive beer list.  I had a steak which was cooked perfectly and had a magical rub on it that ranked in my top 3 steaks of all time.  They also have a very eclectic menu, so there's something for everyone here. Would go back in a heartbeat!
