I lucked out as I live right up the street and due to the vicinity, I gave it a try....GREAT restaurant, some of the best chips and salsa I have ever had, BIG PLUS! They seem to be always running a drink special, so ask, we do, and usually they are  a pretty good deal with quality to match. They even have XL mugs of Micheladas, iced, on a hot day? HEAVEN...Onto the menu, here's where they drop a star, and its not a huge downgrade. Its the 'ol must try different items on the extensive menu to find out whats best syndrome. I have had a couple amazing dishes here, and some not so amazing...So lets focus on the good...Those amazing dishes made up for the others, hence why I love this place! Service has been great every time we have come, servers know the menu fairly well, with some suggestions. (It must be said that as a vet of this industry I absolutely go to restaurants at non-peak hours). I tend to get sat immediately, get my orders quickly, and wave to the crowds on the way out...Not willing to try any of the other choices of Mexican restaurants around, after reading all the poor reviews, I would suggest trying this establishment immediately...you will be happy you did...
