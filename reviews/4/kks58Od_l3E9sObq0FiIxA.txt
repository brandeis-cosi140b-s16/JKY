I like this place. I've tried the tacos, rolled tacos, and the special of "2 mini cheese and bean burritos for 2.99". Those burritos were pretty big  for being minis!  I love the salsas ( the green is pretty hot). I did knock off a star because I feel Mexican places should always give Chips with all of their orders. Chips here will cost you 3 plus. That's ridiculous. But food is great. However the new place behind them may give them a run for their money. Their entrees already come with chips. It's TBD....
