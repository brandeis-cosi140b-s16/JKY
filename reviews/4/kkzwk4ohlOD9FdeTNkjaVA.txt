I was introduced to this place by my husband almost 3 years ago. Prior to that, I've heard of it before, but have been. Since then, we come here maybe...every other month (or whenever we get a coupon for this place). 

Every single time we've been there we've had great customer service. We've gone when it's been both slow AND busy and have never had any problems. Food is usually at the table within minutes of us ordering. 

They give complimentary chips and salsa which I actually don't mind. I know some reviewers say it's bland, but I usually doctor up the beans and just add some hot sauce to the salsa and my hubby and I are fine with that. I'm assuming that have to keep the level of spiciness and a moderate level to cater to the masses. I've always loved the chips and salsa so no complaint there. 

Hubby usually gets steak fajitas and I get my carnitas plate. Almost always I scan the menu wanting to try something new, but I LLLLLOOOOVVVVE carnitas and with the exception of one time, I've never been disappointed. The one time I was disappointed was because I felt it hadn't been seasoned enough and needed just a tad bit more simmering/slow-cooking/whatever you call it. That was about a year ago, and I've had it twice since then and I'm completely happy with it. Hubby LOVES his fajitas. Let me tell you...once again, have never been disappointed. The steak has always been seasoned well and never overpowering. 

In my opinion, the portions are HUGE! We always have to take leftovers home. We even ask for extra tortillas for take home and they always oblige!! 

And yes, I've had all kinds of Mexican food and although this may not be super authentic, the food's great and I'd recommend it any day!!!
