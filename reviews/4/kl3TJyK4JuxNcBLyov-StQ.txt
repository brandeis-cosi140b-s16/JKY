Mariscos Chihuahua has always seemed to me like.a seafood Filiberto's. I always see them on the side of the road, generally in shadier areas, with that signature blue roof and a busy parking lot. Still, I'd never met anyone who had actually gone to Mariscos. 

Is there a Yelp Whitey Badge? If so, I just unlocked it.

Jenny and I were in the mood for fish tacos but had no patience for the kind to crap Rubios or these other Mexican places try to pass off as over-breaded, deep-fried, fish sticks in a tortilla. We wanted good good seafood and, damn it, if anyplace was going to be able to hit that mark, it was going to be a place named Mariscos.

We parked in the back and entered the small shop with a man at the counter and a couple eating in the corner. I think a man and woman were the only people working. She took our drink orders and discussed any questions we had on the menu.  We ended up with some shrimp tacos, fish tacos, and seafood cocktail dishes. All were excellent. I have to say, we are now Mariscos fans por siempre!
