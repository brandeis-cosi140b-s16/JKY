Our group of 8 ladies really enjoyed dinner on August 19th at 6:00pm. I ordered the Chimmichanga with shredded beef, came with re-fried beans with cheese and rice. It was steaming hot & very good. All  our dinners were served within 10 minutes which I thought was great with all the various orders. Our waiter was most pleasant despite a few confused "seniors' in our group! It was my 1st time here and at the end of dinner, he brought 2 small plates with sophapias with strawberry glaze and a dollop of whipped cream that was delicious. Great little extra to top the dinner off. 

I will return!
