No matter how 'grown-up' I am, I think I'll always think of myself as a starving college student and always try to live as one.  Or maybe I just like life that way, who knows.  All I know is I like this Chipotle because I can surround myself with other starving college students AND get a taco ($1.50ish for the single ones), chips and guac ($2.25) and a small drink (free with my awesome UNLV ID) and be totally substantially fed for under $5.00.  That's all I need, baby.

It don't taste bad, either.  (In fact, considering it's run by McDonald's I'm surprised it's as good as it is.  It's no Zaba's, but seriously I think it's actual chicken.)
