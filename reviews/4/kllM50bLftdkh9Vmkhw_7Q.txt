Tacos are now $2.50 with various meats available .  They no longer are selling tamales as they said they weren't selling well enough .  Bummer.  They were tasty.
I have noticed that they over-salt the meat as they're cooking it .  Wish they'd lighten up on that .  That's my only complaint .  The Berumen brothers who own the 4 locations seem to be doing very well. You never see either of them at the Brookline location anymore .  I buy various items inside the store, some of the meats at the back meat counter and a lot of the produce .  I think a lot of the people that come from other 'hoods and towns never step inside .  You should .
