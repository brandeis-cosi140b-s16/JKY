This was our second visit. Definitely not what abuelita (grandma) would make but the eats are well worth the recommendation. I tried the AYCE TACOS for $19, Sunday and Monday. Well worth it. I had 12 of them. My faves were shrimp and the fish tacos. The only downside were the limes: too dry. The waiter was great. He made sure I never went without a taco in front of me. He told me they are going to report start a taco challenge after the new year, I think u need to eat 35 tacos in an hour. He recommended me for the challenge. Maybe I will come back to try it. The draft beers are $3 during happy hour. Not a bad spot inside of the Red Rock resort.
