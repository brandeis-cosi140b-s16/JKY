I came back last week even though the burrito I had was terrible but, I never had the taco's. So, if you have an adventurous pallet, this place is the best. I ordered everything. Brain, head, intestine, tongue, and the tongue by far is the best part of the animal I think. The Mexican street corn is also good. My fault for not looking at the taco menu, because I was set on having a carne asada burrito. I will definitely come back.
