I'm only giving  four stars because I've only had one item from the menu. My wife and I popped in yesterday and I ordered the carne adovada frybread. It was absolutely amazing! I ordered it Christmas style (red and green chili). I can't advise beyond that but the staff is extremely polite and the free chips and salsa is also very good. Will certainly be back.
