The food and drinks were great! Had the octopus, chicken and pulled beef tacos, classic guacamole and a churro dessert. Amazing tacos - perfectly presented and seasoned! Drinks are good but pricey. Skip the overpriced funnel cake 'churro' and buy another cocktail instead! Only real issue was the woman at the front who took too much pleasure in telling us that we should have made a reservation... We opted to put our name on the waiting list and luckily got a table pretty quick - but it was still early in the evening.
