Pupusas! That's all I had when I went here for lunch today. Frankly, it's all I need to be a fan of this place. You'll pay $2.25-$2.50 for the ones with any sort of substance in them i.e. chicken or shrimp or fish. After just a chicken and a shrimp pupusa, I was surprisingly full.

Ignore the sign on the window that says 99c Pupusas. It's misleading. On Mondays and Wednesdays, you can get pupusas for 99c, but you have to order 10 of them. So really, it's 10 pupusas for $9.90. Maths is hard. Yes, I said maths.
