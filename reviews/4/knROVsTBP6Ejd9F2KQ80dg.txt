If you've ever been an inebriated bachelor and piled whatever you found in your fridge in between two slices of bread or into a tortilla, 
or perhaps a struggling mother who feeds her family a hearty mash-up of Whatever once a week on Leftover Night, 
then you'll appreciate "The King of the Sandwiches".

Don't be afraid of rubbing elbows with your fellow patrons, or of a little grease running down from your overstuffed-torta-compressing hand all the way to that elbow.

Try somethign that sounds loco -- it won't be that hard.  A couple of the choices contain basically everything you could think of to put on a sandwich, and then some. 
Actually, you could get a single sandwich that contains the innards of about a half dozen sandwiches all at once.

LRDLT's Del Rey and Las Reynas sandwiches are essentially the Turduken of torta shop tortas.
