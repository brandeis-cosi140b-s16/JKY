This place serves fantastic authentic food! The portions are huge for the price you pay and the menu has endless options. I try something different every time and always love it, although I always get the ceviche to start as I can't resist it! So fresh and again such good value.

The majority of staff don't speak English which can make ordering a little difficult but it has been never resulted in a mistake and there is a man who speaks great English on hand who I think is the manager/owner? 

All in all definitely worth a visit for cheap authentic food from Latin America.
