Went to Red a rock Casino for 4th f July fireworks and hoped to get BBQ At Lucille's but the wait was way to long, over 2 hours, so we headed over to the food court and decided on Rubio's. The shrimp tacos were delicious, fresh shrimp with a mild creamy salsa. Add hot salsa to it and wow! What a great meal!
