Not to say that I'm a Mexican food expert, but I am from San Diego and have had more tacos than burgers. That being said, I am a big fan of Filibertos and it is on our weekly rotation of restaurants that we frequent. 

Great food,  friendly service and they are open early and stay open late. 

What's not to love?
