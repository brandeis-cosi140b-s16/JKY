I could've easily given this place 5 stars but I'm trying (and failing) to be more selective with my 5-star ratings, and because it took a really long time to get the check.

That being said, I loved this place.  We were visiting Vegas from San Francisco and were looking for a place to stop for lunch on our way to Red Rock.  We were ready to resign ourselves to some kind of crappy strip mall food (ie: Olive Garden) when we stumbled upon Agave.

Despite the bright pink exterior and strip mall location, this place is definitely not Chevy's, On The Border or your typical suburban chain Mexican joint.  There were authentic flavors and ingredients (nopales, roasted pumpkin seeds, etc), and the decor was very impressive.  Plus the outdoor patio chairs were super-comfy.

I got the taco sampler with carne asada, al pastor and carnitas and all three were delicious.
