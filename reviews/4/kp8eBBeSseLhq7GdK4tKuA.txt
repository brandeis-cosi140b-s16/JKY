Another awesome find thanks to Yelp! We were in town for the Ironman and the husband was hankering for GOOD Mexican food. We trolled Yelp before settling on The Blind Pig and it was awesome. We started off with some drinks and decided that we were just going to order a variety of appetizers instead of separate meals. We ordered the Chips with Salsa and Guac, the ceviche and the chorizo nachos.... and a side of chorizo. Everything we got was homemade and SO flavorful. My favorite was definitely the ceviche, however. A huge portion and the flavor was so good that even the liquid was worth trying to scoop onto my chips after the rest was gone :) The guacamole was very good and the salsas were both rather spicy. The nachos were the only thing that kind of disappointed. The flavors were great and the meat was good, but they were under the broiler for a few minutes too long.. we had to break apart the chips as the cheese melted hard and they were very dry.... oh well, more reason for another margarita ;) A great experience and if we are ever back in Tempe, I will be dying to try more of their menu.
