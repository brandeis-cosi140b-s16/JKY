This is the hole in the wall Mexican joint of my dreams. Good value, clean, a salsa bar and pretty good too.

The 1.99 fish tacos on special were quite large. The fish was decently crisp on the outside and tender on the insides. It was dressed nicly with the pico and salsas.

For a real kick try the roasted Serrano chilies at the salsa bar they are quite warm.

I salute you Senior Taco!
