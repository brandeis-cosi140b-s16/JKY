First time at this location and it is a busy location but they serve limited alcohol, a plus for any place.

Once we got through the line, the staff are warm and friendly and really go out of their way to make you what you ask for with some extra in it.  The food is good and the place even though busy seems to have a good crowd.

This is a place I would go back to again and just know, expect a crowd being on Las Vegas blvd.
