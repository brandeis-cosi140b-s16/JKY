Always go through the drive up. Usually takes the person a while to either understand me or me understand them. Otherwise ordering is pretty simple. When asked if I want sauce I just stop saying yes over the intercom cause I never get it anyway. The food is pretty basic but once in a while they have some new item that is pretty good. They are fast and havent had to many mishaps.
