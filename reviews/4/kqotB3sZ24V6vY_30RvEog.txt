Wow, I must say I was really impressed with their food.  The menu didn't seem very spectacular (not a ton of choices) but I thought everything was really yummy.  Starting with the salsa which was delicious!  For dinner my husband and i just ordered a few steak tacos and the chicken nachos.  Full of flavor.  I will totally be back again! 

The service was a little slow, but it was right before a bunch of events at NC Music Factory, so that was to be expected.
