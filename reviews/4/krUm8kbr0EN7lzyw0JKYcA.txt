Good spot for lunch

My work crew is a big fan of Cafe Rio for lunch. Line takes a tad long, but the staff is cool, they nailed the order, and the food is actually tasty.  Never a fan of staff singing.  In this case though, they actually seemed to be having fun with it.  Oh, note that the parking lot can be somewhat crazy.

As an experience, I'd compare this straight up with a Chipotle or Qdoba, but with more cheese and less cost.  Lunch specials are a good value.  Decor is enjoyable and cleanliness was good.  

Extra star for the staff's really good attitude and the pride they were showing in their city. I liked seeing the Avondale gear while they smiled, joked, and filled our orders.

We'll likely keep this as one of our go-to places.
