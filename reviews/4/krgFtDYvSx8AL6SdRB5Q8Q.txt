No complains here.

Have been few times here for happy hour but didn't quite feel the need to review the place solely on drinking at the bar until today. 

Went here yesterday with few friends for a graduation happy hour. Since we were a group of around 14 - we had to divide  in 2's to be seated in the booth which I wasn't a big fan of. As for the roof top, it was all reserved - so, unlike us make sure to make a reservation for a larger group. 

The food was okay. Everyone seemed to enjoy their Chorizo Tacos and the salsa with chips. I especially like the Chipotle salsa. The prices were reasonable. The service.. well, it normally depends on the server no matter where you go.

And yes, don't forget to "try" the Yinzerita.
