Best airport food I've ever had hands down... uhhh hello!?! You're in an airport and buying alcohol did you expect it being cheap?!?! For an airport place it has great food, I had the chicken poblano burrito wife had pork tacos... they we're both outstanding! Yes a bit expensive but again you're in an airport! As far as it replacing Wendy's???? Are ya kidding me?!?! Hell yes! Go to sleep!!!
