My husband works in the middle of Chinatown. So it's difficult to find something Mexican which is what we love when I meet him for lunch.  However, we found this place being in the middle of it all and tastes good.  They have great lunch specials and you get a decent portion for the price.  It is a cross between fast food and sit down.  The food is home-style and I love their salsa. Been there a couple of times and have not been disappointed.
