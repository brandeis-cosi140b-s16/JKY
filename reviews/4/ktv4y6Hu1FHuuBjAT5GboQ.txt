I was excited to visit this location on its opening day! There are a decent amount of tables inside and a lot of bar seating as well. The interior was spotless and the staff was incredibly friendly.

I ordered my usual bowl to go, and everything appeared to be fresh and clean in the serving area as well. Portions seemed a little scant compared to the Baum Blvd location, but I certainly don't need a super-sized bowl, so I didn't mind.

For their first day, the staff seemed quick and efficient, and really welcoming as well. I look forward to walking quite often. 

The only downside is the parking situation. This parking lot was a mess before Chipotle. Now it will be much worse. Park as close to Dinette as possible and away from the wine store, unless you park in the excess parking area near MCN Salon. People coming up the ramp from Whole Foods whip around so fast that it's almost impossible to see clearly when trying to back out of a spot near the wine store. Otherwise, love this Chipotle!
