I kid you not, this Chipotle has some of the nicest staff around. So happy go lucky making burritos, taco salads and the like. 

Every time I roll into this Chipotle I'm impressed with the super clean facilities, exceptionally nice folks behind and counter and, let's be real, their burritos have yet to let me down. Massivo barbacoa burrito bowl, pinto beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, lettuce medium salsa, if you're askin'. Super fresh and, frankly, Chipotle does a nice job of sourcing sustainable ingredients from their suppliers. Check their website if you don't believe me. 

My only gripe is that they charge $1.75 for guacamole (on your burrito or as a side). That's pretty steep, amigo...especially because I love me some guacamole. But besides that little hiccup, this Chipotle makes me happy with solid burritos and fantastic, friendly service.
