The first time I went to Brushfire was a couple of weeks ago. I was stoked because the food was great and the prices were cheap. Def 5 stars. However, I went back yesterday and while the food was still good, the exact same meal cost me $2.50 more than my first visit. Not a deal breaker, but def not cool Brushfire. While I like the new styrofoam containers that prevent my taco from leaking salsa all over the bag, I'd rather save my $2.50 and deal with a messy taco. Bring back the cheap-o wrappers and the cheap-o prices :D please?
