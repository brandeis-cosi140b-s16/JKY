Very solid mexican food.  I care very much about the chips and salsa they start you out with and right from that I knew it was gonna be a good place.  Their "fancy" margaritas are very good.  I got the enchiladas which were very very good.  Staff was a little slow for my taste but I won't dock anything from my rating for that as she was kinda busy.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it's good!
