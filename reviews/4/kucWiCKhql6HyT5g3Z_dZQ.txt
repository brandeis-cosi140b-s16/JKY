Moved to Mesa 4 years ago. Just ate here for the 1st time today. Wish we had found this place sooner.  The carne asada was really good - tender and we'll seasoned. My husband had a machaca and egg burrito which he said was delicious. The dining area wasn't dazzling but the tables and the floor were clean. The kitchen looked clean as well. The service was fast and friendly. Paid less than $20 for a whole bunch of food. Would eat here weekly if it was closer to our place. The owner said they have been in business for 10 years. That's saying something for a "hole-in-the-wall" type of joint.
