I have to say... this place is good.  I would definitely come back here... if we were staying at Mandalay but not if we were staying anywhere else.  I am a fan but it is not so good that I would go out of my way to come over here.

With that said - the guacamole is to dieeeee.... so yummy.  Perfect for when you're starving and you still can't decide what to order and you've been at the pool/beach all day and cannot stomach another margarita.  Order it as soon as you sit down, as they are handing you the menu.  You will not regret it.

My boyfriend and I got the unlimited $45 thing they were doin' - here is my breakdown.

Tacos - just okay but I live in L.A. and we got some good tacos over there

Ceveche - good, kept getting a few of each

Whatever that salad was with the bacon wrapped date - salad was good but the date was amazeballs!  Please give more than one!

Scallop and shrimp soup - I thought it was good but my bf really complained about it.  Said the scallop was overcooked.

If you're staying at Mandalay and are flipping through your guest room book, trying to figure out what to eat and not manage to spend $100/person and maybe eat something a little better for you than another damn cheeseburger.  Head over to Border Grill!
