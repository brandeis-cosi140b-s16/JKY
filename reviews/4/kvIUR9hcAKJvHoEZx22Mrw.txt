Decided to try something new for dinner the other night, and stumbled upon Gordo's.  Their menu was pretty standard for a Mexican food place.  The drive thru is a nice option when you're in a hurry as well.  For a drive thru Mexican food place, I thought the food was great.  It definitely beats Filly-B's and I'll be going back to try their breakfast menu.
