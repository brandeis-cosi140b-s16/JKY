My sister & I came here for lunch this past Saturday.  Sat outside to enjoy the scene on the strip.  Even though it was so hot, the mist they have for the customers make you feel refreshing.  It was enjoyable to sit outside. The music, waiters & atmosphere was so fun.

While we were waiting, the music was bumping & this ladies wanted to dance w/ the waiter. He was fun & was dancing w/ the customers.  It was entertaining.  They also take your picture & give you a complimentary souvenir picture. You can also buy larger photos if you like.

I ordered chips & salsa, & carne asada quesadilla. I love how they make the tortilla crisp & their beef is delicious and tender.  It's served w/ sour cream, guacamole, & hot sauce.  The portions are more than I can eat.  Affordable & worth dining here.

The only thing I didn't like was the greeters stand in the heat outside. They should have the mist on them also since they're standing there the whole shift.  They looked beat & I felt bad for them.  

Will come back next time I'm in town.
