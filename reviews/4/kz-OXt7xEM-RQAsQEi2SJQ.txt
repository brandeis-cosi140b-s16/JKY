Ive literally had this place bookmarked on here for a year. My boss raves about this place, and for some unknown reason I never made the time to try it....until this weekend. I can definitely say, for your first time in here, its overwhelming. They have like 12 different meats/flavors, its hard to keep them straight. I liked that they allowed samples first. My kiddo and I are picky. I told him we would try samples of mild options, and nothing with onions! Honestly, I don't even know what the heck I had lol, they were throwing so many names at me. I ended up doing the 3 large tacos, each with a different meat, just don't ask me what kind! My son had the quesadilla, which is huge. Total with tip came to 20 bucks. It looks like they are undergoing a remodel, it doesn't look like the pictures anymore. Staff was friendly. I would come back, just be prepared to be a little overwhelmed with options!
