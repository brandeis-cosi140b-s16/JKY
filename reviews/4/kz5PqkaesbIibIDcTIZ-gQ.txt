Small place in a stip mall, but it's cozy with good food!  Decent amount of tables to sit at, but I opted for carryout.  The carne asada burrito is huge, so I really didn't need the cheese quesadilla that I also ordered.  Make sure you ask for extra red sauce on the side(they gave me a whole cup and I am still sweating as I'm typing this).  Very good meal at a decent price.

I'll be back!
