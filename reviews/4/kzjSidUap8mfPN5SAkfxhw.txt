Finally catching up on some reviews. 
Ate here a couple of months ago after seeing a comedy show- 

We went in and thought it would take a while to be seated so we ate in the bar area. 

The then boyfriend who is now the ex boyfriend ordered Carnitas 
I ordered traditional chicken enchiladas. 

We started with the Queso dip.

First they brought out chips and three different salsas.  very delish!
Then the Queso came ... not my fave. did not really like it, it had a smoky flavor plus it was kind of ... coagulated.
There I said it... coagulated.
not good texture for melty cheese!

The food came out and it was so flavorful and good that I almost made myself SICK eating . 

Definitely want to go back -
