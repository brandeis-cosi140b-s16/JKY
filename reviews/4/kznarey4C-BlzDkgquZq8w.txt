Open 24 hours and has a special Monday - Friday.  Each one of those days, a certain item like taco (your choice of chicken, carne, or beef), tostada, bean burrito, quesadilla, etc.. are 99 cents.  Not a bad deal.

The beans are not runny here.  There's a chip and salsa bar with a variety of salsa (unlike the place on 1250 W. Broadway, in Tempe).

Great Carne burrito and I've never had a problem here at all.
