We haven't been here since they changed the name to Three Amigos, but dinner was great tonight! Joe had the chicken mole and I had some basic enchiladas and a taco - all excellent. Also they had Dos Equis on special for $2.50! They lose one star because the salsa was not the greatest... and you have to order pico de gallo but it's worth it - very spicy but so tasty.
