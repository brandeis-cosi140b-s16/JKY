Wish this charming little restaurant was here when we lived a bit closer to this neighborhood! Still, it was a fun discovery one day when we were on our way to the PV Mall.  The food and service were good. The server even took the time to give us the restaurant's backstory. We have gone back for take-out empanadas, both savory and dessert. They make a fine quick mid-week meal.
