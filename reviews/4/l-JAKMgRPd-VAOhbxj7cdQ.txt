Mexican food and upscale dinning is a combination that sounds simple but somehow it doesn't always get pulled off well. But, unlike most places willing to give the concept a try, Taberna pulls off the middle ground perfectly. Most upscale Mexican restaurants give you a feeling that they are higher priced places that serve Mexican food. Taberna is well decorated and still feels like a Mexican restaurant. 

The chips and salsa were a perfect start. The blue corn chips were perfectly salted and the fried plantains were a unique touch. The salsas were awesome. The hot had a great kick and the green had a good kick plus a great citrus flavor. My girlfriend and I also split an order of empanada as an app. The braised chicken inside was perfectly cooked. The fish tacos use different fish on different.  Friday night was swordfish! It was cooked and cut just right so that you got the full flavor with every bite. I had the special of the night, which was a french roasted chicken, with a stuffed chilies, asparagus and graton potatoes. The sauce was probably the only thing Mexican about it, but it was still great. 

Drinks (a margarita and sangria), an appetizer and two entrees came up around 70 dollars. Not bad considering this restaurant ia in an upscale shopping center. Taberna is also on Local Dines (https://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485), so we used a gift certificate to save 15 dollars.
