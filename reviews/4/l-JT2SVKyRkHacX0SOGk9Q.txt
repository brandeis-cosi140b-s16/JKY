We were starving and looking for a good place to eat. my husband suggested Taqueria Santander and like any hungry person...i said why not? we ordered one taco de tripas, one al pastor taco, one torta de Asada and one tostada de Asada...yes, just for the two of us. The food was delicious and so were all of the salsas. We are definitely coming back soon!
