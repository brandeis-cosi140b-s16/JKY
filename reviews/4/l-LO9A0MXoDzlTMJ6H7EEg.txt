What a nice hidden treasure in Coolidge.  From the street, you might pass it if you were not looking for it.  But, in the end you will be glad you stopped.  Service was good but could be better - but the food - ah yes, the food.  Excellent.  Fresh.  Delicious.  And, they brew their own fresh iced tea - I prefer it a bit stronger, but it was refreshing, cold, and delicious.  Salsa is fresh and is mild.  Mmmmm - I will be back!  Portions are huge!
