My daughter loves this place. We had never been, but she dragged us here on Christmas Eve. It turns out she knows most of the servers there, as she and her ex-boyfriend would frequent the place quite often last year.

WOW! We were impressed by the service, the portions, and the freshness of the food. The Pico De Gallo is great. The salsa is great. The guacamole is wonderful. It's all fresh, and the chips are warm!

The plates are at least 16 inches in diameter, and there's enough food on the typical entree to feed two adults. My 84-year-old parents shared a steak plate that filled them up with enough left over for another person. My wife and I each had lots left over. One of the twins had a kid meal and took 2/3 of it home. The other one took half of his home. My daughter also had leftovers of her vegetarian fajitas.

These folks have an extensive menu, and they will make adjustments or substitutions for you. They want you to be happy and full, and they are very attentive to your needs. We had a "water glass accident" (spill), and they were on it immediately.

We will definitely return to this place. It's authentic, very reasonably priced, and festive. We will have to remember to be starving when we get there...

Do print a Google Map or use your GPS to find it the first time, though. It is in a strip shopping center just off Independence freeway, but is best accessed from the neighborhood streets off of Sharon Amity, just West/South of Independence.
