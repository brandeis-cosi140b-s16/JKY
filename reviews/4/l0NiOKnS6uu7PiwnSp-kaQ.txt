Let me start off by saying that when I review my visits, I always rate the location based on my experience at that very moment.  It could be the most common restaurant chain ever, but ends up getting 4 or 5 stars from me.  That's because my my experience and my satisfaction was a 4 or 5 star at that very moment in my visit.  I wanted to preface this review since I will be giving them a great rating.  

I literally find myself going to Del Taco after every drunken night.  When I visit this drive through, there's only one thing I get and only one thing I will ever get.  That is the soft chicken tacos for only $1 dollar!  I usually get 3 and that does the trick.  This taco is packed with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and the most flavorful chunks of grilled chicken.  Top it off with their mild taco sauce and I got the best taco fix at 4am!

Being that this drive through is a block away from my apartment, I KNOW I will continue coming back to get my soft chicken taco fix.  If you haven't tried it yet, you are definitely missing out.  What are you waiting for?  Log out of your computer now and get your butt down there!
