My only regret in going to Francisco's is that I went on a night I was going out afterwards and my healthy portion of leftovers didn't get to come along. Francisco's is insanely inexpensive and offers up huge plates - I was hungry and I could only put away half my chimichanga, and the burritos are easily 3-4 servings. Their rice is some of the tastiest I've ever had - I've been contemplating bringing in a Tupperware container and asking them to just fill it up so I can eat it for a week straight. If you want to get full fast and on the cheap, mosey on down East Main.
