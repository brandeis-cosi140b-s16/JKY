Surprisingly good Mexican food in this little casino located just off the Strip. We found this place because one year there were so many coupons in the Entertainment Book. 

The complimentary starter is the chips and salsa (good). My husband asks for a side of bean dip. The best dish is the Seafood Burrito, served with rice and beans (onion stem is garnish).  Since Cozymel's changed their menu, we had to find a worthy substitute. The tasty burrito generously complimented with flavorful sauce, really has seafood (not just shrimp, like Toto's), and it is huge. I only eat half of it. It's the only thing that both of us orders, though one of our friends had the chicken dish, but it didn't look as good as our burritos. Reasonable prices, but even better when you have a coupon.

The atmosphere is really tropical looking/feeling with fake palm trees, despite being located in The Tuscany Hotel/Casino. The staff wears uniforms (men wear the cubano similar shirts, and the ladies wear the brightly colored frilly tops with skirts), adding to the Mexican feel. There is booth as well as table seating. The friendly servers are very good. You pay at the cashier. 

Can't complain about anything- never had a bad meal here.
