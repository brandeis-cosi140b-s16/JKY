I love this place. Total diner type with great, greasy burgers. This burger is perfect for a hangover. I think the best gourmet burger in old town is Rehab, but David's is the best greasy one. They also have great breakfast.

Ordering from Eatstreet or GrubHub is also excellent. They go above and beyond for delivery.
