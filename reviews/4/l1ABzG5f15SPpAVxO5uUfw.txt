My husband and I decided we had a hankering for Mexican food so we decided to stop at On The Border. It's not a restaurant we frequent, so we were unsure of the service and quality. We were very pleasantly surprised with the food and the attentiveness of our server, Lauren or Taylor (I can't remember her name for sure). I even used mobile Foursquare to check-in and received a Free Queso appetizer.  I tried the fried avocado for my entree which was ok, but overall the food and service proved a place we'd come back to again.
