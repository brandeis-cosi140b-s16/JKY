I was concerned. I mean, it's next door to a veterinarian facility. Think of the jokes man!
But wait... what if it's not a joke? What if those poor, terminal pets...
Anywhoo, I suggest putting that thought out of your mind and repeatedly visiting this place. It is delicious!!
The crab enchiladas are ridiculous. So are the beef tacos, the nachos, and every one of the kids items :)
And pair any menu item w/ one of their margaritas...
You won't even remember the puppies!!! :)
