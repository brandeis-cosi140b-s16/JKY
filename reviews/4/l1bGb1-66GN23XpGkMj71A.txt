This is a great sports bar in north scottsdale.  No 'snottsdale' folks here.
Saturdays they have specials on their burgers, which are delicious.  They also have Taco Tuesdays, with discounted tacos.  Their menu has the usual mexican favorites and some good appetizers.  A good sports bar for the whole family to enjoy.
