I was driving around earlier tonight desperately looking for something different- not the same old fast food I eat almost every night.

Driving past a strip mall on south Stephanie I spotted the Fausto's sign at the last second. It's tucked away in the strip mall behind a building that is closer to the street so it's real easy to miss.

I've had bad luck with local "authentic" Mexican places here in town so I took a few minutes to decide before going in.

I'm really glad I decided to give this place a try. I decided on the 2 steak taco meal for $6 which is pretty reasonable. I added a medium soft drink and was only charged $1 extra for a total of $7.

Much to my surprise the steak tacos were among the best I've ever had- anywhere. Delicious steak with no fat or gristle cooked perfectly and served on soft corn tortillas with a fresh pico salsa and guacamole. Very very tasty and surprisingly large. 2 tacos is an ample portion. You also get the usual Spanish rice and refried beans- both of which were very tasty also.

I will definitely be going back here and try more stuff. I see the California burrito recommended several times in other reviews, so it's next up for my next visit.

Glad I found this place!
