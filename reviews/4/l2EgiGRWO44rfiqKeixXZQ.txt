My girlfriend and I really like this place.  We have now been in probably 8 times in the past 1 1/2 years.  I have had a chance to try several different things and have only had one bad experience, and that was just due to my menu selection.  It was the "thoroughly modern burrito", which just wasn't what I was expecting and didn't seem to have a favorable flavor combo.  I have tried recommendations from the staff and have not been disappointed.  Chico is a very friendly and efficient server, and it can be real busy in there sometimes, but we haven't been neglected.  He recommended the West Coast Burrito for me on one visit.  It was fantastic and I have since had it on two more trips.  I also highly recommend the Clams Corona.  Great spciy flavor and served with bread to sop all the broth up.  Great margaritas too!
