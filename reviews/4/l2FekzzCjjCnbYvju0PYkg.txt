I need to revise my review of this place.  The food has actually improved greatly in the past months and I need to let everyone know that am recommending this place again.  I keep coming back because this is one of the few 24-hour spots around and pretty much the only place aside Denny's and IHOP in the immediate vicinity to get late night grub.

They now have a drive-thru and are being renovated so things are looking much better here as well as tasting better..  When they finally finish working on that scary-looking men's bathroom, I'll be even happier. . .
