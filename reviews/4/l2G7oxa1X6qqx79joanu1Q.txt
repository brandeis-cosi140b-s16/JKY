I haven't been to a Rubios in a really long time and was very happy with my experience here. The restaurant is very clean and the food is very good. I loved the fish taco but my favorite was the shrimp taco. the shrimp has a grilled flavor to it and the sauce is so good and creamy. For fast Mexican food you can't beat it. Would definitely come back.
