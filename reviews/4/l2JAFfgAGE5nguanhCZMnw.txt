Nice place. Kinda small but it actually helps the atmosphere. Nice and new. Amazing service. I liked a lot of things about this place. The kitchen is actually in front so you can see what's going on. Guy cooking is wearing a chef coat and looks highly professional. 


Food was great. Still need to try out a few other things. Glad I stopped by. Will definitely try it again.
