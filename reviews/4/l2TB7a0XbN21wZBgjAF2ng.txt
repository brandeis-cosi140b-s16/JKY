Came here to check out the margaritas and bar food
Bar food usually isnt the best but its always good to eat while youre drinking
Anywho I had me a beergarita and I really liked it
The service was nice and it was a pretty chill atmosphere
I think its a great location and I had a good experience here
I think it would be a good place for a group of friends
After all it is on Mill
Now you can start your crawl on the North End
and stumble down South 
:D
