I made a reservation and walked right in and didn't have to wait. The marinated shrimp with plantains and black beans were awesome. I had cool waitress that gave me a sample of a local jalapeno beer they have on draft. I didn't like it but appreciated her offering to let me try it before I bought a full glass. The food/service is a level( or two) up from your typical Mexican restaurant (i.e Monterreys, Zapatas) Nice spot to take a date. I def.plan to return soon.
