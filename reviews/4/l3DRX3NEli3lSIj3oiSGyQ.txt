The tacos I had here - chicharron, carnitas, pollo, and carne asada - were really good and so inexpensive. They were very well-seasoned, with a little bit of spicy kick; If you want more heat, the tables have plastic bottles of red and green salsas. This is beyond hole-in-the-wall, though: La Frontera consists of two trucks, each with a blue tarp and dining tables and chairs beside it. Both are kind of permanently stationed in a lot on 16th Street near Van Buren, with a Watermill station in the middle of the lot. I got my tacos from the truck nearest the street; the other truck is for mariscos and Sonoran  hotdogs.
