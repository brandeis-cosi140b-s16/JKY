My hubby works out on the west side so he will occasionally drag the whole family to some resturaunt he has decided is well worth the trek. Rita's is one of our go to's for completely authentic Mexican.  Rita herself is a classy business saavy gal from south of the border who knows her stuff and is a sweetheart to her patrons.  The food is muy muy bien.  Si es possible, triega una persona que habla espanol.   Or you can just point to the number on the menu.  Up to you.
