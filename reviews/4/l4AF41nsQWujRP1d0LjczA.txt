I've been to Three Amigos about 4 or 5 times now. One time we had to wait over an hour for our food and the waitress that we had seemed like she was in a bad mood and didn't want to be bothered, never asked if we wanted more chips or more to drink, so she didn't get a tip, but it was worth the wait for the food. The food is always good and normally the staff is nice. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a fan of Mexican food. Sometimes the place can seem a little cramped when there are a lot of people dining in, but still a nice restaurant.
