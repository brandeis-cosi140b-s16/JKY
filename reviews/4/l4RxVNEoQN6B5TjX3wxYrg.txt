I have always had a hit and miss experience with Mad Mex.  I love the fact that they have a great beer selection, but the food sometimes seemed expensive for the quality.  Last Saturday night the wife and I went to the Greentree location, and the food was very good.  My wife had a spicy chicken burrito, and my grilled fish tacos were fresh and full of flavor.  Of course, wouldn't you know we had a waitress that simply forgot about us.  No tea or water refill, no interest is selling me a second beer.  Oh well.
