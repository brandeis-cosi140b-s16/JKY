The food here at Gorditas is absolutely amazing, kicking the competition to the ground. Situated in what I call the "heart of Mexico", the atmosphere isn't very welcoming nor are the workers. Upon ordering, I was not greeted and getting looks from both the workers and their customers as I am not of Mexican descent. But in the end, I'm only there for the food!
