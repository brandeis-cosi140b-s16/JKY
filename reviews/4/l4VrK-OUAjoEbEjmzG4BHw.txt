So I went back to China Poblano to relive my 30th birthday last year (which was awesomely spent working the week in Vegas and then spending the night at the Cosmopolitan and eating here).  Really I came back because the food was decent, I dug the experience and the wait staff I had last time was memorable.  I felt bad for my dad because he is not as of an adventurous of an eater as I am, but he did find a noodle dish he enjoyed.  All in all, second time was a charm as well!
