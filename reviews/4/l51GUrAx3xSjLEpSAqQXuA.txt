Our first time yesterday. We were looking for a good margarita ( I am picky picky about margaritas) with ambience and good appetizers and we found it! I loved the atmosphere the nachos and cheese crisp. The staff was excellent, really cared if we were satisfied. Oh almost forgot to mention the comfy bar chairs. We will definitely be going back for a full dinner. We even asked about having a large group, they said no problem.
