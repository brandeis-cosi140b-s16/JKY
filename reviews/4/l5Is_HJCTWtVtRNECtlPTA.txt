First off, I love this kind of Mexican food.  The kind that is covered in cheese and so unbelievably unhealthy that I shudder to think what the caloric content is.  I swear AZ has it's own brand of Mexican food.  When I lived in L.A., there was no way I was finding a deep fried burrito covered in jalapeno cream cheese and then topped with more cheese or a Mexican pizza with that same jalapeno cream cheese used as a sauce.   Ajo Al's does have lighter options and their Salad Carbon is favorite of mine as well, but sometimes I just need to indulge. 

You should know something else.  I worked here as a hostess when I was a senior in high school.  So, I had the opportunity to try a ridiculous amount of Ajo Al's food.  I still love this place and always will.  If you're like me and you love the Sonoran style food served in places like Julio G's and Valle Luna, you'll like Ajo Al's too.  

You should also know that I don't understand when people say this type of food is not authentic.  Authentic to what?  I sure can't find this crap in California, New Mexico, or Texas; all of which border Mexico.  So, it must be authentic to Arizona, right?  And that is what I love, good ol' AZ Mexican food.
