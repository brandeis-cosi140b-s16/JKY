Absolutely nothing fancy about this restaurant in a strip mall but the food was yummy! Truly a fusion type concept and not for the faint of heart as many of the dishes are pretty spicy. I loved the jerk chicken and black beans.

Ordering can seem confusing for a first timer but it will make sense after you watch others or ask for help.

No fuss, straight forward and good!
