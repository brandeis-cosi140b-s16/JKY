Ordered grilled chicken salad. It was pretty darn good and satisfying for a fast food taco joint. Not chincy on the cheese on top (which i was disappointed due to dieting, yet delicious) or the chicken inside. Chicken was not bone dry and inedible, pretty moist as fast food goes. Lettuce was leafy, green and fresh.

What stood out to me was there was a young lady empolyee that had finished her shift that had noticed my my eyes wandering (people watching is a hobby of mine, dont pretend you dont as well) and asked if all was ok and if I needed more dressing. Well, in fact I was fine but thanked her and said no. 

Never have I seen an employee in a fast food place ask so politely AND on their own time, as she was obviously off the clock. 

So hey, all you America's Taco Shop head-honcho's, this girl is management material. Or at least a shining example of how all employees should treat all customers.

I'll be back for sure.

I did take the time to point it out to the head-honcho who was there at the time of my meal to ensure she was given props!
