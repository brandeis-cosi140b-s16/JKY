I never, in my life, expected the most authentic Mexican food I've had to come from a place in Wisconsin. I grew up in Texas, and you could find stellar Tex-Mex food on every corner, but authentic central Mexican dishes are had to find anywhere I've been. 

The moment I bit into my beef quesadillas, folded into that fluffy, crunchy, delicate corn masa shell, the food took me right back to my trip to Guanajuato. My only regret is that I only tried the one dish. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town.

Overall, the atmosphere and service are so-so, but the food is fantastic. Perfect for casual lunches and dinners.
