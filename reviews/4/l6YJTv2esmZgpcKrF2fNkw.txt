I've driven by this place so many times and never stopped in, but was glad we checked it out yesterday.  The atmosphere is quite nice, the service was ok, but the food was tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed my mushroom enchiladas...yummy and the lunch portion was just the right size!  Beware...the food comes out piping hot and takes a long time to cool down.  The chips and salsa were really good too.
