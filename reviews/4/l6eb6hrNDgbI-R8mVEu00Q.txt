Good luck finding authentic Mexican food in Pittsburgh!

Chipotle hits the spot with it's consistent taste and quality. The wait is never too long during rush hour lunch, barbacoa is yummy and I'll never complain about too much rice. It is hard to find parking near by which can add 20 mins to your lunch, easily. And I don't think this Chipotle carries any beer.
