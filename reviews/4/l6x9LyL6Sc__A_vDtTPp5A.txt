This is one of those places where you go by default.

It's late. Or it's lunch. Nothing is nearby. Very few things are open. Julio's is right there. It's cheap. Why the hell not?

This place is pretty damn solid. 

It's unhealthy. It's delicious. It's the perfect "after party" food. Catch my 
drift?

Service can be a little slow, but whatevs.
