What a dive, in a good way.  This is one of those run down divey places you will just love to go too.  The food was spot on, I had the chicken fajita tacos.  My son had the nachos and can't wait to go back-he is a very picky eater.  Four stars for they barely give you any chips and salsa, and it could be cleaned a little.  Dives are nice but it needs some spring cleaning.  Absolutely worth a visit though-not like it is just filthy.
