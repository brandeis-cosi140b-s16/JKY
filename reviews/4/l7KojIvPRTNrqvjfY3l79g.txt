mmm, this is chain mexican food that I will eat when I am sober...  That is saying enough if you ask me!

ok ok ok, Senor Taco is muy delicioso.  It is real similar to say a Filiberto's but super clean and efficient.  Similar salsa bar setup with the weird jalapeno and carrot mixture that when you ask what it is called they tell you, "Jalapenos and Carrots?"

Carne Asada is the bomb and I enjoy their California burrito.  Think all the unhealthy things you can put in a burrito... Sour cream, guacamole, potatoes, beans... yum.  

Biggest downfall is the measly six chips they give you with your meal.  I am sure you could probably get some more if you wanted them though since they are always super nice.

The salsa are aight.

Oh an the 10% student discount they give me when I wear my nerdy name badge... ohhh yeah.

Go there and enjoy some chain mexican food.

You know you want to!
