Really good sports bar. Had a "meeting" here one night and it wasn't too crowded during the week. Service was good and prices were also pretty good. I hear the lunch specials are great so I definitely need to make it back soon.

Check it out if you are in the area. One nice thing about this part of Tempe is there is no shortage of good bars.
