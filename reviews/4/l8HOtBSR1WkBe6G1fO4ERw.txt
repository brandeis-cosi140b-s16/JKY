Out of control.  There is no other way to describe it.  If you're in a serious mood to dance, party, fist pump, and make questionable decisions then this is the place to be!  Especially on Sundays!  All of my experience here has been during Spring Training so I guess it was a little more out of control than usual, but I'd like to experience this place when it is less of a sh*t show.
