Very authentic. Large and decorative interior. My favorite was the porch where we decided to sit. The food was phenomenal, almost as though I were eating an actual fish taco made in Mexico. Fresh homemade salsa and chips beforehand were a nice way to welcome us and allow us to stay awhile. However, giving us all our own salsa dish made me not find it desirable to order an appetizer. I certainly don't mind though as they get plenty of service and guests. They seem to know where to get their money. The only improvement I can see is the decorations. While the environment is comfortable, the authentic food didn't seem to match the d√©cor.
