Always delicious and interesting food. Sometimes, my friends are really confused when they receive a taco with cilantro in it instead of cheese, beans and salsa -- all smothered with sour cream.

My favorite experience was the beef tongue tacos and the tripe tacos.  The tongue was incredibly soft and tasty and the the texture of the tripe was really unique and satisfying.
