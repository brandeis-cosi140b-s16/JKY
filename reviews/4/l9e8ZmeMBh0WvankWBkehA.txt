Went here several Sundays ago for a brunch. Gotta say, LOVE love LOVE all of the decor! Think Latin American culture crossed w/gothic shit (i.e. colorful skulls and masks), plus it's before Halloween/Day of the Dead, soo you can see eery blood stained-stickers on the tequila posters in the bathroom. Love that touch!

I ordered the Hangover Burrito (even though I didn't have one). Was not disappointed! It weighed about 2.5 lbs (I swear) and looked like a toddler's leg. I pumped 3 solid meals out of the fried piece of heaven. Had everything AND MORE stuffed inside.

Service was ehhhhh. Maybe the gal was new, but just kind of felt she was bothered by our table and sort of "sneery" tude/vibe coming from her. Dunno but I still gave her decent tip.

Will be back for more fried goodness. Soon.
