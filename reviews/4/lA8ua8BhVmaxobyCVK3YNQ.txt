This was my first time here. We saw Robert Earl Keen and he was hilarious and fun. Great bar and really cool concert area. I was told they had an outdoor area too and would love to go see someone and have it be outside.

We had some good drinks and had a quesadilla as a snack. It was good bar food - not sure how you can mess up a quesadilla either.

Definitely will be back and hope its outside next time.
