I was surprised when I walked in; I had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller, and I expected only a counter, and perhaps a few tables. Pleasant surprise to be seated, with a waitress to attend.

The menu alone made my mouth water, just envisioning all the dishes.

I chose the Del Rey Torta, simply for the meat content, which is considerable, and it has egg. You can't go wrong with egg on a meat sandwich.

When the sandwich arrived, I thought perhaps my meal, and my mother's, were on the same plate; it was huge! It could easily feed a small family. Or a large chef. :)

One thing that was odd; potato chips with my torta. I suppose it was ignorant of me to think that a mexican food place would have tortilla chips, but that's what I've been conditioned to expect.
Upon reflection, potato chips are a more fitting accompaniment to a sandwich, contents of said sandwich notwithstanding.

The salsa that was served with the meal was phenomenal. Not too spicy, but a nice bite, with a slightly smoky flavor. Delicious!

The sandwich was, as the menu implies, a meat paradise, with egg. I can't recall for certain, but I believe there were 5 kinds of meat, including chorizo. You can't ever go wrong with chorizo.

The prices are very reasonable, even ridiculously low, given the volume of food.

The torta turned out to be much more than I could finish in one sitting, but I think I may have been intimidated. I will have to challenge the menu again, at a later date.

I would recommend Los Reyes to anyone seeking something non-traditional, in the Sunnyslope area. Its location on 7th street makes it equally favorably for those traveling from downtown, even on public transportation.

I will definitely be returning.
