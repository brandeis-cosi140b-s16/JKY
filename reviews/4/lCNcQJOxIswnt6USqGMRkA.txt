I was disappointed when my Mom moved to the desert food area of Whitehall. But along came the California Taco Shop with their wide assortment of tacos, tostadas, burritos and enchiladas. 

When it comes to choosing your meat, skip the generic grilled chicken. Branch out and get the carnitas or the adovada - these marinated pork chunks are delicious. If you're truly adventurous, get the lengua (tongue) or tripas (tripe). 

But the bottom line is: big burritos stuffed to the brim with flavorful and well-cooked meat, cheap prices, friendly service, casual atmosphere, spicy homemade hot sauces, crema. Yum. 

If you're unfamiliar with the Mexican dishes, they have wikipedia articles printed throughout the restaurant explaining everything from a taco to carnitas to a California Burrito.

This a casual joint that's a great addition to a bleak stretch of 51. I envision many filling cheap lunches here in my future.
