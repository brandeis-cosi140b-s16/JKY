Just ate here for the first time and it was amazing.  The meat was extremely tender with rich flavor, and the tacos are very well balanced.  Tonight i had the egg and tofu, pork, and hallowiener taco.  The hallowiener was absolutely wonderful and he is selling it for a limited time only.  i strongly recommend to anyone that would like to try something new to try this food truck.
