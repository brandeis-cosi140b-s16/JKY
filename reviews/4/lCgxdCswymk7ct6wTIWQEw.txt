I don't like big crowds, so I go to this place off hours for the food. I have been there three times, and had take out once. I enjoyed the food and never had any problems with the service.  Love their nachos and fish tacos.  I see lots of younger reviewers liking the crowds, music, and happy hour fun, but the food is good too! Of course, the service is going to be slower when the place is jammed.  We attempted to go on a Friday and it was too crowded, so chose another restaurant.  But, we still will go when we don't see the crowds, for their good food.
