My co-worker brought me here for lunch one day and it was love at first bite. Upon entering we were greeted by a distinguished older gentlemen behind the counter a smile and knod from the chef as it he was saying "you will eat good today"   I ordered the cubana and it was blown away. Layers upon layers of meat goodness between two pieces of bread. I've had tortas before but not like this. This is a whole new torta experience.

This place is great! awesome! I absolutely recommend tortas el guero.
