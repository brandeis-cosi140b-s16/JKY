Ok, didn't eat here, didn't sit at the bar here, but we did visit here to get a drink in a guitar after seeing someone on the strip carrying one. We decided to venture out to find Cabo Wabo and finally found it at Miracle Miles in PH. The decor is very tropical, but we weren't here to admire the scenery. Went to the side of the restaurant that's actually in the Miracle Miles shop and there were two girls taking drinks order. We requested the drinks in the guitar, but couldn't decide on the flavor. She gave us samples of the ones we wanted to try. Finally we decided on the drink that tastes like mango..I forgot what it's called. She puts it in a guitar and turns the guitar on which was pretty cool. The drink was $50. Now I'm not much of a drinker so I don't know if 100 oz of alcohol is worth that price...is it? Very cool experience all in all.
