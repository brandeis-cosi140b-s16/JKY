Yummy mom and pop place.  Excellent ceviche and I love ordering the molcajete.  It comes bubbling and filled to the brim with seafood goodies served in a volcanic rock container.  The chips could use a little work, but with all the plentiful Pacificos that come on out, I don't generally notice or remember by the end.
