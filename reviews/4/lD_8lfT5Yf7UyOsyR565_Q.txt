This place is very.

Very accommodating.
Every request was promptly accommodated.  "We can make very spicy or no.  As you like."

Very reasonable.  Grilled Shrimp platter 5.75.   Other great specials.

Very good.  Grilled Shrimp & Shrimp Fajitas were delicious.

Very convenient.  Just across the 10 from Tukee, north side of the street, behind the former Village Inn.

Very recommended.  Don't expect atmosphere like a fancy Mexican place at Chandler Fashion Mall, we're talking strip mall basic here, but El Ranchero definitely qualifies as YASMG.  (Yet Another Strip Mall Gem) *copyleft Sean M, Boston Yelp.
