Fast, friendly service despite it being a bit tricky to get into their drive-through the way it's set up. This Del Taco is inside of a Circle K, sort of attached, if you will.  This one is on my way home and on Tuesday nights, we take advantage of Taco Tuesdays, where their tacos are 3 for $1 and bean and cheese burritos are 50 cents. Great cheap meal and delicious as well.
