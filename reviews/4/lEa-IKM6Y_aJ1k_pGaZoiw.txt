OK. So I'm not giving this Filiberto's five stars simply because it's a Filiberto's. But I'm giving it four stars because (after two visits) it seems to be consistent, clean and pretty damn awesome.

After numerous disappointing visits to other valley Filiberto's because of gross amounts of meat in my country burritos and incorrect orders, I decided to give this location a try because I recently started working nearby. I'm diggin it.

The country burritos are near-perfect and the hot sauce is always fresh. It's always well-staffed, too.

BONUS: They have different 99 cent specials every day of the week, and you can choose any of them on Friday!

I'm still going to remain skeptical of most other Filiberto's locations, but I'd say this one is going to see my at least twice / week for a while (for better or worse). I need my hot sauce fix! What can I say?
