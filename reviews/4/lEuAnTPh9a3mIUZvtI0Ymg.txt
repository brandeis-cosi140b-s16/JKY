It's a restaurant, it's a bakery, it's a market, it's Laaaa Tolteca! 

This place is fun, the restaurant has been around for years and the quality of food is still solid. The dishes are mainly authentic, you order at the counter and seat yourself in a huge dining room. It is not always the cleanest place but it is easy to find a table. I love the salsa bar, so many choices and pickled veggies. I love anything pollo grilled, and the carne asada (yes not the best in town) is flavorful and juicy. 

Grab a horchata, order your meal and go by some dirt cheap pastries while you wait.
