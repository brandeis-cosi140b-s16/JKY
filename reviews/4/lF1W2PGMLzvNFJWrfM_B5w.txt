Tacos de carne asada were very good, carnitas was very good as well but the al pastor was lacking in flavor. I liked the orange'ish salsa they had to go on the tacos and my son liked the rice as well.

One of my complaints with this type of place is always having the TV blasting Mexican soap operas while I'm trying to eat. Give it a rest.
