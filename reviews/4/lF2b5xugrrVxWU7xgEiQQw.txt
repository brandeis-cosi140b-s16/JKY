So delicious and the owner and his son couldn't be more delightful.  While it clearly is a dive atmosphere, the food is of a very fine quality.  I had the enchiladas which were delicious and, in particular, the pureed beans were especially good.  My daughter had her go to bean and cheese burrito which again was done flawlessly.  This is a great little restaurant with friendly and talented service.
