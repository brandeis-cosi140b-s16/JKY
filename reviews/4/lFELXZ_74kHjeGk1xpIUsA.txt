In terms of Taco Bell's go this is the best one to go to when in south Phoenix. I've been here multiple times and they've never had my order wrong. I'd say in comparison to other Taco Bells this one has above average service with generally friendly and welcoming staff. As well the store is kept clean and presentable. Food is prepared correctly and is on par with other Taco Bells.

I wouldn't write a review about a fast food chain unless I feel they genuinely deserved it.

Note: This review is in comparison to other Taco Bells. In the end you still get what you pay for!
