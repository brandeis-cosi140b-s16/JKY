Muy delicioso! I've driven thru several times and each visit has left me happier than the last. 

Brushfire offers a wide selection of tacos, each with specialized toppings. I swoon for the adobado pork, which includes juicy bits of pineapple, spicy peppers, and cotija cheese in a flour tortilla. If you want corn tortillas instead, ask. 

Other tacos include chicken, carne asada, shrimp, and veggie, which has roasted peppers, red potatoes, mushrooms, and other bits. Tacos can also be upgraded to burritos, bowls, or added to a flight. 

Flights include your entree, fresh chips and your choice of five fresh salsas, a tapas and drink...and they not only have coke zero, they also have decent unsweetened iced tea. 

Tapas options seem smaller recently, but are still crunchy bliss. I love the shrimp, like the croquetas and empanadas, and haven't tried the roasted potatoes. 

Service is speedy and super friendly. This is a eat in the car sort of place, so ask for extra napkins and just relax. You may just want to drive thru again for churros or flan.
