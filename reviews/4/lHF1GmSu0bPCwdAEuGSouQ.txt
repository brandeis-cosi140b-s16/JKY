We came after searching for good Mariscos. We went to a few places in the Maryvale area, but since it's Friday they all had loud Banda groups playing. We came here as our last resort before going to buy pizza and go home. We were pleasantly surprised. There was no loud music, the staff was friendly, and we were able to enjoy our date night.
