Yolos you get 4 Stars. You can only get the 5th star once you give Free chips and Salsa!! The Salsa selection though NICE!! 
Out first night in Vegas and we can here. It was about 7:45 or so and the place was pretty full. We didn't have a reservation but were told it would be a 20 minute wait to be sat. No big deal. We saw two spots open up at the bar so we jumped in there! 
It took a while for us to get service, but i can let that slide a bit when a place is busy. After getting service i was impressed =) 
I ordered up some Chicken Fajitas and well those were the best i have had! Lots of chicken, lots of peppers. It came with some black beans and rice which were also very good. The GF selected the chicken Enchiladas and she said they were on the yummy side as well. 
From sitting at the bar, the restaurant its self looked cool, but i never made it inside.
