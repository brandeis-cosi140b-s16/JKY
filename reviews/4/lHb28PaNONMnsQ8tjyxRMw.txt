The double order of El Paso taquitos will be the highlight of your day. Crisp yet saturated in sauce, messy  by the end of the meal but on point in flavor.

The barbacoa, on either a burrito or a taco, will make you miss home. Throw on some cilantro and onions from the salsa bar before you take it to go and try not to cry as you eat: not only is it perfectly soft, it's also full of flavor, unlike other places.

Surprise menu hit: the turkey neck! Ordered it as a torta but my order was received wrong as a "side" in a taco, but the cut of meat is still perfectly flavorful and fatty and fried fresh.  Probably best as a torta, will have to order it again.

 For the reviewer who said it's inauthentic to use yellow cheese: we're talking about  hood border food, not the meal you got while at a resort in Cancun, don't let the door hit you on the way out!
