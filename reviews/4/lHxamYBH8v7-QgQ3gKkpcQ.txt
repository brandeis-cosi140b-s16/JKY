This is the place for tacos, only $1 during happy hour, $2 other times. We arrived around 6:55 PM. There were only a few patrons in the place. It took the waitress a few minutes to come take or order.  She did not give us a chance to give our food order after she took the drink order, 1 Sangria and  3 waters. It was after 7: 00 by the time she came back with the drinks, too late for Happy Hour prices. Most of the tacos were gluten free. Although the tacos were small, they had ample filling.  Our party of 4 tried 5 - 6 tacos each: Carne Asada, Grilled Fish, Crispy Fish,  Fried Calamari, Chorizo & Potato, and Carnitas.  All were delicious, only the Calamari would not be ordered again.  The 4 states rating is for the food only.
