I must say, while this place is small, the good is great.  The menu is paper and thrown away after your order is taken.  I guess it's the experience, but seems to be a little wasteful.  On with the food, it was great.

I started with the Posole soup, which was rich in pork, spicy and definitely filling.  The soup is served on top of a tortilla which was a great addition.  I didn't have too much knowing I still had my main course ahead.  The cabbage and radish were great neutralizers of the spice.

For the main dish, I had the Pork Chop Chorizo.  The pork chop was tender, juicy and well prepared.  The mango chutney sauce added complimented the pork very well.  Not much to say about the chorizo between the two slabs of chop.  I only went directly for the chorizo by itself once, because it tasted better in conjunction with the pork itself.  The side of veggies were grilled to perfection.  I totally forgot what the green chile potato (GCP) was and boy did I miss it.  I didn't finish it, but thoroughly enjoyed it as I was eating it.
