Chips & Salsa: mmm mmm mmm! It was pretty fantastic, and the fact that we got a bean deep with it was a very nice surprise! The salsa was some of the best salsa I have had with a good amount of kick but certainly nothing overwhelming!

Service: Friendly, a good amount of checking in and recommendations on the menu. The first time I visited our waitress was a treat, second time our waitress was fine... but both times a manager stopped over to check in on us. I just felt very taken care of at the Family Restaurant! 

Food: I've had the same things both times! I wish I could remember what it was actually called but it is 2 enchilada type things (with your choice of pollo or carne) and topped with this amazing Jalapeno Cream Cheese sauce... honestly if they could just put a plate of that cream cheese, a little bit of chicken, and some chips - it would pretty much be the greatest dish ever! (Good Idea to try out next time!!)
