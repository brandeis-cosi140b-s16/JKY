Went tonight and did enjoy the food. There was a homeless guy in the parking lot offering to clean windshield. He had the best spots coned off so he could work. I think it was some sort of valet, but I refused to give him my keys, and since he didn't speak English, he couldn't complain. 
All respect to the previous reviewer, Callie R, I don't want to disagree with you but..... I did get shot. It's ok he only winged me and the gun was a piece of crap. Plus, the manager did buy me a free margarita to make up for it so I will be back as soon as I get the stitches out. Oh, the ice cream was good.
