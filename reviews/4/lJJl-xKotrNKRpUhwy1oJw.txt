I'm docking a star only because they can be a little slow getting the food out. Overall, this place is a beacon of hope in the sea of wannabes that is the Mexican restaurant landscape of Charlotte. 

I can't believe I've only seen one mention of the sopes. Holy crap, that's the main reason I keep coming back!!!! I dream of their sopes. Okay, maybe not. But they're amazing. And the salsas? I could probably drink every single one. Though, I'm the biggest fan of the dark red one. It's super spicy. But really, they're all a little spicy. Sensitive tongues need not apply. 

Their store front is pretty nondescript. You would drive right by it if you didn't know any better. Inside is small with probably about 8-10 tables total. And, if you don't speak Spanish, you may want to brush up a little or bring a friend who does. :)
