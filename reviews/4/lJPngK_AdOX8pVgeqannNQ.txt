Living just a half mile away for the past few years, I really had no excuse to avoiding Mi Patio for so long. I tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method. While I still stick to this mothodology, its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity. I mean, you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty, meaty, and full of carbs.

Mi Patio was just the spot. We ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos; chicken and beef. After filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos, we couldn't even begin to eat the chimi. While my expectations for a next day chimichanga wasn't so high up there, it was actually still good the next day. I imagine that it would have been all the better had I eaten it fresh from the kitchen. Maybe next time ill go light on the chips. Ive heard their $1.75 margaritas a decent; however, I cannot personally attest to this. At $1.75 it can't hurt to give it a try though. 

Either way you slice it, Mi Patio is a solid choice for your Mexican delights.
