What a way to start a visit to Vegas!  My sis and I chose Hussongs Cantina for lunch before our shopping marathon.  We needed good food and my Frankenfoot needed the margarita.  The have 2 showcased margarita's - their original is handmade from top to bottom so that's the one we opted for.  It was strong & delicious.

We both ordered the lobster tacos for lunch and started with an order of handmade guacamole.  The guacomole was good and their chips are thick - almost like pita chips crossed with flour tortilla chips.  But that made them nice and sturdy for the guac :)

The lobster tacos were a bit stingy with the lobster.  And they were those Langostino lobsters that are kind of like the midgets of the lobster world.  But the creamy Mexican cheese on top made the flavors delicious.  And we both ate our 2 tacos with smiles on our faces.  

We sat at a tall table in the bar and our bartender/waitresss, Cheri, was great.  Everyone was really friendly and the atmosphere was fun.  My only complaint (other than the stingy lobster) was that the hostess walked pretty fast for someone following her on crutches...  That didn't seem too cool.  But the marg's and food were just what the doctor ordered!  ;)
