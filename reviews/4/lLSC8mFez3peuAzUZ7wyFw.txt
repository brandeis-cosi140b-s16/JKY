Giving a chain 4 stars??? A taco place??? Fast food??? Really???

Well, yes. Why not? I only get items that I've tried and tested: chicken chimichanga, chicken taco salad, carne Asada quesadilla and horchata.

It's a convenient place to get food from. Next to a gas station by my gym. They're open 24hrs and they have a drive-thru. The food is inexpensive. 

When I think of Mexican food, I think about lard, salty fried fatty food, sour cream and mushy beans. But you don't necessarily need to get all that if you don't want to. I'm very specific with my order (no beans, no sour cream, with guacamole) and they've never screwed up my order. The chicken pieces in the taco salad are huuuuge and juicy. They don't skimp on the protein here.

I'm not a fan of soda or sugary drinks but every once in a while, I do crave for some horchata. I trick my lactose-intolerant self to think it's kind of like cinnamon-y milk.
