I'm not sure if it's been redone recently, but the inside of this del taco looks nice! The only downside is that you have to get the workers to unlock the bathrooms, but they have a button at the counter, so it's not a big deal. I don't think I've ever had any issue with my order being wrong. I forget if they do it at this location, but often in the drive-thru, the workers will tell you what's in the bag as they hand it to you, which is nice, since it seems to improve the accuracy of the order.
