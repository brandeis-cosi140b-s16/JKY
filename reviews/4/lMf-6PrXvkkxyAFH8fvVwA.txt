Great value, excellent food, mediocre service.  Don't expect the staff to go out of their way to make you feel like a valued customer, but Senor Taco is a great casual stop-in when you crave simply made, but very tasty Mexican food!  I don't know how they do it, but, from their fish tacos to their tostadas, their rolled tacos to their authentic chilaquiles and their limited salsa bar with spicy carrots on tap, all the food at Senor Taco is very good and made with honestly fresh ingredients at a price that won't sink your wallet-ship!  Nice menu selection...something for all tastes.  Overall, a far better value than the many generic 'bertos eateries (Filibertos, Erikbertos, Polibertos, Losbertos, etc) in the area.  Inside seating is a bit cramped, but they have a nice covered patio area that lets you unwind while you eat.  Solid 4 out of 5!
