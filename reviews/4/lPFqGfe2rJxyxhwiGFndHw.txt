I come here more for the atmosphere than the food, although the food is very good...but Wahoo's reminds me of a Pacific Beach taco shack, complete with the surf and skate decor. And of course I can't resist the piped in music-  80's and 90's new wave and punk: The Smiths, English Beat, Peter Murphy, and the Pixies, to name a few. Love it! Try the shrimp tacos, black beans, and seasoned rice...
