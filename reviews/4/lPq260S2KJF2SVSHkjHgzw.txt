Stopped in with my brother and wife. I had the Anasazi Chorizo burrito dinner. It was excellent as were the black beans and rice served as sides. The chips and salsa are excellent as well. I haven't had any of the Tequilas there but there's an entire menu for them if you're so inclined. I've been twice and would go again.
