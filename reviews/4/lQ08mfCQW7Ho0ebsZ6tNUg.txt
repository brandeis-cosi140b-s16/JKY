We have ordered Pickup on several occasions and have thoroughly enjoyed both the quality and portions of every item ordered. The wife says their cheese enchiladas are second to none and my favorite is their beef burro and taco combos. The only issue I have is in the order process. We always seem to receive the incorrect items ordered and have to return them or call them with our disappointment. Thank goodness we only reside a few blocks from them. I have since taken the time to go through the bag and check everything out upon arrival for pickup. Embarrassing, but necessary. Still worth the trouble!  Yum. Just worked up an desire to order lunch from this place.
