I would give it 5, but the quality/style changes depending on who works.  

I like to get either a rice bowl or a burrito.
The meats we choose are Carnitas, Al Pastor, Lengua.
They also have a delicious vegetarian mushroom type option I get if I am not feeling up to anything at all greasy.

I love the steamed corn.  They have a Mexican version I haven't tried with mayonnaise and cheese, but  I just don't want to know if I like anything that adds the calories up even more.

Good and Bad:    The tortilla is good quality, large, and the burrito is plentiful.
I have to ask for it the way I like.  Cheese melted on it first then the other ingredients.  if you don't ask it may come a different way each time.

Issues:  I have gotten Lengua 3 times.  Once was lean and perfect.  Two other times it seemed almost like the skin was left on or it was way overcooked with chewy tough edges and was inedible.  I had to pull the meat out.  So, I just don't order this anymore.  Not worth the chance of receiving the bad version.  I guess you could ask to taste it before they add it.

The carnitas is different depending on who works too.  Sometimes it is GREAT meaty bits with a delicious flavor and other times it includes large globs of FAT with NO MEAT attached.  I mean come on.  Totally gross and puts you off the food.  Now I try to ask for lean.  Didn't seem to make a difference last time.  Had to pull the fat out of a burrito.  So now I have been ordering it as a rice bowl more often to make it easier.  Very very sad that I have to even think about this.

The Al pastor has been good each time.  It is best when they cut it up into smaller pieces.  

All the other items are good quality.  I never see any old looking items or even avocado that has turned colors even.  Nice job.  Let's work on the meat consistency and trim the fat off please.  
I love the fresh bar with cucumbers, peppers, and all the salsa choices.  Yummy.
