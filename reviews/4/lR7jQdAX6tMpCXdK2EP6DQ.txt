This place is legit. Don't expect much from the area or the neighborhood. But when you go in the staff is courteous and the place is clean. 
I was just driving wanting to try something new. I had passed this place several times. But what caught my eye was the painted sign on the window "Birria de Chivo" and Menudo served all week. Wow, most places only serve menudo on weekends. I pulled into the lot and decided to look them up in Yelp to see what if anything others had experienced. Looked good. 

I ordered 2 days worth of food. The torta de carne asada, and the birria de chivo (shreaded goat meat in a lightly seasoned broth) and a large horchata. She asked if I wanted the torta meal with beans and rice  or just the torta. I replied just the torta. She also provided me with a small sandwich style container for putting in veggies from the salsa bar and said if i needed another to just ask. I helped myself to the fresh sliced cucumbers, radishes, cabbage, wedges of key lime and pickled onions on the bar and filled a few small cups of salsa. The red was spicy with a vinegar base. The green was quite tasty as was the pico de gallo. 
The birria came with corn tortillas and small containers of fresh onion and cilantro. Again this was served as a caldo (sans veggies) but that is what you toss in the onions, cilantro, lime juice and some salsa. Yum! 

The torta was huge. Warning it doesn't come dressed. I was expecting the mayo, avocado, tomato to already be on this. But luckily I had picked up all the fixings at the salsa bar to make it work. And boy did it work. The pickled onions, cabbage, pico, avocado crema, salsa verde....Mmmm....
