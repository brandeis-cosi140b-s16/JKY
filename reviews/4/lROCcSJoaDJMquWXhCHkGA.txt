My husband and I are fans of this place...  for what it's meant to be: a food truck, family owned/operated, in South Phoenix, serving typical mexican dishes, but mostly known for their Birria, it is pretty good.  

ALL of the clientele is local Mexican families ....and all your utensils are cheap plastic.. parking is a dirt lot... the plastic tables may have some flies abuzzing around.. cash only... Spanish only...  but their Birria is damn good and all their toppings (cilantro, onions, home made corn tortillas) are tasty and look fresh/clean.

The two guys that take your order are welcoming, quick, and get the job done.  The food comes out quick, hot, and tasty.... never had a complaint about the food being too much bones or too much fat or not enough this or that... and even better, I've never gotten sick from eating here!  That's gotta mean something, right?

oh yeah, had their huevos rancheros and their avocado was fresh and their beans were yummy... okay, I'm ready to eat this again....
