Richardson's may be one of New Mexico's best-kept secrets -- so well kept it's improbably located in a Phoenix, AZ strip mall. The place feels so authentic it's like you're dining in an Anasazi cliff pueblo on a desert night. YEAH -- it's like that. Get some of that extra-spicy green chile if you want to have a good cry. The place is small and often packed (and its clientele is understandably enthusiastic), but if southwest cuisine is your bag, it's well worth the trip and any wait for a table.
