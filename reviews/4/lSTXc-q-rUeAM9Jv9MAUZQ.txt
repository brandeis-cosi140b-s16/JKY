This is my son's all time fav!! I got the carnitas burrito. Although I'm sooo to the tacqueria burritos from the "la mission" district in the Bay Area, ok this will do for now. I've been to chipotle in Elk Grove, CA, I guess I'm spoiled & just a Cali girl@heart! LOL Place wasn't as packed & busy, that's a good thing. So for the place & location, I couldn't ask for more & just am grateful for finding this place on route home. Thank u smooches
