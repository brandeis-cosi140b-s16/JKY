Cheap, Filling and reasonably healthy. A welcome change to the deep fried gluttonous offerings mostly found in the strip vicinity. 

Its a good place to pop in for fast healthy food and a Cerveza Pac√≠fico Clara. A very filling bean burrito with a myriad of toppings, including guacamole is under $10 and cannot possibly be finished (by me anyways). 

Bonus Star for Chipotle's commitment to organics, sustainable farming and environmental concerns. They also handed me my burrito in one wrap and basket, without additional packaging (like the Earl of Sandwich's plastic-in-plastic-in-plastic-bag-horrer)

Lots of Tabasco sauce variety for you to sprinkle on to taste.

Excellent choice for a quick bite when strip-locked.
