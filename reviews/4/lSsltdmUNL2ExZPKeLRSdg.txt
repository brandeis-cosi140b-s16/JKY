We were recently at the downtown location on a Saturday night. I couldn't believe the place was almost empty. My friend and I shared a appetizer which had quesadilla's and flauta's as well as a few other things. Delicious. Plus the strawberry margarita's were fantastic.  We sat at the bar and while the service was good, my friend and I felt the bartender was a bit pushy/arrogant/creepy. It's the only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars. But, I would definitely go back!
