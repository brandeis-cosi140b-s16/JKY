I was hungry and in the area during lunchtime.  After a quick search on the Yelp app, I found this place.  It's a dive Mexican joint offering street Tacos and Burritos.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the Prize Claw machine....these things are everywhere now, what's the deal with that?  Anyway, back to the food....since I'm rarely in this area I decided to try a couple of items:

Bean & Cheese Burrito, $3.75

The Bean & Cheese Burrito was very good.  The Tortilla & Beans tasted fresh and was not greasy.  The Tacos were simple street Tacos....Carne Asada Steak, Cilantro, Onions, Corn Tortillas....these were very good as well.

Overall, it's a pretty good Mexican food joint....wish it was closer to my neighborhood.
