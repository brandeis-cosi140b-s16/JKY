Senor Taco is a cozy little place, and very clean. The ambiance is nice, and the employees are friendly.

My friend and I arrived at just the right time, because minutes after our arrival there were like 3 or 4 families that walked through the door. (I noticed that none of them waiting long to receive their order.)

I ordered combo #14: Two chicken flautas. It came with rice and beans, but no drink. I thought it was very tasty, especially after dressing it with salsa from their salsa bar. I was also pleased to see carrots that have been soaked in jalapeno juice. Moreover, their flour tortillas didn't taste like crappy store-bought tortillas that are full of preservatives. Still, they didn't completely taste homemade.

If you're looking for fast food Mexican that isn't crappy like Taco Hell or Jack in the Crack, I recommend giving Senor Taco a try!
