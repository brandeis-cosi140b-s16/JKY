You know what?  This is a great neigborhood bar with decent food.  Not a fine dining establishment.  So love it for what it is.  Very good drinks - and have 'em in the bar....forget the dining room - mix with the regulars.

Have some nachos, or a burrito.  But realize you're there for fun, not for 5 stars.  The beer's cold, the margs are smooth and the help, with one exception are pretty damn nice. (one's a little pushy going for extra sales)

So why only 4 stars?  Because it's not and never will be, a 5 star place.  Go there to relax and enjoy and meet all the trades guys (who knows, you may find a guy that can fix your sink) and the neighbors.  If I owned a place, I'd want it to be just like this!
