#3 Tia Rosa's has fresh hand made tortillas and an amazing atmosphere.. Feels like you pulled up to a fancy joint south of the border. You can tell that the owners spent some money putting this place together..The food is outstanding here and there are some very creative dishes..  If you are looking for a Mexican joint that will impress your business friends, then Tia's is the Mexican palace-restaurant that I would recommend..  Unfortunately the palace is a little too pricey and the service is not worth writing about..  That is why poor Tia is #3 on my list
