Was visting Vegas and wanted real Mexican food which is really hard to find in Hawaii. The reviews that this place was featured on dirty dines did not deter me - I was going to eat real Mexican food. I had the burrito enchilada combo and it was 100% amazing. There was so much food that I had it as a second lunch on the plane a few hours later. I wish I had access to cheap, good Mexican food!
