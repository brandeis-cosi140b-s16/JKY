I recently visited Maria, Maria for the first time and had a great experience. The food on the menu was a bit pricier that I had imagined, and I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a lunch menu. However, the chips and salsa were fantastic. I was brought three different types of salsa, the Maria, Maria salsa (mild), a tomatillo based salsa (spicy) and a smoky flavored salsa (hot). All three were delicious, and the Maria, Maria salsa was brought to me in a bowl as opposed to a ramekin which was great since I tend to go through a lot of salsa. My friend and I ordered the nachos and guacamole to split off the appetizer menu. The onions on the nachos were too sweet for my taste, but the chicken on top was great, and I liked that the black beans and cheese were actually baked on the chips instead of sloppily loaded on top. The guacamole was fantastic, and would be perfect for three people to share. The music and low light was very relaxing, but I would definitely advise against bringing kids. Screaming and crying will definitely ruin the experience for other diners. The service was fantastic, and our server seemed very knowledgeable about the menu. I look forward to going back to Maria, Maria and hope that their margaritas are as good as their salsa and guacamole.
