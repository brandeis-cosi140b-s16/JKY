I've had to come out to Golden Nugget several times for work, and Cadillac to Go is consistently fast, filling, and friendly.  

I'm always in a rush at breakfast because I can't be bothered to get out of bed or out the door as early as I should.  Cadillac to Go whips out fresh, delicious breakfast burritos in less than 10 minutes.  

Lunch is just as quick!  I love their chicken avocado wrap.  Everything is cooked and seasoned just right, and chopped nice and small.  No awkward burrito moments when you bite into it and pull out an entire wing or something.  Awkward burrito moments are the worst, right?  And you won't experience one at Cadillac to Go.  Trust me, I'm as awkward as they come.  Enjoy!
