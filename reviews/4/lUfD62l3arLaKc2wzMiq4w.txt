This place is HUGE. It's like a small Mexican village, complete with volleyball courts, cornhole, patio areas, dance floors, and a kitchen and multiple bar areas. It was a really cool, laidback vibe going on.

They had buckets of Pacifico for 6/$18; not a bad deal. One of our group had a sandwich of some sort and it was apparently pretty good, 'cause he ate the whole thing. Our server was really chill, cracking jokes, and was attentive. 

We played some volleyball, got down on the dance floor for a little while, and spent a fun Saturday night at Salty. It was a really nice change from the Scottsdale scene I'm trapped in.

The only thing I'd change is the DJ; they kept playing full 4 minute songs, mostly 2000s rap/hip-hop, and nothing that was on the charts right now... I felt like I was back at high school homecoming. They didn't have anything my friend requested either.
