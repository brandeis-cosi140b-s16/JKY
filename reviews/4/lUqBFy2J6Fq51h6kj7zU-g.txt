Good food for a really good price. My coworkers and I went here for lunch this past Friday and really enjoyed it. 

The service was really nice and offered a lot of suggestions, our server was Enriquee, I recommend him. 

The food was pretty good, I got the shrimp burrito and was surprised at how good it actually was. Their lunch specials looked like a good deal, since you get a main course with sides. For q group of five of us it was only $37 so pricewise, it was a good deal.
