After an intense Sonoran hot dog craving, I decided to hop onto Yelp and came across this little gem of a place.  I rallied up my friend and we set out on an adventure for an early-dinner Mexican food quest!

My friend had actually been here before.  He use to work in the area so he knows all the great spots on Arizona Ave.  With the great Yelp reviews and my friend's word, I was really pumped up!  I got myself a horchata, a Sonoran dog, and a Moreno's burrito [AKA a "wet burrito," with carne asada filling and enchilada sauce poured on top].  He had an agua de jamaica, a Sonoran dog, and a carne asada torta.  After polishing off a delicious Sonoran dog, I couldn't even look at my burrito!  I took a few bites of the fluffy rice, the smooth beans, and the flavorful yet kinda tough burrito and I was full.  I think I should have took the advice of another Yelper and ordered two Sonorans and called it a night.  That food coma is hitting hard!  My friend said the bread on his torta was a bit dry but he still took his food home so I think that's a good indicator.  Also, don't forget to stop off at their small little salsa bar.  Their green guacamole sauce is great!

Anyways, there are limited parking and limited indoor seating so I can see how the place can become packed fast!  Service is superb and it's always nice to see such friendly and welcoming wait staff --- she really sold those hot dogs!  Portions are also huge and I really could have just split a torta with my buddy.  Anyways, upon reflection and a few more bites of my now cold burrito, I think I found a new favorite place in the east valley for Mexican.  I will definitely be back for the Sonoran dog and their horchata.  Yum!
