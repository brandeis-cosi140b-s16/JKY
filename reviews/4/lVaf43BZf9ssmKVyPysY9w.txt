This place is super cute and the food is great too!  Our server was very friendly and she was attentive even though she was the hostess/waitress/bartender/busser all in one.  First off - the salsa is authentic and reminds me of my family's salsa.  It is somewhat mild, but with just enough kick for everyone to enjoy.  The Margaritas are AWESOME!  They are made with hand squeezed juices and good tequila.  I had a regular lime rita, but my friends had strawberry blended ritas and they were also superb.
For dinner I ordered a "Burro" (burrito) with their signature tiopancho pork.  The pork is to die for - it's super tender and flavorful with whatever they marinade it in.  I couldn't stop eating it.  One of my friends got a tiopancho pork chimichanga which she said was awesome, and my other friend got carne asada and bean burrito with a side of rice.  The rice is a saffron rice, I really liked it.  It's subtle, but a great addition to the meal.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living or visiting the area.  

2 thumbs up!  I would like to taste their breakfast items and pozole before giving 5 stars, but it is very close to 5 stars based solely on the margaritas!
