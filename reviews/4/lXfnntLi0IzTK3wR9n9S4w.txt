So if you're into a little more upscale Mexican food this place is a good choice. There's two location, and I've been to both. The Dilworth location in Charlotte is by far better. The food presentation has more thought behind it, and the ambiance is all together nicer. You feel less rushed at this location and it's the original one. So if choosing between the two places ... go to this one first. 

As for my meal at Cantina 1511, I ordered the Salmon al Pastor. This is a nice sized piece of pan seared salmon with an achiote and lime flavoring. It is garnished with roasted pineapple, and is placed over black beans on top of a fried tostada with pico de gallo salsa thrown into the mix. Also, on the very top of the dish there are two giant green grilled scallion bulbs garnishing the masterpiece. The dish goes for $16 and is excellent. 

Warm chips and salsa come with the meal, and if you're lucky you'll get an amazing waiter just like we had. The server was so attentive ... it was almost comical how speedy fast he was. I loved it because it added to the whole experience. 

All in all, I have nothing but good things to say about this location and meal. 

NOW BEWARE: Parking is a bit tough on a busy night so keep this in mind. I parked in the lot next store. AND, if you're on a budget and are looking for a "super inexpensive" Mexican meal this may not be your place. Cantina is more upscale and the prices are not dirt cheap so remember that before choosing this location for anyone on a budget. Other than that - I hope you enjoy!

BTW: if you're wondering why only "4" stars out of "5" it because the meal was really good but not "knock my socks off amazing" for the price. It's totally a place worth going but I keep my "5 star" ratings for only places that I craze days, weeks and months after dining there.
