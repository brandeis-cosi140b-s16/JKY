I like coming to this place. It's bright inside with good amount of seats. Has a couple TVs and Bar. I've only orders the Carna Asada burrito. They give you chips for free which is nice and they have a good salsa bar. The salsas are good I just wished it was a little bit more tasty and different. The music just kills me I know it's a Mexican place so they put Spanish songs or whatever but I just don't like it while I'm trying to enjoy my meal. They can put some Instrumental music or something like that from the Spanish country. Also the workers are very bad with customer service. Not one time do they ask you anything which is very bad. That's why it's a 4 star.
