love, love, love the strips and cheese.  i have also had catering from here, very affordable. everyone loved the food! the potato tacos were a hit. and everyone loved the bean burritos. if you are ever having a get together and want to get mexican food for everyone without emptying your wallet, i would recommend getting catering to go from here. Yum!!
