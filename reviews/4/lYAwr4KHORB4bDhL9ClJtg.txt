I've lived here for 30+ years and just recently tried this establishment. I have driven past here for years and even lived down the street and never made it in. 
WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!! I WISH I would have gone in here sooner! The food was amazing. I ordered the Poco Pollo. So good and the jalepeno cream sauce was perfect. Not too over powering to take away from the flavor of the food and not too wimpy to make me think it was sour cream. 

Will definitely be going back. This is my new favorite mexican restaurant!
