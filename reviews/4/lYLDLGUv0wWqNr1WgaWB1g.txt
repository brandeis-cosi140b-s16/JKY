I've lived in Silverado Ranch for a long time, and I'm constantly hunting for a good Mexican restaurant. This place recently opened in the Doc Holliday's across from Michael's. My family checked it out, really liked it, and then took me there last night. It's really, really good food! Very authentic Mexican food with huge portions, and ridiculously cheap. I had a 3 taco combo (2 chicken and 1 carne asada), it came with rice and beans and was way more than anyone should eat in one sitting. It was $6! For 3 of us, dinner was $23. You absolutely cannot find food like this anywhere else in Silverado Ranch.

My dad chatted with the owner, and the place is family owned and operated. It's a sweet family, and they put their blood, sweat, and tears into the place. They've got it painted and spruced up really nice. It's clean and cozy inside. 

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because its new and they're still getting started. I'd really like to see this place do well, so I can keep going back!
