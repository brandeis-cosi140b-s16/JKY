The green chile chimi is by far my favorite thing here.  The salsa is a work in progress and they are asking for feedback to make it better (which hat tip to them for doing so and listening to their customer)  The drive thru is a little slow, and when I got home I got a Fajita chimi when I ordered a Green Chile one, but I will not slam them for that here - would be stupid since the food is so good, my only suggestion would be to make sure and not turn into a McDonalds where every drive thru order is wrong - maybe double check and go over again with person while in car?  Who knows, but I would suggest giving this place a try .. really good so far based on what I have had.
