If you love your "Mexican" food overflowing with cheese and sour cream then this is the place for you. The service was quite possibly the best that I have ever had and the food came out promptly and was delicious. The dining room is a throwback to 2001 with Dbacks championship memorabilia taking up most of the space. Eat here, just not too often or you'll get really fat.
