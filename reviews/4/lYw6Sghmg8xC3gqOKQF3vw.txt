So Went to Modern Margarita twice in the past week mostly highs with one big drawback.  Here is the way I see it.  I defintly will be back because the tacos and margaritas are outstanding.  The carne asada tacos is incredible and the ghost pepper sauce is just wonderful.  My compliments to the chef on a job well done. 

A few things I recommend though however.

Granted I get it, it has been 115 degrees outside Fix the Darn Air Conditioning or discount the bill,  Do Not EVER tell a customer well you can go sit outside under the misters.  When its 115 outside and your ac is not working correctly do you really think the customer wants to sit outside in the humid heat either.  Your a female manager learn some Customer Service skills that is not how you take care of your guests.   Pick up a phone and call HVAC repairman, dont make customers suffer, it hurts your bottom dollar when you do.  

The only thing I reccomend about the food is that there is more of it and more of a variety.  Maybe like a combo platter of tacos during lunch 1 shrimp, 1 chicken, 1 pork and 1 carne asada.  Sometimes I bring people in and they want to see which they like best.  Instead of ordering mutiple orders you guys should look into that.  

If it had not been for the AC being down on our visit for a business lunch I would have given 5 stars.
