We were pleasantly surprised at how good our meal here was!  Great Server, too...very attentive and even brought us a free dessert Fried Ice Cream because it was our first time there!  Now that's how you should treat customers!  We loved the chips and the bean dip.  Their kids menu is awesome and had something to please each of my 3 picky eaters.  I had the pollo fundido  which was delicious and my husband had the fajita style chicken chimichanga and he loved it!  We will definitely be back!  The only reason I didn't give them all 5 stars was due to our table being old looking and very unstable (wobbly).  This is really a minor thing, but nice furniture always adds to the ambience of a restaraunt.  The most important things, the food and service, get very high marks from me!
