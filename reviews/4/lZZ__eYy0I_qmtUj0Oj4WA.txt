Once again I'm writing as I eat..
  Chips and salsa while waiting for my order, I added a side of guacamole and sour cream..Cops are good but the salsa, sour cream and guacamole are watery but decently flavored.
  Hard shell shredded beef taco- needed work..the shell is bad and the meat was not shredded nearly enough
  Wet Chili Colorado burrito is a treat...very good
  Rice is very good
  Beans are good
  Service is good

All in all, I like it and I well be back
