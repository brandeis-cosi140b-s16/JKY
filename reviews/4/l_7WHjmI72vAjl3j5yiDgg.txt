Finally decided to try Tortas Paquime. I did not realize how much business this place does. All of the tables inside were occupied when we arrived and there was a steady flow of people the whole time we were there. I ordered the twin burritos (1 green chile beef and 1 shredded pork with no guac), as well as the super nachos with carne asada (guac on the side) to share with my boyfriend. The twin burritos look like four because they are cut in half on the plate, but they are skinny so it's manageable. I really liked the green chile beef. The shredded pork was ok, but I wasn't a fan of whatever smoky spices are used in the meat. I added some salsa verde to help out the flavor. The nachos were great! Yummy meat, nacho cheese, and beans with sour cream on tortilla chips. Mmm mm! Simple and delicious. This little restaurant also has Mexican pastries and ice cream. I'm pretty sure we'll be back.
