Loved the hand made tortilla on my burrito, they crisped it very nicely and the salsa was good! I am now going to add this as a frequent place to order  food with nice tables inside and out, and great prices! I had the breakfast burrito and 2 beef tacos and bean and cheese burrito ( with lots of extras) and the bill did not even cap $13.00! Nice staff, and good service..I am happy to find this place and would reccomend it. They only have been open 2 weeks at this location,  and I hope to see them prosper here! Bienvenidos!
