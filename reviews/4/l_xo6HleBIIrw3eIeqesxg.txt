I'm new to the area and I eat at chipotle all the time, but this one has obnoxious employees... Kind of takes away from the vibe of choppltle.. The only one who was normal was the cashier. I mean is there a manger around? Lol, food is still bomb, but I will probably go to different I e from now. It's u fortunate that it's so close to my house though.
