Really great personal service. Great tamales! Carlos said they were his grandmother's recipe I think. We have to go back for the empanadas everyone's talking about! Also lots of yummy baked goods. Love the crumbly powdered sugary Mexican wedding cookies. They had a kids menu but for once we did not children with us!
