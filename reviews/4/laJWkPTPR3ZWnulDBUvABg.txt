We usually stop here on our way to Cali! All three of us always order breakfast burritos and a order of taquitos. Wife get a country breakfast burrito with beans and pico. I always get a steak and egg burrito, wish the quality of the steak is better and less greasy. Daughter also gets a country burrito. Now of course that's a lot of food already, but we always add a order of taquitos no matter how early it is. This will continue to be our breakfast stop when we travel out west.
