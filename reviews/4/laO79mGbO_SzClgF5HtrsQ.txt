Great family owned restaurant with outstanding service by friendly people. My beef taco was filled with flavorful, tender meat and no gristle or fat. Enchilada sauce is creamy and delicious. All the right proportions of meat, lettuce, tomato and cheese. Great Gringo salsa, great flavor and not spicy. We'll be back!
