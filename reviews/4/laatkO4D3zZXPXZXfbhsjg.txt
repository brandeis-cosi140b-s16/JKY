TACOS 4 LIFE

I start thinking about tacos about half an hour after I wake up, and I dont stop until tacos happen.  I'm sure you are the exact same way.

These tacos are GOOD.  Particularly the carnitas tacos, I think those are my favorite.  They're around $10, and one of my favorite lunch options in the strip district.
