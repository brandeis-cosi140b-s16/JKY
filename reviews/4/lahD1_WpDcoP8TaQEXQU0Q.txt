I like several things about Federico's:

1 - It's close to my house.
2 - It's inexpensive.
3 - They have large portions.
4 - The food tastes good.
5 - Service is friendly.

The only thing I don't like is the iced tea.  It doesn't taste very good and isn't fresh brewed.

Overall, Federico's is a good option in this part of town for Mexican food.
