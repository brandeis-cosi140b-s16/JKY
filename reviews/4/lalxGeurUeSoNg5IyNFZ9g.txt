This place is pretty new. The employees behind the counter are nice but still a little confused but I think that's normal because they are new.  However the girl at the counter that helped us raved about the food and assured us we would like it.  They have a really good menu, their prices are VERY reasonable.  The food was hot, tasted good, the sauces were good (not great but definitely good) and the portions are WELL worth the money.  I was disappointed that they forgot the rice with our meal when we got home but it's minor and I'm ok with it as long as they don't forget items in the future.  I definitely give them kudos for some REALLY good quacamole and not just watered down thin crap like robertos taco shop has (i'm not even sure if it's real avocado that's how bad it is) 

I will DEFINITELY return
