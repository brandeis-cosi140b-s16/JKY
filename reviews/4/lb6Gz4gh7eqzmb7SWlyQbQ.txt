I'm so sad that I've had this restaurant so close to home for two years and didn't even know it. One of my customers at work recommended this place and I'm so glad that he did!

The location is really easy to access from the 215 and is in a shopping center with plenty of parking. We felt very welcome when we arrived and everyone was very friendly. The service was not only friendly, but very efficient. 

We started with the appetizer sampler which was not only delicious, but a very generous size. The sampler included two mini cuban sandwiches, one papas rellenos (mashed potato and meat ball that is breaded and fried), a tamale, and two croquetas. A truly delicious combination. We decided to share the vaca frita (flank steak marinated with lemon, lime, garlic, orange, and spices) with moros (black beans and rice) for our dinner. Everything on the plate was full of flavor and delicious.  I'm already thinking about when I can return. I ended the meal with the vanilla tres leche which had a nice flavor and wasn't soggy. 

What a great place. I can't wait to return!
