We had great service! Thanks Aaron!
A girlfriend and I went here for lunch. We started with the guacamole which was just how we like it - chunky (made from real avocados), not too oniony and topped with a sprinkle of goat cheese. We also shared the Carnitas Crisp topped with a green enchilada sauce - very tasty although not the usual smokey flavor I'm used to in other carnitas I've had.

We complimented the meal with a sampling of margaritas: I had the "Perfect" - powerful good; good amount of sweet & sour if you like that (I'm only good for one sweet & sour mixed drink). She had the prickly pear margarita which went down very smoothly. A little sweet for my taste, but light and refreshing nonetheless.

Next I did my own rendition of the "Skinny" - margarita made with real lime juice (so no sugar) but topped it with Grand Marnier which sweetened it just enough for me. Fabulous! My girlfriend had it unadulterated and liked it.

I was reluctant to go to this place since reviews weren't particularly favorable, but all in all we enjoyed our lunch howbeit mostly liquid and the staff was very attentive.
