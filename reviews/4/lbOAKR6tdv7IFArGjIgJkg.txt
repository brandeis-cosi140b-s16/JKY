It's a great, creative restaurant. Small, kind of a hole in the wall, but they come up with a lot of tasty dishes. I never would have thought to put sweet potato puree in a burrito, but surprisingly, it works! I love the BD quesadilla and Carnitas burrito. If you call for delivery, service is quite fast. The people who work there are fast, friendly and efficient.
