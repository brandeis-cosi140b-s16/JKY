This has to be my favorite location!! Not because it's the closest to my house but because they are the most clean and friendly! That goes an extremely long way when we are talking about eating out right? Well the portions at many robertos are always generous but usually get the California burrito or the Carne Asada burrito! Both are my favorite and you can never go wrong with either or!
