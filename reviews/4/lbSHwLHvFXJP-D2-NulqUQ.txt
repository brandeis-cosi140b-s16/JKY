Boyfriend and I just stopped by here for burritos before we head on our drive home. We have been here once before and I got the same thing as last time: grilled chicken chipotle burrito. It is a burrito (fancy that!) with grilled chicken, beans cheese and chipotle sauce. I remember it being really good last time but now my tummy hurts as I type this. I may have just eaten too much though. Overall, the place is cute, but the burritos are slightly pricey (my burrito was $6.99). For two burritos, it was a total of $15.
