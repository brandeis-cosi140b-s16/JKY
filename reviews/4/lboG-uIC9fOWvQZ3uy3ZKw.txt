Very, very good. As soon as I saw this popping up in the mall I was interested. I just visited for the first time and was a worthwhile experience. They have a variety of nice beers available, and the happy hour(s) are generous. I do particularly like the open air bar setup they've got going on, especially since they've  kept it very clean. Fast and friendly service. Definitely get the SirVeza fries. They are incredible.
