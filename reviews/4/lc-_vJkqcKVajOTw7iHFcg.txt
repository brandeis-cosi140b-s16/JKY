I'm working out at Litchfield Park this month so I finally had a chance to try Senior Taco--a place that always seems packed at their Fountain Hills location the times I am up there. 

This is sort of a Filiberto's-style place. It is fast food, it has a similar menu. The prices are similar. However, the food was quite different. 

I tried three things, trying some of each and bringing some back to the office with me. First, the carne asada torta. I would say this is the most similar in flavor to Filibertos. Not bad, but not super great. It would have benefited from more meat and less guacamole. I also had a shredded beef, hard-shell taco. This was quite a bit different than Filiberto's and, in my opinion, better. They did not fry it as much, and it had a lot more cheese than I usually get at Filibertos. I also had the carne asada soft taco. The size was large and it was very good. Nothing here is super great, but the tacos were especially yummy. 

Service, cleanliness and all of the rest were average or above for a fast food restaurant. 

I give it 3.5 stars--leaning toward four due to the size of the dishes for the price.
