Huge selection unique items and now many vegetarian options. 

Mexican, Chinese, a Thai dish, and dinner (american food including breakfast items) they have it.

On my first visit I oped for the daily special which was a chillie rellno and a drink for $6.99 The chillie it self was quite good, the sides were standard and the hand made soft corn tortilla were amazing. 

My coworker had a dish we had never seen before, potato gortia like long patties covered in sauce cheese and chunk of carne asada. ~7.50 which he did enjoy.

My one grip with this place is the price. With tax and tip meals are close to $10 and I would like it to be just a buck or so less for lunch pricing or have a pei wei like format so I did not need to tip.
