We have been to La Cocina for lunch several times. Always good for a quick lunch close to the office. My friend raves about their beans, and they are pretty good, if I may say so myself. Do not let the location fool you, they are a sit down restaurant and bring chips & salsa to your table upon seating. They also accommodate to-go orders. I have always ordered the combination plate which I choose 1 beef [hard] taco and 1 chicken enchilada [with red sauce]; my friend raves about their green sauce chicken enchiladas and their green sauce is good, but I am a red sauce kind of guy. They are reasonably priced and the table service, while not the best out there, is adequate for the type of restaurant.
