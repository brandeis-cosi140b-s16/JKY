This is my second time here since the reopening under new ownership & new name. Both times I've eaten out in the Taqueria (take out shack by the street). Today I got a Grande Shrimp Taco and a side of rice. I'm glad I got the large (4oz of shrimp) taco, its close to the size the old owner served. At $5.49 its priced about the same as before.

The young man behind the counter brought me chips N salsa before my taco came up, which was a pleasant surprise both because I got two sides, not a meal, and because I expected them to call #12 back to the counter since it so large on my receipt. Maybe they do that when its busier. I thought the green salsa vwrde was delicious and the chips were very thin like I like them.

The shrimp taco looked just like before, with big ol shrimp N pineapple on a double corn tortilla. Unfortunately this isn't quite the old owners taco. It was cooked properly and the quality was g9d (tender & juicy) but the flavor was pretty bland. Not at all bad, but not where the bar was set. The rice was very ordinary too.

All in all, this was a 4 star meal to me, as long as u don't keep measuring them to the old place.
