Chinese and Mexican under one roof? Weird, right?

WRONG.  So good!  They recommend that you order 2-3 plates for each person and share.  So, almost like Chinese tapas... with a Mexican flair. Choices are available from dim sum, noodles, tacos, soups, etc.  We ordered some of the more traditional choices, like shu mai and tacos (both chicken and barbacoa), which were very good.  But the best were the off the beaten path items... the rainbow congee (soup with sausage, carrots, and snow peas) was delicious.  It seemed like it had polenta or some similar base, and the flavors complemented each other with the added crunch of the veggies.  By far, the wen rou salad was the best! Tofu and avocado were blended with a delicious citrus based sauce which was phenomenal.

I see so many of the reviews talk of how expensive this place is.  OK, but it is the Cosmopolitan!! Hello! This place is one of the more reasonable in the hotel (even the buffet is $29 per person) and we were really glad to have eaten here instead.  We had two dishes each and we were not hungry at all.

I would definitely go back.  The flavors were amazing!
