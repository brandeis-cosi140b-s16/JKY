Open, airy restaurant - high ceilings.  I can imagine it is very noisy when the place is full.  The food was not your typical Mexican fare ... the fajita's had jalapeno's which while a surprise, were a nice addition.  The cheese enchilada is done in a small cast iron dish and is layered and excellent - although the dish is only about 4" in diameter it is enough for 2 people to share.
