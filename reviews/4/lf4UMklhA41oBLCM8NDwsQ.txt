When everyone in this place is Hispanic, and we are the only Caucasians in the place we figured this has to be authentic! The food was great! The service was great! And they serve COKE, not pepsi so that is always a huge thumbs up. I had the USA Torta, which is like a sandwich, breaded chicken, ham, pineapple and cheese with a chipotle sauce, lots of food and very good...I took 1/2 home! 

I had passed this place 100 times recently and the parking lot seemed always busy. We love Mexican food so I was hesitant since I remember being a kid and going to this place when it was JB's for breakfast with my grandmother. Place was great, and will for sure back to try something else.
