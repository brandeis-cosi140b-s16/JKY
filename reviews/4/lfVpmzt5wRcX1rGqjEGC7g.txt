So I don't come here by choice really. Or rather, if I'm coming here for food I either somehow lost track of time and it's now one of the ONLY options in the same zip code or I got talked into it by a friend - after last call somewheres. This place gets really weird after midnight. I've seen drunken older women totally hit on the guy at the cash register - quite entertaining. Oh yeah - the food. There's food. I usually get either the carnitas plate or a carnitas burrito. Pretty good valuewise especially if you get the combo including drink. I'd say the carnitas here is a lot tastier then at the nearby 'berto's. They also have those fifty cent sticker machines that sell wacky stickers. I got one that says Butterface in the shape of a butterfingers bar - good times! Lotsa parking. Open all dang nite...
