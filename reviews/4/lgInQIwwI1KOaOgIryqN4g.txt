I just moved to north Phoenix and I was used to the mexican restaurants and taco shops in downtown. I looked hard for a mexican food place near home and finally found this tiny little place under the shadows of N 51 and Bell behind a gas station. They serve the best menudo around to cure the hangovers and the best late night appetizers. This place brought all the good taste of awesome made mexican food. 
Note: I would have giving a full 5 star except that the only negative point is:  the close too early during the weekends. 
Congratulations !!
