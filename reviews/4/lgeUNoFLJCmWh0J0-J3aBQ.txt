Barrio Cafe is a great up-scale Mexican restaurant in the heart of downtown Phoenix! 

Since 2002, Phoenicians (local Phoenix residents) and tourists have been flocking to Barrio Cafe to check out Wendy Gruber and Silvana S. Esparza's amazing concoctions! Cooking up authentic southern Mexican cuisine, Barrio Cafe is worth checking out if you are visiting Phoenix!

*BREAD & OLIVE TAPENADE (complimentary, **3 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#hotQFFC1GATHL5k4SK9RlA
I love toasted bread and I found it interesting that there was a type of olive tapenade accompanied with this in a Mexican restaurant. I must say though, I like the concept, but I wasn't sure how it fits in with the Barrio Cafe theme and authenticity of Mexican cuisine. The olives were rich in sodium, so I needed to drink water to dilute the saltiness. Nonetheless, it was out-of-the-box, interesting, but nothing too memorable for me.

*GUACAMOLE CASERO & CHIPS ($10.50, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#MeFFk_MnYU7HeBUO3kpXYg
I've fallen in love with their guacamole! I'm a guacamole slut and love everything about this dish! First and foremost, who puts pomegranate seeds in their guac?! They do! This gave a bit of sweetness, which complimented the acid from your typical guacamole ingredients. Prepared table side and made in a jiffy! I was impressed with this dish and would order it again! 

*COCHINITA PIBIL ($19, **5 STARS**) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3TUF75Ror8SVevRy-CoaNA
This dish is their FAMOUS 12-hour slow roasted pork marinated with achiote rojo (Mexican spices)! As you can imagine, the pork was quite succulent and there was a side of au jus in case you wanted more "oomph". The pork was topped off with salsa Yucateca, which elevated the flavors of the pork's richness! The dish was served with sauteed veggies and a sweet potato mash. It is a heavy dish to consume, but nonetheless, amazing dish that is taste-bud worthy! I can see why this is the popular dish amongst the visitors and regulars! Get it if you can!!! *oink*oink*  

*CARNE ASADA TACOS ($14) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#3NI_va9ekIdN_V8MzGYahw
*FILETE AZUL (Filet Mignon) ($26) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#lsSphM27AH9f18-2r00T7A
-I can't attest to the other two dishes since I did not try my fellow grubbers' dishes. But both were content with the dishes they had ordered that evening.

*HORCHATA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/barrio-café-phoenix-2?select=-n9S3iox-mxfPDf1nQOn1Q#wACvkrnyMEzHvYvvJh1iAA 
Barrio Cafe was honored a couple years ago for having the most authentic horchata in town. As I had a glass of it (served in a glass Coke bottle), I was expecting the drink to be over-ly sugared! Surprisingly, it was quite tamed and it was refreshing to drink throughout my dinner here.

Service - our hostess was quite busy, she forgot to let us know how long we would have to wait to be seated. We didn't really have to wait too long (15 mins) and she apologized for the delay. Our waiter was quite attentive and was able to answer any of the questions we had about the menu. Our water glasses were filled promptly and although the restaurant was quite busy, they didn't forget anything we had requested! Thank you for your service!

Overall, I had a great experience with the Barrio Cafe and would recommend this place to someone if they are looking for an upscale kinda Mexican restaurant. I wouldn't mind coming back for their guacamole, since they put a twist to the original dish!
