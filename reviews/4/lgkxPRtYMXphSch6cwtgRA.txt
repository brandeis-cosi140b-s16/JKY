Wow!  I have stayed away from this restaurant for some time, because my last few visits would rank at around a 2.

This most recent visit was closer to a 3.5 stars, but I'm giving them the 4 because of the vast improvement over my prior visits.

A couple weeks ago I found myself "stuck" going here.  I hoped for the best and was a good sport.

We ordered a cheese crisp and shredded taco appetizers.

A basic House Margarita, frozen, was good.  The cheese crisp was super crispy and the perfect balance of bubbly hot cheese to tortilla ratio.  The tacos were the best I have ever had at this location.  Service was a little slow, but competent.

So, I can say that I was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by this most recent visit.  More cautious optimism, less avoidance, for now.
