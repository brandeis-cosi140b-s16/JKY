Mimosas are good, although a little small.  The 'you call it' drink menu wan't bad since anything you want is $5 a pop.  I had the Huevos Rancheros on a Sunday morning.  Place was busy, but I didn't have to wait to be seated.  I sat at the bar.  Staff was very attentive and food was very good, although presentation was a bit lacking.  Cool place, cool staff, cool crowd.  I'll be back.
