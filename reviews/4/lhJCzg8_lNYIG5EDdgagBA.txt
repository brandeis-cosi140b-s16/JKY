Another of the "pretty darned good" Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. Maybe it's not perfectly authentic, but the food quality and quantity is excellent. It is definitely on par with any of the other similar restaurants I have Yelped.

Very wide menu, which includes several vegetarian options as well as the usual carnivore stuff. The chips brought to our table were warm and fresh, along with two bowls of salsa. The mild one was just that. Mild. No spice at all. The hot was well peppery. I was able to mix one into the other to make one that was "just right" though it was still not the chunky style I prefer.

The food was served promptly and accurately. The rice was fresh and not crunchy or stale at all. My friend totally demolished his Texas-style burrito - I was sure he was about to start licking the plate!

Very convenient, right off the highway at Carowinds Blvd. Great prices. Good drinks.

Would I return? Absolutely!
