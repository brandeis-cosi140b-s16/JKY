Of the very limited dining options in Gila Bend for travelers, this place is likely the best. Most of the options are fairly typical Mexican fare but the salsa and gorditas are strangely good. I'm not sure what they do to the salsa but it's amazing. The gorditas are like little flash fried Mexican pockets of meat topped with cheese, lettuce and tomatoe. A real treat, compared to the many other sub-par restaurant options nearby. Lots of locals and travelers, generally a good sign. Very fair prices. Service is acceptable. Not one of the cleanest places I've eaten but I'll be going back for more the next time I pass through.
