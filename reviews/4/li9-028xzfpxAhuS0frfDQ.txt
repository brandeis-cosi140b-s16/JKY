The decor was sunny and airy.  the table was clean.  The service was attentive and friendly.  The food was well cooked, well seasoned came out quickly and arrived HOT.  The only negative that I have about this place is that nothing I had was standout tastey.  All of the food I had was good but nothing was outstanding, hence the 4 stars.  I'd Recommend, I'd go back, but I enjoyed Feils more.  

I don't understand the the low start ratings of some of the recent posts.  This place is a solid 3 to 4 star restaurant.  and they have angry Orchard on tap, that's a bonus for me.

if your looking for a good Mexican meal you can get it here  Anyone saying otherwise is being disingenuous.
