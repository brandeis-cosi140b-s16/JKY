I only know about this place because it's across the street from my dentist. I came by after work and there were just a couple of people dining inside when I came in. I perused the menu and decided to try a chicken gordita and carne asada taco, with horchata to wash it all down. The food didn't take too long to come out and I took it to go. I like that they plated the food and wrapped it with foil, easy to dive in. The gordita wasn't what I incorrectly imagined, but it was really good. Both the chicken and the steak were very soft and flavorful, though I have to say I preferred the chicken. I will definitely be back to explore their menu, plus the price is very reasonable.
