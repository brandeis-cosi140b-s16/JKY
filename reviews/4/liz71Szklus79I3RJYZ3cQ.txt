My husband and I stopped by to have lunch one day at this location. Their salsa is very good I don't know if they have a specific name so excuse me if they do, but we loved their red salsa. We shared some of their carne asada fries they were really good. Just the fries at this location taste a little different from others we have had. 

The service was very fast and the girl that helped us was very friendly. I believe it might of taken me longer to get all the salsas that wanted to try than it did to get our food out. 

We will be visiting this location again.
