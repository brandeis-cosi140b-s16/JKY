Went here for dinner with my niece.  It's fresh fast food.  I thought the prices were reasonable.  The portions were a good size.  They give you free chips and they have a free salsa bar.  

My niece likes the soda machine. You can pick between a lot of different flavors.   I have to admit I enjoyed it as much as the kids.  Who doesn't want to mix cherry coke with lemonade and orange soda???

I had a vegetarian taco. It had beans, tomato, lettuce, rice and guac and sour cream. It was good. Like I mentioned, everything tasted fresh. The guacamole was homemade.  

It's worth checking out if you're in a hurry and are looking for something other than a burger.
