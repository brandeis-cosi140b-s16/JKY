These guys are taking tortas in some bold new directions.  A slight nod to these sandwiches over those by other purveyors like Tortas el guero.  

On a personal note:  Tortas to me are the Krispy Kremes of the sandwich world.  The first few bites are an incredible and unexplainable bliss but the last few are full of guilt and a prelude to an upset stomach.  Maybe that's why I always prefer the simplest tortas that don't overshadow the bread.
