My husband and I had dinner here one evening.  I had the #2 taco & cheese enchilada, my husband had the #10 two soft carne asada tacos.  The Food was delicious!  We joined the clean plate club and plan to return, again.  We were also impressed with the red salsa which had a solid kick to it, but not too much.  I just wanted to add that the restaurant was clean and they are open daily from 6am to 10pm.
