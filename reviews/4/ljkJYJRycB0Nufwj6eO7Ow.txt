Man, this place has been awesome for the last 8+ years since I began working nearby.  NOT fancy or by any means high class Mexican cuisine, but if you want fast, great tasting inexpensive mexican without fearing the "aftershock", this place is it.  I have been to all 3 locations many times over the years, and IMO the College location seems to be the best (then Gibson, and last Eastern), but the are ALL good.
