I had the steal burrito especial. The price was a little more then I would have liked.
A little to small for that price but, it was still good. 
The place was clean and the staff was acceptable. 
I would have to say that this 2nd place to Phat Phranks but, its still not bad. 
Try it at least once if you're in the area.
