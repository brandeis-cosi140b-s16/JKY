Me & my bf went here on a friday night, and were seated right away by some "young punk kid." But he was nice enough to give us an extra large bowl of chips, so less "young punk" and more of a "nice young man." 

We grabbed a pitcher of Dos Equis and ordered. The server was attentive, but not the most charming or friendly. But our orders came out as...well, ordered. 

I decided on the flautas. I was expecting you average, fried, crispy, tiny flautas. However, the tortillas they used were large and still semi-soft. Quite delicious. I really liked the rice too...they have a hidden taste of chicken added. 

So I'm sure I will be back considering my love of Mexican foodage, the location, and reasonable price. They are close Sundays and Mondays, I believe.
