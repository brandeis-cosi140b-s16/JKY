Great atmosphere, awesome patio. Went on a Friday night. The food was great. The ceviche was enough for a meal, and very tasty! 4 stars only due to the long wait and my food being done the wrong way, but was corrected VERY quickly. Oh and if you like Tequila (I don't) this place is a must for you!
I have been here for Sunday brunch and that was spectacular!
