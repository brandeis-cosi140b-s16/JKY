Surprising to find food this good at the airport, but the Charlotte airport really is top notch as far as that goes.  Lots of good choices.  Tequileria has a great menu which can get you something fast and easy to handle, kind of like a burger (but better!) or you can get something messy too.  Great grab and go selections as well.  I was able to get a quesadilla and soft drink in about 5 minutes and be able to eat it before I got onto the plane.

This place is in the main terminal section between C and D, I believe.  Pretty sure it is between City News and Starbucks.
