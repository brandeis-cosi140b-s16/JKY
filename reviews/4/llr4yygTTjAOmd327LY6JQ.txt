You scan the menu and are greeted by the same standards that you see at countless Mexican spots in the Valley.  The difference?  These items are executed excellently, efficiently, and by an endearing staff.  The complimentary chips and salsa are top shelf and their unique take on the chile relleno is worth making the drive.  New Mexico done right.
