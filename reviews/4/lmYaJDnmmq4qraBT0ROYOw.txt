I would give this place 4.5 stars... really enjoyed it! My boyfriend and I visited for AZ restaurant week, right away the old world spanish decor was lovely, I loved the table in the little room we were sat in, one side of the table had this nice big, lush bench seat with a pillow- nice and relaxing. Our waiter seemed a little weird, but he did his job and gave us a laugh!  The food was wonderful, we got the ahi tuna and empanada appetizers, both were delish! Then we got the quail and pork tenderloin w/ chorizo entree's, sooooo good! Loved both of them, full of flavor and creativity! Dessert was also really good, we had the chocolate torte and the churro's w/ 3 sauces, both were a delightful end to the meal, rich and tasty! We also had their flaming coffee with dessert, we got the one with kahlua, not sure what it was called exactly, but it was a fun show! We definitely plan to go back, great experience all around!
