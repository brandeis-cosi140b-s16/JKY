The margaritas here a ton better than the ones that I drank at On The Border, I really prefer a spanish person to make my margarita rather than a gringo who looks like he has been working the bar for less than a week.  The shrimp fajitas here were great, the shrimp were huge.  It didn't taste too Americanized like a lot of the Mexican places in Charlotte.  I would like to come back, the only problem was that I prefer to have the tails pulled off my shrimp when I order fajitas.
