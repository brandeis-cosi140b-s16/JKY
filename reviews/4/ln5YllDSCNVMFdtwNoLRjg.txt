On my way to Kingman, I dropped by to get a breakfast burrito. Now when the wife and I go to Cali early in the morning, Our ritual is to pick up a breakfast burrito on the way out. I usually order the steak and egg burrito while my wife always order their country burrito. Their country burrito consist of potato's, eggs, and cheese. Well I decided to order the country burrito with a twist. I asked them to add chili verde. They were more then happy to do that for me.
Filiberto's is conveniently located in the same building with the Shell mini-mart. So you can go next door and get what you need and come back for your food. 
Everything was easy and convient, got in and got out very quickly. And the Burrito? It was great!!
