First time! After asking some fellow YELPERS where do i go.. they didnt point me in the wrong direction! 

the place is small. but i like that. makes me feel like its a mom and pop place.. but then again it is. 
The service was great even though they were busy ( i went at lunch ) 
they were quick getting the food to the table and it was piping hot! 
the chips and salsa were really good. 
 
I ordered the Baja Chicken Burro! and it was GOOOOOD!
