I went there for lunch today.  The park lot is small that is near the building, you can park on the side of it for more room.  The place is set up to order at the counter.  

I had the quesdilla paquime with chicken $5.25.  The chicken was breaded, pounded thin,  and yummy.

I eye balled the deserts (ice cream, pudding, flan, cakes, popsicles, etc.)and different drinks (bottled sodas, canned sodas, shakes, & fruit drinks).  OMG!  Too bad, I was already full.
