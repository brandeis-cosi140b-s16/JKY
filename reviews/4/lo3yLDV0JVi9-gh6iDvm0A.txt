What, another Chipotle adjacent to Chandler Mall?!  Yes, that's right there are now two Chipotle locations within walking distance of Chandler Fashion Center.  This location is close to the Modern Mommy, Green Table, and Lizard Thicket boutiques and unlike the other location does not share a parking lot with the Harkins theater.  This makes it infinitely superior to the previous location.  I just hope it lasts since this space has had a different restaurant tenant every six months for the last 5 years.
