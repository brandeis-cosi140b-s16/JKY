I love this whole genre of eateries. 
Each one has it's pro/con's, and while I like Zaba's it is my least frequented of them all.

I generally get the 3 steak taco's with just cheese and sour cream, as I am a very plain eater.  Zabas steak is nice and spicy, with lots of flavor.
As a HUGE fan of Qdoba's Chips and Queso I had high hopes for Zaba's - but I found their queso to resemble melted plastic with peppers in it. There was nothing
appealing about it at all to me.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it, but I did not.  The chips also lacked flavor and were just average.
I can't remember what burrito my boyfriend got, but he really enjoyed it.  I'd go back, but not spend the money on the Queso.

The service was great and the people were very nice, even though we came close to closing

Let me tell you, my boyfriend was pretty excited about his Modelo with his dinner!
