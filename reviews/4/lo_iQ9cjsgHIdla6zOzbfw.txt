This place is definitely a mom and pop kind of shop and that's how I like them!

When you pull up you can tell it looks like a run down place and a lot of construction to the building is still being done, but don't let that fool you! It's a very small space, cheap seats, but we had a great waitress! She was an older lady and had a outstanding personality.

The food was good, it was a bit spicey at first, but you get used to it! It's a little on the pricey side, I had ordered just a bean burrito with enchilada sauce, and it was $6.00, but this place is still worth going to once if you haven't been!
