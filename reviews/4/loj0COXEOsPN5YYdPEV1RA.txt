This is a great place for Sunday lunch. The location is in the center of midtown, a happening place to be!  You can easily walk, in less than 3 minutes, to Target, Best Buy, Trader Joe's, Vitamin Shoppe, and many more places.  The food at Chipotle is always great and the service is always top rate.  Although I will say that I went in to eat a few weeks ago and the manager was doing business paperwork on the tables in the dining room area.  Not a great place to conduct managerial duties of paperwork completion.   Especially when you are taking up valuable real estate in the dining room!!  

So, they do no have queso here because it is processed.  It would be great to find a queso that is able to be manufactured without harsh stabilizing chemicals, but this certainly doesn't take away from the fantastic menu options currently available.  

The outside patio area is great for dogs and people alike.  There are select tables with umbrellas, so arrive prior to busy hour to reserve your shaded table.   

There is a mattress store beside of Chipotle, so if you eat too much then you can go "test mattresses" in a nicely cooled and comfortable mattress store!  Ha!!  

Enjoy your experience!
