I DEFINITELY took advantage of the Buy One Burrito or Salad, get one free coupon that was floating around on Facebook for the month of March. Somewhere along the way, I became a converted fan of Cafe Rio. I say convert because I was not a fan of Cafe Rio previously. I guess all I needed to do was give Cafe Rio a second chance!

First off, the burritos and salads are huge. Bigger portions sizes make my fat girl heart happy. Second, the tortillas are freshly made. In fact, they're so fresh sometimes I have flour dust on my hands! Cafe Rio's tortillas beat out all the competition IMO. 

VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($7.79): Comes with "double" beans and rice. I get mine with black beans with hot AND mild sauce. This location loads the burrito up with cheese. Yassss! Guacamole comes with the veggie burrito, but I pass on that. I wish they'd let me sub sour cream instead! Also, Cafe Rio's burritos are best eaten with a fork and knife. I learned that the hard way. 

Price wise, Cafe Rio is a bit on the expensive side for a fast food burrito place. It's probably around $10-$12 per person, depending on how many "extras" you get.

UPDATE: OMG OMG Cafe Rio has the best military discount ever! 25% off your entire purchase. That's one of the biggest discounts I've come across at a fast food chain. Way to go Cafe Rio!   

Worth a Return Visit?
Yup.   

TIP: They have Vanilla Coke on fountain drinks and horchata as well :)
