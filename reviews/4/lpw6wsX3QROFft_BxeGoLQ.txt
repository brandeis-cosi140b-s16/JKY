I have been told that in Spanish, the name 'Secreto' means 'The Secret'.  I can tell you first hand that this is absolutely true.  I have driven by this place probably 100 times, but had never bothered to stop because it simply didn't have the curb appeal.  Well let me tell you something - this is the best Mexican I've found in Ahwatukee, and I've tried them all now.

It's getting 4 stars, because there's nothing extraordinary, but at the same time, everything is good.  The margaritas are good, the food is fresh, with large portions, and the prices are reasonable.  Our waiter seemed very comfortable in the joint, so I'm assuming he was the owner/manager, and he was attentive, friendly, and fun.

This is our new Mexican place.  We'll be back soon!
