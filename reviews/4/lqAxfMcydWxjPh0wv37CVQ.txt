Maki Taco is my #2 food truck. I was excited to try them ever since they sent me a note on Twitter months before they even got rolling (pardon the pun).  I've now had them many times as they typically are at the Atherton Mill Market Saturdays for lunch and also at the Chow Down food truck rallies.  Just look for the long line.

Their concept is a pan-asian taco which means instead of latin flavors, they have sauces like peanut, teriyaki or panang curry and the veggies are thick cabbage and red pepper and cucumber. They have some pre-arranged taco combinations that you can choose, but I highly recommend the make-your-own combo. You can choose from chicken, shrimp or veggie, then you choose the veggies or toppings (incl. peanuts) to go on top and then you can mix and match sauces that go with them. 

I've had shrimp but I HIGHLY recommend the chicken instead and really love the panang curry sauce the best (with peanut as #2).  A combo of 3 tacos is $6.50 - what a great deal, non? Actually sometimes I think 3 is a bit much and they could get away with a combo of 2, but who's complaining? 

The only real thing to complain about is the aforementioned long line when you go to a rally. They're getting in their groove and typically the wait isn't as long once you actually place the order, but the order taking is slow because of the foreign concept, many choices and credit card processing. But I still love you Maki Taco.
