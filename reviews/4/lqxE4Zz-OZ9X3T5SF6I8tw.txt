Just found out this burrito shop opened recently near my house, so I had to give them a try.  According to the manager, they've been open for about 6 months, and their thing is "no fat" meats.  My girlfriend and I got two chicken burritos... one super burrito (with sour cream, guac, etc.) and one regular one.  Both were very good, and definitely felt healthier than your other hole in the wall Mexican restaurants.  Unfortunately, they're only open til 9pm, so I probably won't be frequenting this place as much as I'd like to.  Definitely a nice friendly vibe here, though.  Recommended.
