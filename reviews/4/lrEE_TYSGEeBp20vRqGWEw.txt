My aunt took me here! She bought a deal chicken or something :) I got a tostada good but nothing amazing she got green chilli chicken. All average but their tortillas so good! On point and delicious at home with butter. Place was really busy but I'm not sure if it was because the deal was expiring or if people really love this place. - one star for being a bit on the dirty side!
