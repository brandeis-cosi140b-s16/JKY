Rolando's occupies a former Taco Bell carcass and has been here for ten years.  
Why have I been missing this place?  I'm not afraid of dingy booths and a CASH ONLY sign!
They may look like one of your typical indie mexican fast foods with the big white menu board with red and green letters, but they really served up some delicious food when I stopped in for some takeout this weekend.
Two friendly dudes were running the show, and one of them was even wearing a chef's coat.  I thought it was silly at first, but not after tasting the cuisine they plated up in styrofoam showcase boxes.
Shredded chicken tacos, even with a fried, hard shell, were not the least bit greasy, and even though they fell apart while eating them I was able to fork up every single bit of the remains without dodging any greasy or fatty bits (NO DISCARD PILE!).   
The same applied to soft corn shell carne asada tacos, with fresh made guacamole and tomatoey-onioney-cilantroey pico de gallo.  
I didn't have the beans, but even they didn't look greasy at all, and the rice was fluffy and light, if a bit on the bland side.
The 'green' sauce was absolutely yummy, with enough spiciness but flavorful heat, not show-off heat.
Rolando's having a guy in a chef's coat is no joke; this is mexican fast food at its finest and for cheap, too!  Spending less than $14 on two full combos meant plenty left over for some Stone IPA to wash it down.
