Its actually a Salvadorean restaurant and not Mexican food. Its family owned and it offers a no frills dining experience. However the service is fast and friendly. In and out quick dining. Everything is prepared by a mom and her daughters in the kitchen and it has the feeling of a restaurant in a small Salvadorean town. Their Pupusas are the best in the city hands down. I constantly order them to go when ever I am in the area and their Tamarindo drink is made fresh everyday.  The pricing is fantastic: easily feed four people for about $20. If nothing else the pricing, Pupusas, tamarind and speed of service makes me a fan.
