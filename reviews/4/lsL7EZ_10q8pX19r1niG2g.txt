More like a quasi-Latin kitchen.  The Latin food is there if you want it, but you can also get burgers, and most of the coffee selections are hardly Latin. 

At first, I got a frappe coffee drink, a "frigid mocha latte".  For $6.00 for a 16 ounce blended coffee drink, it was a overpriced, but very tasty. 

At another counter, I got a double burger.  The only choice for cheese was cheddar, but the burger was actually a relative bargain, at $8.25.  The two greasy patties with nicely melted cheese, with tomato, lettuce and onion, turned out to be a good choice. 

This was tough for me to judge as it's more like 3.5 stars, but for Yelp ratings I pushed it up to 4 stars due to the inviting eclectic decor, and I really like that it's off the beaten path, compared to so much of downtown.   As it's just across the street from the Mob Museum, it's also a good choice before/after a trip to that museum.
