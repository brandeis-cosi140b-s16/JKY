I have been coming here for years. My wife works right up the street so we head here for lunch when we can. I love the Chicken En Chipotle, it is spicy and full of flavor, but don't order it unless you can stand the heat. The tacos are solid too and the wet burritos are great. It can get busy at lunch so be prepared. It seems like most of their biz is during lunch. Maria is one of the servers and is a gem. Be nice!
