So up until last month I had never even HEARD of this place. My husband is from Utah and knows all about Cafe Rio. He was raving about it and telling me that it was right up my alley. I'm kind of a brat....I like to think I know it all, so I just laughed and said, "How could it be that great if I've never heard of it...?" Blah, Blah. I'm so diplomatic, sometimes.....
So when we looked up a Vegas location near us, it was soooo crazy...they have one on the same block as the Chipotle that I so often frequent. I had apparantly driven by it a dozen or so times and never  even noticed or cared. But oh MAN, do I care now!! 
If you like fresh, fresh, fresh mexican food then this is your place. The chicken and pork burritos are exceptional, and it is all put together in front of you in assembly line fashion. The ingredients all look and taste fresh and fab. You can choose pinto or black beans, with all the fixings like rice, cheese, and salsa, etc....note....you can choose different "sauces" on your food... Cafe Rio has their own  very sweet sauce that they serve up which is great, but not too traditional for mexican food, ( If you are used to say, So Cal style like I am ) so if you don't like surprises, choose the "medium" sauce, which is more "traditional." (I personally adore the sweeter sauce.) What else is great? The coconut shrimp tacos are delish and savory, and I do love the salads as well. My fave is the Pork Barbacoa with the fresh Lime Dressing. I even ask for an extra serving of the dressing to take it home with me, it's that good. ...my Hubby was right! The food was waaaaya better than I could have predicted, and I stand corrected. (He'd better not get used to it, har har.)
