We found this place last year when we visited Charlotte for the dirt races and was looking forward to a return trip this year. We opted for the lunch time buffet, and were once again delighted with the offerings provided. I'm not usually a fan of buffets as I find things tend to sit around too long, but that simply isn't the case here as most items are put out in small quantities and replenished often. We opted for the margaritas with an upgrade to 1800 tequilia and were not let down as they were fabulous.
 The staff members are absolutely some of the friendliest people you could ask for as there seems to be a family that works there that remembered my friend and I from last year...."You're from Pheeely, no ?"
 Not sure that we are coming back next year, but if we return to Charlotte, we will definitely make a return trip to Los Arcos.
