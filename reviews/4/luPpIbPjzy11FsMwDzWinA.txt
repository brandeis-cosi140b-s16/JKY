Great little place, made even better by the recent addition of Lengua to the menu. The California style burritos are a staple (regular burritos with french fries) and all their portions are hefty. I particularly like the Carne Asada fries (fries smothered in carne asada, guac, cheese, and sour cream). 

Service is solid, but nothing to write home about. Food comes up quick, which is nice. Place is busy around lunch to late afternoon, but never packed to the point where you're waiting more than 10 minutes for your food. 

One of the best items on the menu is definitely their Chorizo Breakfast Burrito. I have at least one every week; big hefty burrito stuffed with egg, chorizo, and hash browns. A must-try!
