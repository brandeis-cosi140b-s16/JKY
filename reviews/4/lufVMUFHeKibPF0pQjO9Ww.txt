This place is clean and the food is pretty good. Everything on the menu is pretty typical of a Mexican joint. It's a little bit more expensive than most something something bertos places. But it's worth it, because it's fresher and lighter. It's like Mrs. Chipotle and Senor Bertos forgot the gloves and give birth to Senor Taco. Thank you for joining me at the Food Porn channel. See you next time!   Buy surf and turf burrito.
