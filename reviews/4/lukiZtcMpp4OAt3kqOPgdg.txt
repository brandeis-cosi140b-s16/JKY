I have visited this location 3 times and each visit I had a good experience.  

I ordered a combo two every visit, seems to be the best value ($8.50).  You choose two items from a list of about 7 selections including burritos, hard or soft tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tamals, or tostadas and it is served with rice and beans.  

Overall the quality may be one notch higher than your standard mexican restaurant that many of us have grown accustomed to in the south. You are also paying a little more for this great location.

If there is anything that stands out to me about this place it has to be their shredded beef that you can get stuffed in just about anything on the menu.  It's delicious!

I have not visited their other location so I cannot compare the two.
