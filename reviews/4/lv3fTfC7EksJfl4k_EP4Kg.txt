I love this place! It's definitely our GO TO place for breakfast and lunch! It's right close to our work so it definitely has become our place to go to when not sure where to eat for lunch. We love their burritos - it's large and very filling. Their rolled tacos are good and one of my new fav is the green chili burrito. I also love that they have a little bar that you can grab some pickled carrots to go along w/ your to go order. Their drive thru is a bit hectic but everything is made to order and their food is good so I think it's worth the wait.
