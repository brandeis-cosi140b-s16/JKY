My roommate and I were actually trying to go to the Sonoran Hot Dog truck across the street, but it was not there and saw Sinaloa and decided to give it a try.  We were both pleasantly surprised at how good everything was.  Probably the best carne asada I have had in quite a while.  The tacos were great, my roommate also tried the ceviche and it was delicious as well.  The other tacos we tried were chicken and a shredded beef, both were very good as well, but were overshadowed by how awesome the carne asada was.  I knocked a star off because of the straight outta the bag chips, with so so salsa and the fact that every time I go there there's a communication struggle with the mostly Spanish speaking staff.  Overall, worth a trip.
