I don't get why people are giving this place a hard time. Is it because it's not enough like a Mexican chain? I mean come on, Phoenix. I was just passing through, but I was on an epic Mexican food binge that started in San Antonio, via Santa Fe. This place stood up to the food we'd eaten along the way, and we thought the space itself was very attractive. The servers were really nice, explaining the unusual menu to us gringos. I had some sort of marinated beef in my enchilada that was extraordinarily good (it wasn't the carne asada... I didn't care for the carne asada). I wish I remember what it was called!! I tried really hard to remember, but I failed all of you. Just ask what everythign is that you've never heard of, and order the beef chunks marinated with onions. The carnitas were good too.
