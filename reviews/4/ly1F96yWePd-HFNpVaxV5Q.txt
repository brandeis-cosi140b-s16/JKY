I had the taco combo platter. It includes 3 tacos, rice, beans, and a "salad" (lettuce). I chose carne asada for the meat. Everything was delicious. I loved the horchata as well. I would definitely come here again to taste something else. You know a Mexican restaurant is good when their beans are good! The beans were awesome.
