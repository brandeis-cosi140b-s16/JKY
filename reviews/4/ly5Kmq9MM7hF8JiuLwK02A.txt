Thankfully they put some signs on the street next to the strip mall, which kept teasing a spot in my subconscious directly linked to "street taco nirvana". This place was either going to hit the mark or be a "one and done". Well, it HIT the mark. The smoked and marinated meats are works of art. The fresh salsas are generally very good - the smoky salsa is the best choice. Everything is made to order, including the guacamole which we decided was necessary to tide us over until we could make decisions on the deep menu. The waitress reminded us it was made by hand upon order, so we would have to wait a bit for it. 2 minutes later it was at our table. OMG - delicious. We are now trying to figure out how to direct all our neighbors over here so it gets successfully launched. And we are going to see if they will let us order up a few pounds of meat for a party at our house. Oh wait, I missed one fine detail - BYOB!! Awesome place
