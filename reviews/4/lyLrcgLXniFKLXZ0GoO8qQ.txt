So, all I've had here(so far) is one mini carne asada taco, but with that, their friendliness, and their expansive and well-priced menu, I'll definitely be returning.

The taco itself was $1.35, after tax, and consisted of two flour tortillas filled with freshly grilled beef--extremely tender and flavorful, topped with cabbage, raw onions, and a medium salsa. It was a teensy bit greasy, but delicious, savory, and it totally hit the spot!

More to come, soon!
