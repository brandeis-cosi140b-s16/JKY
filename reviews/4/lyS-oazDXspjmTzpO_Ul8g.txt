I went here for the first time a few weeks ago on a Saturday night. I got there around 8pm and there was a good crowd already. We managed to get a table right next to the heaters because it was one of the few spots with one. The waiter was attentive and the crowd was pleasant. As soon as it was 10pm, the crowd got fairly large, and the waiter still came around often. I was impressed! The only problem I had was the drinks were on the watered down side... I like a little more Jack with my Coke.
