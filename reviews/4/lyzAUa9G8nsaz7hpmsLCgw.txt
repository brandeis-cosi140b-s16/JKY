Food is really good. Somewhat authentic. So far as good as I can get in Charlotte. Homemade tortillas are thicker then the usual. Great as tacos or a side for a soup. Refried beans were dark in color with a slight kick. Horchata was refreshing. Everything was on point and we enjoyed our meals.

However, the service leaves much to be desired. Divas crowd the front cashier area and lack the proper etiquette to attend to customers. They border on rude and disinterested in servicing you. It took awhile before a waitress came to seat us despite the front cashier area had all these women there catting amongst each other. Out of the eight I counted, only two were busy trying to handle the busy afternoon crowd. Why they were loudly bumping rap/hip hop music in the foreground is beyond me. 

This place has the potential to be a great restaurant that could attract a broader crowd, however it's managed poorly and is reminiscent of a Latin hood joint.

Update 3/2015- submitted an updated review. Food is consistent- very good. Service much improved.
