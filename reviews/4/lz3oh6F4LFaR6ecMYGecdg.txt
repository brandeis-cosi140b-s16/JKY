I had their escamocha twice. The first time it was great, the cream was delicious and had lots of fruit, granola coconut all that goodness! 

The second time was the same except some of the fruit in it had an odd taste to it. Like they had used the same knife to dice onion or some of the other food. Maybe they forgot to wash it and used the same knife to cut the fruit? Or it could of been the cutting board. Ive been here a couple times and had always enjoyed it, but tje last one left a bad taste in my mouth :-( 

However i plan on trying it again soon and hopefully give them 5 stars
