This location of Filibertos is much better and cleaner than the one in Sierra Vista.  The employees are nice fast.  The food is slightly above average and tastes pretty authentic.  It's a good place to go for takeout, and unlike the Sierra Vista location is nice enough for dine-in.  The food is not worth jumping up and down over, but it is good.  One exception, stay away from the menudo.  It was too greasy and tasted like it hadn't been cooked long enough.
