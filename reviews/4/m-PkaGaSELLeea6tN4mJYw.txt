OK... So I'm actually writing this review while waiting for my food at this place. Obviously, this is pertaining to my first visit, which was yesterday. Considering I'm here again, it's already a given that my experience at this place is very good. 

Location -  this Mexican joint is located in a strip mall right next to a gas station, hair salon, and a brand new bar. Most of the businesses in this location are brand new and starting up. The strip mall itself is located in a residential area deep in the south side of town (Jones and Robindale) 

Restaurant - it's a little hole in the wall but the place is very inviting. Very simple and the staff (which I'm assuming is the family that owns it) is very friendly. They explained the menu and introduced me to their house specials. 

Food -  their house dishes are called "CC Sizzle" and you get to choose what style it comes in. You can get it in either nacho, burger, burrito, taco and their own house signature, the sopaipilla. All dishes come with rice and beans. Everything is made to order. They roll the dough in front of you and prepare their tortillas on site which is pretty cool. I had the burrito style during my first visit. It comes with 2 medium size burritos which is a huge meal  on its own right. I left very satisfied and stuffed... 

Just a heads up. The place has only been open for 2 months I believe and the owner told me they're still working on the little things. With that said, their drinks are a la carte ' at the moment from a little fridge behind the counter. They have a fountain machine set up but it's not yet operational. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, especially if you're in the neighborhood. It's quick, fresh and food is delicious. If you're craving simple Mexican food, it's a go to spot.
