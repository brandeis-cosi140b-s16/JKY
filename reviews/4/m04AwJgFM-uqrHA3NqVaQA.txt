When we asked some local Mexican friends where to go for authentic Mexican food and, in particular, mole, they unanimously recommended Pepe's.  Howard Seftel's AZ Republic review also recommended the chicken enchiladas with mole.

We went for lunch on a Sunday and fortunately did not witness any "deals" going down.  The restaurant's in a stand-alone building with ample parking.  It's spacious inside with high-backed wooden booths and a long bar.

We ordered:
- Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole:  3 flour tortillas wrapped around shredded chicken breast, covered with black mole and cheese, served with refried beans and rice
 - Tacos Rancheros:  mildly spicy slow-braised pork in choice of soft or crispy taco

The verdict:
- The mole sauce was a delicious combination of spices and chocolate - we wished there could've been more.  I actually prefer dark meat so next time I'll order the Mole Poblano, where they give you choice of chicken leg or breast.  
- Described as a house specialty, the pork was tender and infused with spices.  According to a review posted on the wall, chopped chorizo is also mixed in. 

Dishes on average run between $8 to $10.

We're eager to go back to try the green corn tamales, taco monterrey (machado (sun-dried beef) w/ scrambled eggs) and of course, more mole!
