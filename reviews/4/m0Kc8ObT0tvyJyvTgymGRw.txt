This is one of those places that has been around for forever (1950's).
The food is delicious. Try the Chili Verde; mmmmmm! The food here is made from scratch, not Mexican from a can. You can tell that there is attention made to the quality of the food served here.
Yes, it's out-of-the-way; but you know what?; sometimes the best places are! This is one of those best kept secret places.
The service is attentive and the food is very good.
Go here for lunch; you'll be back!
