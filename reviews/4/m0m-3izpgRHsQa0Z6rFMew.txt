Well, I can't believe that there are 2 really good authentic Little restaurants in the same damn strip mall! This is the best Mexican food your gonna get in Phoenix! I guarantee it! Right here in Avondale. And if you want really good Thai food, about 100 feet around the corner. I love yelp! I've lived in Cali for years and I know good Mexican food. I grew up in Chicago and I know good thai food. You can't go wrong with either one of these. And for the price? It's ridiculous.
