A coworker once told me that Chipotle will not build a new franchise unless there is already a competitor in close proximity. If true, it certainly speaks to Chipotle's confidence that it can beat out any other fast food mexican joint. 

The loooong lines snaking through the the Market Square Chipotle testify that they're winning the battle. Still they move pretty quickly so don't be discouraged. I definitely prefer Chipotle to its neighbor across the street. The ingredients seem fresher and the taste is good. I like the burritos myself.
