Very similar to the food offered at Chipotle, so if you like Chipotle, you may like this chain, too. I tried the shredded beef bowl (without any queso sauces) and it was good. I left pleasantly satisfied. Staff were friendly and a HUGE plus for me here, although probably not for everybody, is that it is a smoke-free environment, too...hip hip hooray!
