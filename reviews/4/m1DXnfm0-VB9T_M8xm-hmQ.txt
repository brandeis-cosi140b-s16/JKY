There are starting to be more "Chipotle" like restaurants, which is a fantastic idea!  I like having to pick what I want instead of settling for what's pre-made on the menu.  

Jaburritos is located on Sahara at the same shopping center as Landry's Seafood and McDonald's.  Plenty of parking.

The place itself is small and a good amount of people are always there.  Luckily, it's never packed enough to where you have no place to sit.  

You enter the line, the menu is above you.  You can either create your own, or select a prefixed item on the menu.  

I went with the Rosarito today, which includes spicy tuna, cucumber, spicy mayo, lettuce, tortilla strips, and other things I can't remember.  I decided to add some salmon for fun.  It's wrapped in your choice of seawood or soypaper.  I like to get the soypaper, plus it looks more like a burrito that way.  The Rosarito was $5.25, but just to add the extra salmon was $1.50 more.  Prices are fair.  

The "burrito" is the size of a regular burrito.  Half is already filling enough.  I tried to eat the second half, but couldn't eat it all. 

 I enjoy these creative places.
