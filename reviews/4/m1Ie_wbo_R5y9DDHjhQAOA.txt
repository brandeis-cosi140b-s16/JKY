What a beautiful restaurant with great indoor and outdoor space!  We came in for Sunday brunch several weeks ago and were really surprised it wasn't busier.  We tried the buttermilk pancakes and the enchiladas suizas...both were pretty darn good.  The atmosphere is living and fun, the service is great and the menu is really unique with many different choices depending on what you are in the mood for.
