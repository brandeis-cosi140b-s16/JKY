Completely blown away by the service. I don't claim to know what a typical experience at Patron is like, but I think this place deserves a glowing review for how they handled the large birthday dinner we thrusted on them. 

+ We had a reservation for around 20 people, and while I promise we are each wonderful as individuals... we can border on obnoxious when together as a group. Luckily, they seated us in a secluded corner of the restaurant at long chain of adjacent tables that managed to fit everyone. They are not low on space here.
+ As people trickled in over the course of maybe 40 minutes, the servers let us take our time to order and were incredibly patient.
+ Constant supply of chips and salsa is dangerously addictive. We never even needed to ask for more; they would just restock as we finished them. 
+ Food came out in a very reasonable time, with delicious and hearty portions for all. Honestly, after all the chips, my boyfriend and I were able to split a Patron Fajita for one and it was completely satisfying.
+ Servers were always polite, whether asking how things were or gently nudging in to take plates away. They also brought extra tortillas, extra plates, hot sauce when we asked.
+ Very accommodating for dietary restriction changes to meals.
+ They were able to split the check for each person like absolute WIZARDS (even accounting for items like margarita pitchers split 6 ways). That alone is pretty amazing, if you've ever been through the awful math of bill-splitting in huge groups.
+ Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.

Overall, it's such a fun place, and I personally loved the service and food. For a large group of friends or family, I highly recommend it! Four and a half stars. :)
