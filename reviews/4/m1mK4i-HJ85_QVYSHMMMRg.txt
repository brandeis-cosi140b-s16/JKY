First time in this restaurant.  It is next to Golds Gym on the n/e of Northsite and Raintree Dr.  

 It is similar to Chipotle but the pinto beans are better tasting, the chicken is all white meat.  The employees are very friendly and will take the time to chat with you.  They learn what you like if you are a regular and will just confirm that there aren't any changes.  
Burritos, tacos and salads are the main items to choose from.  
This is a very good spot to eat and enjoy the food.  The soft drinks are not watered down like most other places are now a days.
Enjoy, I will.   Oh, they have a card that you buy 10 and the next purchase is free.
