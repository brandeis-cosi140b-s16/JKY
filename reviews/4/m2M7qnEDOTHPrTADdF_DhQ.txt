My Husband and I had lunch today at Federicos, he loves their Fish burritos, they are huge  !  we live in scottsdale, but visit this mexican restaurant often, so worth the drive!   they also have good green chile !  they make their beans with soy, so they do  taste a little different !! this place is very clean also !!   good food ! good prices !
