We have been going here for years.  Prior to them acquiring the neighboring business space, adding the Dancefloor, Sunday brunch buffet, and tortilla maker, and renaming themselves to Cabo's.  Think I preferred the "small" before a little better, but the food is still terrific. (Used to see the same waiters and waitresses and they were very customer oriented.)

Salsa and chips are delicious as well as the Sangria. One of my favorites is the Burrito California and my kids love the fajitas.  Big disappointment the last time I went was the $1 charge for extra tortillas. They used to be free (you only get 3 tortillas for double fajitas, not enough!)

Will keep going there for the consistently delicious food.
