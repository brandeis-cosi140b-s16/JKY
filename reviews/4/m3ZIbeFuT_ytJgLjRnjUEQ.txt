If you're in Vegas and looking for some good quality Mexican food hit this place up.. The menudo was almost as good as my Grandma's! The tortillas were fresh, the rice and beans tasted homemade and the price was decent.. The salsa was not the greatest, but if you ask them they will bring out the good stuff..
