There are 800+ reviews at "The Mission" for a legit reason, the place is really good.
You can come here casually and chill on the patio or go inside for a more classy, intimate environment. This restaurant truly provides an amazingly tasty experience and from what we were told, hosts a renoun chef. Now take what I'm saying with a grain of salt, I am not hispanic so if you are looking for 100% authenticity it might not be here However, this food is still amazingly tasty. Definitely a bit pricy, but for a tourist you should definitely come by here if you are in Old town scottsdale.
