Hungry and craving Mexican food, stumbled on this restaurant that has been it's fair share of places over the years. In fact, I believe it was an Elephant Bar when it was built. Well, it was a stumble I was happy I made. I mean, how bad could it have been ... how bad could it have turned out? It is conveniently located a couple of short blocks from Sunrise Hospital. If things went bad, I had a back-up plan.

Very large restaurant - us, one other table, and 1 person at the bar ... service was excellent.  As soon as we sat, we were given a cheese quesadilla - nice touch. Also, given fresh, hot, recently made chips with salsa. Ordered the Carne Asada Plate. Delicious! Nice, good cut of steak (not thin like I normally would have expected). Served with homemade (well, restaurant made) tortillas (corn or flour).

I will for sure return. Looks like several good seafood options - including shrimp wrapped in bacon.
