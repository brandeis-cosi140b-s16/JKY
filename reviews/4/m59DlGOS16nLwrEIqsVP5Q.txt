This place was pretty good for the price. It's kind of like a Chiptole except with burrito-sized sushi. I ordered the Jaburrito Wakiki and the texture and flavors were great. The chicken, corn, and crisps along with the seaweed and rice was definitely a great combination. I also had some taro chips that came with some cheese for dipping. The cheese was cold, but I think it was to compliment the sushi. The chips were seasoned, but they were nothing special. The salsa bar looked like the salsa came from a store-bought jar, but it still tasted ok. 

The music that plays is absolutely great, by the way. This place is has a great gimmick. I might stop by again to try another jaburrito.
