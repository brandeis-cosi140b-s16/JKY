I just stopped off for lunch last week. I order tacos from their "sushi style" Taco card. I was the Coolest concept to order taco's like you order sushi rolls. I ordered a flank steak taco with a Jalape√±o stuffed with cheese and a Fish Taco . The tacos had been delivered in my to go bag as if I picked them up from a nice taco cart and the flavor was outrageously good. So much flavor, with homemade and fresh ingredients, it was definitely made with love. I cant wait to go back and try more.
