The fiance had a conversation with his  coworkers about their favorite food spots and this came up a few times. I've heard of it, but we're not around this area often, but decided to head down. I've been looking for some new Mexican eateries. 

The food is more Yucatan region judging from some of their menu offerings and the way they cook their staples. It's a bit different from what I'm used to, but I liked it. 

I got a combo of chicken tamales and chicken enchiladas (which comes with red sauce but I asked for green) and the fiance got cheese enchilada and chicken tamale. The tamale was stuffed with chicken and had a tomato sauce over it. I think I prefer a bit more masa, but this was quality. Enchilada also was plentiful with chicken in it and I enjoyed their green sauce. The beans is more pureed than what I do and had a interesting roasty flavor about it. Rice was standard, but good.

The service was friendly and good. We both appreciated that we were able to sub minor things in our combo with no problems. We were checked on often and drinks were refilled.We came at not a busy time, and in the areas where people weren't sitting, some of the staff were doing some cleaning and prepping before dinner. Definitely appreciate a place that is cleaning daily.

I'll definitely be back. It's not the style of Mexican food I grew up with, but it's nice to shake it up sometimes. I'll try something that is more Yucatan like the panuchos next time.
