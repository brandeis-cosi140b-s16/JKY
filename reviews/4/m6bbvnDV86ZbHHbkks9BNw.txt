I had the arrachera and wife had shrimp tacos and they were pretty good! We also had the Carne asada quesadilla and it also very good. The salsas were very tasty, not very spicy though. The margaritas were well made and had a good balance if taste and alcohol. Very nice and clean restaurant with very friendly staff. We will be back for sure.
