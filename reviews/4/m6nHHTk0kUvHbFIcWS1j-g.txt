Pedros serves up everything you would want from an Americanized, cheesey Mexican restaraunt. They have some over the top mariachi music playing in the dining room, fake parrot cages hanging from the ceiling, free chips and salsa, solid service, gigantic burritos smothered in cheese and a ginormous variety of margaritas. While I won't venture to say this represents anything close to legitimate Mexican cuisine, it is exactly what the doctor ordered for like 95% of Madisonians.

My favorite things about this place:
-Fresh tortillas, pressed and warmed in the dining room
-Flavored Margarita variety, because Strawberry should be standard, but blue is something to be applauded
-Corn cakes - don't waste your sides on anything else, double down on these guys
-Karaoke in the bar with super cheap margarita mugs
-Seafood Suiza - even with olives (yuck) this is my favorite enchilada anywhere
-Fried Ice Cream - this place is where it was invented as far as I'm concerned

Pro tip: Don't order off the menu for your kids, a buttered tortilla with crushed up chips and a little salsa is probalby the best thing they have, and its not even on the menu. Pretty awesome, don't knock it til you try it.
