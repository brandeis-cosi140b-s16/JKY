Okay - this might not be the food find of the year and were not talking about anything earth shattering... but it needs to be said.

Roberto's tacos has 99cent  chicken tacos on wednesday!  Talk about cheap eats!  Everyday I struggle with the "where to eat a cheap lunch --- other than subway"  ... dilema.

So these crunchy and tasty little tacos do the trick!  The taco is premade, but they fry it up and stuff it with cheese and lettuce.  Its that simple and it is that good.  I ate 5 tacos for lunch and went back for dinner and ate 4 more!!!!!

BTW - this particualr Robertos is in the nicest gas station I have ever been in!  Do not be afraid of a taco shop in a gas station.
