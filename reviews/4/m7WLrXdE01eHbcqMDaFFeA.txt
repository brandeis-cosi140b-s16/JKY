We ran into the Tamale Store purveyors at the Citadelle Market a few weeks back.  In the fall/halloween spirit, we decided to get two of their pumpkin tamales (frozen).  The next night for a nice dessert, we prepared them in the steamer.  I don't know what I was expected, but, wow, they sure were good.  Went back the next week, and decided to get something a little more savory (in addition to a couple more pumpkin ones).  We settled on two ground beef/cheese and two green chili chicken.  Again, we prepared them in the steamer from frozen.  And again, they were quite good, I cleaned my plate and part of my wife's as well.  Definitely will be getting more tamales from there, they are so good.

The only thing keeping them from a five star review is that in the two pack of ground beef tamales, there was one ground beef and one shredded meat (probably beef, but quite possibly pork).  Hopefully it was just a one time mistake, a lot of people (like me!) don't eat pork for one reason or another...
