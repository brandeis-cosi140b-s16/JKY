Oh, where do I go in the Venetian when I just need a normal drink?  Why Taqueria Canonita of course!  I've eaten here on previous visits to Vegas and know that it's pretty quality Mexican food.

So this time, I came for drinks and chips and salsa.  The bar service was great.  Chips and salsa plentiful.  My fresh blackberry mojito is my new favorite drink I think.  It was perfectly tart and sweet and minty.  I highly recommend it if they have fresh blackberries that day.  

I really enjoy this place.  Sitting at the bar and relaxing after a crazy convention day is just what I needed.  The bartender provided good drinks and conversation.  I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas.
