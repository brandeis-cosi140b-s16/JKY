Have been eating at Mendoza's for the last 10 years.  Initially, we had to drive to Noblestown road, then Bethel Park and finally, they moved to Mt. Lebanon.

Mendoza's is delicious, authentic Acapulco type food.  I look at some of the posts on this site and realize that most Americans do not recognize authenticity.  Fish tacos and a variety of shrimp dishes is a dead giveaway.

Pricing is good and alcohol is typical prices.  I've taken my family of 5 for dinner, no alcohol and the bill is always under $50-60.

Abraham the owner and Fernando the head waiter are great.  Very accomodating.

Lastly, there used to be a Taco Bell one block away from Mendoza's.  After a year, the Taco Bell's business had dropped off so far that they closed.  If this is not a testament to the quality and affordability of this restaurant, nothing else will convince you to give them a try.
