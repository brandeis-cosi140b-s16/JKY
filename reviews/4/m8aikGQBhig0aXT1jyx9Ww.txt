I love Korean food. And I love Mexican food, how awesome is it to combine the two? Well, it's really good!!

Definitely must-try's are Bulgolgi fries, even the half size is very big... lots of fries with jalapenos, cheese and bulgogi- it's a very savory and filling mix. And OMG, the kimchi fried rice was HELLA good, greasy, but that's because it's fried. The fried rice packed a lot of flavors in every bite, my favorite dish here! If you want a healthier option, the chicken fusion burrito is delicious and feels very light. The chicken tasted like it was lightly grilled or boiled, but something about it made it very moist, yet very healthy (non-greasy). The salsa in the burrito is really refreshing!

The restaurant is a little crowded. The workers are sooo nice and pretty attentive. The prices are really good considering the amount you get. 

Just fyi, if you want spices, you have to ask for it. :)

They also give you chips, salsa, and guacamole when you come in.
