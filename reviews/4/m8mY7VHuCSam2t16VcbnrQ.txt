Whenever I'm in town, I always stop by for a breakfast burrito to start off the day.  They changed the parking a little bit so it's difficult to park on Mohave, but the lot on the west side of the building usually has a few spaces.  Although the surrounding neighborhood is a little run down and the wrought iron door can be a little intimidating, there is plenty of great food inside.

Ordering is pretty straightforward and they're great at the basics.  The tortillas are always made fresh and you can see them prepare it.  Machaca isn't too common in the midwest, so it's always great to get some eggs, salsa, and machaca breakfast burrito.  It comes out hot and the tortilla is a little floury.  The value is always great here and there is plenty of spices and seasoning in anything you try.  The chorizo and potato breakfast burrito is also one of my faves.  A great place to start the day!
