Fun and contemporary place. I love the fact that the menu is tapas style. This allows you to try a variety of items instead of just one plate. We tried a couple of sushi rolls, mini tacos and pad thai. It was all delicious and atmosphere of the restaurant was energetic. 

I strongly recommend this place. It's fun to visit once in awhile and I'm sure the patio will be the place to be once the weather cools down a little more.
