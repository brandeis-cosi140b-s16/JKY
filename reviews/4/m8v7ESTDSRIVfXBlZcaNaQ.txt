What distinguishes this El Pollo Loco from most others is its spacious dining room. The staff here also does a nice job of maintaining the salsa bar, an area in which some locations fall short. 

Located on the back side of Arizona Mills shopping mall, near some other restaurants that have closed, the location offers a quiet break from the chaos of the mall. It's also easily accessible if you are passing by and not visiting the mall itself.
