Tasty, reliable Mexican food. Been here several times.

The highlight is always the table made guacamole, made to your specifications (i.e. I tell them to give my husband the jalapenos as I can't handle the spice). The fajitas and barbacoa tacos are my favorites. My husband tries something different every time and has never had a bad meal. 

I've never had bad service here. We generally like to come for lunch.
