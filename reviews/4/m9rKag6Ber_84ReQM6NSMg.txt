Great little place.  We ordered shredded beef tacos, beef and potato tacos, carne asada burrito, bean tostada, and a cheese enchilada.  All were awesome.  The salsa and red sauce were both good as well.  Everything tasted authentic, even the beans and rice.  Casual, cheap, clean, local, and family owned.  I'm glad we finally went.  We'll be back.
