Not a bad place - especially for an airport.  Know that they'll always be crowded during peak travel times and usually understaffed so the bartenders especially will be running around like crazy and they're actually quite good yet people will still be complaining about service.  That being said, the house margaritas are very good - and large - and as far as airports go the price isn't too bad for a top shelf margarita that basically fills the glass twice.  On the food side, the crab cake sandwich was excellent with a fresh jicama slaw on top and I got it with chips & guacamole which were pretty good.  On a second visit I ordered tacos immediately upon sitting down which never came in the 45 minutes I was at the bar but it was a Thursday evening and the place was packed and the bartender took it off my bill so not a huge deal.  If I was starving I would have asked about it every 5 minutes but everyone was running around like crazy so I didn't bother them.

There are a few decent places in the central area of the Charlotte airport, but I would definitely come back here again and appreciate the large number of bar seats that are available.  Not perfect, but pretty good option for an airport restaurant & bar.
