I love this place. I always feel like I'm walking into a grandma's kitchen when go. The chips and salsa are always fresh and tasty. The seasoned chicken burro enchilada style is my fav. It's pretty massive, and I can only finish it when I'm absolutely starving. The booths are big and comfy, and the bottomless beverages are always a plus in my book.
