I got two words. "Tijuana. Hotdog." It is a delightful, gravity defying, awe inspiring, bacon wrapped pork stick, deep fried, and lovingly dressed with diced tomatoes, onions, and jalapenos.  I shared one with my wife, thinking that it would be too heavy and greasy to have along with my meal.   I deeply regret offering to do so.    It was so good I wanted it all to myself!

I expected to fall into a deep coma after eating it, but I felt energetic and lively.  Could it have been the bacon induced hypertension kicking it?  Quite possibly, but it tasted much lighter and less greasy than I would have expected.  I also enjoyed a shrimp diablo burrito and my wife got fish tacos which were all excellent.  Normally  I associate Sriracha with asian food.  My shrimp weren't as spicy as their name would suggest, so I gave their Sriracha a try and it complemented the Mexican food perfectly.  They also have house made sauces which were good, but get a few as the containers are small.

It's a bit of a hole, light on atmosphere, but generous with great freshly made, inventive Mexican food, low prices, friendly knowledgeable staff, and every reason to come again soon.  Only a donkey would not love El Burro!
