Best green chili burrito in AZ!  I always get the green chili mixed with beans inside a burrito.  Typically I take around 5 bites, and the burrito falls apart because all the goodness is spilling out.  I had the tacos once, and they were really good.  But it is the green chili I crave.  I took off a star because in the summer, it is way too hot to sit outside.
