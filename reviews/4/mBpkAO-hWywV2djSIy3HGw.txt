I eat here all the time since it is near my work. There are 4 or 5 other Mexican restaurants in the area but Mr. Taco is the most authentic I think. They are always friendly and glad to see you. There are  Mexican folks eating there all the time. The prices are great and I always leave full. The lunch fajitas are delicious and always more than I can eat. It's just good simple Mexican food without all the flashy Americanized junk piled on.
