I judge all Mexican restaurants by their chips and salsa, rice, beans, tacos and enchiladas. I have to say this place hits the spot. The rice and beans remind me of my moms home cooking. The chips are warm and served with green and red salsa, both delicious. The enchilada sauce isn't bad at all, although I've had better, and the hard shell taco has a nice crisp to it. 

I really enjoyed both the food and atmosphere at this place. This place felt authentic and comforting. The staff and even the customers are all Mexican.... Except for me, the half breed. I'm definitely coming back to try their Camarones al mojo de ajo.
