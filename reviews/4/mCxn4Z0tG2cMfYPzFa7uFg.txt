I won't lie, the breakfast burrito was really good; but, when every other word out of their mouths were "pinche, pinche, pinche".

My Chorizo Breakfast Burrito was very, very goo!  In fact, so good, I may come back regardless of Fausto's colorful employees' after all, they give the place authenticity!
