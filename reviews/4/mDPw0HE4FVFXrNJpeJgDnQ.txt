I live across the street from here and for 6+ months have been telling myself I would stop in ... I finally did and I was pleased!!  The bf and I popped in for a late lunch/early dinner and the place was empty (4pm on a Saturday) which we found a little odd, but sat down at the bar anyway.  Bf had the Calderita (a margarita with jalapeno infused tequila) it was too spicy for me, but he liked that it wasn't overly sweetened like other margs. I had the strawberry mojito which was nice and not overly sweet either. the bartender brought us out some chips, salsa and some green chile dip while we waited for food. Chips didn't appear to be homemade, but I didn't care because that warm green dip was so good! I coulda put it on cardboard and been happy.  ;)
I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered the "small nachos" with chicken. This is $5 at full price and I wasn't expecting the mass pile of food that was placed in front of me. Everything you want in a nacho was there... Lots of cheese, black beans, lots of succulent shredded chicken, pico, guac and sour cream. Love-love-loved it! I over ate and left way too full.
The bf had the chicken mole and he claimed it to be his new official favorite mole. Their mole is a family recipe and he made sure to give compliments to the chef!  He got 2 sides with his entree and one of his choices was a lemon-cilantro rice... I of course had to try this.... Matter of fact, I tried about 4 bites cuz it was so good!
The bartender said they do a happy hour all day on Sunday, so I'm thinking the next time I get a wild hair and bar-hop on Sunday, I have to work them into rotation!
