Well I drove from Ahwatukee to QC to check this place out with a local San Tan Friend. It's really out there (distance wise) but well worth the drive. Good pour on the house margaritas and good drink as well. The food was presented well, hot and delicious. I most likely would have given it a 5 star but I have to say even though it was overcast that day they need to turn the AC up a bit....I was glowing (and not from pleasure of the food) throughout the meal - Wouldn't want to experience it on a full sun / hot day for sure unless then they aren't so frugal with the A/C.....phew!

Oh, the salmon and mango tacos rocked ! Good "chips" too....with the salsa...
