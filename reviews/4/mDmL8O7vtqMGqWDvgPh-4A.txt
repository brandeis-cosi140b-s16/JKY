So its a Wednesday night. Dont feel like cooking.  Found a Groupon.  Mexican sounds ok. 
I scan the yelp reviews and figure its a gamble.
So we decide to check it out. Well I am happy to report it was good. We both ordered enchiladas.  I have the three ameigos.  Beef chicken and cheese w all 3 sauces. The beef is shredded.  Tasted like beef stew meat almost.  It was good but my least favorite.  The chicken was shredded.  All white meat. Very tasty.  The green sauce was my favorite.  The white was good too. The red was my least fav. 
Hubby liked his as well. We ordered soft drinks and 2 fried ice creams to go. It all came to about $38
So not bad with a groupon. Its a little high priced for the quality.  It was tasty but I prefer fresh high quality food. This is your standard American Mexican.  Not bad. Definitely recommend with a Groupon.  Service was great. The guy was very friendly.  I think he may have been the owner.  
We were served in like 4 min. It was nutz. In and out of there in under 30 min. I left feeling lile a stuffed thanksgiving bird.
