a little hard to find.  Don't be fooled by the exterior.  Has a nice little covered outdoor patio with 6 picnic tables to sit at. 

Food was good. Street tacos are smaller than I expected but that's just me not knowing better. 

The owner is a guy who grew up in Chile and moved here.  This guy has good prices, good food, fast service and a clean place to eat. 

Went based off yelper recommendations so we tried it and we're not disappointed.

After the 3 tacos I went back for a spicy chix tamale and burrito (both were much larger than the tacos). 

The guacamole sauce is awesome!

Enjoyed the side of onions and jalape√±os that come with your order too. 

Try it!  My 3 month old baby even liked the smell :)
