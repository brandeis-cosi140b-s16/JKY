This will be a 3.5 star review. A really old Carl's Jr/Green burritos building that has been converted into a Mexican paradise theme. The building in not that big but hosts ALOT of small tables and chairs for this place gets popping on weekends due to live music. 

The staff here is excellent it seems to be the same group working every time I have came here so you know consistansy with food recipes and service will always be good. 5/5 

Atmosphere is pretty cool here, they have a bar up front and a small bar in back  for the weekends. The beach motique actually works here. They also have a medium size patio with misters for a pleasant smoke and drink 4/5

Food is where it gets great! I have had multiple things here over the years and haven't been disappointed. The red chili burrito is huge and delicious! I'm 6'5 230 pounds and the burrito is like my hand + some!! Also have great breakfast burritos and green chili.. 

Come on weekends for live music and festive drinking for every weekend is Cinco De Mayo at Mixteca ...
