Josh, our server, took great care of us today during lunch. He was so friendly and helpful. 

I wanted to order the seafood guac without the guac. He went and asked the chef if this was possible. Yes, it certainly was, and it would only cost me $5. So I ordered that - happily - with the side of black beans with orza for $2. 

YUM! 

There was more than enough for me to finish, but every mouthful was delicious. 

I still think this place is a little over-priced. They didn't offer us a lunch menu; instead, we had to choose from their main menu. BUMMER. So, if you're looking for a lunch deal, you're out of luck here, though I did manage to have a hearty lunch (still feel full 5 hours later) for under $10!

This time around I found the service was more than accommodating today. Definitely 4 stars! I still love, love, love the atmosphere and decor! 

(I left a "You've Been Yelped Card" at the table. Booyah!)
