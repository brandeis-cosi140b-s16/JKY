I've eaten at a lot of Chipotles in California and I never reviewed them because they were so common.  I'll make an exception for Charlotte :)

Chipotle is a winning concept - fresh and accessible.  It gives you a pseudo healthy feeling and options (if you really want to be healthy).  It is not at all authentic, but it is tasty.  The assembly line, Subway-esque, made-to-order line works.  The menu is simple, choose your entree (burrito, bowl, taco) and your protein, the rest is entirely up to you.

I recommend the burrito bowl with tortillas on the side (so much food and this way you can wrap what you can't eat) or the tacos (3 to an order).  Their carnitas (shredded pork) is always moist.  I'm not a fan of their chicken, which has a fake smoked flavor.

Pile on plenty of corn salsa (the best!), a bit of sour cream and lettuce and you are good to go.

Seating at Chipotles is always kind of uncomfortable, varnished plywood and steel doesn't make for comfy seating.  Get it to go and have a meal for two days if you get the burrito bowl.
