So far, so GOOD!  For the first experience, I have to say, very good. I will return! The tomatillo salsa, a little too limey, but the roasted red pepper salsa was good. Chips were light and tasty. Waitress was so nice and attentive. Guess they've only been open for 3 weeks, but nice start. Keep up the good work!
