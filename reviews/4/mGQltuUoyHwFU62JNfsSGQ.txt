My boyfriend came home from work one day and said that one of his coworkers whose husband was born and raised in Mexico, had said that El Milagro is the most like authentic Mexican food that he has ever had in a restaurant.  Mexican food might be our favorite, so we had to go.  

It is amazing.  The restaurant itself is nothing great, and the one and only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars.  But the food is awesome.  The homemade chips and salsa were out of this world.  Next time we go I'll be buying a bag of chips to take home.  I forget what I got for an entree but I remember thinking it was so good.  

Definitely try this place, it's a hidden gem.
