I truly enjoy the fire roasted chicken here.  The price is affordable and well worth the money.  I am somewhat luke warm with regards to dark meat which they seem to promote.  The side dishes are good and they have free salsa in the condiment area.  Fries typically take a few more minutes to prepare.

Good overall.
