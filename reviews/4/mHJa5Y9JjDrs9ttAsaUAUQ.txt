This place has really good Mexican food. Ok place- not too fancy - not too much of a dive.  Service is good. Atmosphere is perfect for Authentic Mexican food. We go with our large family often. They do a great job keeping up with all of us. We also go as a couple often. I recommend it to anyone. 

I think I've had everything on the menu and would recommend it all. They have some hot sauce that you have to ask for that is amazing. Ask for the spicy salsa or if you are up to it the habanero salsa :)
