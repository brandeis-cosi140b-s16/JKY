This is a Mexican seafood restaurant and grocery.  You can dine-in or buy fish to bring home and cook.

For those who are unschooled in the field of eating in combo fish-shop/restaurants, the place will smell faintly like fish.  Fair warning if you find the smell repugnant.  Also, if you're experience with Mexican seafood ends with the fish taco or Baja Fresh, be warned - this place is not quite what you are expecting.

I dropped in, lured by promises of $5.99 lunch specials, and was surprised at the prices on the menu - most items were in the double-digit range, and I was only looking for a quick, cheap lunch.

The menu is large and varied, with everything from beef to octopus fully represented.  As tempting as the more expensive entre√©s sounded, I diligently stuck to my budget, opting for the $5.99 shrimp burrito.

$5.99 isn't bargain-basement for a burrito, but for a flour tortilla stuffed with shrimp, a standard ensalada, and some flavorful rice with vegetables, I'll bite.

The shrimp was in a sauce that had hints of citrus and tomato, and another bright, tangy note that I couldn't quite place. The shrimp itself was excellently cooked, not soggy like poor-quality ceviche or overly-rubbery like poorly defrosted frozen camarones. In short, delicious.

The rice tasted like it was cooked in some kind of broth, and had tomatoes and carrots thrown in for good measure.  Also delicious.

The salad was the standard that you get in most Mexican places, but, importantly, the iceberg lettuce, green bell pepper, and tomato all tasted fresh.  No limp lettuce here.  The veggies provided a very satisfying crunch to the burrito and the rice.

They also served beer and liquor.
