Divey Whole in Wall alert.

Solid Mexican Foods to eat on the run. I especially  love the Chorizo and Egg burrito. 
It  is a generous portion of egg and greasy chorizo wrapped in a  fresh flour tortilla. 
The Bean and Cheese Burrito is very tasty too and generous in portion as well. 

While not much to look at, it is no frills and the service is good. Food is made fresh and it  has great flavor.  Don't expect to anything but good basic mexican food for a fast and easy price.
