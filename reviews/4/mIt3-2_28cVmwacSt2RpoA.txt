Just short of 5 stars.  
I went on a Sat. evening several months ago and finally got around to this.  A friend and I split 3 items:  
Guacamole Casero (prepared tableside) - excellent!
some Chile Relleno - a special that night, not on menu - excellent!
Ensalada del Barrio - good - not incredible like the other two items

Wonderfully flavored food with a great combo of textures, which is essential for me.  The place is cute, welcoming and colorful.  Our server - a very engaging guy, forget his name - was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly - wonderful service.   The parking is scarce and it's pretty crowded, plus a long wait on weekends but that's to be expected because the food is great and word gets around!
