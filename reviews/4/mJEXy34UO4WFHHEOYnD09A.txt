This unassuming little restaurant has a secret. It has the best Philly cheese steaks in the West Valley. What are my credentials? I am a native South Philadelphian. Who can beat that? We invented the cheese steak.

The roll is just right: tough on the outside and soft inside. The steak is tender. My son said it melts in his mouth. 

They also serve an impressive Mexican menu. I took a photo of it for the review.

Everyone here is so very pleasant. It is always a joy to stop by after movies at Harkins Park West.
