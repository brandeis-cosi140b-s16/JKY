To take a step away from the more authentic Mexican places we've been eating lately, we decided to try out Salsa's, which is more towards the Americanized style of Mexican food.  That doesn't make it bad - just different, so if you're wanting authentic, you may want to go elsewhere.

Inside of this Salsa's, the decor is very nice.  The only complaint is the lighting.  Along the right side of the restaurant, the ceiling fans and the low lights combine to create a very annoying strobe affect.  It was so bad we had to move.  Once we did, it wasn't a problem at all.

Service was excellent, speedy and efficient all around.  Glasses were kept filled, and food came out quickly.  One thing I'll typically do at a new restaurant (new for me, not necessarily brand new) is ask for advice, and the waiter offered it.  A nice touch.  I hate it when they can't do so.

The food was tasty - ingredients were fresh, sauces were not overwhelming.  I had a (steak) chimichanga, and it was one of the better ones that I can recall tasting.  For this sort of Mexican, I'd highly suggest you try them out.
