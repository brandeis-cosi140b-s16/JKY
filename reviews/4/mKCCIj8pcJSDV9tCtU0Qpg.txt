my girls and i would stop by all the time and would always enjoy our evenings here but this time my bf and i decided to stop by for brunch and wasnt that wowed about it...sure they had a variety of food but it wasnt tasty as their regular dishes...the only good thing was that we left paying $25 for brunch and 8 margaritas which were included in the brunch...oh and cant forget about the homemade tortillas made there...stop by and order from their regular menu you cant go wrong with that...btw the service here is awesome they are all very welcoming and always on top of things!
