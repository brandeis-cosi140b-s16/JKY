Top shelf margaritas were excellent. Guac made by our table was good and to order. Yay jalape√±os. Chicken enchilada was great - not too heavy and he sauce was yummy. Aztec steal and butterfly steak was 3/5 stars bc while steak had good flavor it wasn't very tender. Shrimp were good. Kid's chicken quesadilla was 3.5/5 because wasn't well put together but chicken had good flavor. Flan was great - former flan lovers, this one is for you!
