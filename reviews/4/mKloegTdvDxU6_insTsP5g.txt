Looking for a romantic, cozy place to take your date on Saturday night? If so, this is certainly NOT the place for it. However, if you want to practice your Spanish skills and eat awesome food from a truck parked on a busy road, this is your spot!

I had two tacos: carne asada and al pastor. Both were excellent. I also had a vampiro with carnitas...kind of like a tostada. The meat is really juicy and tender. All of it tastes like it has been marinating for a good amount of time.

I've spent a fair amount of time in Mexico and this made me feel like I was a back there. To my right, a woman selling bootleg DVDs. To my left, Spanish-speaking families drinking soda out of glass bottles. Not the best area of town and to be honest, it smells a little funny...but if that doesn't put you off go check it out!
