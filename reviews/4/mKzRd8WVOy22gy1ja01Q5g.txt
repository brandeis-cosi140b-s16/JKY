I really like the food... I'm not going to lie this is 5 star food if you're drunk.  Which is completely awesome!  It's 4 star for any other time because it makes the quota for having veg options and really good flavor and they've cleaned it up a lot! I just don't like how sometimes it's too cold and It's very bare.... but those are my only complaints! The people who work there are always sweeet!!!
