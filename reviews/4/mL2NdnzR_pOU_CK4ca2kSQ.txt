Great food with a great view. There's a reason that this place has a long wait on weekends.

I must mention that the service here is really good and very attentive. On our most recent visit our waiter checked on us frequently. There was always a staff member in our section making sure that every need and want was met. 

The view here is awesome. The restaurant is situated on a hill so certain dining rooms offer a great view of the valley. There is also an outdoor area that offers a nice view. 

The food isn't just the standard burritos and enchiladas even though those are awesome as well. The menu is huge and offers many more authentic options as well as the standard Mexican restaurant offerings. The chips and salsa that start each meal don't disappoint. I also enjoy the soup that comes with most of the meals. The food isn't as cheap as most Mexican restaurants, but I figure you're also buying the view.

This is an awesome spot for good Mexican food that makes you want to come back.
