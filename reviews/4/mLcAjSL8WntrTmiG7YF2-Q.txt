Went to Joyride today and really had a wonderful time.  Their salsa is fantastic and I wasn't even to the bottom of the chips when they brought me a refill of chips and salsa. The food is fresh and just the right portions and lots of vegetarian options available.  I recommend the Mexican corn from the starter menu and the pineapple Fresca!  Joyride's Happy Hour specials are the best just like all the Upward restaurants.  I hung out there with a few friends for an hour or two without pressure to leave or order more. I will definitely frequent Joyride.
