Best mexican place in the university area. Service has always been great for me and my friends, and the wait staff has always been helpful. Portions are huge. 

My only complaint is the venue itself. On a busy night, it can get quite loud. More importantly, if you're not sitting in a booth, seating is cramped and public, as there are no dividers between any of the tables.
