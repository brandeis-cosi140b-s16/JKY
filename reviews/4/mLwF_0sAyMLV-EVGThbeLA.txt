Time of Visit:  Dinner around 7 on a Sunday Night @ the Waterfront (and it was nice outside)

Not too crowded, we were seated immediately!
In fact, we were originally seated @ a table and a manager asked us if we'd prefer a booth instead (well, of course!).  So he had a table bused and moved up immediately.

Service:  Wasn't bad, but I think our waiter was new.  There were other waiters that seemed to be really on top of it and the manager that moved us was very nice!!  Our waiter wasn't "bad" by any means, we didn't want for anything, he just lacked personality.

Atmosphere:        Small restaurant, about 10-15 booths surrounding the perimeter of the restaurant and a handful of tables in the middle.
There was a cute bar area too with tall chairs.  They do have a Full Bar; it was clearly stocked with many different types of liquors.
As a whole, this place is VERY clean!!   (as were the bathrooms!  Yay!)

Food:          Very generous portions and flavorful!
I'd recommend the Fundito Pollo (its basically a Chicken Chimichanga);
Oh!  Get the sour cream "on the side"; trust me... it was COVERED! LOL
My husband got a beef burrito (which he said was probably the best he'd ever had) and a taco which was also good.

Pricing:       Not bad @ all!   For the both of us our bill was just a tad over $25 and, as I mentioned earlier, the portions were very generous!
