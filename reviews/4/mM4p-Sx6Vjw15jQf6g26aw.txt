Honestly, I only ate here so I could get a Pink Taco tank top for my girlfriend. It gets 4 stars instead of 3 for having a name that makes me smile every time I say it.

The food is good, though not particularly authentic (what is in Vegas?). The portions are a little smaller than I expected, but the service was fast and the atmosphere is hip and fun. 

It's one of those places in Vegas, you go, just to say you've been there.
