I think their name should be Vaqueros Grande Burritos  As our burritos were HUGE. 

We stopped in after a hike, inside is reasonably nice all things considered. There is a free chips and salsa bar allays a huge plus and a decent menu. 

I went for a $4.35 vegetarian burrito, it was a mix of just about every non meat ingredients  a place like this has, cheese, lettuce guacamole sour cream etc. It was a bit messy to eat and the sour cream made it quite rich.  The salsa/ hot sauce here is great smooth and quite spicy.

Stop in grab a burrito and be full.
