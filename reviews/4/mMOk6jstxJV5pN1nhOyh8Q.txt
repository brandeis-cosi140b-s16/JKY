Get the queso!  Actually, I enjoy both the queso and the salsa; they are also good together.  The chips are huge; you'll have to break them up to make them manageable.  I've tried all of the enchilada flavors now and prefer the beef ones just because they come with red sauce.  The rice is a little sweet because of the corn, and the beans have a hint of a roasted flavor.  If at all possible, save room for the kahlua ice cream pie - delicious!
