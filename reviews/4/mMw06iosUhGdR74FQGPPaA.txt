I've been a semi-regular (once a month) at this Moe's since they opened back in '01 or so.  At first my training buddy and I frequented it for the large, and relatively healthy, chicken burritos...(the Joey Bag O Donuts.)  They also have a salsa bar with some really good options including one called "Who Is Kaiser Salsa?" (See "The Usual Suspects" for reference.) The friendly atmosphere (Welcome to Moe's!) and dead-musician theme and made it a unique favorite.  This Moe's has become a neighborhood institution as shown by the outpouring of sympathy and support in the aftermath of the tragedy a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, the service and quality have also slipped over the years.  Nowadays you don't always get a welcome shout and the staff just don't seem to be as focused on the customers as they used to be.  In fact, they seem to spend a lot of time shouting at full volume to each other.  However, it's still a good lunch at a good price in the heart of Dilworth.
