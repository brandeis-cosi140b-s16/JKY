I had an errand to do close by and only 30 minutes to grab something to eat, thanks to Yelp, I found this little gem.  When I walked in, I was greeted by the staff and when they learned that it was my first visit, they told me all about how it works, gave me samples of each of the meats.  I was excited about the shrimp tacos they offer on Friday (so I will be heading back on Friday to try them).  I did the burrito platter and it was excellent.  I really liked the fresh and authentic guacamoleo.
