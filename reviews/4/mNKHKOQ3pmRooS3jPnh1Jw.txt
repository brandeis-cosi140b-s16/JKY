Lazy whole-foods, plant-based dieters unite! The guac was always clutch (yes, I know it's extra) and then the pinto beans became "animal friendly" more recently. Truly a dream come true now that they feature sofritas - organic shredded tofu braised with chipotle chilis, poblano peppers, and 'aromatic spices' - in other words: bippity boppity boo! - because the finished product is magical and will make you wish they delivered in a pumpkin horse drawn carriage (note the aforementioned laziness - a girl can dream, right?). 

And on to the staff...the welcoming, personable, efficient, talented, and helpful people they pay to get shit done - and done well. Really well. Stupendously well if you ask me. (You did ask me, didn't you?) They know what they're doing and I like to tell them that. You should consider telling them that, too, if you just so happen to agree. It's a kind, unexpected, painless thing to do that just might make their day a little brighter and as kid president would say, "We should all be a little nicer to each other because it's hard being a person sometimes." BOOM.
