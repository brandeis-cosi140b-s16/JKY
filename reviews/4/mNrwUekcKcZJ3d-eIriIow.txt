We picked this place to eat because it was the only place close and open. We ordered a lot of food and they were amazing. I got the fish tacos which were great. The Tortas were good too. My friend got the quesadillas and they were the bomb. We were not drunk either. The fries sucked but the price made up for it. Very cheap for what you pay for.
