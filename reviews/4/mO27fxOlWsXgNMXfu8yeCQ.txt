Our local friends who have school-aged children chose this place.  It was affordable.  It was loud, so kids cannot disturb the peace.  They have a lovely outdoor seating area looking out over a pond.  I ordered enchiladas, and was impressed with the quantity and quality of the meat inside.  The food was of good quality, and the service was pleasant and accommodating.  The beers were served in glasses with matching logos.  That's how Negro Modelo tastes its best.
