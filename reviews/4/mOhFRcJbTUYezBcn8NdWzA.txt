Ate here yesterday the food was really good the 2 burritos I got were really big and when I'm talking big I mean big enough to fill you up the rest of the day the fries were good as they were fresh and crispy and they give you alot of fries. The cheese quesadilla was good but way too much cheese but it was still good the only negative about this place is that if you want to go to the bathroom you have to go all the way through the back of the kitchen but other then that this will be my go to spot to eat at when I'm craving Mexican food.
