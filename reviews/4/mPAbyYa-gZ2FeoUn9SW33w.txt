Went to Cantina Laredo with some friends who had been there previously.  The place was quiet, as it was late Sunday afternoon, but the service was excellent. Jaclyn, our server, was on top of us asking if we were alright the whole time. Also, her recommendations were right on.  From the Black and Bleu Mojito for my wife to the Cabo Margarita for me.  Also the entries were fantastic, Tacos de Carnitas were great.

Will definitely be coming back when we get back to this side of town again..
