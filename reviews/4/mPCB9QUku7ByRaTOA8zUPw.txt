I went here the other day it's a nice new place nice paint very clean inside and out, spacious place , the staff seemed to be dressed nice in some type of uniform / shirts they had on. Also the food that I ordered which was a breakfast burrito came timely it was a little more expensive than I thought it would be but overall the service was good I also had some rolled tacos another day and I'm noticing that the food all the good food is not spicy it seems not as spicy as I've had in the past at similar places. Drive Thru was not operational yet but hopefully in the near future that would be great, staff was friendly
