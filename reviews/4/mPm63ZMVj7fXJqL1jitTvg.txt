By now I have come to accept the HIGH PRICES of Las Vegas dining.  

$18 for 3 fish tacos, $7 for a beer and tip will put you out the door around $30.  
THAT'S LUNCH that I can get from a taco truck in Los Angeles for $12!

Still decent food and the serving sizes have not shrank noticeably since I was last here 3 years ago.

Fast friendly service is efficient and timely.  The fish tacos, rice and beans were tasty.  I normally do not eat the rice and beans, but this time I did - Yummy!

The salsas that they serve with the free chips are great on your tacos - ask for more, they are happy to bring it on!
