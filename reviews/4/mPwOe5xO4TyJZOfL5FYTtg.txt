I haven't been to Chevy's in a LONG time. My wife and I were at the Galleria Mall with our son and decided to give it a try. The food was great from the chips and salsa to the entrees. We each had the pick 2 combo (one with an enchilada and tamale, the other with a chile relleno and tamale) Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizer sampler. Especially the nacho's with the jalapeno jelly for dipping, it was the real shocker. Next time I will not opt for the chile relleno though, it was a little tough and honestly I've had better. We had our youngest child with us who ate for free because it was a tuesday, his chicken fajitas was very good, I had to sneak a bite, but it was only the fajita meat with no tortillas or toppings, but it did come with a side, we chose the fresh fruit and it also came with an ice cream cone. Caesar, our server, was very knowledgable when it came down to the menu and preparation process. He also provided very good service and stayed on top of things like keeping our drinks filled and clearing dishes from the table. Overall it was a great lunch and we look forward to returning. I gave it 4 stars mainly because I thought the chile relleno would have been a lot better.
