I used to work near there other location and when it closed and said they were moving I hoped to be able to find. Then while driving home one day from work I saw the new location, and boy was I happy, its within my work commute and close enough to make a regular lunch time stop. 

I stopped one morning on the way to work and was happy to see they have a drive thru, I ordered a egg, potato and cheese burrito and had pico de gallo added to it. I have to say it was a great tasting breakfast burrito.

A few days later I met up with my friend for lunch and I ordered the #20, it's a carne asada burrito with beans and rice, this did not disappoint! So good!  

I'm pleased to see Salazar Bros back, its great seeing everyone, and loving the new spot!
