I came here last night with about 20 people from Yelp as the first stop on Nelson's UYE Taco Trek and Cool Down #2.

I got two tacos, one cabeza with a hand made corn tortilla; the other was lengua with flour tortilla.  After stopping at the toppings bar on the side of the wagon, I enjoyed these tacos a lot.  I like the sliced cucumbers and their spicy hot green salsa.  It was very good.  On the lengua, I put some pineapple which made the flavor of the tongue stand out.

I think this would be a place to which I'll return and get some tacos to go.  I find that eating at food trucks is problematic because you don't have a place to sit nor a table.  Of course, I could have gotten one of my folding chairs we use for after hike Guinness Time but today's not the best time to think of that.

This is a good street taco place and I recommend it if you're on the west side of Las Vegas!
