Went here Friday night with a group of friends and we had a great time!  It's a good variety of authentic Mexican food from different areas in Mexico.  My food was absolutely delicious.  Almost everyone in my party said the same - only one person didn't like her food, mostly because it was too spicy and she had asked for shredded beef and got ground beef instead.  Our waiter was really nice too.  As some other people have said, the service was a little bit slow, but they're probably just trying to give people a nice dining experience - nobody likes to be rushed out of a restaurant either.  I wanted to give a 4 1/2 but couldn't figure out how.  I stuck with a 4 just because there was some slowness, and a few small mistakes - ground beef instead of shredded, and someone got corn tortillas when they'd asked for flour.  Overall though, a great time - we will be back!
