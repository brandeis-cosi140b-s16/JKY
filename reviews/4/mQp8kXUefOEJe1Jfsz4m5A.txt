I visited in the middle of the week to grab a quick bite with a friend. I had been before but never to eat, so I had no expectations for the food. Because it was slower this particular day, we received pretty prompt service. I have had a good time here in the past, have never been disappointed and must say that it is definitely a fun place to go. For these reasons, I started it out at three stars.

What put it over the top? The food. Not wanting it to sound like an insult, I refrained from telling the waitress that the grub was "not bad for bar food". As a matter of fact, I highly recommend the fish tacos. Amazing! Having visited the land of fish tacos, AKA Southern California, I developed an affinity towards this tasty delicacy. The rice was flavorful and not the speedy stuff that some Mexican joints serve. The black beans were surprisingly great as well. 

It was an excellent treat to have such a great meal at a place that can easily be labeled as a trendy casual cantina. Of the ones that I have been to in the Phoenix metro area, the food here makes me a fan. Like the menu reads, they "just don't make money by selling beer and t-shirts". Try the food if you get a chance!
