Soda machine was awesome (one of those new ones where there are a ga-zillion flavor options; I mean where else do you find diet fanta orange?) and so was the food.  

If you're looking for good portions (ie: Chipotle) this isn't your place.  You pay more for less food than Chipotle.  

However, if you're looking for good food (esp carne asada) this place is great for that.  

They have combo options and deals that we noticed AFTER sitting down (they weren't obvious and we weren't up-sold by the cashiers).  I think if they promoted the combos where you get a burrito, chips and salsa and a drink--then they'd do better.  Otherwise, ordering a la carte makes it seem like you aren't getting that much food for the price.
