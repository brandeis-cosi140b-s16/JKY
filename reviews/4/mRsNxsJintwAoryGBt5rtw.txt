Decided to try this place based on the great reviews. I love me some Mexican food and my favorite type is the hole in the wall taco shop. I'm from San Diego originally and moved to Arizona about 10 years ago. Typically I find Arizona taco shops to be awful. I find bad carne asada, tasteless watery taco sauce and bland gross refried beans beans abound, IMO. So, this place... It's very good. I had a carne asada burrito. It was massive and all the ingredients were very good and fresh.  My girlfriend had the tacos with the tinga chicken (shredded spicy chicken) and that was very good as well. The guacamole was good and it was only a 1$ to add to your item which I think is reasonably priced. The only thing that held me back from giving them 5 stars was the salsa. I tried both the red salsas and I found the "medium" to be weird tasting. The "hot" had some decent flavor and a decent amount of spice but it didn't blow me away. Overall this place is good and I will continue to go here and I would definitely recommend it to friends.
