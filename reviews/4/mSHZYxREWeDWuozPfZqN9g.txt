Fast, friendly, and fresh.

I can only compare this place to Chipotle, but with more greens. The flavors are super fresh, and the combination of ingredients is fairly well put-together, and it should be because you choose them.

It might be a year before I can visit one again in Vegas, but I'll definitely be back.
