It seems this Roberto's made it to Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive Ins and Dives!

Pity they neglected to tell you the same recipes can be found in the Roberto's that are scattered throughout Las Vegas. I'm not shooting it down, but the food is consistently good throughout all of the Vegas locations.

I have sent several friends and old co-workers here. They've all said it's worth the drive - too bad they don't yelp! They love the super nachos and for some reason, the bean and cheese burrito were huge hits for them. I've had the bean and cheese burrito and it's pretty darn big and delivers on flavor, too. I never thought I'd get overwhelmed by flavor and size in a bean and cheese burrito. It's amazing what you learn about yourself! Haha.

What a pity there isn't a location in Mesa...wait, or maybe that's a good thing for me. :D
