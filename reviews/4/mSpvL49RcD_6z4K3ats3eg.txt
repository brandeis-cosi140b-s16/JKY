We came here with family while visiting Phoenix, AZ to try some authentic Mexican street food. First I ordered a porter beer called seed panther. That was really good. Rich and flavorful with chocolate notes. Then we got a while bunch of apps and small plates. The guacamole was made table side and the twist was that it had pomegranate seeds in it which was a pleasant surprise. It added a sweet note but still tasted like a very good guacamole. Next we got the chile con queso. I didn't really get much chili but the cheese sauce was delicious. It was a mix of different cheeses that was part think sauces and also stretchy like melted mozzarella but not mozzarella. I couldn't stop eating it. The esquites asados was a nice Mexican take on fries. Nothing plain about them as they were typed with grilled corn, cheese spicy sauce and much more. The apps can be quite filling so just keep that in mind when going for dinner. The entrees were large as well. I ordered the Torta de Asada. It was a huge sandwich with steak and a huge slice of bacon that looked like it was sticking it's tongue out at me as if it was taunting me "you can't finish me". And it was right, I couldn't. I had to bring him, err it, home.

This place isn't really an indoor spot. E entire restaurant was exposed to the outside environment even though you was surrounded by walls and a ceiling. So keep that in mind when coming her at night time during winter months. We were pretty cold sitting "inside". The Yard is in the same establishment and that night a live band was playing and you could clearly hear them in Barrio. It's a fun noisy environment with games and a picture booth. Go there with friends to hang out and have a good time.
