The mac and cheese meal with chicken here is awesome. It has just a bit of a kick. I tried the chicken, artichoke, and mushroom stack last night for dinner and that's my new favorite. The chicken enchiladas are just ok. Be careful with the frozen margaritas here. They have more alcohol in them than the on the rocks version and will knock you on your ass if you're not careful.

They have fajitas for $10.99 on Tuesdays with half of margaritas with the purchase of a fajita platter. 

And don't worry about finding parking here. They have free valet for paying  customers. Just make sure to get a validation stamp from the hostess before you leave.
