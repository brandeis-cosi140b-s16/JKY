Decided to try this restaurant at a recommendation from a friend who lives in the area. The food was very good! The cooks aren't afraid to be sure there is some kick either! We ordered three different items to all sample them- beef/steak enchilada, pork tacos, and a chicken Mexican 'pizza'. Each was so yummy! VERY large glasses of soda. As we went at an extremely early dinner hour, we received a lot of attention from the staff, who were very friendly and hospitable. A good experience and meal overall!
