I've been wanting to try Komex since I read such great reviews on here, and finally I made the leap.  We ordered the full order of combo fried rice, a small cheese quesadilla, a burrito with chicken, and a bulgogi chimichanga at the chefs recommendation.  The chimichanga was mouth watering, so good that the burrito seemed flavorless!   The fried rice was also surprisingly good, my daughter ate it like it was the best meal she'd ever had.  The quesadilla was cooked just right with tasty cheese, but the burrito is where the meal fell short.  It was the first of our order brought to the table, and wasn't hot inside as I expect food to be, but reheated the next day was a nice left over meal!

I will def be frequenting Komex, and the chimichanga will be a staple!
