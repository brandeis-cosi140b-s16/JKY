Sat at the bar with a few friends and had some great drinks prepared by Sarah.  She was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  This was not my first trip to the restaurant nor will it be our last.  The salt air margaritas are excellent and although no longer on the menu the Oaxacan old fashioned is excellent.
