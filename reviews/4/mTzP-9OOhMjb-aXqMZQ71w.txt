After moved to Vegas, I haven't really find a burrito joint around where I live. My friend recommended me this place, so I decided to give it a try yesterday, and I was not disappointed at all.
I ordered the Tuesday special Chicken burrito, and my gf had the Nevada burrito
they both taste great, I think we both love the Nevada burrito more, steak and fries in a burrito, what a great combo!
My chicken burrito was great for it was only $3
I love how they have daily specials for weekdays, it's just awesome when you are trying to save some bucks and still get the great taste and portion

the only downside why I didn't give it a 5-star is due to the kitchen size, the food may take awhile when it gets busy. And I noticed that's why many people call ahead to place the order before they go pick it up

this place is definitely going to be our favorite taco/burrito joint now
