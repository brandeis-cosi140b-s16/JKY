This Chipotle location is great. Super popular though, which means super busy most of the time but it's well with the wait. Food is always hot and fresh and there is always plenty of staff to help keep the lines moving. I always enjoy coming here and favor it over a couple other locations. 

Only downsides? 

Parking.

The plaza that this location sits in sometimes runs short on parking, which makes getting in from the front lot to the front door a challenge anytime after 11:30 AM. But no complaints about the quality of food or the staff. 

Busy.

Like I mentioned earlier, there are several car dealerships and office parks nearby which means plenty of office folks and dealership employees coming by everyday for lunch. There's also a major shipping center across the freeway and so there is always lots of people stopping in. But overall, it's worth it as there is plenty of staff to handle the line. I've never waited longer than 6-7 minutes to order my food. 

Give it a try of you're in the area. Totally worth it! 

Great location all around!
