So good. So fresh! You know this from the moment you walk in to the strip mall location and the air filles with the smell of flour tortillas. 

The sweet BBQ pork is a must try, especially on a salad IF you're a big cilantro fan like myself. The cafe is similar to a Chipotle but with fresher ingredients and hot salso. 

In addition, they have a large selection of beverages to choose from - Mexican Coca-Cola and fountain drinks that are unique in flavor. I wish I saw them before the Coca-Cola. After I left, I wanted to try all their refreshing fountain soda that seemed unique to the restaurant.
