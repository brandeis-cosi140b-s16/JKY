YES, Chipotle within a mile from work. New go to place for lunch? I think so. 

New location, clean space, friendly food servers, yummy food. This location's food is consistent with other locations, meaning the food is delicious. Lunch lines aren't long yet, yay!

Only gripe about this particular location is the parking. The parking lines are drawn very inconsistently, with a couple super narrow spaces that make no sense. And trying to turn left out of that plaza, can take a long time.
