Food is great I bought a Groupon for 20 bucks =40 bucks it was good they have a guy come to your table and take a picture says its free and you know Yeah right you just decline it when he comes back and you still get a small picture w/ their information etc all on it. But overall this place had great margaritas and food Great Fast service I would definately return If you get the groupon plan on paying at least an additional 10 bucks not including tip for 2 people!!
