Can't go 5 starts cause I only ate there once..  Today I had the pleasure of trying their Pollo Fundido..  Mmmmmmmmmmm..  I am a big fan of Some Burros in Tempe.  This was easily as good or better.  Loaded with sauce, and the burro was fried just the perfect amount.  Next time, I am going to try their fajita burro and maybe eat in with one of the many beers they sell.
