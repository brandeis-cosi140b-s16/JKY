This past weekend I was in Las Vegas for a bachelorette party and on Saturday night we decided to go to Diablo's Cantina for dinner. We had 8 ladies in our party and we were accommodated very quickly, about a 10 minute wait! 

Also, make sure to check-in on Yelp and then head to the hostess stand where you will receive a 2 for 1 on beer and wine! Such a deal especially in Vegas, where we all know drinks can get pricey. Even better if you go during their happy hour...beers are $5!

Our server was friendly and always smiling so that was a nice experience! He was prompt and brought us our food after about 20-25 minutes which was expected! They have plenty of TV's so it's a great place to catch some sports if that's what you're looking for, however, I would not label it as a "sports bar." 

I ordered the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with french fries and it was super tasty. The BBQ sauce had a really nice flavor, it was a sweeter BBQ sauce which I enjoy. I believe the BBQ sauce is made in-house too. I would recommend getting the coleslaw on the sandwich. I ended up getting it on the side and wished I would have just gotten it right on there. It's a messier sandwich but nonetheless delicious. The fries are the beer-battered style fries so of course they were good. Crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. 

No one had any complaints about their meals and everyone seemed to enjoy them thoroughly. This restaurant is a good spot if you're looking to get in and out in a decent amount of time with a full belly!
