Some of the best most authentic tacos for a reasonable price in town. I'm a Taqueria Guadalajara kind of girl, but I figured I'd root for this place, too.

I'm also hating that everyone is running on about getting "sick," while eating their food. I've eaten here a million times, the atmosphere inside is very standard, and I see these servers run around while thirty drunk people come in and bum rush the whole place, make a huge mess eating, and leave terrible tips.

You know what, Los Gemelos is good food and that's what matters and I appreciate what they do.
