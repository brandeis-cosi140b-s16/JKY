We live about a mile away from this place and just recently discovered that their carne asada tacos are pretty good.  For my taco loving family, Don Tortaco is exactly what you want in that pinch of a moment when you are craving good tacos but want to avoid the ff chains and restaurants.  Each of their tacos is filled with a LARGE heaping of meat - no skimping here.  The fully loaded tacos on corn tortillas are my favorite.  The crunchy shells are a bit too fried and crunchy for me, but my husband likes them.  We prefer the carne asada over the chicken, but still eat them both.  Their house hot sauce is delish!  Their rice is delish!  Overall, this is a great neighborhood taco spot and we will continue to eat there!
