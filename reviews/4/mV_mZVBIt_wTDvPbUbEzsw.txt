Pink Taco is always a good experience! The atmosphere and décor make for great fun!

The service at Pink Taco can be hot or miss. I have had not so great service at times and at other times really great service. I love their outdoor patio seating, with a view of the pool, provides a nice atmosphere with the palm trees and is great for people watching! 

I have tried a many things here, and have narrowed it down to a few favorites.... the chicken nachos are great, they have real cheese and cheese sauce....YUMM! (the diablo nachos are good as well, but beware- they are spicy!) The taquitos are very good- I prefer the shredded chicken over the beef, and the bacon wrapped jalapeños are great- definitely give them a try!
