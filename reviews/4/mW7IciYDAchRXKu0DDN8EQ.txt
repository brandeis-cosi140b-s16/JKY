I. Love. Their. Horchata. It's the best I've ever had.
Their tacos are decent, but not to the point that I rave like everyone else. 
I'm so glad they are still in this location. I lived in Melrose for 4 years and saw 3 different restaurants in that building in that time. It's like cursed or something. Maybe it WAS cursed until America moved in? Wouldn't that be crazy?
Anyway, the staff is friendly. I do think the portions are a bit small for the price, but she's got a following and can charge a bit more.
I love riding my bike here, pounding down some tacos and horchata, then pedaling back home for a food come nap.
