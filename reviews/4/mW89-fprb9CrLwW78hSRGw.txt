Went here for the first time yesterday. I was very pleased with the chile relleno. The deep fried exterior did not overwhelm the delicious cheese filled hatch chile. The red sauce on top was a winner.

Everything tastes fresh and the salsa bar is an added bonus. I will be taking my family here very soon.
