This location cooks their fries perfectly, just enough salt and crispy.  I tried the beef taco asado, and this is very yummy!  The chicken soft tacos yummy, the white buttermilk (I think) based sauce) makes these with the marinated chicken.  I loved Naugles (who Del Taco bought) and order the egg and cheese burrito and add beans making it similiar to Naugles egg & bean burrito.  One of my fav fast foods spots!
