More consistent then most little Mexican joints around here. Cheaper than a filibertos. Their tacos are very good. They are .99Â¢ Tuesdays and it is always busy. I always have the carne asada or a cheese quesidilla and they never let me down. 

They can tens to be a little bit slow but overall the Service is good and so is their food.
