Happy Hour and a sunset?  Yes!

Our party consisted of my wife, myself, and our preschool aged son.  We had just finished a long day of touristing (yes, obviously from my location, we are visitors) and needed dinner.  We were originally planning on another location down the street, but that other venue's parking lot was full.

We had seen Papi Chulo's on the way in, and decided to head there after our original plans were denied.  And it's a good thing too.  The chips were fresh and warm, and the two salsa choices were fresh and neither too sedate nor too spicy, either for ourselves or our son.

I ordered the chimichanga arrachera, which was quite flavorful and, despite being large, not an "unbeatable " foe.  My wife's selection was the fajitas arrachera, which she simply described as "delicious".  The flank steak was a hair tough on both accounts, but could have been far worse from our experience.

Of course, it was happy hour.  House margaritas are discounted, and were quite... shall we say... effective.  Without being overly "tequila-ey", shall we say.  All this as we enjoyed a sunset dropping down over the valley, as the outdoor seating faces west.

On our next trip to the Valley of the Sun, we will be quite likely to pay this restaurant a visit.
