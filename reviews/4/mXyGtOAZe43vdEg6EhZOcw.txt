The food here is easily 5-star quality: great tacos of all kind, good meals and plates, and really friendly staff who were happy to accommodate a large group coming in all at once. 

The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that once we overwhelmed them (there were only two people working), multiple mistakes were made on orders that were already taking awhile (though it should be said they were always quickly corrected). The food was worth the wait, but they just need a slightly better system to stay on top of orders. 

Overall, can't wait to come back here!
