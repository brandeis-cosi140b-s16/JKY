I live right around the corner from Los Cabos, and so I am particularly interested in having a good "Mex" restaurant nearby. I've now been there probably two dozen times since they opened a few months ago, so I feel like I can give them a fair review. 
First, the owners are very very nice and interested in feedback. Second, the food is, on the whole, very very tasty and cheap. I am a particular fan of the tortas and burritos. The chorizo breakfast burrito is a knock-out as is the "California Surfing" burrito, with carne asada, shrimp, french fries, and a garlicy sour cream sauce. 
The only gripe I have is that the food isn't always consistent. I've twice had inedible items served to me. Once with a carne asada torta that was so over salted as to be inedible (and I really like salt) and once with a pollo asada burrito where the chicken was so dry as to not be chewable. These two extreme outliers (everything else I've ever had there -- including these two menu items on other occasions -- has been delicious) are just a symptom of lack of consistency that I hope will get ironed out soon. 
It's also a big annoyance that their hours keep changing. When I want a burrito, I don't want to show up to find they're now closed on Sundays or only open at 10am in the morning when I've shown up at 9am. I think this will work out, though. 
I have my fingers crossed for them. The food is awesome 9 times out of 10 and the local friendliness makes up for the other times. At least, it will for now.
