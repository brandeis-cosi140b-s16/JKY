This review is solely for their Beefy Crunch Burritos aka BCBs. I first tried one last year at UNLV's taco bell and I was blown away. CHIPS in a burrito?! I'm all for crunchy things in a not so crunchy food thing. Yep then it was taken away for a short while but BROUGHT BACK! I didn't even have to do anything. Beef, cheese, rice, and spicy Fritos....omg. Best eaten with Mild sauce. Please never take the BCB away again. Oh and 4 stars for this location for having pink water. What....?
