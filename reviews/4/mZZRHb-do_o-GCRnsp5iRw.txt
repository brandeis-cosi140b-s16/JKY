When this part of Las Vegas was still under development,
Don Tortaco was still Roberto's
and one of the few places to grab a quick bite.

Times have changed
and now a bevy of eateries
can be found up and down
South Rainbow,
but they remained my go to spot.

Recently,
Don Tortaco moved from one
side of Rainbow
to the other.

And I guess I can't really blame them for the move.
This new location is bigger,
better lit,
and now has a drive thru.

The food is as good as ever
and provides yours truly tasty
late night nachos
when binge watching
or when wanting to start 
the day off with a hearty breakfast burrito.

So to close,
Stay gold, Don Tortaco.
