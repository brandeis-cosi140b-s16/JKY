Came here 2 days in a row while on a conference in the Mandalay.  Gets busy and a long (and unorganized) wait during peak lunch times, so probably better to go early or late if getting lunch.
The first day I did the carnitas tacos, and was disappointed.  The meat tasted like it had been made long before, and just reheated and plopped onto my taco.  The fixins with the taco also were unimpressive. Service was very slow downstairs.
The second day, I did the tuna tar tar which was delicious, glad I gave it another chance.  Service upstairs at the bar was far better than downstairs too.
Their beer selection is also quite limited.
