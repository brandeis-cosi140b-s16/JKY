This was a really good experience. Despite the fact that it kinda smelled like cigarettes, we (me, gf, kids) had a nice lunch. 

The prices are insanely cheap for what you get. The kids meals, bean burritos with beans and rice, were only four bucks, and they couldn't finish them. The adults got avocado tostada and veggie burrito. She couldn't finish hers. I finished the burrito but I never give up (when it comes to eating).

If this place weren't three states away I bet it would be a regular spot for dinner. Next time I'm in East Suburban Charlotte I'll probably come back.
