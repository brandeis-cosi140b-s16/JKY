Cute, small, neighborhood hole in the wall place. I always get the super Michelada which some of the bartenders make better than others. The pasole has been consistently good. So is the arroz con pollo. Carne Assada is also good.  No soap in the men's restroom. All in all tho a good spot and hope it sticks around.
