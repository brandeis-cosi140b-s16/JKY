The barbecue is very good. My wife had the 1/2 ribs. That size is a large size for one person. Probably 2 meals for most. I had the 1/4 pulled pork, it was very good as well.  Their regular sauce & the bbq mustard were are favorites, they have a spicy also. The macaroni salad was macaroni noodles with cole slaw dressing. If you like cole slaw, you will like it. Cool little place!  We were going to eat there, but it was too hot out, so we brought it home and ate it. No indoor seating, but still great when we got it home.
