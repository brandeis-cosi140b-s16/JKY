The lady at the front desk of the Marriott Courtyard pointed us in the direction of Fuego, warning, "It's a hole in the wall, but you'll like it." As we approach the entrance, there is a sign stating, "The management reserves the right to refuse service." Good start.

Inside, it's a bar with tables along the back wall. Good news is the food is excellent! We had the usual chips & salsa, both red & green, plus an appetizer of Queso, the thick cheese swimming with anaheim or similar chiles. My main dish was the Chimi Plate, including Green, rice & beans. Inside the chimi was grilled, sliced steak. Very tasty.

Fuego had good, inexpensive Mexican fare in a hole in the wall kinda way.
