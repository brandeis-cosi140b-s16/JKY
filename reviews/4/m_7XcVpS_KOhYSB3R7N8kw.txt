I kinda feel sad about the two (2) star reviews, because this place is really good. I avoided this place for 3 1/2 years now (as long as it's been here) because it looked a little sketchy from the outside and I thought it was just one of those gross Mexican food places to eat at. I now find myself kicking myself. The hot dog cart is outside the entrance and all you have to do is go in and pay for your dog inside and they give you a ticket that you show the man outside to order. $3 for a pretty decent Sonoran dog grilled on a griddle, wrapped in Mesquite-smoked bacon, topped with chopped tomatoes, onions, shredded yellow or cotijo cheese, tomatillo salsa or red chili sauce, pinto beans, mayonnaise, ketchup and/or mustard, and served on a bun with a fresh-roasted chili. 

Oddly enough, I liked that the menus are on five different flat screen tv's. The Carne Asada burrito was phenomenal, way better than any other Mexican fast food restaurant. The salsas were tasty which is something that is very important since I always start the meal by drinking some salsa. If it is good, then the restaurant is good. Smoked chile and garlic salsa is always welcome! The green guacamole sauce is great!

The tortillas are super soft and the beans were homemade, nice texture and flavor. I still prefer the rice at La Tolteca (but hey, no one can compete with that place) but it was still moist and flavorful. They seemed to have a lot of employees working here for such a small place but that's a good thing because the place was very clean and they brought our food to us.
