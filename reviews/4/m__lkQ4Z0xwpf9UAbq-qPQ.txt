Good Mexican (for Pittsburgh....we all know that this is a major weak spot for the Steel City). The guacamole is delicious- made tableside to your specifications- ask for extra cilantro and salt! I'm not a big fan of the chicken they use (the seasoning is a bit weird), but overall this place is decent.
