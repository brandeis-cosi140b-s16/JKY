I was having a craving for Mexican food.  El Toro is less than 5 minutes from where I live and based on the reviews here it seemed like a solid choice.  I've not yet been to other Mexican restaurants in the area, so I can't say if this is really the best local option.

However, based on my experience I would say that it is indeed a solid choice.  No frills, filling food, with LOTS AND LOTS of cheese and beans.  Oh man.  So much cheese.  So many beans.  I got Vegetarian B (...why do all Mexican restaurants follow the same formula for their vegetarian menus?) and it was good.  I really have no complaints about the food, and it was cheap plus we had a coupon, making it even cheaper.  Service was also friendly and fast; as in, we ordered our food, and were eating it less than 10 minutes later.

I've had better Mexican food (oh Plaza Azteca...you're sooo far away right now...) but this wasn't bad at all.  The decor leaves something to be desired.  It was a bit weird and kind of looked like the remains of an old person's garage sale.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal once the screaming children sitting behind us were gone.

Oh yeah...and for some bizarre reason there are bottles on ketchup on each table...no hot sauce or anything...just ketchup...at a Mexican restaurant...am I missing something?
