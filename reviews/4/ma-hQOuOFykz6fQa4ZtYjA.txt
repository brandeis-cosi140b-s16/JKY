Great place with good ambience.  Had the Chile Relleno.  Probably more authentic that I expected, had more soft cheese and had dried fruit inside the chile.  Tasted great but was expecting maybe the more of just the cheese inside.  Still, the flavor was very unique and good.  Their margaritas are awesome, good variety.  Guacamole is perfect, as is the Queso Fundido. Good sangria also.
