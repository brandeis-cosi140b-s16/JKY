We have been here twice. The first time was 5 star. Love the condiments and our green chili pork and fish taco items were fantastic. The second time we got the chicken taco salad and fish tacos to go.  The salad was great, but they got the order wrong on my fish taco and I didn't find out until I was home. 3 times I said corn tortillas, and they did flour tortillas instead (on a fish taco?) The other thing I wasn't thrilled about was, you say, "Fish tacos, please." They say, "with cheese?" and because I hadn't read the whole board, I thought cheese was included, so I said yes. But you pay extra for it, at least on the fish tacos.  (BTW, don't get cheese on fish tacos). The atmosphere there is very nice, and we will definitely go lots more because the food is good and not expensive. Just be sure to ask if what they suggest is included.
