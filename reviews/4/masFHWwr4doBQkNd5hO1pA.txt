If you're anything like me, you've been sad ever since you returned from the islands because no taco on the mainland comes close to that wonderful kalua pork goodness from Jaws or Killer Tacos. Well if you happen to live in Las Vegas, then you're in luck - stop by Braddah's for your fix.  Your taste buds will not be disappointed!
