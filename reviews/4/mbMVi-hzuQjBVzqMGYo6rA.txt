Excellent tamales, flavors galore. So many specialty options, there's something for everyone. The jabanero salsa is very spicy for those who like it hot. Red sauce and tomatillo sauce are also made in house. All meat fillings are house ground meats. The ratio of masa to filling is just right. And the consistency of the masa is firm but moist -- not overly mushy like some tamales. 

For those who complain about the size of the tamales, note that more masa in itself does not make a better tamale!  These tamales are about the length of an adult hand, and about 2" in diameter. The prices are so good, you can totally stuff your belly with the 4 tamale combo for about $7. 

If they would put in a few tables, and replace the outdoor ones with some reasonable size chairs, I would give 5 stars.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that I have Celiac Disease. Having a restaurant where nearly everything in the place is naturally gluten free is a Godsend!  Thank you, Tamale Hut!
