Excellent Mexican.  In my estimation, the best of the "bertos". The carne asada is flavorful and tender in whatever dish you order.  Tortillas are fresh and so yummy.  The kids love their rice and beans (although I haven't tried them). The restaurant is small but always clean. The tables are big and sturdy and beautiful. The service is always friendly and quick. Definitely the go-to place in Gilbert for quick Mexican food.
