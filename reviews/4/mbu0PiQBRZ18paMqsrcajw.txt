So it was my first time in Rubio's. I heard they have excellent fish tacos. I love fish tacos. I walked in and ordered the special, the coastal trio. It includes a tilapia taco that I had grilled instead of blackened and an original fish taco which was big and crispy and a verde shrimp taco which was out of this world! I will try a blackened Tilapia next time. I learned on the food network that when cooking shrimp c means cooked and when the shrimp is an O it's overcooked and the shrimp taco was CCCC! The service was good too, it was fast and they bring your food out to you. I would have given the place a five but the restroom was a bit dirty, napkins on the floor and the mirror was frosted and looks old...
