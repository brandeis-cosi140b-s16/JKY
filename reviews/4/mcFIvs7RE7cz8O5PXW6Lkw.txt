First time here. Also one of my first reviews. This place was actually really good. Great salsa bar with hit chips. I had the #13 steak fajitas, $8.99. Girlfriend had the #12 sour cream chicken enchiladas. Horchata was pretty decent. We both really enjoyed our meals. Pros- tasty, cheap, quick, salsa bar. Cons- kinda dingy. Overall- give this place a try! Its worth it
