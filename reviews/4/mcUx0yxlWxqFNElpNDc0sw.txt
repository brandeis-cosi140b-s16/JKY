Yum Yum. I like Julios too. It doesn't look like it from the outside, but they have tables inside and they also have a patio so you have a lot of options of dining in or getting takeout. If you come for lunch the lunch specials are cheap but you are going to be lethargic when you go back to work. They also have drinks in here which seems kind of random. I've only gotten a margarita here once but it seemed pretty strong for the $3 or whatever it was. Also, you get free chips and salsa which is always a plus in my book. The carne asada tacos are my fave, but I like the taco salad and the green corn tamale is delish as well.
