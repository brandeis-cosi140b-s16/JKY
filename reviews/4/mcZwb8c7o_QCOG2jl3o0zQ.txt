Good food at a good price. I can't say I had an experience that others had where they had amazing food. I went with my family 2 hungry guys and my 5yo. We all ordered breakfast, my husband had the steak omelette (which he said was good, not great) one son had the breakfast burrito (which he said was great),  my other son had the waffle, (which he said was great) , I had the big breakfast which I would say was good, not great. 

What I can say was great was the service. Our hostess was super nice and super helpful, which I value highly in restaurants now days. 

All in all, I like IHOF and give it 4 stars (they get +1 star because our hostess was soooo nice)
