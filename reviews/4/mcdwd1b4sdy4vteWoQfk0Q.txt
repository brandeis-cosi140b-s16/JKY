I have no idea if this place is a cookie cutter chain but we stumbled upon it after an afternoon of wandering the strip and all of us were ravishing and in dire need of hydration and nourishment. This place more than hit the spot.

The service was on point, glasses never empty & courteous help all around from the server and other help in the restaurant.

We had their guacamole @ $8/order, it was good. I like a little more kick in it, but I can understand needing to tame it for the masses. It was not made table side and served in a nice presentation glass dish with hot chips and some decent salsa.

I had the fish tacos which came with 3 sauces, a chipotle, ancho chili and avocado crema. All three sauces were really good but I think I liked the chipotle best. 

Pricing was average for eating on the strip, about $25/person with tax and tip and no alcohol. 

I thought this place is worthy of a repeat visit.
