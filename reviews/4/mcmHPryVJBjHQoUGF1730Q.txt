While I wanted to give 5 stars for the salsa and flauntas I got. The lack luster Texas fajitas ruined the meal for my hubby. He described them as veggie overload with bits and pieces of scrap meat thrown in. The meat in my flauntas was very tasty. The cheese enchiladas were good but strange as they had only cheddar cheese and no sauce of any kind. We will likely return and try new entrees. The 3 sauces with the chips were all phenomenal!
