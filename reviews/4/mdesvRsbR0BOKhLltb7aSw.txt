As mentioned below, not the greatest atmosphere, but when it really comes down to it, I don't give a damn. I'd rather be eating a magnificent hot-link sandwich in a dusty, dimly lit place than a stale sad-looking sandwich at the bright and shiny Subway two blocks down. Prices are great, they have a wide variety of choices and of everything I've had so far has been immense. The guy who run's the place is wonderful-- we were there and the power went out from the storm and he just kept on making our food like there was nothing to it. 
It is dingy looking and you might think twice before going in, but do. It's good. Oh! And they have catering, in case you have need of this in your life.
