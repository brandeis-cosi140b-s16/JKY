We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues.
