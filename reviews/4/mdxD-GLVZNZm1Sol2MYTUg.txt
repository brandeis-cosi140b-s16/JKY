I went here for dinner last night and order take out. The tacos were so delicious! After reading the reviews I decided to try the Fish and Carne Asada tacos. Then I asked the girl at the register to suggest a third so I ordered the Adobado. All three were delicious but I ordered WAY too much food. I think on a normal night 1 1/2 would be plenty. I couldn't eat it all. My favorite was the Fish Taco, and the Carne Asada Taco was a very close second. I didn't try the rice, beans, or chips. The salsa bar is clean. The bar was out of one salsa I wanted to try so I asked for more and they happily (and quickly) brought out another batch. The salsas were all cold and tasted fresh. The people there are so friendly. I would definitely recommend Gordas Baja Taco :)
