Mexico City?  The one on Smithfield Street?  It has a new name and a new menu!  If you're a fan of that location - and I am(!) - you'll be happy to know that the same wonderful, AUTHENTIC (yes, I said it!)  Mexican cuisine is on the menu....and more authentic Mexican dishes have been added.

Vicky has been the talent behind the kitchen for a while now. She and her husband have expanded the menu, added a choice of American OR Mexican-style preparations and upped the presentation.  Did you know she makes each and every tortilla herself?  

Some of my dining companions got their old favorites and were as pleased as always - we are REGULAR customers.  One caution...be sure to specify Mexican-style or you may get American.  I tried the chilaquiles with fried eggs....the mildly spicy tomato sauce on top of crisp tortilla chips topped with beans, cheese and onion was a good way to chase away the cold and snow blowing past the windows outside!  The only suggestion would be to ditch the onion rings - pretty, but useless - and just sprinkle some chopped onion across the top instead.  Saves a lot of work for the diner.  

Go check out the new menu...and congratulate Vicky on the recognition she so deserves!!
