The name says it all CARNITAS (fried pork)! Yum!!

Long version: 
I probably wouldn't come here for anything other than carnitas. They're Carnitas are great and very authentic! Carnitas tacos, carnita tortas, or carnitas by the pound - you can't go wrong! Can you tell I like they're carnitas? 

On busy days when we don't have time to cook or when we have unexpected company we order carnitas by the pound! It's great for around $8 you get a lb of meat, tortillas, salsa, cilantro and onion! Plus you can pick it up right away, without any wait! 

Short version: 
Try the carnitas they won't disappoint!
