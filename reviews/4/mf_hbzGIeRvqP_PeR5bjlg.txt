I've been secretly sneaking off to Filibertos for their Breakfast Burritos for about a month.  My wife and I are doing P90X again and we're in competition to see who can loose 40 lbs.  (I'm winning).  The Breakfast Burritos are amazing, by far the best that I've ever had and I recommend them to anyone.  

This specific location is CLEAN!, Fast and always really nice.  

I'm sure that their burritos are really bad if your on a diet but hey, you only live once.  Give-em-a-try.
