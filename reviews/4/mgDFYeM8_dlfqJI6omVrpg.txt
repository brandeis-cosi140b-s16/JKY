Hussong's was better than I had expected from a Mexican place in the tourist-laden shopping mall that connects Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  It's hard to go wrong with a pitcher of Negra Modelo, and after flying all day if wasn't too hard to impress me or my co-worker who were in town for a conference.  We weren't pushing the culinary envelope or searching for the "real" Mexico among mall restaurants, and we were happy with the tacos and flautas that we ordered.  The good news:  It's loud and artificial, but it's fun.  The bad news:  The two salsas that came with the chips were both horrible, and lack of drink prices on the menu is a trap for the unwary.  Pitchers of Sangria were $40, but our pitcher of really good beer was a much more reasonable $22.  I'd go back on a future trip because it's perfect after a day of flying when you just want to eat and crash.
