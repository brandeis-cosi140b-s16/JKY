I found Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on my Packers Everywhere app, as a bar in Goodyear, Arizona, that would have the Green Bay Packers on TV! My friend and I went there for lunch on Sunday and I was so pleased to find the Packers game on their largest TV in the bar area. They had several other TV's showing other NFL games as well. The service we had was EXCEPTIONAL and we had delicious chips and salsa, quacamole, and shared the Combination Fajita's for two. All of the employees were friendly and I felt as though I was watching the game in my own house. I couldn't have been happier! I will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix again!
