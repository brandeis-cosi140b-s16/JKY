So, I was over at the auto glass place getting a new windshield put into my truck when I thought I will just walk over here and try it out.

WOW, was I impressed the Carnitas were OUT of this world! The service was good I only had a few knocks on them. 

1. A .75 cent charge on any credit card order under 40.00
2. No ice tea

The place was very clean and the out door seating plentiful.

Cheers!
