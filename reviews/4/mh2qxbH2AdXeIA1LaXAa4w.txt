Stayed at the strat from Friday thru Monday and as delicious as the other gourmet and high-end places we visited here this place wound up being my favorite.

You can have a completely diff experience tho, if you don't order the right things. Like ordering the veggie platter at a steakhouse... It's never gonna be that good 

If you come here get the Huevos rancheros (farmer eggs) meal it's amazingly delicious. Fresh protein and it's 5.99!!!! Best deal ever and best breakfast ever. It does take a while to get prepared tho but it's worth it. Other than that my gf got the chicken enchiladas and  she ordered that every single time we went so I think it's safe to say she liked it (even when I offered to take her to fancier places she ended up picking this place!!) 

Get the horchata and be greedy at the salsa bar!! Load up on the pico de gallo!!! And the salsa it's gonna make your plate more healthy and filling without increasing the cost and it taste way better. Skip the coffee tho
