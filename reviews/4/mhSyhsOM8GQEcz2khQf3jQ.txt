One of my favorite place to eat Mexican food! I went there after getting a hair cut and bought some stuff to go. My fianc√© loved the food! The beans taste home made so does everything else. I dragged my brother there next time he said it was meh but the tongue taco amazing! One thing is it's kind of like creepy quite and takes a while for the food to come out. They need some decor help it's kind of awkward eating there due to how silent it is. But if you want good food at a great price I would go here.
