I saw Cabo Fish Taco on DDD about a week ago, and just had to check it out. Very busy, short wait. They said 10-15 min., but it was more like 5 min. I had the lemon shrimp tacos, they were wonderful. Oh, we also had the shrimp and crab dip & that is a must have! Prices are ok for the amount of food.
