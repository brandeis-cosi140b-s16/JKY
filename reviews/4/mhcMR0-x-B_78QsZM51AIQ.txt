HOLA !  Is this place a chain? I'm usually the first to frequent an independent restaurant .......but oh well , It is good. 

We went to the one on S. Tryon also!  We did not make it for Cinco de Mayo, we made our visit on SIXO de Mayo!

Anyway , I really enjoy their Carnitas de Puerco(pork dish) the meat is so tender and tasty! Friend had Steak Azteca, the shrimp that were served in this dish were very good but the steak was tough (according to my friend) and the other dish was Pollo con crema(chicken in a little spicy sour cream sauce) it was also good , I grabbed a bite of that one!

I like how the manager? or owner? not sure? ......... would be walking out of kitchen yelling spanish sounds of  "lets go ,lets go,get pumped eveyone" 

I didn't care so much for the rice that was served with my dish.So I needed to order another great big margarita to wash it down .WINK WINK .

I'm thinking of getting one of the girls  uniforms for halloween!
