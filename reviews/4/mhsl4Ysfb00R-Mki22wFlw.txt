My sister, two nephews, and I went here on a recommendation of a high schoo friend.  I wasn't disappointed.  My friend was there to show us how to order.  It's a little complicated the first time, but not an insurmountable task.

- The teriyaki chicken was nummers.
- Jerk Fried Rice and the Jerk quesadilla - Mucho good-o.  They used authentic jerk seasoning too, which was nice.
- Black beans - Excelente.  Not as good as mine, but very good!
- The insufferable, bratty kid who was climbing all over the place, turning lights on and off, ignored by is inconsiderate and rude mother - Sucked.  I wanted to get up, lead him by the ear to mommy, deposit him in a chair, and give her the frowning of a lifetime ;-)

Very good.  This place should open up a franchise in Austin.  It would be a great fit!
