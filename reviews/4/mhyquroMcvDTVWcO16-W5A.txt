I've been here twice in the past week, so you know the food has to be pretty good!  First time I went, I got the steak burrito dinner.  It came with a burrito, rice, and beans for about $9.  Not a bad deal... except when you realize that the burrito alone is only about $6... and the rice and beans they serve in the "dinner" are not that great-tasting.  The rice especially was not my favorite.  So second time I went, I just ordered the al pastor burrito alone.  Out of the two meats I tried, I think I prefer the steak to the pork.

I really like the "smokey spicy" salsa in their salsa bar.  It's not that hot, but it adds nice flavor to the burritos.

I overheard them saying that they got their recipes from Mexico City, so I guess they're pretty authentic to true "street" tacos!

This place is great, although I'll try to limit my visits in the future since the food isn't really all THAT healthy for you :P
