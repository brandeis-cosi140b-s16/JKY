First, I'd like to say is that the only reason I didn't give El Ranchero five stars is because of the setting. The spray painted building, walk up ordering and telenovelas SHOULD be overlooked due to the quality of the food...but I know that some people calculate ambient qualities such as these. Personally, I would risk crossing the 38th parallel to get food like this.
Words of warning: No English speakers there, but gringos are welcomed with accommodating smiles and nods. Also, CASH ONLY!
Once you get past the skin of the place and down to the food only one thing should  be known...
El Ranchero is, without a doubt, serving some of the best food in Phoenix! 
I got an order of carne asada gorditas with some rice and beans. I noticed that the gorditas came with a sort of Au Jus (later I found out that it was the caldo de res). The gorditas alone were a wonderful conglomeration of carne asada, potatoes, lettuce and onions. But when I added a dash of amazing salsa and a splash of Au Jus (caldo) the meal sang. 
Wow! I'm glad I finally went after passing it up so many times.
