This place is GOOD. Red chili is good stuff, rice and beans are on point. Enchilada sauce is unique. Not bad, actually quite good but different. All in All I definately have a new mexican food fav and will be back for more. Best part is that Top Shelf is right across the road and the dummies eating there don't know what they are missing!
