I had the opportunity to stop by the restaurant for the second time during my stay in the area. I stuck it out with my usual crane asada tacos, grabbed a couple churros and a cheese quesadilla. 

Having this order a second time, the tacos are larger than what I saw in Pasadena and are worth every penny, especially with the guacamole included in the price. The only downside was with my late visit this time around they had run out of green salsa for the day. This was at 11:15PM at night.

The churros were a sweet bonus and I may have missed the description on the menu but they were filled with Carmel inside. These tasted so much better than the ones I had at Redondo Beach two days prior. 

The quesadilla was as expected and par for the course.

All in all, this is a restaurant that's a great value for traditional versus Tex-Mex. This is especially the case considering this meal will cost only 60% compared to the chains. Don't be fooled however, the wait in the drive thru is equally long compared to ordering inside. And missing out on the salsa bar makes it worth the walk inside.
