This restaurant is NOT closed! I ate there today. Food is still good; prices reasonable; staff and management are friendly. Comfortable casual atmosphere. TVs with sports on. 
A big plus for owners of plug-in cars is that there are 2 public chargers right in the parking lot. I wish all restaurants had car chargers.
