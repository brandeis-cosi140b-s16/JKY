You can tell they care about the freshness of the food here. A pitcher of a perfect margarita on a spring or summer day is amazing. Ive had many meals here but to night I had the side of potatoes with mushroom and a tortilla soup . The potatoes were insanely amazing but the soup however was dull and flavorless which I found odd since a lot was going on inside of it. I don't have much to complain about they try new things here and care about their ingredients . Can't always be perfect but it's good when your on point most of the time.
