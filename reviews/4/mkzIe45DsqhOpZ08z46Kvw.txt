Been here three times and have never been disappointed.  In a world of mediocre wait staff you will not find that here. (We feel like there's a parade in our honor every time we walk through the door!)  The fresh margarita is yummy, and my go-to dish is the Pollo con Crema.  While Don Pedro's might not be the most authentic Mexican fare, it's pretty inexpensive.  You'll eat till you explode and still have plenty left for the takeout box.  And the super friendly staff will point you to some of the more obscure Mexican bakeries, etc. in Charlotte.  And if they recommend them, I'm on it.
