This was a cool bar to grab a great margarita-esque drink and other similar cocktails on a night out. Bartenders were nice and I liked the vibe, lighting, and decor of the restaurant. They have some different margarita flavors and an interesting assortment of fruit flavored mixed drinks. I came here mostly to grab a drink while doing a mini bar crawl on Pittsburgh's East Carson Street. One complaint I have is that I really wish they offered chips and salsa or guacamole even after their kitchen closes so you can munch on something while drinking. I'm surprised this place has as many negative reviews as it does because drinks were great (I got some kind of electric blue cocktail) and the pictures of the food look really appetizing. I would definitely come back here to try out more options on their drink menu and sample the food despite the plethora of negative reviews this place has accrued. My advice: give this place a try and form your own opinion.
