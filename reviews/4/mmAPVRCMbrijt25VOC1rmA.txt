... I've been to this particular Macayo's multiple times without any issue. I'm basing this review off our last visit on Saturday. The waitress was so amazing that she drained my wallet of any and all remaining dollars! Haha! 
I ordered the chicken California burro which is a staple whenever I visit and my husband had the variety sampler of the enchiladas! He never finishes his food (ever) and he gobbled it all up! I love my CA burro because it tastes fresh and it's big enough to take half home.. But I normally push myself a little too hard to finish it all in one sitting! Ha! 
Last visit was 5 stars, but giving a 4 because we normally visit in a larger group and it can be difficult for staff to accommodate 10 or more.
