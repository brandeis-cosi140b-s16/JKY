I've eaten here on several occasions over the past few months, and the best thing about this place is that it's consistent. Of course their specialty is top shelf margaritas, but the house margarita is darn tasty. They have a good happy hour as well.

Start with the chips and salsa, very fresh and very flavorful. I recommend the house margarita on the rocks, it's very good. My favorite appetizer is the ceviche, absolutely delicious. It's pretty expensive, though, and not that filling, but worth it.

Tacos are a stand out here, especially the pollo asado (Wednesday special). They don't serve the shredded chicken garbage, here it is real, grilled and diced chicken breast, served with pico de gallo and good guacamole- quite tasty and reasonable. And if you don't eat meat,  there are good vegetarian choices here too.

Finally, it's a nice casual atmosphere and the staff is really friendly. The music may be a tad loud, but at least it's usually good music from the 70s and 80s. This is a must try for Mexican food in Old Town.
