When I was living in Wheeling WV, my friends and I would always go to this place for special occasions. They have an awesome beer selection and all kinds of great food! Plus most of their food has a vegan option!

That being said the food is really good but not great. The tofu is bland and the salsa is not very spicy. But who needs tofu when you have beans and guacamole? They make a good salsa verde as well.

The place has seating inside and out side, both with plenty of seats. There is all kinds of unique south western inspired art all over the place and it makes for a lovely atmosphere.
