Stop number two was my second favorite of the night. The lengua tacos came with large chunks of tongue. Ask for only onions, cilantro, and limes because anything else would be too much. The line moves fast and a massive crew is on the line to pump out the orders in a timely manner.

Charleston is the place to be for good tacos. I was not disappointed in this pit stop either. In fact, the last stop was my least favorite and it gets the most love.
