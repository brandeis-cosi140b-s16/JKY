The only reason it does not get 4 stars is because of the plating and silverware, the plastic knifes are very thin and hard to cut through your food, and the plates are easy to fall apart or tare through. Other than that the food is very delicious! I had the Gordita plate with asada meat and it tasted great. The only down side was the side to it were chips, and that didn't go well with it. My girlfriend had the Sopes plate with Asada meat and she loved the Sopes and said the beans were also great!
