Update: My main gripe was getting slow service frequently and they've improved. So I will up my rating by 1 star.

Most of the food is good, I especially like their tacos. The staff are also nice and friendly. The place is also beautifully decorated.

The problem occurs with service. Like I said, the staff are nice but they can usually be slow and not come around to your table very often. This is being based off multiple visits, about 10 visits. Sometimes service is great! But 70% of the time food can be slow to come out on non busy times, drinks can take a while to be refilled, and there's been a couple times where processing the check takes a long time.

So they need to work on service. But based off how many times I've said I visited, foods good. When they bring out your chips, ask for some queso dip, it's AWESOME.
