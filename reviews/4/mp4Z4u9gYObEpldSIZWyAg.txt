This is a similar restaurant to Moe's and Chipotle.  I would say they are all interchangeable. Although I like the salsa bar that Moe's has and the others don't.  They have Shredded Pork (Carnitas)  which is always a plus for me.  The first time I had the pork it was great, the second time it was mushy, but very edible either way.  I would stay away from the steak, I found it rubbery.
They have excellent Guacamole and Queso dip and chips.

I went back the other day and had the Mexican Gumbo.  This dish alone moved them up to a 4 star from a 3 for me.  It's pretty fantastic and a very different menu item from the other quick burrito places.  If you want something like chili but a little lighter I highly recommend it.
