I use this place like a fast food way station.  If you're hanging on Fremont Street, you're on a journey.  Pop in here and grab a quick bite to eat to tide yourself over in-between destinations.  

If it's early in the evening, just get the single soft taco of your choice (made from an assortment of barnyard animals and their parts) while you're on the go.  If it's late, you might go for the three taco plate with a dollop of rice and beans for under $8. The tacos are relatively small and are "street" sized.  And, if you need more beer, they serve it.       

This isn't epic Mexican food, but it quickly gets the job done at a reasonable price.
