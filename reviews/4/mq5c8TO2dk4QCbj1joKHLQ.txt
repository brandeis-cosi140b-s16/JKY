Great Honduran restaurant with a menu catered to less adventurous diners who consider fajitas "branching out". I recommend picking out a handful of house specialty apps and an entree or two to split it with friends. You can't beat leaving with full bellies, to-go boxes, and an average of ten bucks a person. 

I'm one of those less adventurous eaters who tried fajitas the first time I dropped in. They were good, but pretty greasy--even for fajitas. So, my boyfriend convinced me to return and let him order. Now, the Choripollo will be something I'll be craving again before long (see photo). I give it 4 out of 5 stars only because their Mexican is half of the menu but not their calling. 

Make sure you check out Las Delicias across the street for chocolate cake or their chocolate mice with almond slivers for ears (they taste like Swiss Rolls).
