We ordered out from here one night and were overall pretty pleased. It's good if you are just looking for some basic Mexican food. 
They have two kinds of salsa and the cheese dip was the same as you would get anywhere else. We had bean burritos which were huge, and covered with cheese sauce and each had a side of rice which has some vegetables in it. The rice was delicious, nice and fluffy. We will def. be ordering from here again in the future when we need to satisfy our craving for Mexican.
