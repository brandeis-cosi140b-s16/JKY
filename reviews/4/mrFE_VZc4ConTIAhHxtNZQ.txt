We tried this place over the weekend and were pleasantly surprised. I would recommend sharing a plate because the portions are huge. Fresh Guac made at your table and the service was amazing. Their staff is on it. Everyone was happy with their food and the kids were excited they had fresh horchata. My husband and I will have to return without the kids so we can try a margarita. Recently moving from California we are always looking for good Mexican food that reminds us of home and this place is great.
