I wasn't actually expecting to like this place because it's not really my type of hangout.  Kind of trendy, very bar-oriented ( I'm not much of a drinker).  But, I was curious, so I decided to check it out.  First of all, my server was really nice and attentive.  He recommended the Chicken en rojo.  First, he brought out a small but fresh chopped salad with a variety of lettuces and a little tomato.  Nothing special, but the dressing, which I had on the side, was wonderful.  It was a tamarind vinaigrette.  I highly recommend it if you like sweet spicy dressings.  Next, the entree came.  It was a pounded chicken breast, topped with cream cheese sauce, roasted fingerling potatoes, and surrounded by a delicious red pepper cream sauce.  It was phenomenal.  I would definitely go back just for this dish.  I wasn't crazy about the chips and salsa, but I liked everything else.
