Been coming here for the last few years, every so often for lunch. This place offers a mix of Mexican, Guatemalan and Salvadorian food. But I've only tried a few things over and over.. Their Pupusas! If your not familiar, Pupusas are a traditional Salvadorian dish that consists of a handmade corn tortilla and then stuffed with one or more ingredients. It llooks like a thick/stuffed white corn tortilla. If you've never had it, try it, they're great!

My usual order:

(Complimentary) Chips and Black Bean (sprinkled with a little queso) Dip.  I love black beans and they aren't that common. They come warm, creamy, a little salty. 

Revueltas Pupusa (pork, bean and cheese): The pork is grounded so it wasn't chunky,, beans were mashed, and the cheese just melted it all together like a thin spread. The pork had a nice flavor, just enough to taste it. Beans were creamy and Cheese had a mild bite. This was my favorite of all the Pupusa's I've tried here. 

Queso Y Frijol (cheese and beans): I love bean and cheese burritos, so this just made sense! 

Queso (cheese): Plain ol' cheese, Sometimes simple goes a long way!

*Pupusa's always come with 2 condiments (Curtido and Salsa Roja) that are mandatory to add with every bite. Curtido is thinly sliced cabbage, carrots and onions.. that's been pickled of some sort. Salsa Roja is a orange/red color sauce that resembles chili but it isn't spicy. it is more like a seasoned tomato sauce. My method is to pour the Curtido on top of the whole Pupusa then pour the Salsa Roja over that. SOO GOOOD!!

The staff here always seemed to be in a good mood, polite and kept a smile =D. Prices are very reasonable and they have a special on monday's and wednesdays for 99 cent Pupusas. Super deal! Place was always bumpin' the jams like reggaeton, spanish dance.. Like really loud sometimes! Never bothered me but had to throw that in! So, if you want something other than tacos or quesadillas then I say try these bad boys!
