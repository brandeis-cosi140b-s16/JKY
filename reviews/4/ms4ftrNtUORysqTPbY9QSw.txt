Although Cantina Laredo books itself as "gourmet Mexican", it really serves mainly the usual staples - enchiladas or tacos with rice and beans, etc.  So why the "gourmet"?  Maybe it's because the portions are a little smaller or the prices a little higher than your neighborhood favorites.

So how come the four stars?  It's mainly because the food is a cut above the ordinary.  The tacos had so much meat that they were really a handful; even the salsa with the perfect thin crispy chips was different -- a tasty tomatillo salsa if I'm not mistaken.  The chicken enchilada was full of flavor but the beef enchilada was just overly hot (almost inedible).

Cantina Laredo likes to serve its entrees on plates that are just barely big enough to hold the food.  This makes it feel like you are getting small plates although actually the portions are quite filling.  Maybe that's why I probably won't go back - it's just a feeling I get when eating here.  The ambiance, service and the cuisine don't quite match up and it makes me uneasy.  In the final analysis, we often return to restaurants just because they feel right, and for me Cantina Laredo doesn't make the grade.  But you might react differently -- worth a try.
