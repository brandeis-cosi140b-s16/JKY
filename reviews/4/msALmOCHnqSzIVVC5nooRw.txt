The Cochata is amazing. I mean really, who wouldn't love coffee and horchata mixed together? Its crack in a cup, really. Or maybe I just really love both that much ;) I'm used to their other store that was on 7th Ave and Camelback and the University and Rural location, so walking into this place was kind of a shock- its clean, massive, and mainstream.
