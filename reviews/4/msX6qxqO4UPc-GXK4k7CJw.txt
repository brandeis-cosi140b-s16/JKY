Had dinner Saturday night at the Barrio Cafe.  We started out with some great Margarita's, ... actually finished off with some too .. We had the Halibut and  the Special which was steak, crab, lobster, and some great veggies in a wonderful sauce.  Awesome.   Our waiter Richard  was first rate ..   This is not your a typical rice and beans shop.  Prices are pretty high, but the quality of the entree's and the table side guacamole makes for a memorable meal.
