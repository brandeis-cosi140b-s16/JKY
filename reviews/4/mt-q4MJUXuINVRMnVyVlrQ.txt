Another one of those restaurants on my 'To Do List', I was in the area recently and stopped by to check it out.  I ordered:

Nachos (no meat, $6.50)

Cheese Quesadilla ($3.95)

The Nachos wer pretty good.  The Chips were fresh and the ingredients tasted very good.  However, one minor problem with the Nachos is that the Beans are buried at the bottom of the dish!  Seriously, check it out:

You have to eat through all of the layers of Chips, Green Chiles, Salsa, Guacamole, and Sour Cream to get to the Beans!  WTH?!  The Beans are really good too!  By the time I got to them, I was full and didn't have many Chips left to eat them with.  Bummer!  The highlight of the Nachos were the Green Chiles....they are really good and make these Nachos taste great and different from other restaurants.

The Quesadilla was awesome.  They put Green Chiles in the Quesadilla if you ask for it and believe me, you want them....they are sooo good!  It's what makes this Quesadilla unique and tasty.

Overall, it was a pretty good meal.  Not sure I would drive all the way across town to have it again, but if I am in the area I would consider making a short drive.
