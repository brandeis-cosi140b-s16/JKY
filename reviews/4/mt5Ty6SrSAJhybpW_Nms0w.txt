Immaculately kept clean. Very friendly ladies greet you with a warm welcome. Food is delicious and plentiful. Flavors are strong, robust, tantalizing, and complex. Grab a napkin for your runny nose! Start off with a salted-rim Margarita, or one of a nice, smooth, cool Dos Equis beer to wash down the chili powder-sprinkled chips and powerful salsa. I always order the #1 which consists of a taco, and a bean and chorizo covered tortilla, cheese enchilada smothered in sauce, and a chunky beef and green chili burrito. It's way more than enough to eat, and I always wind up with leftovers. Very comfortable and inviting dining room, with soft Mexican music playing. Wonderful people and place to take visiting family from out-of-state for an truly authentic taste of Mexico. Prices are fair. Service is excellent and quick for made-to-order homemade dishes. I eat here at least twice a month. If you want to know where to get good Mexican food, eat where the Mexicans do! Love it!! Can't get enough of it.
