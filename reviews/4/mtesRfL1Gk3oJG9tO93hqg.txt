I am a transplant from Tucson who now lives in Scottsdale.  Since my move over 10 years ago, I have been trying to find a goto cheap Mexican food restaurant that I could depend on.  La Fonda is it.  For me, it's all about the enchilada sauce and La Fonda's is very good.  The food is reasonably priced and easy for take out.
