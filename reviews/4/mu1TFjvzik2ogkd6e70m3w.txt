Had I known earlier what an amazing happy hour they have here at Canteen I likely would have come every evening since their opening.  I am officially a fan.  My parents and I went there and got three orders of tacos, drinks and guacamole for around $25.  I love a good deal and all, but the price means nothing if the food is crap.  Luckily, it was delicious!  My favorite was the fish tacos.  I wouldn't suggest the portobello mushroom tacos -- the flavor was too strong and smoky -- but that is my one and only complaint.  The decor is a hodge podge of rustic, modern and southwestern themes, but it works for me and I loved the colorful accents.  I do believe the owners of La Bocca are responsible for this new gem and I would like to personally thank them for maintaining a little local flair down on Mill Ave.
