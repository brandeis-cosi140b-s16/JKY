5 stars had they put more rice, but rice portion is generous I'm just a rice eater I want more! Two consecutive meals that I ordered #13 Fish Taco with beans and rice for $7. I love the green sauce that comes with it. I also like how they overflow it with lettuce. I just love it I want it for lunch tomorrow ( I just had it for dinner today)
