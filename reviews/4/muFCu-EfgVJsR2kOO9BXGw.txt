Finally some restaurants have opened within walking distance from the office.  One of the first was Salsarita's, a Charlotte based chain.  Salsarita's set up is similar to the other customizable assembly style fast "Mexican" style places.  This places gets very crowded for lunch but they are always very fast.  They have a different special every day, and even offer a 10% discount to us.  Most of the food is made fresh as you can often see the meat being cooked.  It's also a good place for vegetarians too, as you can get grilled vegetables instead of meat (no tofu though).

For the price, the convenience, and the quickness of the service here, it's a great lunch spot.  Don't go here expecting authentic Mexican style cuisine, but the food is high quality for the price.
