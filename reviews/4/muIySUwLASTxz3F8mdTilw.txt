The menu is eclectic which usually makes me nervous, but it turned out to be ok. The crab bread pudding is an appetizer but could easily be paired with a salad as a meal.

Went with the family and we all had different entrees - each of them was quite yummy. But the best part was the creme brulee for dessert. Each day a new flavor - we had the maple brown sugar accompanied by chocolate dipped bacon. Yep, it's as good as it sounds! 

It's a little confusing to get into, the location is a bit odd, and the menu can be a bit overhwelming. Overall it was a good experience.
