When I first entered in, I noticed a nostalgic feel from the decor & paintings to the rustic woodworks of the restaurant etc., I felt I was in for a great dining experience.

The staff was friendly and we were given a table and menus. Drinks were ordered and appetizers were on its way.

The first to arrive were our chips & salsa (green & red salsa) - but the shining star was the guacamole! We liked it so much, we had to order additional portions.

The next appetizer that arrived was the Bacon Wrapped Jalepeños! Wow! Mild sweet Jalapeños wrapped in smokey bacon. The name alone should have you salivating already! This is the other shining star of the appetizer menu!

The food arrived for our party and I remember how everyone was commenting on how fresh the tortillas were and hailing the guacamole as an encore.

I ordered the hamburger with guacamole & creme. It came with a side of chips and cheese sauce (homemade!!) my birder was awesome - though they did forget the guacamole creme, but quickly redeemed themselves by giving me some on the side.

We stayed and enjoyed our food and conversation. The staff were pleasant and nice. We even took a selfie with one member of the waitstaff!

The place does get busy! We were smart to arrive at the beginning of happy hour!


The prices are pretty fair, our only negative experience was the wait time for our second round of drinks.

I would definitely come back again with friends or other coworkers.

That's my 2 Cents :)
