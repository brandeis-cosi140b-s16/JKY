First impression was great thanks to the man that welcomed us into the restaurant, we got seated immediately. They have a very fun environment and modern fixtures. LOVE the outside patio lighting. Atmosphere is extremely pleasant. Booth seat isn't too worn in and still bouncy! 

Got the #1- Enchiladas were delicious and served on a hot plate, had enough for leftovers, and would order again. 
Margarita was 95% tequila-AKA fantastic and forced me to take an uber home. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, uber... Ya feel? ;) 

One negative experience was the waitress. she was not very friendly and never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers. Ran away to the back with our IDs when we ordered a drink. Had to request through other employees to make orders and get her to the table. Never introduced herself.

In short, I enjoyed the atmosphere and food, we will be back again! Thank you!

PS please make taco Tuesday deals all day versus during happy hour times.
