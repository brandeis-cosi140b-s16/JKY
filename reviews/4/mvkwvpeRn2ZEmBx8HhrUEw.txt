If I could go here everyday, I would and I would also be 500 pounds. It is soooo delicious. The salsa is good, the chips are better, the taco dish (I think it was called "Six Halves") was pretty freeking yumm and the side salad that came with it, wow. 

The prices were reasonable. They have beer,wine and margaritas. The only thing I'd suggest is faster mamacitas (the service was slow).
