At dinner here while visiting Phoenix.  The enchilada was awesome.  It is not like a regular enchilada but made like lasagna.  I was wary at when the waitress told me about but I'm so glad I tried it.  The chips and salsa were good.  My husband had the chimi, it was huge.  He said it was pretty good.  Margarita's are good but small and pricey.  Service was really slow.
