Small owner run business.  Give it a try!  We saw a small ad for this newer restaurant and being that there are few really good Mexican restaurants near us, gave it a chance.  It is in a small strip shopping center near the Harkins theater we go to often.  The owner greeted us personally, offered us chips and drinks while we were deciding what to order.  You place your order at the counter, then the cook brought us our food.  Very homey food, much like I would make myself (but usually don't as it is labor intensive)  I tried three different tacos on the combo plate.  The carne asada, carnitas, and machaca meats in my tacos were quite good.  The tacos could have been cooked a little crispier but were still good.  The star of my meal though was the rice and borrachas beans.  Not sure how he makes the rice- white rice with some good spices and buttery tasting.  The beans were mostly whole pintos, but in a spiced sauce with big pieces of ham in it.  I could have eaten the rice and beans alone and been content!  Hubby got the carnitas burro smothered in green sauce and a guacamole tostado. Carnitas meat very tasty, big chunks of tender pork.  Our only suggestion is less salt added to the meats and especially the green chili sauce- he was unable to eat the outside of his burro as it was just too salty.  All in all though we will return to this cute (and clean, a big plus with me) place.  Hope Johnny Castillon (owner) can make a go of it as we need more good Mexican restaurants up in North Phoenix.
