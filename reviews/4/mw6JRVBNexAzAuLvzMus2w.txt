Pros: 1) Excellent, fresh tortillas. This is reason enough to go here over the chains that give you a pre-pressed tortilla out of a plastic bag. 2) The taste is great, the food is usually very fresh. 3) The price is a bit cheaper than Chipotle. 4) You don't have to worry about the massive lines at Chipotle.

Cons: The employees are awful. They clearly hate their jobs and are generally grumpy when you interact with them.

I highly recommend Panchero's. The employees are pretty terrible, but the food is outstanding, especially the fresh tortillas, which makes all the difference.
