So, since moving to Bend OR, I've become even more of an insufferable food snob than before. Coming back to Phoenix for a couple of weeks did not exactly excite my palate, except to see Silvana and get my fix of the world's most amazing churros. But, alas, I digress...

My memories, over a year old now, of Gallo Blanco are fond. On a lark, we decided to head there for dinner last Thursday and as we got closer, my mouth started watering just thinking about the luscious, fruity sangria. To start, we had the chorizo/queso fundito and the guacamole. The guac was AMAZING - so amazing, I swear they get their avocados from Mexico: the flavor was deep, full bodied and sensuous. For my entree I got three tacos: veggie, halibut and shrimp. The veggie & shrimp were excellent, but the halibut was not: a bit strong smelling with a taste that did not please. Not sure what was up with that, as it was a strong contrast in quality from the other two. My husband loved the chilaquiles and most definitely his margarita: he is usually not pleased with the first margarita that he orders anywhere except Zydeco (in Bend), but GB came through. My stepdaughter had the carne asada burrito and intended to finish it, except her dad kept making goo goo eyes at it and murmuring something about breakfast....

I'm going to refrain from commenting on the sangria for now, except to say I had two...We are headed back to GB for dinner tonight, and I'm going to road test the sangria and guac to make sure I'm not just fantasizing about finding amazing, whole food in Phoenix anywhere else but Silvana's kitchen.
