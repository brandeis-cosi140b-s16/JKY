I like these places where you go up to a counter and choose your own ingredients. So at Moe's, I ordered the "Earmuff" Burrito Bowl with Rice, Chicken, Cheese, Black Olives, Mushrooms, Sour Cream, Guacamole, and Bacon. But even though I'm a Baconaholic, I confess I'd leave off the Bacon on my next visit--you know, "less is more." Otherwise, this was a great composition for me and I would definitely order it again. Their chips are light and crispy; and their guacamole is fresh and tasty. I'm not into "spicy" so I like that the food was mild, but there is a salsa bar for those who want more heat. And they have one of those wonderful beverage machines with the infinite choices of sodas.The servers were friendly and there was plenty of seating, even some outdoors. I will certainly be coming back!
