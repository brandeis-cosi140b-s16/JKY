Decent tacos and super cheap too, especially if you come during lunch (before 3 pm) for their lunch special where you get 4 tacos, rice, beans and drink for $5.99. If you come after 3 pm, you pay the same price and just don't get a drink. They also have several other specials on the menu and the same policy applies. 

The chorizo is my favorite so far. The tacos seemed smaller than other places but the meats are tasty although sometimes slightly greasy. The horchata tasted watered down so just opt for a soda.
