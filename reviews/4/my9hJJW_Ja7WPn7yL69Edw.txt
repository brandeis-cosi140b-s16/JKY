Been here several times and wanted to say this is prob the best chipotle in all of Vegas. Food quality is awesome. Always fresh. But today, this little punk ass (manager?) lady on the line made it the worst experience ever. Chirpy ass annoying voice and all. I asked for double meat like I normally would, which is a up charge yes, I understand and pay it always. But she made them charge me 3x for extra meat? Wtf??? I tried to make a point and say I Said double meat yes, but I'm not asking for 4 servings and to be charged 4 servings!!! I paid $16.16 for my "double meat bowl" ridiculous. It may only be $4 more then what I normally pay.. But the arguing and sheer incompetence of this lady was ridiculous. It's hard to make me loose my cool, but fuck this lady. I almost threw the damn bowl at her.
