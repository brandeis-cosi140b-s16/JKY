In town for business and hotel was across the street, if your from the south you may know Moe's and this place has the same concept. It was clean and about an hour from closing they were still busy and the food tasted fresh. I had the large steak quesadilla and did a combo with queso and chips. Everything was yummy and while a bit pricey at $11 for everything I would do it again over a greasy hamburger.
