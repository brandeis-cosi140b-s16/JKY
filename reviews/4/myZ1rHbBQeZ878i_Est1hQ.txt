Great tacos! Nothing fancy but great food before heading to the strip and fast.. Don't expect to much.. Just good old Mexican food! I've said it before but in Vegas you don't find too many good Mexican places and this place is definitely top 3.. This place reminds me of being in the valley(San Fernando valley) hanging with my cousins after a night at city walk! People need to stop being stuck up with this place! Its not a 5 star or even 4 star restaurant! Its a taco stand! Fast.. Fills you up and can cure a hangover with its salsa!
