I go to Vegas a several times a year and this is one stop that I ALWAYS make. 
Its just past Encore and in the middle of a little strip mall. Nevertheless a jewel 

My favorite is the Quesadilla con Chorizo, i usually get two of those and sometimes if Im really hungry Adobado taco or Carnitas taco. 

The kitchen is so clean!!! Not that I thought it wouldn't be however for as busy as it always is and the number of orders that they crank out it is impressively clean. 

I am looking forward to the new expansion, so I don't have to stand in line as long. 

Not that I mind waiting, its worth it.
