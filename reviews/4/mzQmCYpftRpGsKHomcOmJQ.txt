I don't like fake wanna-be Mexican restaurants.  You know, like Taco Bell or Don Pablo's.  "Mexican Inspired" food.  Bleh! 

So one day, I really had a taste for Mexican food and I had heard about Bea Taco Town.  Very easy to walk to from my job and very reasonably priced.  I ordered several tacos, rice and beans for my first visit.  The cochinita pibil (slow-cooked pork in orange sauce) taco and the tinga de pollo (shredded chicken) taco were pretty tasty.  I also enjoyed the rice and beans.  They also provide you with a small serving of sauce to go with your meal which was also tasty and definitely had a kick to it.  (I thinks that it's their version of pico, but I have never seen liquidy pico de gallo before.)

On another visit I had the Enchiladas Suizas with chicken and that was pretty tasty too.  I usually get my orders to go so that I can be as messy as I need to be when getting down with my lunch.  Once my co-workers smelled my food they asked me where I got my Mexican stash from.  I told them, "Bea Taco Town" and now we have several Bea Taco Town addicts in my office.

The service is very fast and everything is extremely fresh and it taste much more authentic than other Downtown Pittsburgh Mexican or "Mexican Inspired" restaurants.  Muy sabroso!
