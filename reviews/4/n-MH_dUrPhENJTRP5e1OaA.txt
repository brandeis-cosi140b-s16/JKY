Im not a huge fan of Mexican because what so many consider "authentic" is bland and tastes like retirement food. When it comes to Mexican I prefer the frou frou such as Padre's or Barrio. So when the Urban Spoon app picked this place I was a bit reluctant but I go wherever the Urban Spoon App takes me. I had preconceived notions about what this place would be like. I figured order at the counter, they make it ,you sit down and eat it. I wasn't even close. It definitely would be what most consider "divey", dimly lit, tons of booths and dare I say "adorable" with full service inclusive of bar. Tvs in the corners with various sports going on, menus with pictures (awesome)..everything is numbered so you dont have to make an ass out of yourself trying to pronounce something you know damn well you have no idea how to.  Service was fast and with a smile, no complaints there. Now for the food. Im not a fan of the corn tortilla..possibly because Pink Taco was the only place I ever had one and it left me with the wrong impression. So I ordered their Taco Siberia (double wrapped in corn tortilla) and now I understand the fuss. It opened up a whole new world and I am no longer a corn tortilla hater! But what I really want to rave about is the side of potatoes and onions I had. OMFG. Freakin awesome. They were like perfectly seasoned non french fried french fries?Its the best way to explain.. trust me, order and you will understand. This place is true authentic flavorful Mexican food and the prices were ridiculously inexpensive. Such a find.
