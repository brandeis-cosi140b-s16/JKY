I've been going for breakfast, lunch & dinner here for about 2 years on & off & have had nothing but the best experiences with the taste of food & prompt & kindly service from the wait staff. I see some negative responses but their a few & far between. My wife & finicky daughters absolutely love this restaurant. Gerardo is a great waiter too, if ya can, try to seat in his area. Be mindful it is a small restaurant so lines & waiting can be frustrating but if there is lines, they must be doing something right.
