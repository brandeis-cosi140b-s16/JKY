The homeless guy is gone.  Also, there is at least one employee that recognizes me, and tonight she handed me my order as walked up to the counter.  That was fantastic.  However, they still have some room to improve.  Not all of the employees are as aware as the one I have mentioned, but I am a satisfied customer.
