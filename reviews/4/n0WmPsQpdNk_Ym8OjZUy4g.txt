I would give this place 5 stars if it were free to eat there! Mmmmmmmmm  Great service every time. Strong drinks. The 2 dips they bring with the chips, right when you sit down, are outstanding. Wait, THOSE are free, so maybe I should make it 5 stars. Authentic Mexican? Who the hell knows, but it tastes grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreat! And fills me up every time. 2 full meals, 2 drinks all for around $30. Find the 2 for 1 coupon and you are a rock star.
