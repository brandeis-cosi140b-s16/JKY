Service was great! Food was definitely memorable. I had the carne azada tacos, the meat was well seasoned and was grilled unlike other places where they throw it on the flat top stove and call it grilled. 
My daughters had the huevos divorciados, really good and spicy. The salsas were spicy but flavorful. They also had the posole, we have very high standards for posole, this one was really good!! Their chips and salsa were also really good and flavorful salsa. The place itself was clean and had a foosball table and other games for an evening get together with friends. Our visit was definitely memorable and we will be coming back!
