Love this concept!  I think I could seriously eat enchiladas at least once a week and Gadzooks makes we want to eat them here.  The cornbread and potato enchiladas were amazing...unique options and super flavorful.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations, the patio was pet friendly and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  

They told me today that they won best chicken taco this weekend at the AZ Taco Festival, so you definitely want to check this place out!
