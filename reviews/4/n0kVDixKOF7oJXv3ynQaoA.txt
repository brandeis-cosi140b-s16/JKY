I ate here again because I was staying in the Cosmo and wanted to get something quick.  So I sat at the bar and the service there was good.  I remembered that the tacos were ok so I ordered the carnitas and the fish tacos.  I would have to say that the carnitas taco was super good.  The pork rinds on top put it over the top.  Delicious.  The fish taco was less successful.  The pickled onions were too strongly flavored and completely overwhelmed the fish.  I also had the rou jia mo street sandwich - this is slow cooked pork belly (I think) on a crispy baked Chinese flatbread.  OMG - this was so good it's even beyond words.

The carnitas taco and the rou jia mo were so good that I had to go back one more time just before leaving Vegas.  After my gambling losses, I needed a sure thing!
