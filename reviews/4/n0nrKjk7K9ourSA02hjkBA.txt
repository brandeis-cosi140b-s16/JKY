Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed our meals.
The chile relleno and enchiladas were both very good.
They have a nice outdoor patio area that is walled off from the parking lot.
Service was good and they had a decent crowd for lunch that day.

El Encanto and Sofritas are the best two Mexican/tacos/tapas spots in Fountain Hills.
Will definitely be back.
