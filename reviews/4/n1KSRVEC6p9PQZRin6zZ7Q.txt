Carnitas burrito was very good but I would have liked something more than a ton of carnitas, guacamole and pico de gallo (like beans, rice, cheese)---just because it ended up being a ton of meat! Oh and the tortilla was so good! Not dry and a little chewy, yummmm!

Chips were also really yummy, kept under a heat lamp so they'll be nice and warm for ya :) 

My dad loved the guava agua frescas. I had a sip, I thought I tasted a spice of some sort, gave it some depth.

Anyway this wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had but it was a very good one. Place looked clean and server was nice but she couldn't understand my questions "what burrito is popular? What type of burrito do people like? What do you like?" haha oh well, it turned out alright for me :)
