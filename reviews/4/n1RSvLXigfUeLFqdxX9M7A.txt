Having that urban chic warehouse idea that doesn't give hint with cliche regional Mexico decor towards the modern Mexican food to be found is quite nice. Large white washed beams, iron round cage industrial lighting and wood slat raised wall details reminiscent of the 70's offers the modern Scottsdale atmosphere you hope to find in the area. 

Okay, enough of the eye candy. We're hip and happy with atmosphere (although current dance music pumped at overwhelming levels making any form of normal conversation very difficult needs to be dealt with, it was so loud it's one reason for the loss of a star) but what of the food. 

Like any Mexican restaurant worth its salt chips and salsa come quickly to the table. Hand made, thick and crunchy and a nice thick pur√©ed salsa with small heat are standard but good. 

Our group ordered a variety of tacos and chicken enchiladas. I chose three barbecue pulled pork on flour tortillas. Done in a street taco open face style when they arrive to your table. The pork was tender, well seasoned and included slices of pickled red onion (apparently all the rage right now? It provided a nice tart pop to the more mellow but full pork flavors. A tad on the dry side, but the beans were saucy enough I was able to spoon a little to each taco. The enchilada was layered like lasagna and quite tasty and felt unique. The rice was a bit off for some in the party as it seemed like it had been mixed with butter perhaps. I didn't mind and found it rather tasty.

Other taco places I have sampled and go to regularly offer true a la carte portions and more unique flavor combinations ("Moms Ortega taco, barbecue pork with fried pickles, Philly cheesesteak tacos, even mashed potato"), this is a good sampling and does offer numerous options if you want  to try Mexican food in a more modern but easily recognized style.
