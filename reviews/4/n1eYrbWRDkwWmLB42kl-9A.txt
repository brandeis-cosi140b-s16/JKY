Pretty good. Mixing the hot salsa with the mild is the way to go. Just had tacos and rice with the chips and only cost 12 bucks with soda. 

I've never heard of using mushroom soup for enchilada sauce. So I'm  pretty skeptical of that. But I'll give it a try. Just wish I could find green chile in this state. 

Left satisfied.
