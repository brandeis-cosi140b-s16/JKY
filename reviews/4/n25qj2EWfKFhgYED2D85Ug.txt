Today was a perfect day to get out of the house and grab a bite to eat.  I met my nephew at The Cantina.  We met here because I am a regular at the Tuscany, and I have comps that I can turn in at the restaurants.  I eat a little differently from most.  I cut all, if not most, of the carbs from my diet.  I explained that to our waitress and she took care of me.  It was hard to stay away from the chips and beans but I managed.  I ordered the chicken tacos and just emptied the middle and dumped the shell.  It was good but not as filling as I would have liked it to be.  But, that is my fault for eating the way I do.  I'm sure I'll be back soon and give it another try when I can eat a little more crazy.
