Best chicken nachos ever.  
The price is $7-something but I think it is worth every penny!
I am addicted to their nachos and I would keep going back just for their nachos.

I tasted their chicken nachos but the price for one small taco is almost $3 and I do not think its worth it at all.  The chicken is tasty but I would rather go to taco bell or del taco to satisfy my craving for tacos. 

The cashier & I think he is the cook isnt too friendly but the owner of the place is really nice!
