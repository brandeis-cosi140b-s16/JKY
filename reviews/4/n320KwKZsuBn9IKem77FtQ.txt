I first saw this place while I was on light rail going to basket ball game. The stop is nearby and it makes it easy to get to. The food here is very good! Everything I get here tastes home made and offers just the right amount of spice. Their salsas are very delicious! I always get the enchiladas or the bean burritos served enchilada style. Both the red and green sauce are very tasty. The service is always very fast and helpful. We came here late one night and were one of the only people left, but the waitress never hurried us and was very courteous.
