Breakfast crunch wraps are the best. I always  get  the chicken quesadilla with extra jalape√±o sauce. Never gotten and order wrong just a little cheap with the sauce. No complaints other than the 3 sauce packets for my family meal of 5. Food just doesn't taste the same with pace or other salsa at home.
