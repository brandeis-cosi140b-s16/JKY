Tried both of the vegetarian burritos... Amazing! Great salsa/sauce. Not sure why they've taken a stand against chips. OK, so it's a fusion place, how 'bout plantains or sweet potato chips. Something. Hope they expand the menu because so far so great! We took out but if you dine in be prepared for a tiny place. Will return!
