There is a second Los Taquitos, owned by the same family as the original. I have eaten here a bunch of times. I had seen their other location on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and when they opened this one near my house I was thrilled. This one is on 16th Street at Glendale. It's a great street style taco shop and they serve breakfast,lunch and dinner. Their food is all good and authentic. If you are staying close by at the Hilton Squaw Peak and you want to eat some good Mexican food, head on over. I highly recommend the tacos. Check out taco Tuesday, they're only $1 or go for happy hour and get $3 margaritas and Mexican beer. I especially like to go for a late breakfast. The chiliquilles and breakfast quesadilla are great. It's always good.
