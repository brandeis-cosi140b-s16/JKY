Comments of "Los" have been rampant throughout my school and I would always hear about their breakfast burritos, beverages, and tacos. At first, I was confused why there would be food at "Lowes," but when I realized the food came from a Mexican restaurant, I became curious. Obviously the food was good because many students were willing to ditch class to get their burrito fix for lunch, but I had to try it out for myself. 

I went with a few friends to survey the place out. The fast food restaurant was small, but it was perfect for our gathering. The convenience of the location on a main road and near a local shopping market gave the place many regular customers. When you walk in, the first thing that comes to view is the large painting of a cartoon Mexican man, which appeared to be the logo. The overall close quarters and decor added to the warm charm it exuded. 

The menu appealed to different people with different tastes, as there were vegetable, fish, chicken, and beef options. I decided to go with the "Carne Asada Burrito," which a friend had recommended to me earlier that day. The service was a little slow because of the lack of employees, but that could be disregarded because once I took a bite of the burrito, I was hooked. I had the opportunity to try it with a green sauce that the worker suggested and it enhanced the eating experience. 

Although Mexican food is not a favorite of mine, I was surprised at the fresh quality because it was a fast food restaurant; Los Favoritos even beat out Rubios', another premier Mexican restaurant. I hope to become a regular and next time, treat my family to the burritos. The price is not too costly and is a fantastic place to take your family, friends, etc. I can almost guarantee that the food will have you returning for more.
