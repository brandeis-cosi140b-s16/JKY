Came there after a hard day of work with my boss and co-worker for dinner. 

Cleanliness/Decor
The place looked like a sports bar. There were TVs hanging with sporting events everywhere. It was darkly lit and had a romantic feeling (only and if it wasn't a sports bar it could achieve that effect). Also it was pretty clean for what I could see. 

Food
Food was great! I got street taco plate. My coworkers and I shared some Fiesta Nachos with Filet Mignon. It was delicious! I honestly recommend everybody getting the Fiesta Nachos!

Service
Service was GREAT! The waitress was very friendly and helpful. 

Overall Experience
4 Stars! Everybody should GO! 

Happy Eats Everybody!
