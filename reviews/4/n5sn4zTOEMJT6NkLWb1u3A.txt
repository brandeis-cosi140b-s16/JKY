I have a potato, egg and cheese burrito here at least once a week.  It is soooo yummy!  It tastes better than Filibertos and Eribertos.  It's bigger too!  The staff is really friendly.  I haven't had a bad experience yet.  If you use CC they charge you $.50.   If you go inside they have the typical salsa bar.  Carrots are really crunchy. mmm
