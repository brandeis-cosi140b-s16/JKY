I have started working closer to this location and go here from time to time after work. I find the staff friendly, the seating perhaps at times a bit cramped and it's almost always pretty busy (which Chipotle isn't) but they do a great job of moving the line along and doing so with a smile. 

It's sometimes difficult to find parking on extra busy days and for some reason the "fresh food" always seems to get cold quickly but I always come out of Chipotle full and usually happen. If there is a tip I can give to regular or new Chipotle eaters is to get a burrito bowl and simply ask for a tortilla on the side. Best of both worlds. Get my bowl and can make my own little burritos.
