Best carne asada burrito in Vegas.

It's incredibly authentic. A fresh tortilla, seasoned beef, beans and rice as well as hot sauce if you want that extra kick. 

They a salsa bar with all sorts of typical additives. What stands out is the onion/cilantro mix. So simple, yet it really makes a difference.

I have tried the chicken nachos, and they were pretty nasty. You're better off going to Roberto's for those.

They offer a variety of burritos, tacos and combination plates. You can also order a burger and fries, which I though was unusual, but hey.

A few different locations is town and open 24 hours.
