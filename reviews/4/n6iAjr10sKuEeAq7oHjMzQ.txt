This place was good and cheap, just how I like it! It was a little far from where I live and nothing was super spectacular but it was good and If I was in the area I would stop by again.

We got the:
cheese empanadas- delicious.
adobada tacos- pretty good, not the best I've had, but good

They bring you free chips and salsa when you first sit down.It was a nice touch. The specials are on the side of the cash register if you want to get a better deal, though I found everything to be pretty inexpensive already.

My only real complaint would be that all the reviews said the tortillas were handmade, mine were definitely not. :(
