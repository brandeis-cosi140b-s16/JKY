WOW the Tuna specialty taco with the honey Wasabi sauce, so tasty. I definitely recommend!! Unfortunately I've had better Guacamole... Although I did like the minced jalape√±os sprinkled on top! 

This was my first time in Charlotte, I was passing through en route to Atlanta. So while my time was limited I'm really happy with my decision to stop here! Great tacos!
