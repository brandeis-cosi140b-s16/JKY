I am a professional cook myself so i tend to be critical about quality, service and presentation. With that being said my dining experience last night was a treat. As soon as my eyes were presented with my dish(BBQ Mahi Tacos w/ Spicy Avacado pasta), i couldn't wait to indulge. My dish was fresh and full of flavor, plated simple but nice. The atmosphere was relaxed and pleasant. My girlfriend's Beer Battered Salmon dish left much to be desired. Personally salmon is not a fish that muddle up with deep frying. The flavor was truly lacking. Rachel was our server and definitely contributed to our pleasant dining experience. I would highly recommend this very reasonably priced restaurant to a friend.
