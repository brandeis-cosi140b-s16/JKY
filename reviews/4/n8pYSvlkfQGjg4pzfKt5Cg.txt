This is a very nice, clean place. My husband and I stopped by here late one Saturday morning. It's amazing what they offer. Can't really call them an IHOP or Denny's since they also serve a more authentic selection of Mexican food. Asked the waiter if everything on the menu is up for grabs at whatever time of the day, and his response was, "yes". Hooray!!! American, Chinese, Mexican. Breakfast items as well. Yummy! My husband had a meat and veggie loaded omelet and loved it. I had pancakes, poached eggs, fruit, and sausage. Pancakes left something to be desired. Tasted store bought but okay. Wish they could spice the pancakes up a bit with diff toppings or flavors. Friendly staff and good cheap food. Will def come again to check out their Chinese and Mexican dishes.
