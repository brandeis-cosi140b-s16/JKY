very cool environment, great staff who have earned their chops at postinos and Windsor downtown (great to see familiar faces).  have been here several times with friends and each time very nice.  i had tamales and they were tasty but a little dry, asked for some enchilada sauce - excellent.  good food, house salsa is super tasty, margs are excellent.
