How I love me some street tacos! And Mucho Macho Tacos sure does have them! We came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon after hearing that it had recently opened. I've been to Tacos Atoyac before so I was excited about this place opening seeing Atoyac closed. 

Mucho Macho is definitely a lot cleaner than Atoyac. It also seams to have more tables inside but there isn't a patio like the old location. I can see when It gets busy finding room might be tough but lucky for us we were able to find seating right away. 

We ordered a few different tacos and a carne quesadilla. I'm a huge fan of street tacos and all of there were really good. We ordered the crispy fish tacos, pastor, and carne. I loved the pastor taco so much! Next time I think I'll just order a bunch of them! Carne was. A close second and I did enjoy the fish but I'd probably stick to pastor and carne next time. I enjoyed the quesadilla but my wife actually thought the meat was a little tough. 

Overall I had a great experience. For 4 tacos and a quesadilla total was right around $15 for the both of us. We had a lot of food and paired with chips and great salas you really couldn't beat the prices.  I'll forsure be back!
