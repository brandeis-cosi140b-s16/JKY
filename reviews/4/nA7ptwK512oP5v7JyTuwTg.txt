I'm a Moe's fan, I'll admit. I don't think the flavor is that good(I think all of these types of restaurants taste like a Mexican Subway, and by that I mean any form of imagery you can imagine). But Moe's wins out among the Big 3(Moe's, Qdoba, and Chipotle) in a pinch for a single reason: Moe's offers free chips, which means for less than $3 I can get chips, salsa, and a Unanimous Decision(veggie taco with guac and sour cream). Seriously, how can you beat that?

Honestly, it's just a chain fast food burrito place. You know what you're getting when you walk through the door.
