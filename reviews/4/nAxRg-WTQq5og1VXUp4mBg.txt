Yummy!! Thought we would try their namesake and get two carne asada burritos to try it out. These were really good! The meat was seasoned well (maybe a little too salty but still tasty) with fresh pico and a nice layer of guacamole. The tortilla was nice and chewy, just the way I like it. There was a very nice man working the window, so customer service was great too. We will be back.
