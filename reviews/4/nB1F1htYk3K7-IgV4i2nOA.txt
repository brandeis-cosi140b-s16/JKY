Pretty dang good!  I tried the Barbacoa, Pibil and Queso Fundido tacos and all were great.  The Barbacoa was my fave, it had incredible depth of flavor and was extremely tender.  My husband preferred the Queso Fundido; perfectly salty & meaty. :)
At $7 for 3 tacos it was a pretty good deal considering the quality of ingredients & location.  This shop is TINY though....only four tables inside and a few more out on the patio.  Once it gets hot I'll have to settle for take-out only.  Can't wait to try the Sonoran Dog!  :)
Three cheers for a cool salsa bar too...
