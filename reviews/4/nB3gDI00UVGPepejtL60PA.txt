I've eaten at the Gilbert location before so I remembered that the tacos were good.  Was scoping this place out at least a month before it opened....it was like a Mervins commercial....OPEN OPEN OPEN!  Well, it finally did, and the tacos are still good! For a semi fast food joint the food is well above average!  Crunchy tacos are delish..beef and chicken, rice has a good flavor, I don't really eat beans so their beans are ??? And the other items other ppl were eating looked good.  Guac...not bad and better than expected. Chips...decent. Salsa decent.  Like I said, GREAT for what it is. Two thumbs up for clean and super nice service!  We will be back soon for sure!
