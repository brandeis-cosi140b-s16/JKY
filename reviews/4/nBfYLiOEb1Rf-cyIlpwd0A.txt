Just a quick note....,if your looking for fancy food this is not the place.If you want dinner for 2 with many drinks and and appetizer for $50 or so....this is the place. Best part is that happy hour goes till 8pm,most places it goes till only 6pm, It let's me catch a later dinner and still get drink specials.

We also just won $200.00 plus on the slots machines the other night...sweet!
