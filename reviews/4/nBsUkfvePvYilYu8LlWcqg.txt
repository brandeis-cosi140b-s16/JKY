What can I say? I confess. I like Taco Bell. Usually not a Yelp check-in worthy event though. Definitely not review worthy. Except tonight. 

The workers on this visit were simply awesome. How often can you say that about a fast food restaurant? I eat at this Taco Bell fairly often, usually just running in for the quick and cheap $2.99 meal deal (a best buy, hard to find on the menu board), motivated by a dining room that is really nice compared to most Taco Bells.

On this night I was accompanied by extended family. Two unexpected things happened. First, I was offered an unexpected discount. Nice! Second, we were given some free cinnamon twists, prompted I think by the cute kids we had in tow. Even nicer! 

A great family outing at Taco Bell! Who knew? I was only expecting quick and cheap, but received much more.
