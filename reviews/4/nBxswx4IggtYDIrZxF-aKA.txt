Those of you who had a less than perfect experience should give it another shot.  I have eaten here more than a dozen times now since they opened and it is delicious!  They are so generous with their great condiment bar that has delicious salsas, fresh cilantro and limes.  The food is fresh and tastes outstanding.   A few times when busy it has been a little slower or the order a little mixed up, but I feel this is understandable as they have just opened and are getting everything organized.  The staff is friendly and always working diligently to make the customers happy.
