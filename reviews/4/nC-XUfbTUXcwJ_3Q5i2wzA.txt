First time visiting, and the experience was good. The service was friendly, and the lady interacted with my 4 year old (which he loved). We enjoyed the flavor of the chicken, but the rice was a little bland. I did like the brown rice and wheat tortilla option. I didn't like the queso, but my hubby loved it. They were out of coca-cola which was a bummer. It reminded me of chipotle, which is good too. For 2 adults and 1 kid it cost about $26.
