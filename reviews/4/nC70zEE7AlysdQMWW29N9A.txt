I know I know, I'm a foodie, I shouldn't like fast food. I know I know, there's so much local food around, why chipotle?

But there's just those days. When I just wanna have some guac and chips, and some good old chicken burrito. It's just good old comfort food. And, its cheap! What more can you ask for?

I love the chicken. Most people do it dry, but its always juicy at chipotle. I like the corn, salsa, sour cream with my burrito. I usually share half of it with my man.

The chips are kinda salty though, but whatcha gotta do when you want some good old guac?
