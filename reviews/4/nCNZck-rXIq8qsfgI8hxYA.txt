The atmosphere is very casual very mom and pop. But who cares cause it's the FOOD you're really here to enjoy! The service is solid the people are friendly and you cant beat the price. We got there at about 5:30pm on a Wednesday and the place was full.

We ordered the bulgogi nachos and the bulgogi burrito. The meat in the burrito was sooo tasty and the combination for the rice and beans and salsa mmmmm mmmmm good! The nachos...seriously I cant really remember cause we WOOFED it down sooo fast!!!  I was worried that the hot sauce would be too spicy so I asked for it on the side but it was just enough kick and it fused everything together!

I recommend to order a variety of dishes and do family style on your first visit so that way you can taste a little bit of all the tasty goodness....I could have just eaten the free chips salsa and guacamole all day....its not your regular chips but I wont give it away...just go and try it! 

This was definitely a winnah winnah chicken dinnah!!! (waving my shaka in the air)
Thank you mark m for the recommendation!
