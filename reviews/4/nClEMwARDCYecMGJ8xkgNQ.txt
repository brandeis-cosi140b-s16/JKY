Loves the burrito drive! Be sure to order a specialty burrito, if you try to build your own you'll just screw it up! The braised pork and shamena burritos are favorites at our house. An order of chips is enough for one person. Probably skip the chips and dip - the bean dip isn't very good and the amount of  guac you get is not worth the price. 

--below I clicked beer and wine - they only have beer.
