Went here for the first time today and it was really good!  I'm a big fan of the one in Cave Creek, and although they don't have the spectacular patio that the Cave Creek location has, the food, service and atmosphere were still very good.  There were five of us for lunch; two had special orders (vegetarian meals), two people had the special (a fabulous stuffed poblano) and I had the steak fajita taco salad (also really good!).

My first indication of a good Mexican restaurant is the salsa and they didn't let me down here, serving us three different types of salsa and a couple baskets of warm chips.  The service was fast and friendly.  A little too warm to sit on the patio but we checked it out afterwards and will definitely go back when the weather cools.

So did I have anything negative to say about the place?  No, not really, actually.  It wasn't a WOW moment in Mexican food, but most definitely very very good and we'll be back.  And yeah, I think I'd go out of my way to come here again, not just a "as long as we're here we might as well go there" type of place.  Any of you who are loyal to the Cave Creek location, give this place a try...it's worth it!
