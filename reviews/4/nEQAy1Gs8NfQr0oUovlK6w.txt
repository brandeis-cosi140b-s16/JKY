I really like this place.  It's a little different and usually not busy - but they are pretty new and in an area of town that just doesn't get that busy.  It's a huge place so it looks more empty than full.  Plus they are not advertising on TV and billboards like the only other competitors (chains) in the area.

I really like the salsa and the hot sauce.  One thing I really LOVE is the shrimp cocktail.  It is fabulous!  Fresh and full of shrimp.  I don't think I've ever had one in the Valley that has been as good.  It reminds me of sitting beach side in Mexico.  I go back often just for the shrimp cocktail.

My daughter is vegetarian and there are plenty of options for her, besides the standard vegetarian Mexican dishes of cheese enchilada and cheese quesadilla.

It's not fancy and it's not packed, but that is part of what I love about it!
