Went to Zapatas on a Tuesday night for dinner at 6:30pm.   No wait for a table - they immediately sat us outside (weather was gorgeous).  Service was fairly prompt - the chips kept a rollin' out all night.  The food is as you would expect, meaning good but not out of this world.  I've been here many times and for the first time tried a menu option outside of my normal comfort zone.....Pollo con Mole - chicken breast braised in a sweet spicy peanutbutter based sauce with a hint of cinammon.  Really interesting flavors.  I think I'll add it to the rotation.

Other guests in our party that night had fajitas which looked and smelled delicious.  The margarita pitcher didn't last long, but not because it was small, because they're pretty darn good.

I'm a fan.
