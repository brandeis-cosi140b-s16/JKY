Just went last night for taco Tuesday ($1.50 fish tacos).  Their fish tacos are way good - make sure you get the corn tortillas.  Until having them here, I've always wanted more out of them.  Too often, tacos are placed into two tortillas - because one by itself typically falls apart.  Not here, they're perfectly cooked - and chewy - so go corn all the way.  Don't forget to get a side order of the refried beans, they're awesome as well.
