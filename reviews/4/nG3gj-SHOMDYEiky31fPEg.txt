I'm quite surprised at the low reviews recorded for this joint. It's actually a lot better than the measly 3.5 stars it has even though I rate it a half star more than the average.

Coming from LA where I know what's up with my Mexican fix, this place definitely serves Mexican food that can quite possibly resemble my beloved taco trucks in my hometown. The Asada can definitely be cut to smaller pieces, however everything else is as good as it gets. My personal favorite was the chorizo. I only got a single taco of chorizo and it was a mistake because I should have gotten maybe 10 more. They normally don't list the chorizo burrito outside the breakfast hours but if you ask, they will give to you. It's spicy and juicy. The pastor is cut from spits and served with the pineapples which gives the juiciness as well. The asada burrito was okay at best. Excess of rice and beans which takes away the taste of the asada. Nonetheless, I can easily eat 10 tacos. 

Tacos are only $1.35 so take that Tacos El Gordo ($2.00 excluding taxes)!

This place is easily the best tacos in town.
