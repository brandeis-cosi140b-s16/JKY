Love this place! The outside patio is terrific, decorated so nice with white lights and a big fountain, and fireplace in the winter. The food is 90% great, although sometimes inconsistent. I've had just about everything on the menu at least once and don't have a complaint.  It's a great place to bring out of town guests. And their Margaritas are good!
