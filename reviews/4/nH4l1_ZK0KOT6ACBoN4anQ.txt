Cash only so stop at the ATM before you come. Great Mexican food at great prices. You go inside, place your order then stand outside or in the covered dining area till they call your number. Very mixed clientele here. Today I see construction workers, beautiful young latinas, old white guys, a couple hipsters and some business professional types in suits. Chili is good....not too hot but not too mild. Great place to eat at a reasonable cost!
