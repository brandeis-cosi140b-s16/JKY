This past weekend, some of my buddies went to the Taco Festival in Scottsdale and this place was one of the restaurants represented.  They enjoyed their food so much they suggested we try it for lunch.  

First things first...Great service and it looks really adorable in there! Our server was on the ball refilling our iced teas, asking if we needed anything else, making recommendations, etc. I have no complaints. The chips and salsa were yummy and fresh. I ordered the shredded chicken burrito and both of my friends ordered the steak street tacos. The burrito was HUGE (I barely was able to eat 3 bites due to my snacking on the chips and salsa, but it was verrrrrrrry yummy) and the rice and beans were very tasty.
