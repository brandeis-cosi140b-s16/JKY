Another great opportunity to check out a place I've been meaning to try, thanks to Groupon. 

The queso sauce was super yum yum. I got the nachos with the shredded beef. I found everything to be pretty good, but the queso sauce outshone everything else on my plate. My fella got the steak burrito with brown rice and pinto beans. 

I love that they have the option of whole wheat tortilla and brown rice. That's the great thing about this place. Healthy and non-healthy options unite. 

I'll definitely be back! More queso please.
