Visiting from out of town and looking for a quick Mexican restaurant.  Went to yelp and found The Corn Flower just 10 min away. Ordered the taquitos,  chips salsa and guacamole. While the service was a little scattered the food more then made up for it. The taquitos were delicious and the guacamole was so fresh and delicious. And the chips were homemade and fresh. Overall a definite 4 star and I would come back again next time I was in the area.
