This is a great little place.

They have almost as many dessert options as they have food, which is unusual in itself.  Check the website menu for a full list.

We had the rib-eye tacos and the Cubano torta.  Both very very tasty and a good value for the price, and both were very well-seasoned and yummy.  Big chunks of avocado on each taco, and a salsa bar with a lot of good options.

They also have....

chocolate covered strawberries for 75 cents each.

One of the best values on THAT product that you will find anywhere.

It was clean and shiny in there too, and open, and overall just a pleasant ambiance.

Definitely a spot I will return to, probably many times.  Highly recommended !!!
