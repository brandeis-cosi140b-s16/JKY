Have lived in SE Gilbert (might as well be QC it's so far SE) for about 2 years and just now discovered this gem.

The building is gorgeous... from the outside.  The inside leaves something to be desired... not much ambiance.  We went on a Sat night about 7:30pm.  There was a short wait (about 15 minutes).  The host sat us and gave us chips and salsa along with the menus, good thing since we were starving.  The salsa is very tasty, but I wish it had more heat.

We ordered a shredded chicken quesadilla to start.  OMG so f'ing delicious I want to eat it every day.

For our entrees, I got the pollo asado burrito enchilada style.  I kid you not, I'm drooling right now... literally there is drool dripping down my face... 

The food is incredible.

Hubby got the carne asada GORDO burrito, which he loves, and I say that in the present tense because he is still eating it... and will be for the next 3 weeks.  It's that huge.

To drink we had prickly pear margaritas, which were awesome except for the price.  $8 a piece. Ouch.  For a place like this I was expecting margaritas to be cheap, like $4 at the most.

Service was great, food was great.  We will ABSOLUTELY be back.
