Really liked this place overall.  Saw it on diners drive ins and dives and thought I had to check this place out!  It is defiantly a divey type place, it sits in a little shopping center area and the inside is pretty small with minimal decor.  

The staff was great, we were helped immediately at the counter and every experience with them was nothing short of awesome.  The menu is pretty small but awesome at the same time.  They seem to do a few things really well.  There was so much we wanted to try but didn't have the stomach capacity for at the time.  We went with a couple burgers to include the daily special and some sweet potato tots.  Great choice if I do say so.  It was prepared fresh and fast and was right out in no time.  

Honestly I was surprised at the size of the food.  I guess I'm so used to today's huge American sized everything that the smaller burger size surprised me at first.  That being said I think it was so refreshing and great.  It's the perfect size to be satisfied, not over stuffed and not having to take home things you'll never eat again.  Very delicious!
