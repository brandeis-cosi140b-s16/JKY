Great food overall. 

I usually get the Sausage or Chorizo breakfast burrito which both are pretty good. However, I still love Filibertos burritos more because they are bigger and tastier. But if you're down in south chandler, this is the place to go.

They are pretty quick here with making your food. Filibertos usually takes a while to make the food so this is where Los Faves shines.
