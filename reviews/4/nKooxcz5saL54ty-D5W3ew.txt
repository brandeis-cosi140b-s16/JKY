I had read about Yolo's on Yelp prior to my Vegas trip so I had an idea that I wanted to try it. I got a strong craving for Mexican food so we went to Yolo's on Christmas Day. Originally I wanted to come for the lunch special but I ended up coming after that time slot so we ate off the regular menu. When we went the restaurant was pretty empty but we still had to wait 10 minutes for a table (odd). We were seated and our waitress was nice.

I got the chicken street tacos with rice and black beans. I liked my food but I couldn't eat it all because I was getting full. The price was reasonable at $12. I got the Razzarita drink, which is a blended drink of raspberry schnapps, vodka, etc. which was  very good and just my style, fruity adn blended. My sister got the steak nachos which were somewhat small. Her only complaint was that the steak tasted weird but overall the nachos were good.

The total for the bill for 2 people plus one alcoholic drink was, I believe $38 which is a very good price for a late lunch/early early dinner meal on the strip. I would go back.
