I've been eating at this Armando's since High School and have always loved the food and service. The ladies at the counter are always really friendly and a 24 hour drive thru is heaven for late light cravings or coming home from being out late! As a "mature adult" my taste buds have also matured, but Armando's has a place in my heart that can never be replaced by fancy restaurants. 

Some of my favorites:
- Armando's Breakfast burrito
- Carne Asada Fries (they only use Angus meat!!!)
- Adovada Burritos
- Rolled Tacos
