Tried this place based on reviews.  I had the chicken burrito and chicken soft taco.  The taste exceeded my expectations.  Portion was huge for the money.  The chicken is not all white meat.  If they used all white meat, probably would have given it 5 stars.  Chips are great, but extra cost, and their Green sauce was amazing.  Taste was great, but chicken quality could be better.  I look forward to trying more on the menu.
