I originally wanted to give them a three star review, but their happy hour pushed them up to a four. 

Three stars:
Great location on Mill
Nice bar and patio, tons of room. 
Cool bathrooms.
A little lacking on he service, when it wasn't that busy.
Tequila prices higher than ZTejas

Four stars:
Great drink deals
Great food deals
Guacamole is awesome
Best street tacos I have had in a long time

When you check them out you have to try the house margarita and tacos, at happy hour tho, they are a bit over priced any other time.
