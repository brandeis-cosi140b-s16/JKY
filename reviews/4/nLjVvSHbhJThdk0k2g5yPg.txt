Just like almost every other Chipotle, they serve fresh, quality Mexican food. I've been here plenty of times and always had a good experience. Line moves at a fast, steady pace. I've even been here during their busy lunch hours and the wait was reasonable. The facility is clean and the workers are pleasant. You can imagine how exciting it was for Laveen to open a Chipotle because the next nearest ones are either the Cityscape location or 24th st and baseline which is quite a drive.
