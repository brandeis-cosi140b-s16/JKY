This place is a gem - had a few burritos from there and can't wait to try other things.  I had the California Carne Asada burro yesterday - it was GREAT!  My honey usually gets the mixed burro with chicken, which is super too.

Cheap, big portions, friendly service.  It's going to be one of our go-to places if we don't feel like cooking!
