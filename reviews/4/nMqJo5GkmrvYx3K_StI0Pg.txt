So I'm a huge fan of Robson's other spot (yet I get the irony) Gallo.  The menus are basically the same as is the high quality of food.  And coffee is from Lux so if you need a little caffeine with your chiliquilles (my preference is the veggie option slathered in the green salsa)  then don't hesitate.  

This is a little quieter than Gallo but it is also a little more sterile feeling.  There is a warmth to GB that isn't here with the white walls and massive windows but that said the parking is far better, the food is the same high quality, and the hours are a little broader which makes for big appeal.

I'm just happy to have multiple locations to get some of Robson's yummy creations. :)
