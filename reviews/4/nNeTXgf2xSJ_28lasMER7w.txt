I will say this for Super Mex: they're consistent. They're nothing spectacular, and the service is sometimes a bit lackluster, but for reasonably inexpensive Mexican food, 24 hours a day, they definitely do the trick! Their fajitas are actually quite good, and both the cheese enchiladas and chimichangas are good standby items.
