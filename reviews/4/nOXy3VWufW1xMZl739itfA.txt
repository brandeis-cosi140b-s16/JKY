4 stars. 

Family friendly place when you have a little one is on my top requirements when we go out to eat now. We actually decided to eat dinner earlier and at 5 there was a bunch of families already there eating and watching football. 

Service was really attentive from the start. We decided to order the mixed fajita (chicken and beef). We both got Fideo soup and it was pretty tasty. The flaming fajitas part was entertaining but I think what matters is the food. The chicken and beef were tasty and moist and I even ended up eating onions with it and I don't like onions.  I asked for double rice instead of the rice and beans on the side and they gave it to me like I asked! The tortilla was a thicker type kind of like the type you get at Taco Bell, but other than the tortilla everything was delicious. We actually ended up ordering the churros for dessert too which was good. 

Overall, this place is good if you want fajitas. I definitely want to try some of the other items on the menu too.
