Very small cafe-style spot in a strip mall. Habanero's offers amazingly good authentic food that you would pay double for down the street. They have everything from breakfast burritos to unique daily specials. All are served with several delicious salsas. If your not trying to impress a date, then try this for an affordable, casual, neighborhood experience.
