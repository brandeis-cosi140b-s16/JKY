Happy hour at Milagro was nice. It can seem a little pricey of it's not happy hour, but I think that Milagro has found a good middle ground between fusion with a Mexican twist and just another waterhole. 

The service was excellent. Nicely dressed staff that addresses you properly and act like they enjoy your business. Ok, at happy hour it was be a little wait for a refill, but that is to be expected. 

Locale. The outside patio is super nice. The indoors is just as nice. They have succeeded to make a cozy yet stylish interior and there is several alternatives to sit by the bar, in a booth public or more discretely off to the side. It also feel clean and fresh.

I didn't get to try much of the food, but I did try a few beers.. and they were refreshing and not of the standard selection. I will definitely go back to Milagro, and give it another shot.. not that it needs to be given anything. This establishment stand on its own feet.
