So I was there a few days ago and really liked it. Food was good, the steak nachos were awesome and the burger good. I thought it was very reasonably priced though I was there during Happy hour (3-7?) so a lot was half off. Still 5 dollars a beer is about average in Scottsdale and half off is even better. The service was good and the bartender was funny and prompt with the drinks. I will definitely go back and recommend it to any of you.
