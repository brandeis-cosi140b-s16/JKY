This place is buzzing! You know is good when most of the customers are Hispanic. Seeing that big piece of adobada (spicy pork) on the rack when you walk in makes your mouth water. We got a sample of each, spicy beef, pork and beef on soft taco. All made to order with fresh ingredient, including the soft taco where they stamp them as needed. Don't forget to try the different meat such as the beef tongue, they looked good. They probably got some of the best tacos this side of Tijuana.
