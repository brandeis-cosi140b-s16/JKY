I like Serranos but sometimes their food seems a little too pre-made for my tastes. They have good salsa and bean dip and a good selection on the menu. Their veggie enchiladas are good as well as the spinach enchiladas. I like that they have fresh homemade tortillas. They aren't the best tortillas I've had but kudos that they don't use the waxy pre-packaged junk that a lot of places use.
