I'm a fan of Salsarita's and their ability to give you a quick lunch that doesn't result in a form of a sandwich.  This location is off of Tryon, right across the street from the Wells Fargo Plaza.  There are large windows in the front so you can look out onto the street... usually there are cars parallel parked on the street, so it's not much of a view, but at least it is a change in scenery for lunch (rather than staring at a computer screen or cubicle wall).

The staff at this location are friendly and efficient.  They even clear your tray for you as a courtesy if they see you are finished.

As with all things Uptown, they make use of the space and sometimes the line can wrap around the dining area if you hit it at the wrong time.  But even with a line, it moves fairly fast and you can get your burrito, nacho, quesadilla fix whenever you want to.

There is the main street entrance, but there is also a back entrance in the hallway of the Latta Arcade... you do have to pass by the restrooms in the back entrance, but it is usefull if you don't want to walk out into the elements or are trying to save time by cutting through the building.
