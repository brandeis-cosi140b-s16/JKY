After fine tuning my ordering process, zapata's gets upgraded to 4 stars. If you ask for spicy cheese dip, it will come out slightly green (from puréed jalapeños, I think) and delicious! Also the green salsa is better than the others. 

Goat cheese stuffed jalapeño peppers wrapped in bacon is the most interesting appetizer I've seen on a Mexican menu in a while. Definitely worth a try. 

Vegetarian chimichanga is fried hard and stuffed with various veggies. Enough to split.
