Faustos is a place just like robertos or don tortaco the only thing they do different is the beans and the types of chips they use. They have better refried beans than the other two and they offer a little more on the menu. Now i don't recommend breakfast burritos here which are one of my faves but I do recommend the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, carne asada nachos
