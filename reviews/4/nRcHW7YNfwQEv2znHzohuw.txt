Hubby and I have eaten here a few times. Now so thought I should write a review. The place is nice and clean and has a decent salsa bar. We have taken our food to go both times and I appreciate that you can pack up your little containers of salsa and limes in plastic baggies so you don't have a big mess by the time you get the food home. They also do a nice job wrapping the tortillas up so that they are still warm when you eat. 

Now onto the food. Not being a fan of Roberto's I was hesitant to try this place but was pleasantly surprised with the carne asada plate I had the first time. The meat was tender and flavorful. The rice and beans are decent, they just need a pinch of salt and a dab of salsa and they are a good side .  The only thing I didn't like was the massively ginormous flour tortilla that came with it. I thought it would be 2 smaller more manageable ones to roll and wrap.  I ended up tearing it into smaller pieces and was good to go. 

This last visit I ordered the pork carnitas plate and had the corn tortillas. Again nice tender meat and the tortillas were very fresh tasting. Hubby had the adobada plate which was amazingly delicious. I know what I will be ordering next visit. Very seasoned flavorful meat, guessing it is pork. At any rate when we are in the mood for fast Mexican food this place hits the spot.
