12/20/14 Update UH OH - Went by the other day for some food, and the sign is down and there was a ladder in front of the grill. Closed? Remodeling? Dammit!

This is the former Roberto's (As featured on DDD), inside the gas station. I'm glad to report that the place is back to having awesome food.

If you're tired of watery re-fried beans and flavorless rice - those days are over. These sides rock here! Taste-E. The chimis are huge, and of course you can get them enchilada style, with guac on top if u so desire. The Al Pastor (El Pastor here) is packed with flavor.

There's a chunky pico de gallo with avocado on the chip/salsa bar - you won't want to miss that if you like your pico packed with a decent amount of heat and a crisp citrus bite. The red sauce in the squirty bottle isn't nearly as hot nor as flavorful.

Yes, they have Mexican Cokes - in 2 sizes!

There's plenty of 'Bertos joints in the area - skip those and head to Los Kiko's.  Solid 4.5 stars.
