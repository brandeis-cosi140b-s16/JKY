I recently revisited Ricardo's last week (I hadn't been since 10 years prior). Service and service were good and efficient. Its open 24 hours and for us coming in so late all of the staff were in a pretty good mood. Margaritas were yummy! They also provided complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip! 
Growing up in a hispanic household it is sometimes difficult to find good authentic mexican restaurants, Ricardos did it for me.
