My family and I ate at this restaurant last nigt for my birthday.  Did not know it had changed names.  Not even sure if it is still the same management.  Was a little concerned as the sign outside said it was their grand opening and we were the only customers in the restaurant.  The only thing missing was the red salsa.  They had green but no red.  But instead they brought me Pico de gallo which was very good.  I ordered the chilie relleno which was very tasty.  One in our party had the steak fahitas and she was happy with them.  All in all we were all quite happy with the food as well as the service.
4 stars due to no red salsa and they also did not have mango for the mango margaritas and I could not understand why they just didn't go next door and buy them.  We had the peach margaritas (frozen) and they were really good.
I do miss the little shops that sold goods outside in the court yard.  These gave the place the authentic Mexico feel.
