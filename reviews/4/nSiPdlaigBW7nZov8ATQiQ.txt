Veggie Burro is perfection! Whole pinto beans, homemade Guacamole, cilantro, cheese, and salsa!! The tortillas taste authentic and fresh. Hubby loves the pollo fundido. All white meat chicken(breast)  burro topped with a spicy cream cheese and cheese. My rating is four stars because they charge for chips and salsa in the drive thru. :( Come on...a little bag o chips and some yummy salsa won't kill your business bottom line....but it will make happier customers!!
