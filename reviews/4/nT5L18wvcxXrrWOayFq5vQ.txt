Great little hole in the wall, and my first experience with frybread. I had it with beans, cheese, tomatoes, and shredded chicken. In retrospect, I may have overestimated my appetite, but it was yummy. My only real complaint was that the shredded chicken was on the dry and bland side. I was hoping for chicken that had been cooked with some sort of flavoring or salsa. It tasted great once I added some salt and a little of the salsa that was on the table though. The horchata was delicious too, and the selection of old-fashioned candy was fun to browse even though I didn't end up buying anything. Overall, I'd come back.
