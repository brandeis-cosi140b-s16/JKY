This place is my jam! I've been coming here a while.... I've always gotten good quality food & my crazy orders always come out right. The horchata here is my fav-not too much cinnamon. The quantity is always plenty. I've realized I get a lot more here for my $$$ then I do at other locations... I'll continue to make a guest appearance here from time to time. no autographs tho.... well, some exceptions can be made
