A pleasant-enough happy hour experience. It's got a nice, dark wood feeling inside that was comforting on a hot afternoon.

The happy hour menu isn't necessarily "cheap" but the food items were good, and  the wine choices interesting. The wings with the habanero sauce were tasty. I heard great things about the pork belly and jam sandwich. Service was good.

The music is a bit too loud, and for a place like this, a soundtrack featuring Coldplay and Jack Johnson (the hits of 2003) seemed a little off. We were two of 6 customers for Happy Hour, so it's likely that things like loud background music were more noticeable than they might have been otherwise.
