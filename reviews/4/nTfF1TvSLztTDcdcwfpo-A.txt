This place is open 24 hours, not too far from the airport (though a bit of a drive from the strip--I guess I haven't really found a place that is a proper hole-in-the-wall burrito place NEAR the strip, I'd rather not eat burritos at CHIPOTLE or Treasure Island...) and it was pretty cheap.  

The salsa is AWESOME (picture above).  

They definitely need more people staffing it.  There was one guy.  ONE GUY.  I went at a weird time and there were say 6 people hanging out just waiting for him to take everyone's orders and then cook it all up himself.  

I sure hope he's not working there for all 24 hours...
