Came here today to grab a quick lunch on my way into the office.   I picked one of their combos (#6) it came with a shredded beef burrito, cheese enchilada and rice and beans.  I did not eat the enchilada but I did really enjoy the burrito and some of the beans.  Really... you cannot beat this price $5.83!!!  The burrito had shredded beef, a little bit of green peppers and I think I saw little pieces of potato, it was very tasty!  I would definitely come back here again.
