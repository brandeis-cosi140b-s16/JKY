What can I say? You pretty much know what you are going to get at Chipotle; fresh and yummy. My husband introduced me to the bowls. It's basically a burrito in a bowl, sans the tortilla. The chicken is my favorite but if you go with the veggie chofu, the guacamole is included. That's about 1.50ish if purchased alone.
And yes, parking is a bit of a bear but not impossible.
