I had to update this review.  I go to this place all the time and the past 6 or 7 times the service has been much better.  'Tiny' is probably the best server here.  He's funny, personable, and he gets the job done.  The food is always consistent and now they've added a salsa bar.  Their chicken or beef flauta is great!  I love to go to new places but when I want mexican food, I want to go somewhere that I know is gonna be good.  Other than Carlito's Burritos, this is the spot for me.
