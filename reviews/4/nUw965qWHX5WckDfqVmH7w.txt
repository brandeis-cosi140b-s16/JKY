I'm so glad that a friend of mine chose this for our "double date" night. I've driven past here several times, and never thought to try it. I wasn't crazy about the chips here, but LOVED the spicy pickled carrot slices that came atop them! My dish was fabulous. I ordered the Fajitas Cozumel, made with shrimp and tilapia, this dish is fresh and fabulous. Not to mention HUGE, I took home almost half! Next time, We'll definitely go back--hopefully on a day that it's not POURING rain(as it was when we went), because I'd love to sit outside! So nice.
