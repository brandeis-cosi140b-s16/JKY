I've been here twice.  Loved it once and liked it alot the second time.  First, the patio really is lovely.  I don't feel like I'm in the middle of Scottsdale, that's for sure.  Great, efficient service both times.  Great food both times.  I forget the names of what I've ordered, but it's always fresh and mouth-watering.  The margaritas are big and decent.  They seemed stiffer on my first visit, a little more watered-down on my most recent visit.   Of course, my second visit was at happy hour, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Great chips and salsa.  Sopapillas were a novelty, but very good.  I plan to go back whenever I'm in the area if for no other reason that the patio- it's really an oasis in the middle of Old Town.
