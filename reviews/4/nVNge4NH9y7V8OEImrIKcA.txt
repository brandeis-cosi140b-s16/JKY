I like all the filibertos and eat at them frequently. They have great breakfast burritos! However, this location seems to be better than most for lunch. I am never disappointed here. It's fun to play mistery burrito. They have all these burritos named for different southwestern states and it's not posted what  the ingredients are. Everytime I order one it's a delicious surprise. I love me some Fili-B's
