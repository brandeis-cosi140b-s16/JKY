I have been here about 8-10 times and I love it. Great service, very good food, nice atmosphere and fair prices. It is my favorite Mexican place in town, hands down. Surprised by the mediocre reviews on here as everyone I know likes it too. I recommend a pitcher of sangria too. Guacamole is good too.
