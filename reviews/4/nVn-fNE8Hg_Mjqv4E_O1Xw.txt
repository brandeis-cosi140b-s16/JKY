ONLY reason why I'm giving 4 stars it's because of the ancho citrus shrimp burrito , that was amazing!! It has avocado in it, rice beans , and there was a lot of shrimp!:) 


However the cashier was hoooooorrible! Instead of her saying hi how are you or anything I was the one to ask her how she's doing today. Her attitude was disgusting but humorous to watch . Lol
