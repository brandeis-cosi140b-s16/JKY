Reviews here had me worried. But I wanted to take friends to this Phoenix icon before the Symphony. Fantastic green corn tamale. Salsa good. Margarita pitcher a little strong, but tasty! I hadn't eaten here in 20 years since I used to work downtown. So close to all the action when you have a downtown event. Go if you haven't been.
