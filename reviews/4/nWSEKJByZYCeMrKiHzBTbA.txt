We usually eat here about once a week, since it is so close to the office.
We use online ordering, and we've found it much easier to pay online when using a credit card. Anytime we try to pay in store it seems to get complicated for the staff, because there are usually a few different payment methods.
They are pretty friendly and the food is usually ready when we get there. 

This location is a little smaller than others that I've been to, but since we are mostly going for takeout it's fine with me. There is usually a line when I get there, but since we've ordered online, I can go straight to the check out. 

Food is always good, very consistent. I usually order the Barbacoa Bowl with white rice and black beans or Barbacoa Soft Corn Tortillas. I like the corn and hot salsa. 
Pro tip: Use online ordering, pay with a credit card online, for easy pick up.
Pro tip: ask for tortillas on the side. 
The guacamole seems expensive, but you do get a fair amount. Like 4 oz. 
Pro tip: order it on the side, because otherwise it's too much all in one spot.
