This is easily the best Roberto's in the valley. I used to go to the one on DI and Durango but they charge you extra for using a debit card. I found this one on Trop and Ft. Apache and it is just as good, if not better. The interior is really nice, large and well lit. Plenty of places to sit down. The salsa bar is also better stocked and cleaner. I always get the Carne Asada Nachos with extra pico de gallo but that was just too much food for me today. Instead I settled for the Shrimp burrito. This burrito was on point. Just a tad too much rice but onions, green peppers and large shrimp were really good. Make sure you get the spicy version for a good kick.
