Always got the carne asada fries. The fries stay crispy for a long time no matter how much guacamole, pico de gallo, or sour cream is on it. The meat taste great and you get enough to keep you full for most of the day. You don't wait too long for it and there haven't been long lines if any, at least the times I have went. Definitely a go to place for me when Im low on cash and need a filling meal.
