was this the old ceramic place???? wow, what a change. 

the interior decor is super cute...almost like a 50's diner! they have a cozy, refreshing patio, which is where we parked for our meal. 

so we heard about these brussel sprout nachos? they are the bees knees! i kid you not, they are absolutely delicious. they are a great app for 4 people or a meal for 1. the cheese, brussel sprouts, and chili rings all go together with the delicious chips. 

i had the playa poke for my entree. the chipotle aioli was ok. i'd rather taste the fish than the sauce. next time i'd get something different. my dining companions loved their tacos, tataki and tulum poke. if you get the lettuce poke, be prepared for a hand-mess...it's hard to eat without a fork/spoon. 

i also ordered a side of fried plantains. sweet, crispy, and soft. cooked perfectly.

the one negative...the wife ordered a drink...it came in a coconut. basically it was 10 bucks for 2 sips. the inside of a coconut is small, and then they pack it with ice so essentially it was a bum deal. 

other than that, very cute and tasty place. the patio is NOT dog friendly we were told.
