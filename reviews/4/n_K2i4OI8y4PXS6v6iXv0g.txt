I know a lot of people have less than stellar things to say about Top Shelf....but they have the best salsa around!  I started taking my sister and her roommate there, and they literally eat bowls of the stuff!  It is so fresh tasting, with just enough heat to keep you coming back for more!

I also love their Green Chile Beef, it is some of the best around.  The meat is so tender and there is a good amount of heat going on with it as well.  For those watching their waistlines, they even have a Lite & Healthy Menu with nutrition facts...how many Mexican restaurants offer that?

While I have never seen the place packed by any means....the food is always consistently good....so you people are missing out!
