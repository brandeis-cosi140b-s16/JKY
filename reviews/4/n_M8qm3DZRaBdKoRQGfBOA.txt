Like some of the other reviews, the food is the better part of the overall experience here. 

We went here to use a coupon from restaurant.com. It was encouraging to see that there appeared to be a large crowd on a Saturday night, and we were acknowledged promptly by several staffers passing by. Similarly, when we were seated, no less than three different servers took out drink orders. This gives me the impression they aren't really organized from an operational perspective. The location is an old Shoney's with the telltale atrium windows, but is pleasant.

On to the food, my wife and I ordered the taco platters with 2 brisket, 1 chicken, and 1 shrimp each. While we waited, we went through a basket of chips and 2 little bowls of the house salsa and pico, both very savory and good. Our tacos took a little while to arrive but we were both very impressed at their "authenticity." Unlike the typical low end Mexican style restaurants, our plates weren't loaded with fattening refried beans and tons of rice. We were very happy with the dishes. 

By the way, Despite the initial confusion, our server also ended up taking very good care of us. We even ordered the dessert, a very flavorful flan, which we devoured. 

Based on the food, we would definitely eat here again. But we realize the service could be iffy depending on the crowd and our luck in getting the right server. 4 for food and 3 for service and experience.
