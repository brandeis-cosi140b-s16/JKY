Headed down burrito alley and I finally got Taqueria Mexico.  Inside the booths and the artwork have some Mexican flair.  Everyone at the counter is as pleasant can be and will always greet you.  Chips and multiple salsas are brought out to you when you arrive. The wet burritos are about the size of a football and are damn good.  Its like 2 meals for $6. The tacos ( especially the al pastor) and solid and come with extra sides.  For the price point this place is bomb
