2nd best filabertos I been to (or same spot different Berto prefix) in United States. Very clean, quality cooking on combos and menudo here is on point! They seem to take their time here. You shod take care this serious since I spent precious life minutes on a review of a (prefix)Berto. Not five stars since it is just Mexican fast food
