I haven't been to Ajo Al's in about 12 years (since I left to go to college) but it is still just as good as it used to be. I had the chicken fajitas, which might seem expensive at $15, but I'm a big guy and there was enough food for left over lunch the next day too. Overall, if you are looking for a good tex-mex sit down restaurant, don't pass up Ajo Al's. If you are looking for a cheap carne asada burrito, look elsewhere.
