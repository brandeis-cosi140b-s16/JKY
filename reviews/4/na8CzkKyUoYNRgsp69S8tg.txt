After being downtown twice in the past week, and eating here both times it occurs to me I've never reviewed Dona Maria's Tamales. Kind of hard to believe, seeing as how I've been eating at both locations for almost as long as I've been in Las Vegas... since like 2001. Food is always consistently good. They have awesome Pork Tamales, delicious Albondigas. Chips are fried fresh and hot, salsa is good although I prefer salsa with chopped tomato, onion and cilantro versus their tomato-ey blended salsa. I think they have one of the best chile rellenos around, although holy crap it was spicy as hell last time! (Dona's - remember to clean out the seeds, Yo!) really good enchiladas and so far pretty much every time I eat here it's consistently good. It's one of my three favorite Mexican restaurants in town.
