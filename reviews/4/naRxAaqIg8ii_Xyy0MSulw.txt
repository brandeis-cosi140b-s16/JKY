My wife and I are hailing to the Kings.  This place specializes in Mexico City cooking, and in particular, the torta sandwich.  LOTS of different kinds of tortas

My wife and I are vegetarians, and generally do not eat tortas.  However, there are a variety of other dishes here that will keep us coming back.  BIG portions!  CHEAP!  They don't serve enchiladas or chile rellenos, but they do have great burritos with a distinct flavor.  Their chocoflan also makes a fantastic sweet end to a meal.

If you're looking for authentic Mexico City flavor, this is the place and the locals know it.  Service is generally friendly, the place is clean, and there is always futbol on the television when you sit down.  Highly recommended.

Los Reyes de la Torta:  GOOOOOOOOOOOAL!
