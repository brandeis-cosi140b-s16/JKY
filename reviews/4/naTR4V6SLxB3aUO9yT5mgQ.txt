It's not a bad little neighborhood place. We have been here quite a few times. There are a few things that aren't too bad but my husband loves the chicken and tri-tip meal and I usually like to order the shrimp tacos. The beer is cold and the service is always good so that's a bonus. I wouldn't go as far to say it's ever our first choice, but it's not usually the last either.
