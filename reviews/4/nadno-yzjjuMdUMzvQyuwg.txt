Nothin' fancy, just a quickie burrito take-out place that serves up your basics for large portions at a reasonable price. They serve breakfast burritos all day, so I went for the supreme breakfast burrito ($4.50). It was a large burrito filled to the brim with ham, strips of bacon, egg, and potato. It was delicious, and I gobbled up every bit! 

Cash only, so come prepared.
