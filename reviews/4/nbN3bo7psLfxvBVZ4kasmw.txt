We like Pasqual's.  The food is decent.  The service is typically good - and fast.  Not too pricey.  The restaurant is really kid friendly - which is important to us given we have a 15 mo old.  I love that they have concrete floors - it's easy for me to clean up after our son.  Pasqual's is owned by a local family - I like that.  Nothing against chains - everyone is entitled to make a buck.  I just prefer to support the locals whenever I can.
