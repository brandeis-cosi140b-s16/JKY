I go to this part of town sometimes to visit.  We've gone several times to Chiltepin, as there's this dish called blondie or 'guera', I believe, that my sister's rave about (the name may not be advertised that way).  I tried it and it was damn tasty - loaded with lots of veggies (pico-style) and other mexican-style ingredients (meats, beans, etc).  They are good with portion sizes as I bought a burrito here that was ginormous... and the beans were yummy.

The owners are a Latin (don't know their exact background) husband and wife couple and I'm pretty sure they do all the work themselves (ie. prep, cook, serve, clean, etc) as I've never seen anyone else there.  They are very friendly and I think that friendliness/neighborliness and their food quality is the main reason my family and I still go here.  They seem to be improving from the first few months when we had tried them and their service was sssslloooow.. they are much quicker now (experience, I think) and their quality is still good.  I think they now accept card, but I usually pay cash to small businesses...

I would suggest they keep their menu limited and not so vast.. especially for a new start-up, you want to make sure you can deliver what you say in a timely manner and not waste product.. if you have a surprlus of product because your menu is vast, you are wasting and not meeting your cycle time for customer service... 

Out of all the shady taco/burrito/tostada places on Central in SoPho, I choose this one to go to because of the owners and operators.
