I eat Mexican food way too much, I'm half Mexican and grew up eating great Mexican food at home and out. A lot. Still one of my favorite things to eat - with that as a qualifier, for solid old school Sonoran Mexican food - this place Rocks! Menu selections are HUGE, with many mariscos options that you don't normally don't find in the Valley. I got the red chili chimi and chicken sopita combo, and it was might tastily devoured. Wife loved her ceviche and we all enjoyed the beans and fresh salsa (both key to measure the quality of a Mexican restaurant).  Now admittedly we came early for dinner (5ish), but service was perfect: friendly, timely, attentive even when we made some requests. I am very happy we came - as some of these reviews almost made us pass - now I can't wait to bring my parents, who will certainly love this place that reminds them of our family food. Prices are fair for the area and setting is really cute traditional. A great place, we're sure to visit again!
