When we arrived at Ajo Al's, I thought "Hmmmm, looks like a chain...probably pretty generic food."

However, it's a surprisingly good restaurant. Their sauces and salsas are obviously house made and are interesting takes on traditional Mexican fare. Thicker than most Mexican sauces, they are very flavorful.

We went for breakfast. My huevos rancheros were very good. Now, the eggs were a LITTLE overcooked to my liking in this dish, but other than that, this was a very good dish. And you certainly won't walk away from this restaurant hungry - portion sizes are very large.

Our service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive and available to knowledgeably answer all our questions.

Refills were prompt on water, chips and salsa. He was also right there when the first Coronas were gone to see if we'd like another round.

Very festive atmosphere.

All-in-all, a very good experience food wise and service wise.
