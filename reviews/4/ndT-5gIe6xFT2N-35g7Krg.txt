Authentic Mexican cuisine. The wait staff has always been really nice. I love to get the tostada. I was really happy with the wait staff when I ordered vegetarian and he let me know all the other options other vegetarians order and was very willing to custom build my order to fit my needs. Way to go above and beyond! I have eaten here many times and will continue!
