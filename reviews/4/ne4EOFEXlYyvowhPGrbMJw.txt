3 Taquitos - a little over priced, but excellent. 

Bombero Burrito - Spicy! Super good. 

Al Pastor Burrito - ask for no beans and add cilantro and onion. Very good. 

Overall this place has great food, but not quite as good as a San Diego Taco Shop and the portions are a bit on the small side for the prices.
