There's a lot to love about this quick but hearty Mex Grill.  I love walking in seeing that the guys standing in the open kitchen are roasting peppers and chopping tomatoes for their salsa bar.  A lost art most would say in a place that seems like could be your typical chain, quick fix, "Fresh Mexican Food"...  

The two owners are buddies as the name proclaims and they are a friendly bunch.  The food though is why this place is a small gem in  the NW Valley.  The Burritoes are huge and would challenge Chipotle's size, but also put to shame the cold taste you get from Chipotle's burritoes, from ingredients sitting out cold like a Subway line...  

The Burrito Especial is really good which has big pieces of shrimp and some nice chunks of zucchini.  The steak served in their burritoes is also very impressive, nice grilled taste and definately not chewy.  
The sides are generous when you get a combo and the salsa is nice and fragrant.  

Overall this is a great place to eat, period.  The three flat screens hung up high always have football games on, on weekends.  Awesome food  that cooked right next to dining area has never seemed to dissapoint us.
