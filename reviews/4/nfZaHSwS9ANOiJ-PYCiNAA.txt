Ok, so we're not from Scottsdale and my husband said this place had good reviews. I walked in and was a bit frightened by the dive-y feel, dingy and eclectic decorations. But to my skepticism, we were greeted by a very friendly/personable yet super busy waitress. The food was delicious, the drinks were not outrageously priced (and decent- we had margaritas that were pretty run of the mill). We met Flicka, the owner, and I'm glad we did. He's fantastic and welcoming to everyone that walks into the door. I also watched him take out the trash and clean up the bar, so he's really involved and gets down and dirty too (which is respectable in a restaurant owner!). If we're ever back in the Scottsdale we will definitely come back to Flicka's.
