We saw this on yelp and thought we would give it a try. It was wonderful . Service started out a little slow but quickly changed.  The restaurant atmosphere was nice and it appeared to be very clean(dark lighting).

There was a variety of food and our family all liked the dishes that were served. They even had a nice children's menu just in case your children don't like tacos. 

Now let's get to the best part . The dessert Mexican Apple pie in a sauce with ice cream on top. It was out of this world!

I would definitely recommend this place! We are from out of town and when we make the trip again we will be back.
