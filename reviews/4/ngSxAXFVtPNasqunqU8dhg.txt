The pseudo-hubster LOVES this place and drags me along every once and again. The salsas, I think, suck, so that's a big time star auto-deduct. It's pretty dumpy inside and out, and it's almost always dead... this is pretty much the entire reason I like it. We can come here without seeing a soul we know, enjoy some good, traditional Mexican food, and enjoy a cerveza in peace.
