Las Gorditas is a great spot for some quick, authentic mexican food.  Their signature item is their gorditas, which are like doughy tortillas that are stuffed with different stews, meats, and condiments.  My favorite is the Chicken with mole, the pork with adobo, pork with green chile, and the chicken with green chile. The restaurant has a small bar with condiments such as marinated onions, jalapenos, salsas, and sour cream.  All of these condiments go great with the gorditas. The gorditas are around $2.50 each, but are definitely worth it.  
The other great item on their menu is their Carne Asada and Cactus Quesadilla.  The cactus is roasted and stuffed into a fresh tortilla with cheese and freshly grilled carne asada.  

I would highly suggest trying Las Gorditas!
