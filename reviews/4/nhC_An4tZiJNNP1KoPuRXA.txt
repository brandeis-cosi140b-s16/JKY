The one in Rapid City, SD, where I'm from sucked so I have not been to one in years. Figured its close to the movie theater we were heading to and I was craving some chips and salsa. The On The Border chips that you buy at the grocery store are my favorite. 

We stood in the doorway while the bewildered hostess who watched us walk in contemplated lord knows what then finally acknowledged us after the ten people in front of is all going to the same table via the manager were being sat. We waited for about five minutes before a manager just coming on duty asked us if anyone had taken our drink order. We said no. In fact we had yet to even be greeted. All the while our movie deadline looming. 

First words out of the servers mouth was apologizing and saying there was a mix up. I I have to give her props as after she took charge found she was very attentive. I drank my soda in about two minutes and upon her first pass by the table after taking our order she had a refill ready. Good job. I told her we were pressed for time and our food came out fast. Our drinks were never empty not was really good service. Food was really good too. I had the three sauce chicken burrito and Jen had the grilled chicken. She was very happy with it. Other than the horrible initial impression which had me convinced this would be a horrible experience, the only down side was that the chips at the restaurant pale in comparison I the ones at the store. Salsa was good though with the perfect amount of heat. Just enough to make your tongue sweat. 

I seriously was not thinking this would be a good experience but the server really turned things around to shall I say, I was actually impressed. Good job Erica. We will be back.
