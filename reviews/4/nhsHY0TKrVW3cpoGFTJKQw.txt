Ok I want to give this place 5 stars but I always get the same thing so it may not be fair. This is a real authentic Mexican restaurant from the music to the decor. Be prepared to be the only gringos and brush up on your espanol! The tortillas are hot and had made and the salsa is warm. The service is always friendly and hard working but communication can be a challenge. Honestly I enjoy the hand talking and gestures feels like I am on vacation. This is not 5 star Michelin cuisine but down home Mexican. The prices are cheap and the food is really good. Now andale to Allende!
