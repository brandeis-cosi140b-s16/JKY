Good, very authentic Mexican food. You can nit pick about anything in any restaurant, but if you want a real Mexican food experience that isn't one of the million Roberto's in town, this is perfect. Our server Jeronimo was really nice and helpful, and knew a lot about the food. I got the taco, enchilada, and tamale combo plate, and the shredded beef was marinated perfectly.  My girl got the lobster and shrimp enchiladas, and she loved them. The chips and salsa came with two different types of salsa and bean dip, which were awesome. A great place.
