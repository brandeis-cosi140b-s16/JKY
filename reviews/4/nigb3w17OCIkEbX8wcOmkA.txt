I work down the street from el steak burrito, so for lunch I alwayse order from here. Food is actually pretty good here believe it or not. I'm not a fan of the steak burrito, 
but all my coworkers rave about it, I prefer there chicken burrito instead. I love how they make there burrito here with rice, beans, pico degallo, and cilantro. Every time I order I usually request for extra cilantro and less on the rice and it comes out perfect. 

    There papusa is good here also, I like the cheese filling but the other variety are good as well. Make sure you order 2 atleast cause the portion is small, I could probably eat 5 of the papusa alone but I wont lolz, it's hella greasy. The only complaint I have here is the location, horrible parking especially during afternoon. But if you work in this area, el steak burrito is worth the visit. Good food and good service.
