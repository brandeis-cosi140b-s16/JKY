Gotta respond to Dee M. and her critique of the lady bartender at Sam's Cafe.  I've been served by Amanda about 100 times over the last few years, and never once has she shown me poor customer service or a bad attitude.  She's about the best bartended in Phoenix, so go check her out some time!

As for the restaurant itself, the food is pretty tasty.  Pancho's enchilada's are my staple, but you can't really go wrong with anything there.  Happy Hour is also great - several good food and drink specials.  My favorite drinking place at the AZ Center by far!
