In the area so we tried it out. We had a hard time finding it since its on the MLK side even though the address is Craig. Anyhow, the restaurant is much bigger than it looks outside. Pretty nicely decorated with lots of tables and booths. Really tasty chips and salsa were promptly on the table. Wifey tried the Chile Verde Chimichanga. She loved it. I had the Carnitas and they were really great. The food was better then we expected and will be returning. Great to have this place in our neighborhood.
