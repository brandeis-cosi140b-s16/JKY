Update: Recently I posted a review regarding a definite lack of 'double meat'. Went back last night and got much better results, without saying anything to them. 

My only problem now is the online ordering system, which sometimes works and sometimes not. They really need to fix that since it adds 10 mins onto a takeout order.
