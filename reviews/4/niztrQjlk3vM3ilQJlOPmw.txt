How many 24 hour mexican fast food places does one town need? Apparently Vegas did not have enough, because a brand spanking new Roberto's recently opened up pretty close to my work.

There is another Roberto's even closer to my work that has been open for quite some time... But my coworkers and I have all agreed, this location on Rainbow is worth driving an extra block. 

It is clean and spacious. The price is right. I am a fan!
