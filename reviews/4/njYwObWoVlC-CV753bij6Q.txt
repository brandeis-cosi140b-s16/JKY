Brunch. 

Fun combination of all-one-can-eat for a price situation that one often finds at brunches and ordinary menu ordering with food prepared to order. 

I'm sure you'll find a litany of descriptions of each of the tapas throughout the reviews here. I was partial to a very delicious rendition of eggs Benedict, with a Yucatan flair. 

If I could have one of those right now, I'd rather enjoy it.

It had good atmosphere and very friendly and congenial service. I would take that brunch for another spin.
