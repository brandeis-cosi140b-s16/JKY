Food is more 3 star, but the atmosphere and service knocks this baby up to a 4 star! El Encanto is a beautiful restaurant. Not only is it massive, but the outside patio is awesome. Just perfect for our Arizona winter nights. The man-made lake in the back is so pretty and adds a nice ambience to the meal. Supposedly there are ducks and/or swans in the lake, but I didn't see any. You definitely need to make reservations if it is the weekend, seemed like everyone in Cave Creek was out when I went! There is a huge parking lot in the back and it was filled to brim at 7PM on Friday. 

I had the Mexicano Combo (taco, enchilada, and tamale). The taco and enchilada were good, tamale was okay, I should have asked for green sauce! Their chips are quite tasty and the spicy and tomatillo salsa were my favorite. Margarita was solid, I felt it after 1.5 (might be a little sweet for some of you though). The boy had a scotch and it was quite a heavy pour indeed. Service was all around A+. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly, as was the food runner, and hostesses. Overall, not a bad joint. I will gladly take the ride out there when the boy's family wants to go!
