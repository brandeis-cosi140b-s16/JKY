You want to talk about a little secret in Gilbert? This is it. I drove right past this place for years when I went to ASU East and I've lived right around the corner for 3 years now. It's a dump on the outside... Literally a shack, but a friend recommended it, so I tried it for breakfast. Seriously, one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. Customer service is great, too. I just wish this place was advertised a little better, because I would have came here sooner!
