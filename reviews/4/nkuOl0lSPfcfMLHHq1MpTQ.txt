Just opened up at the Chandler mall, you'll find this sports bar at the food court entrance.

The menu is written in car jargon and difficult to understand,  but our server was polite and helped explain the different items. Food and drinks were over priced. The happy hour specials are closer to normal prices.

Seating was...interesting. The dining area is mostly outside and set up like a bar rather than a restaurant. There is also a 'lounge' area with cushioned benches and coffee tables. At the dining tables, you get either a bench seat, stool, or horribly uncomfortable chair. I had to swap out my chair for a stool shortly after being seated, and I noticed another lady also opting for a different seat.

I have to say, after seeing the high prices I was prepared to dislike this place, but we really got our value for the food we ordered. Three of us shared a full order of nachos with chicken, and it was super huge and we all loved it. Just for the nachos, I would come here again. Seriously, this thing was served on a baker's 1/4 sheet and was 8" high!!

Service was a mixed experience but mostly good. At one point I went inside for something I needed. I surely had an I-need-help look on my face but thought there were employees everywhere,  they were so focused on watching the game on TV I had trouble getting someone's attention. In a few minutes I got sorted out and went back to the mountain of nachos at my table.

Overall a good experience.
