I have traveled far and wide across this great nation, and nowhere compares to Phoenix when it comes to cheap, fast, and delicious Mexican food.

The chile relleno burrito at Filiberto's is a case study in why.  A breaded and fried chile stuffed with cheese and drowned in guacamole and pico de gallo, wrapped in a warm, soft tortilla that tastes fresh off the stone - ignoring cholesterol and fat, what could be wrong with that?  Drown it down with a sweet cup of horchata, and you have entered post-drunk, pre-dreamland nirvana.

For meat lovers, the carne asada is yummy, but I think my favorite is the patr√≤n burrito.

Also, Filly B's doesn't use lard in their beans, which makes it a go-to place for my vegan friends when hunger strikes at two in the morning.

If you want fine cuisine, go to the Barrio Cafe and be prepared to pay for it.  if you want delicious and equally authentic Mexican food, visit Filly's, any time.  There's a reason there's a line for breakfast burritos at five in the morning.

Also, a veteran's tip - avoid the drive-thru and go inside, if you can.  Even if you are ordering your food to go.  Trust me.  A Filiberto's drive-thru line is a place where time ceases to have meaning and the fourth dimension gets clogged.
