We finally tried this place for Happy Hour and I was not disappointed!  $4.50 happy hour margs were tasty and potent.  The chips and salsas were very good.  Green one was nice and refreshing, and the warm one had a nice kick to it.  The bartender was very attentive and friendly.  Let us sample their frozen margarita too.

The BF had the steak tacos which he said were great.  I ordered the crab cakes and the crawfish hushpuppies.  The crab cakes were really good, nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Beautifully presented.  The hushpuppies were sooo good!  At first I thought they were really greasy because they were shiny and what I thought was oil, was puddled in the bottom of the plate.  It turned out it was some sort of sweet stuff drizzled over them, and there was a salsa on the side too.  The sweetness combined with the spicy salsa was just great!  I thoroughly enjoyed them and even though I was full after about 3 of them, I kept eating until they were all gone.  Yum yum.  All in all, I left with a buzz and a full belly.  We'll definitely go back!
