I found this place by accident, as it is tucked away in a strip mall with a very unassuming sign.  It has a very Chipotle like fell, with the whole "build your own" but oh so much better, which was shocking to me as well.  The ingredients are fresh, and you can really taste the difference.  They give you healthier options, which is always a nice change.  The guys who work there are ALWAYS so nice and friendly, it's hard not to go back for more.  The chicken, is by far my favorite but they have, shrimp, steak, carnitas, and a veggie option.  

To make it even better, it is locally owned and operated!!
