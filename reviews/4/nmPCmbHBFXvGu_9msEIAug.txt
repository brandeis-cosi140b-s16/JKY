Stopped at Tommy Rockers for the food truck meet up last night. Alot of options but i always wanted to try Sloppi Jo's and i'm glad i did.
I went with the pork tacos and they wey soooo good. The pork was moist and tender. The combinig flavors of the chillies and the crem fresh cheese all came together for a perfect taco. Only about a 5 minute wait. Can't wait to meet up with them again!
