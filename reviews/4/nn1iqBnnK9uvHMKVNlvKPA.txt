I stopped by here with a friend on the way back from a hike. I was initially worked about the limited menus selection. I ordered a chicken and a carnitas taco. They were both well made, with the appropriate amount of filling, and a pretty good flavor profile. My friend got a carnitas and the daily special which he also enjoyed. This is a pretty solid choice for a satisfying quick bite.
