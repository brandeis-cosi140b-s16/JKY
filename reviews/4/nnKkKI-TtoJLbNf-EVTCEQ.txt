Once again my wife and I were too pooped to cook.  Dropped in once more to our favorite watering hole and enjoyed a fine meal.  I had a green chili pork burrito and she had the carne asada fajita.  Both were tasty.  We felt pampered and welcome & the made to order michilada hit the spot. We will continue to come back.
