Rolled in here at 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon after reading some Yelp reviews.  Thanks, Stefany V!

I had my heart set on the Pig Sandwich (Torta de Puerco).  I was not disappointed.  I'd describe the sandwich, but there's no way I could do better than Stefany V's writeup.  Just read her review instead!  :)  It was the best food I've thrown down the old gullet in quite some time.  Pickles on a pork sandwich?  Sign me up!

Why four stars?  It's kind of a hole in the wall; I might just get food to go next time.  Limited seating including a couple of picnic tables.  And I had a dancing chair - one leg was about three inches shorter than the others and I nearly biffed it a couple of times.  Shouldn't have been drinking, I guess.

The service was very good and the other food I saw looked great.

Give it a shot!
