My veggie burrito was very good and HUGE!  I must have been teally hungry because i ate the WHOLE thing!  My only complaint is the noise level inside if you eat inside. It was too hot to sit out so stayed at one of the three tables available. The music is so loud you can't hear your self think much less understand your tablemate or the cashier. I would still eat at Chipotle but maybe they could cut back on the volume just a little??
