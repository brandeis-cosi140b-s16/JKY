I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. The mason Jar Margs are yummy and the cheese crisp is perfectly cooked. I got the carne asada for my dinner.  It was delicious and not greasy at all. The meat was cooked perfectly with great seasoning. I wish it came with a little more sour cream and guac but that's ok. The rice was fluffy and the beans were really good as well. The tortilla that came with the meal was AMAZING. Overall it was a great experience. If I am ever on this side of town again I will be coming here. However, one thing that could have been better is my sister ordered a non alcoholic margarita and they still charged her 9 bucks for it.
