I met a friend for lunch at 11:30. The time was perfect as we were seated immediately and by 12:15ish the place more crowded. We enjoyed the chips and salsa, and requested the mild and it was brought promptly. My friend ordered the Arroz con Pollo and I ordered the burrito and taco combo. Both were delicious. Not a five b/c the service got a little slower once they got busier and the noise was overbearing at times. I will be back to this location, as it is nicer than the original Park Road location.
