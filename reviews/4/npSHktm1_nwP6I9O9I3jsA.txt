Zaba's is close to my work, and I go here fairly often for lunch. I really like Zaba's quesadillas. They come with a big side of guac, sour cream, and salsa (I suggest the tomatillo salsa). It's always yummy. I'm not a huge fan of the burritos as I don't like rice in them. You can get it without the rice, but then your burrito is really thin as they don't put anything in to replace the rice. The tacos are pretty decent. My suggestion: Get the quesadilla, skip the burrito.
