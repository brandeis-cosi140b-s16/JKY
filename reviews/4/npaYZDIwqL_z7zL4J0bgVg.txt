The place has a nice ambiance, tasty food, and friendly service. My friend with me has been several times, while this was my first time there. He got a combo plate and I got fajitas. The thing that I noticed was the tortillas I got were much larger than I get at other places, so big bonus points. As I said, the food was very good. I would return.
