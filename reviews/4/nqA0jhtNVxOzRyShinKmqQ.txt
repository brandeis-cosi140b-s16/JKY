Good food and well priced. If you get an appetizer of chips and dips you can get a fresh order to take home with you! On both of my visits I got the veggie burrito and it was good each time. I love the fun sauces on the hot sauce bar. I know I will be going here rather then Moe's whenever I am craving quick and fresh Mexican food. PS. The service here is fantastic!
