Stooped by today for lunch after seeing the parking lot full everyday. It was very busy and crowded inside. I ordered the Machaca and bean burro. Even though they were very busy, it took only about 12 minutes to get my food. The staff were all smiling. Even the prep cooks in the back. You hardly ever see that in restaurants. 

I got my burro to go and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It cost about $4.50 and for the price the quality was pretty good. Limited garnishes though. You are limited to a mild red salsa, some dried herbs and tired looking diced green onions.

Great for a tasty quick lunch. Don't go if you are trying to find the best Mexican food in town. It is good but not South Phoenix taco truck good. They are perfect for a grab and go on the way to a family event though.
