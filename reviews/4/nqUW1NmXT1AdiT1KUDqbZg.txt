We've been going here for years but I just finally got around to reviewing.  Compared to other Mexican food in the same price range, Los Favs is far superior.   The shrimp burrito is amazing.  I was nervous but tried it based on another Yelp review, and I have never looked back.  It's just spicy enough and super-stuffed with rice, shrimp, and veggies.  

Inside d√©cor is nothing to write home about, but it's usually pretty clean.  There are frequently groups of annoying high school kids there, though, so we usually get our food to go.  The bathrooms are super clean and nice for a fast food-ish type place.

We eat here once every other week or so and will continue to do so.  Customer service is hit or miss, but the food is consistent and fast.  I wish they delivered!
