My wife and like to go here from time to time. We enjoy sitting out on the patio by the rail and people watch and drink a couple of beers. 

My wife loves the shrimp cocktail and orders it everytme we go. Along with chips and salsa. Had fish tacos a couple of times and it was good. 

The staff is always freindly and give great service everytime we go.
