I was so excited when I heard that Poblano's FINALLY opened their doors for business.  

I went there for lunch this week with folks from work.  A group of 6 got there about 15 minutes ahead of the next.  I was in the second wave (3).

The place is spotless, decorated tastefully, and the employees are friendly.

When i arrived, all but two of the earlier arrivals had received their food.  It was artfully plated, very appetizing.  Thumbs up all around. There was a little of everything on the table, and it all looked great.

We ordered at the counter, got our drinks and sat down.  

About the time our food showed up, the straggling food for the earlier arrivals showed.  

Everything was fresh, hot, and delicious.  Several of us found that we needed to add salt to our dishes.  

My chimichanga was great- lean shredded beef, just a schmeer of refried black beans, and the fresh tortilla were perfectly balanced and delicious.  I rarely order chimis, because they are generally overly huge, watery interiors and too much food with chips etc., but Poblano's serves a reasonable sized chimi, perfectly prepared they way a chimi should be.  Lunch was a little under $10 with a large drink.

Besides the wait, the only complaint was with the "late" food - the carne in the burro had a lot of fatty pieces.  The earlier orders of the same were very lean. We guessed that maybe they ran out of meat earlier and hurriedly prepared more, and skimped on the trimming/cleanup.

I think that Poblano's has the potential to be a 5-star local favorite.   They need to work out the details with regards to consistently timed order fulfillment, and final touches with seasoning.

I WILL be back, and look forward to trying other menu items.
