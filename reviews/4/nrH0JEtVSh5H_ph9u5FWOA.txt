Anytime I house sit for my parents, I hit this place at least 3 times that week.  They dont mess around, some of the better steak and salsa/chips, good rice, beans.  I just get it all in the burrito with cheese sc and guacamole, MMM MM MMMM, good stuff.  Never feel like I paid too much, sometimes I feel like I paid too little.  Theres only one guy that works there that I've ever had a problem with and Im sure the owner took care of him for me once he saw how often I come.
