Came here to get some good Mexican food, and got exactly that. You get ships and salsa once you get seated and the salsa was perfect. I ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were fantastic! The enchilada plate came with 5 enchiladas, and for the price, it's an amazing deal. The green sauce on the enchiladas was very good. It was light and not too overpowering, but the flavor of it was amazing. The rice was not my favorite, but I am generally very picky when it comes to rice. Overall, this was a great Mexican place and I really wish I lived in Madison so I could go here more often,
