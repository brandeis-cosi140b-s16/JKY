Does anyone ever ever get a hankering for Chipotle? ... like every other day? Just me? I'm okay with that.

First time trying this Chipotle location for an early dinner, decided to go with a bowl with chicken and of course guac. Everything was filled and my bowl was decently filled with food. It's just a shame that guac costs an arm and a leg for a little cup of the stuff. Did I still get it? --Obviously!

Chicken was flavorful, good portions as I had enough for left overs for the next day. The price for a chicken bowl with guac came out to be around ~$8.

Service was pretty fast when I ordered, but upon eating the line quickly went out the door. So I'm guessing this location gets pretty crowded during dinner time.

Will be back- undoubtedly. Will I get guac again? ... obviously. But just so you know Chipotle, the cost of your guac is ridiculous it was close to $2 for that tiny thing!
