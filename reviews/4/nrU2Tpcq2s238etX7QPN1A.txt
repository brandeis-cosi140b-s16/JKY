Why would you go to Chipotle when you could come here? The barbacoa was tender and flavorful...think of good Pot roast. The spicy pastor was also flavorful and lean. The guys were super friendly and fast.  The restaurant had a basic decor with clean tables and a clean bathroom...which I've been told likely means that the kitchen is clean. No farm-to-table or bells and whistles but that's not why you would come here anyway. I'll be back even though I live on the other side of town!
