La Cosina has very good Mexican food at great prices.  I am not Mexican, but my cousin is half and he confirms the quality of their food.  I have had various dishes and none of them have disappointed.  They even have Menudo, which is very good.  Finally, I love that they have Horchata, which for some reason is not as ubiquitous in Mexican restaurants as you would think.

Excellent casual dining destination!
