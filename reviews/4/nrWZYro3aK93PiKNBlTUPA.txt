We came here for a late lunch.  This is named after Carlos Santana's song.

It wasn't too crowded and one wall of the restaurant is a long bar.  It is lined with a fairly large collection of tequila.  The dipping sauces was a hot green sauce, and smokey taste sauce and a fresh cut salsa. 

I ordered carnitas and it was sauteed and fairly spicy, a tomatia tangy dipping sauce and a side of black beans.

Overall a pretty good experience.
