Very tasty, service was not very good or I'd give it 5 stars-server was not very good. Their jalepeno cream cheese dip is excellent! My fiance even liked the food and he doesn't really like Mexican. Its kind of more like tex-mex than Mexican food. They give you huge portions. It's not too expensive either-kind of like a family dining experience.
