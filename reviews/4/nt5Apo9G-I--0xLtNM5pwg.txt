I stopped in by accident...was hungry and too tired to cook. I'm Cuban transplant from Miami so I figured it couldn't hurt to try Las Margaritas. I got the grilled skirt steak platter...a bit expensive, but I got to choose how the steak was cooked. Enough food to feed me x3 (I'm a gastric bypass survivor). Tons of steak, rice and beans! Some kind of guacamole garnishment on top, that made everything else tasty! I got it 'to go' and I would absolutely return to eat inside! This restaurant is in a small strip mall on E.Independence and because of the road changes there if you are not aware, you could pass it by. If you enter via Monroe Rd, turn on Lanier and go until it dead ends and you will be at the strip mall it is in. It will be my new BEST go to restaurant for the Cotswold area I live inn.
