Friday night, after check in, before night on the town.... quick meal and margarita at the Yolo's. 

The food was okay, the margarita was splendid, but the service was HOT! He looked like a Freddie Prinze Jr! Also, he checked in on us 4 girls like every 2 minutes... gave us the line that we were he's "favorite table" line too. We also found out that he is a poor soul that went through a series of misfortunate events.... mother dying, wife in an accident and then leaves him... poor Freddie-look-a-like.

But for the first meal in Vegas, it was fun and filling. I had a brain freeze when drinking that rita tho... it was sooo good!
