Solid taco shop, tried it after driving by for a long time. We will be back again. I grew up in Southern CA, I know my way around Mexican food

Burritos, Chicken and rice, fish, carnitas and carne asada all good. Decent Salsa bar three flavors, marinated carrots and cucumbers.

El Regio is a solid choice in NW Las Vegas, Ann & 95 north, Give them a shot.
