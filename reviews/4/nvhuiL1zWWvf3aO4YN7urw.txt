So I followed my own advice and came here for drinks and appetizers only. I'd say the "couches" they have set up in the bar area are uncomfortable and akward for people to sit and talk (you're leaning over the table just to hear one another). HOWEVER, drinks still didn't disappoint.. I'm loving all their muddled fruit drinks! This time I added an order of guac. I'm a mexican food snob, and this guac was GOOD. Fresh, not that green goopy stuff you see here all the time.. my friend in from TX was also quite pleased. I will be back when I feel the need to drop $10 on guac in the future.
