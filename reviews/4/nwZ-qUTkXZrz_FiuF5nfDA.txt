I've been a regular here for the last two years (twice a week). With a plentiful bounty of authentic Mexican food restaurants in this area, this is the spot I keep going back too.

Carne asada dishes highly recommended! Just stay away from the seafood. Some reviewers forget we live in a desert and ALL frozen seafood tastes bland no matter how you spice it (yes, even Papadeux).
