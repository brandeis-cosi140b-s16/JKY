We had the mixed ceviche to start.  It was decent...it was a little bland, but it came with a heap of seafood on top of a tostada.

I had the 7 mares soup.  It was delicious!  And their corn tortillas that come with it were delicious too!

My boyfriend had the rice with seafood.  It was pretty good.  He liked the chipotle cream sauce and poured it on the rice.

I love it when we try a place like this on a whim and it works out!
