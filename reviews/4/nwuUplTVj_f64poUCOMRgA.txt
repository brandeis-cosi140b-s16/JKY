Walking distance to Chase Field makes this a popular destination. 

The Mexican food is very good, the drinks are cheap, they have a huge outdoor patio, a large bar area, and you can wobble over to the ballgame when you're finished.

If you get here early enough you can park in their own private lot for free.
