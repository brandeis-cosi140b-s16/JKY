After hearing Vince L saying that after eating the tacos from Tacos El Gordo, tacos elsewhere is no longer the same, my bf and I made a visit for lunch on a Friday afternoon. 

When we arrived, there were so many people there and we were a bit confused with the ordering.  The tiny paper that were taped to the bucket at each station was a bit hard to see at the chaotic time.  I went to a line to order the cabeza taco and the person behind the counter directed me to a different line, then I was like OMG, I totally didn't see that each line is for different items.  Then after we received our 3 cabeza, 2 lengua, and 2 tripa tacos, we head over to a different counter to order drinks and to pay.  I asked if the horchata was freshly made and she said yes...THAT is not true because it came out of the fountain and it doesn't taste homemade.  I then opted for the orange bang.

Right around where the drink fountain is where we found limes, turnips and other condiments.

The food was really authentic and yummy.  I will definitely come back to try other items on the menu.
