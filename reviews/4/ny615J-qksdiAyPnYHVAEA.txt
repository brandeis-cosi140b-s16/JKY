I don't get the negative reviews this place is getting.  I've been on a "taco quest" lately and this is so far my fave joint in Madtown.  The tortillas are fresh, warm, fluffy, obviously made right there, as they should be.  I've been three times so far and tried a lot of the fillings, and they have all been flavorful, filling but not gut-bombs, and satisfying.  I even like the refried beans, which is usually a throw-away add-on to a plate.

A lot of the other taco places around here either seem to serve dried-out tortillas, and rubbery store-bought ones.  And I hate it when they glop a ton of sloppy filling into a tortilla so it falls apart.  El Jalapeno totally avoids that trap.  I will definitely be back many times to try more tacos, and explore the non-taco side of their menu.

Plus the people are so friendly, and the space is cozy and inviting, it just makes me and my wife happy to be there.  Totally recommend without reservation!
