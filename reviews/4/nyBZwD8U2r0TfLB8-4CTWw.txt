NOTE: For this review, I'm getting in touch with my roots as a Madisonian, not a transplant to "Mexican Food Heaven" Phoenix, AZ.

Casa de Lara can be a little pricey, but the quality of the food and drinks are definitely worth it.  I am a bigger fan of CDL than Frida's up the street (which is also decent) because I love the unassuming exterior and the authentic feel to the restaurant.

The food choices are very much within the lines of an Americanized joint, but it's prepared immaculately and every dish is full of flavor.  When visiting, I usually take the opportunity to deviate from traditional food and grab the Western Burrito which is HUGE. I usually finish it even though I feel like I'm about to explode.

The margaritas are surprisingly strong - especially when you split a pitcher with someone special, and they usually have reasonable prices if you stick with the olde school Lime on the rocks.
