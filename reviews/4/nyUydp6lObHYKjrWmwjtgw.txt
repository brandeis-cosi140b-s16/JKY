UNREAL CHOCOLATE MALT SHAKE.  Better than the burger.  I had the Beach House Burger: roasted green chili, smoked mozzarella, and pico de gallo.  It could have used avocado and some jalapenos, which are available but I didn't get them.  Everyone talks about the brulle burger, but I don't eat pork, so the bacon thing didn't work for me.  But back to the pièce de résistance: the chocolate malt shake.  An unexpected treat and a pleasant surprise.  Make sure you get the 'malt' and not the 'shake'.  If you're into shakes/malts like I am, you won't regret this one.  

The owners are super chill and have a good personality as well.
