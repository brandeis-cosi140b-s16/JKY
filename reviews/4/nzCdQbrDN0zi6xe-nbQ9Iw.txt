I would have given this place 4.5/5 stars, but Yelp did not give me the option to do so. Everything I ordered from this place never made me dissapointed, but I got .5 star deducted because it is not the cleanest place to eat around Madison. I am always coming back (and prefer to get take outs instead of dining in there) because everything tasted so good, cheap, and it made you crave for more Mexican foods.

I don't like Mexican foods before I found out about this restaurants, and I am a big fan of Mexican foods since then. Before, I used to only like burittos from Chipotle (I tried La Hacienda, Pasqualis, and other places around the city, but I was never impressed). Taquerias Guadalajara, however, is the best place I have ever eaten, ever (my husband agrees, and he tried different mexican joints around the country).It's so good it makes me want to go to Mexico and explore more about their foods and cultures.. 

My favourite: Chicharrones gorditas and pork steak tacos (I usually have two tacos and one gorditas for only 5.75 before tax. Ha!). But don't worry, they have more extensive choices which I can't pronounce at the moment.
Ohh.. talking about it makes me want to go there right now...
