You really can't go wrong at Chipotle.  I value their commitment to fresh ingredients, and it is a great alternative to fast-food.  I always opt for the vegetarian bowl with brown rice, black beans, grilled peppers, salsa, corn, lettuce, and guacamole.  They are a little on the pricey side given that the meal does not include any chips and salsa.  When we arrived (peak lunch hour) they had run out of brown rice and the people behind me had to settle for white.
