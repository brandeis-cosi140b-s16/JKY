Right on the corner of Roosevelt and 7th street is where this little hole in the wall stands. If you blink.. Well you might pass it.
El Norteno has the best green and red chili burros! Hands down!
I always get a few orders to go because coming from Scottsdale is quite out of the way... So I usually order 3 green and 3 red!
For Christmas Eve, I get a few pints of their green chili to serve piping hot to the family and boy do they love it! They always ask me where I got it, but this secret is safe with me.
