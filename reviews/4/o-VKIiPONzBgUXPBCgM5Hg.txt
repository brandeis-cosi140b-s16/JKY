Fresh and cheap mexican food.  We got the Carne Asada plate and Hard Tacos- everything was really good, cooked to order.  Chips were fresh and hot, small salsa bar if you eat in.  Open 24 hours and has a drive through.  Can't beat the prices for what you get- really large portions.  They just opened but looking forward to hitting them up regularly.
