I dined here for their famous all you can eat brunch with 7 friends for a fun business meeting. I have heard of it and always wanted to try it! 

Food pros: The brunch has a great variety of different dishes and are considered small plates. With that said they are definitely generous "small" portions. The price is right at $35 and to top it off you can add endless mimosas for $8. It was lots of fun ordering and tasting different dishes. My favorites were the skirt steak, shrimp and grits, frittata tart, and the waffle with pork belly. Some things I tried weren't my favorite, but that is just my personal taste. The lobster pancakes had an odd flavor and needed more lobster! That's what makes it so fun and enjoyable, there is something for everybody! Everything came out mostly hot, a couple things could have been warmer. Our server was great and accommodating especially dealing with 8 women. There are 10, that's right, 10 different flavors of mimosas! Each equally delicious and refreshing. 

Food cons: A few dishes weren't as hot as I would have preferred. I am sure the kitchen was crazy though as it was a busy Sunday morning. A few dishes weren't for me, but most were amazingly delicious and filled with flavor. I would suggest having a selection of the brunch menu available for ala carte or available as a full entree. 

Service: The staff was pleasant and helpful. Our server was very busy but still attentive to our table. He was lots of fun and accommodating. 

I would definitely go back again! Maybe next time for lunch or dinner. I would be more likely to return for brunch if they offered their brunch items ala carte or available as a full entree. Overall it was a tasty and fun dining experience.
