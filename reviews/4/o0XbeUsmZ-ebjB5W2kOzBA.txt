Ordered online here for the first time. I got a barbacoa burrito with white rice, black beans, cheese, and sour cream. I put in the comments: "easy on the sour cream". Also ordered a burrito bowl for my roommate (half chicken, half steak... I didn't know you could do that!) who also requested a side of dressing & sour cream. The site said it would be ready in 30 minutes. I arrived right on time and the line was to the door. I went straight to the register and told the girl I had an online order. I had already paid online, she handed me the bag of food with my drink cup, and I was on my way! The order was actually correct too. The only thing that wasn't exactly right is our names were switched when they wrote on the foil, but that is easily forgiven. The food tasted great and I definitely recommend the online ordering!
