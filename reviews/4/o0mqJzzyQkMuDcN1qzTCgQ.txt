You had me at free warm chips and salsa bar. This place is almost perfect in my eyes although the Horchata needs some serious work. They also seem to have late hours AND a drive thru. Pretty damn good food to get in a drive thru if you ask me. 

I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and a large Horchata. The Burrito was around 5 bucks, but they give you free chips and they have an excellent salsa bar to accompany them. The burrito surprised me by having beans and rice mixed with the meat unlike other joints. It was still delicious and the meat was tender and flavorful and I didn't have one piece of grizzle. Refreshing since almost every burro I get from Roberto's has at least one piece of meat I have to gracefully spit out. This burrito was heaven. 

The restaurant is clean and has plenty of room to eat comfortably. I did also try their homemade pineapple juice which I will be ordering on my next visit which is tonight!
