Still a solid 4-stars. 

+ The table chips and salsas are consistently delicious. The chips: paper thin, light, not terribly salty. The salsas: flavorful with great texture/consistency.

+ Servers are ON THEIR GAME with drink refills

+ Fajita salad - one of the best salads around, in my humble opinion. I skip the cheese and the dressing (use salsa instead) and am never disappointed.


Note: I hadn't been here in a while; looks like they've drastically updated the menu (all for the better).
