Great friendly service and good food too.  I made a quick trip in to pick up my lunch and ate at my desk at work.

I ordered and was told my food would be ready in 10 minutes.  I arrived and it was piping hot and ready.  I ordered nachos today and they were great.  Crispy and they are generous with the guacamole.  This is always a plus.

If I had to find a negative it's that they are closed on Sundays.  There is a polite message on the front door explaining that they give their staff Sunday's off to spend with their families.  I do think this is very nice however I do think it is odd that  a business closes on day's their customers are off.  Just a personal opinion.  I found this out when my hubs and I attempted to place a to go order over the weekend.  

This location is on the corner of Rainbow and Tropicana.  It is bright and cheery inside.
