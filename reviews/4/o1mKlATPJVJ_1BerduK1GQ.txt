On an extremely hot June day,  I was in the mood for Horchata and had read about La Condesa's with the Fruit and nut pieces.   I enjoyed my drink sitting at the empty Bar area while I waited for my To Go.   Its worth just going for the Horchata.   I ordered One Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco as my Appetizer which was lightly battered and fried perfecty in obviously clean oil.    My Entree was the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  The 2 Quesas were crispy, pastry like and filled with Mole Chicken.  Oaxaca cheese was sprinkled on top and was a nice compliment .   Although, The Mole was just a tad bit too sweet, for me, I am looking forward to trying the other Quesas on the menu.   I was not familiar with "Quesa's" prior to my visit.
