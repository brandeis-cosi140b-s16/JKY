Tons of food. Especially mexican food. This place is close to my parent's house and well, this is probably the place to go to when we're craving for some mexican food. Because it's 1. Extremely close, for those eat and sleep situations and 2. The food is good (and the beer is pretty cheap), and lastly 3. The portions on the plates are absolutely huge and plentiful.

I don't understand why they have a low rating on the restaurant, as this is the place I would go to for a quick mexican food fix. I mean I have to say this isn't the place to get a nice gourmet mexican food. It's a place where you go get down and dirty with some mexican food and if you choose to drink, they have a bar and you can lounge. 

Overall, I think this place is wonderful. I get my fix for mexican food and well, I come out full. I'll definitely come back to this place when I'm craving for it.
