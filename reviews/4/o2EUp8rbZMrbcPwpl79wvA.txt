Rubio's = good, consistent, affordable fish tacos

I am no mathematician,  but that's an equation even I can appreciate!  

They have chicken, steak, and fish tacos... and multiple types of fish available (tilapia, mahi).  And for most tacos, you have the choice of corn or flour tortilla.

My favorite is still the original grilled fish taco on a flour tortilla.  And the steak "street tacos" with cilantro and onion are quite authentic-tasting and delish, just like my imaginary Mexican abuela used to make!
