It's Mexican-American fast food in an airport's food court. With places like these, you can already know what to expect before you even order. Salsarita's was good to me, however, and it got the job of filling my stomach done pretty well. I would personally be more interested in what the other restaurants of the airport have to offer during my next trip, but I had a good quick lunch here and can't complain.

In terms of quality, this is perhaps a notch or two below Chipotle. I ordered a large burrito bowl for $7.89 and sure enough, it was all the normal contents of a burrito served in a black plastic bowl instead. Possibly because all this food was spread out rather than compacted into a tortilla, there seemed to be more food in here than what you would find in an ordinary burrito. I still can't tell whether that bowl created the illusion of more food.

The rest of my family ordered a chicken nacho for $7.79. This whole thing was apparently enough to satisfy three people somehow. Probably the inclusion of rice and black beans helped to make these nachos more filling. The prices here were low, and we got all the food we needed for lunch before we had to hurry to catch our flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This food is by no means award-winning, but it's appropriate for an airport like this one.
