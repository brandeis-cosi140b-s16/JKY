I'm a frequent customer of Roberto's but this place is just as good if not better.  I ordered Chili Relleno and Chicken Enchilada.  The sauce was darker and less greasy than Roberto's.  I love spicy food and the Chili Relleno was spicier than the ones I've had.  Chicken was chunky instead of shredded. Rice and beans were very tasty.
