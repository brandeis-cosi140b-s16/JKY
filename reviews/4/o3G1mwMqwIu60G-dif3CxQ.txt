When I eat at vegan restaurants I often leave thinking I could have prepared the meal so much better but at Tedibertos I found myself pondering what in the world those flavor combinations were. Hands down some of the tastiest ever. Once they finish getting settled in and work out the kinks this place will be totally awesome.
