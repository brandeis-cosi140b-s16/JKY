Not much needs to be said about Chipotle's food in general... if you've never been to one, I suggest going immediately, like, right now, or you might as well jump off a cliff because life is just not worth living (jk, don't really do that).  Chipotle's food is delish, consistent, healthy, fast, fresh, environmentally conscious, and well priced.  What more can you ask for?  If this will be your first Chipotle experience, get a chicken burrito (currently $6.25), with a side of chips and guac ($2.95)... you can't go wrong!

Regarding this specific Queen Creek location, I am a frequent.  95% of the time, I submit my order via the Chipotle app in the Apple Appstore.  Very easy and fun to order this way.  I almost always get the chicken (occasionally the carnitas), because I've found that the other meats (steak, shredded beef) are just not that great... the steak is a bit chewy for my taste.  Anyway, the orders are usually complete within 5 minutes of the pickup time confirmation, but it is not unusual for me to show up a few minutes after the pickup time and they haven't even started it yet.  They are usually very kind and accommodating about it, and may even offer free drinks or chips for the inconvenience... and once, they even paid for the meal followed up by one of the employees calling my phone to apologize and ask about the problem.

They do seem to have a pretty decently high turnover of the staff.  Not sure what to make of that, but it does cause some hiccups in the service (including running out of guacamole once, which was very depressing... because it's sooo good, and I can barely live without it) as they are training the new employees.  But in all the turnover, I have only come in contact with one employee who should not have been working there, and he doesn't anymore, thankfully.

All in all, even though this is not the best Chipotle location, it has top quality Chipotle food, friendly employees, and a pleasant atmosphere.
