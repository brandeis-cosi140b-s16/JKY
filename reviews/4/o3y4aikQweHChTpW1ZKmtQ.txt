We have came to El Palacio a couple of times now and we thought the food was yummy, the prices are good and the service was pretty good...(it's funny we have had the same waiter each time and he seems new so a little slow.) We hope to go again soon and maybe get a different waiter or waitress that knows the menu and fills your water up frequently...;-)  Hopefully the owners read this and all up above and make the service a priority...We need a good mexican food restaurant to come to at least once a month. ;-)
