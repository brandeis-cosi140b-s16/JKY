The reviews are spot on.  My husband and I went to this place for an early dinner.  Yes, the area looks a little rough but it was pretty early.  I followed the recommendation of other yelpers and ordered the shrimp culichi, very good choice.  My husband had the Torito de camaron, a yellow chili filled with shrimp, even better choice than mine.  The salsas were so good, the tomatillo one had enough spice for me.  I can handle spice, the red one was great too, however a bit too spicy for me this week.  Maybe another time I might enjoy it more.  My husband loved it.  We also had the shrimp meatball soup, very well seasoned and delicious. BTW I loved their corn tortillas and they told me they get them at the Sonorense.  They were fresh and cooked to perfection.  I dipped them in the green salsa, YUM. The margaritas are ok, but I was really here for the food.
