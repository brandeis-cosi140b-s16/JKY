Went here yesterday for lunch before seeing Transformers. Guess it's now called Camarones. Either way, the decor is still the same, which is great, because it's an absolutely stunning restaurant. Just beautiful!
We ordered a 5-item combo ($15!!!) - who lets you do that?!
We tried the chicken tacos, cheese enchiladas (with their own red/cream cheese sauce) and a chicken stuffed sopapilla. Holy hell, it was so good! 
The service was great - our gal was really on top of things. 
But really. Try the chicken sopapilla stuff. AMAZING.
OH! And no split plate charge! YAY!
