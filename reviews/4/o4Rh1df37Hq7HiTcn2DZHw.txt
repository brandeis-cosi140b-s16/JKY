"Welcome to Bajios!" - That's what the people behind the counter exclaim as you walk through their door.

Bring a larger-than-life appetite or be prepared to take your left over food with you when you leave!

This place is clean, the service is top notch and the food is fresh and rather tasty!

My weapon of choice?  The Chicken Chimichanga: Lime Chicken, mexican rice, black beans, green sauce.  Then they toss it into the fryer right in front of you.

While the chimichanga is attaining crispiness, your pan is prepared: I choose more mexican rice, black beans, fajitas (onion, bell peppers) and the green sauce.

Once the chimichanga is done, they place it on your pan and adorn it with more green sauce (whatever salsa you choose), sour cream and guacamole.

With the chimichanga and drink it comes out to under $11.

Another worthy mention is that the ice in the ice machine is crushed ice... the good kind.

When you tip them, the person at the register yells "Propina!"  and the rest of the crew answers "Gracias!"

We frequent Bajios enough to where we know the servers and they are very friendly.
