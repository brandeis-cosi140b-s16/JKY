I actually really liked Frida, I'm glad I went there in disregard to the lukewarm to awful reviews on here. The service was really nice and helpful, not over attentive but definitely at hand when needed. I ordered the Spinach Enchiladas, which were a bit bland for me - the addition of my side order of diabla sauce was a good choice. The desserts are seriously delicious, we had the chocolate cake and the flan split between 3 people and had a bit of trouble finishing them after our ample entrees. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, complete with colored lights overhead and lots of Frida Kahlo paintings. From my drinking age companions, the signature margarita was good and they knew how to make a truly dry gin martini well. I didn't find the place uncleanly and the food was delicious with a lot of items you don't always see along with the good classic staples you would expect to find.
