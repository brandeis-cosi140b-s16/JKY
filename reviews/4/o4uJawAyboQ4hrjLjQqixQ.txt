It has been a tough place to find. Living in Phoenix there are plenty of Mexican restaurants to go to. All serve the same thing- tacos, Tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and so on. It's nothing new. So what sets this place apart is the taste of their food and the diversity of the items available. Their portions are large. So what do I mean by diversity in food. Well, Gorditas, pozole, tamales, menudo, sopes, flautas, and all of the other stuff offered in both corn or flower tortillas. Their willingness to customize your order is definitely something to be praised. Try this place out. It's really something to brag about.
