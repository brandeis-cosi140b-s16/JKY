I am a fan for three reasons:

1. They make EXCELLENT margaritas - I love the Jalapeno one. Their house margarita is delish too. 2. Excellent chips...and...if you ask for it, they have one of THE hottest salsas I have ever had in a restaurant! (that's my 3). My hubby says it's hotter than the "blazing" sauce at Buffalo Wild Wings. If you like HOT salsa, ask for it, but be careful not to take a big scoop or you will burn your tongue off.
