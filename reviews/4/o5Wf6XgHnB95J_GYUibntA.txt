After reading previous reviews, and being a lover of all Mexican food, I figured I needed to check this place out. I was prepared to be confused walking in, as some other yelpers mentioned, but there was a woman who greeted me at the door and told me exactly how it worked. 

I ordered the "pick dos" and it was a great way to go! Had a taco and enchilada. The chicken and beef were equally seasoned and fresh, as well as the toppings (you get your pick of tomatos, onions, lettuce, olives, sour cream and jalepenos). You also get your choice of side. I went with the chips - again fresh and had a nice seasoning blend on them. 

They have a hot sauce bar that you can experiment with also, which is cool. I kind of wished that you got salsa with your chips or that there was a salsa on the hot sauce bar to go with the chips. I feel like it just goes hand in hand. 

All in all, great meal, friendly staff, and they offer a 10% discount for all public servants (police, fire, emt, and teachers)!
