My first visit here!  I love to find new places especially those hidden from sight like Nandos. Today i tried the lunch special. A beef Taco and cheese enchilada. it was pretty much what I expected, but in a good way!
The other yelp reviewers had given it pretty much a thumbs up and I think they were spot on. iI's typical texmex, but really well done. The portions are generous and the food was well prepared and presented. 
It was actually much more than I could possibly eat. So I was not disappointed, BUT I was not enchanted either.
