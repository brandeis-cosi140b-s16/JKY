This is a nice mom and pop type restaurant. We arrived shortly after opening on a Sunday morning and were the only people in the restaurant. The waitress was friendly and offered us suggestions when we asked. We went with a green chili cheese crisp and a chicken chimichanga. Both were very good. I really liked the cheese crisp and that we were asked if we liked it soft or crispy - crispy all the way!

I like the current decor but I think that they could soften some areas by hanging curtains or valances in the doorways or from the ceiling in the back to block the server area. Otherwise everything was very good and I would be happy to try Ayala's again.
