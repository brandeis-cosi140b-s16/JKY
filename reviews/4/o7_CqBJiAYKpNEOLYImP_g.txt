I got the kissi rolls, different but definitely good. Also the carne asada fries. Fries weren't a big proportion like other restaurants but we're definitely alot better quality ingredients and carne asada was cooked to order rather than left under a lamp. The restaurant was clean and the family that runs the place are very nice. Great customer service, I'll definitely be coming back.
