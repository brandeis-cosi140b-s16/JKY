Coming from San Diego, where taco shops extend beyond the Roberto's chain, I found myself hopping from taco shop to taco shop after moving to Vegas, chasing the guacamole dragon.

I finally found this location, which has a friendly staff, is clean and reminds me most of the taco shops back home. Everything I've had here has been good and the price is reasonable.

I personally love the #11 -- 3 rolled tacos with rice and beans. On occasion, the beans can get kinda salty. Someone back there gets a little heavy handed with the cotija cheese (salty salty!), but I just throw more hot sauce on it and move on.

Two negatives: Their horchata isn't very cold. That may be traditional -- maybe I'm just a gringa used to icy cold horchata, but its not even served with ice. On one hand, I dig it because you get more horchata, on the other hand... it's warm horchata.

The other is that they don't offer chips and salsa.  Every single Roberto's I've been in, when i ask if we can get an order of chips and salsa with our to-go, has given me a look like, "Que?"  And then we end up with a stryofoam carton full of chips and pico de gallo.

The concepts seems to elude them. Maybe it's a SoCal thing.

But I drive out of my way to go to this location. Good stuff.
