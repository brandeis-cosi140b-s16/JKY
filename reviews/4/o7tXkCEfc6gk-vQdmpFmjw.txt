I have to say I am pleasantly surprised. I ordered the bean dip to start with the chips and salsa. It was delicious. The chips and salsa were OK but not that good.  I ordered the nachos. When they came out they were huge.  They were filling and tasty.  The server we had was awesome. He was running back and forth to make sure we always had everything we needed.  Needless to say we tipped him well.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great because it is kind of inside, but no walls so you can see outside.  The have a DJ every day.  I feel bad because they are in the infamous cursed location of Chandler Mall.  No place ever lasts there. I can't say I for sure would eat here again without the Living Social deal I got for this restaurant. It is a little pricey.  The Nachos are definitely worth the money, but from what I can see on the Yelp pictures it looks like everything else may be a little overpriced.
