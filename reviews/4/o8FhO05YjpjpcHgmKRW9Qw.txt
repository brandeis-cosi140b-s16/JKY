I don't know why Del Taco doesn't get better reviews than it does? When your stuck on the East Coast with Taco Bell, this is fast food Mexican manna sent from the heavenly El Chapo gods themselves! I absolutely love the beer battered fish tacos that are crunchy, warm, topped with lettuce, and a avocado cream! Wrapped in foil with a lime wedge and your in  some remote Mexican village eating some kinda goodness! The prices are all very reasonable and not a overwhelming menu! You'll have your standard tacos, along with some seasonal specials their running. If you can ever catch the carnitas taco, hit the manager over the head and take off with every one he's got! This southern gentleman is loving some Del Taco!
