Here's the thing about this location.   The food is always good.  The service can be so so.  It really depends on your server.  There is an older gentleman, whose name I do not recall, that we had the other day.  Yes he was pretty slow.  Another person coming through actually brought our food and refilled our drinks for us.  The food however is always very good.  The bean dip is fabulous. I like the decor of the restaurant also.  If you want good food Garcia's is a good place.  At times the service can be slow but it is always courteous.
