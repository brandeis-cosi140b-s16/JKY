I had my first visit there and I was very impressed.  We told the cashier that it was our first time and they were great at letting us try things out and learning how to fill out the ordering ticket.

I ended up getting the imperial quesadilla, jerk fried rice, beans and jerk burrito.  My favs were the imperial quesadilla and the beans.  They were delish.  The food is a tad on the greasy side, so just be prepared.  Otherwise my husband and i shared the combo listed above and we still had some to take home.  We'll definitely be back.
