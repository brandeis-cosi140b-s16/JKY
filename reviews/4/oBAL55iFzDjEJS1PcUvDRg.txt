It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, but differ considerably in food quality and service.

This one is the best Filiberto's I've been to. Still no "neat and clean" feel to it, but the food is better than average for Filiberto's.

Like any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless.
