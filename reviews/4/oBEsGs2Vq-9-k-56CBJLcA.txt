It's everything you can hope for: cheap, fast, and really good. A rather hearty taco was under $2. After the simply OK La Nopalito near my hotel, this was a very welcome surprise. Phoenix doesn't seem to have any specialty besides Mexican or "Southwestern" (read: Americanized Mexican). So, I am happy to have had some good Mexican while in town.
