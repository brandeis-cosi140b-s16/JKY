4.5 stars for my love of good dive-y Mexican restaurants. 

I went to La Barquita a few weeks ago on a Friday night at the tail end of Happy Hour. I have to say that La Barquita serves the largest and best $2 margarita I have ever had. I love to get tipsy for under a fiver. (It's $2, so don't expect top shelf or even middle shelf tequila. This is cheap tequila, but so is the drink. )

Service: Sweet and very nice ladies serve you and make sure you are enjoying yourself. Excellent service for a dive restaurant.

Food: Holy mole the food was great. I got the mole enchiladas with cheese. They were delicious. And some good rice and beans on the side. My friend ordered the molcajetes a la mexicana for one ($12). He loved it. He is a sucker for chorizo and he said it was cooked perfectly. He also loved the Mexican cheese, chicken, beef, and poblano peppers that completed the dish. The charro beans, fresh tortillas, guacamole, and rice were wonderful additions to the almost overwhelming amount of food. 

My three favorite things about the meal were:
1) the chips and salsa -- great smoky flavor to the salsa with good, thick chips.
2) the guacamole -- I almost ate all of the side guac. It's chunky and seasoned just right.
3) the fresh tortillas -- I'm a a big fan of fresh tortillas. My best friend makes her own tortillas and I am sure that they are holy because they are so good. These tortillas were just as wonderful.

Go here for happy hour ($2 drinks) and good food.
