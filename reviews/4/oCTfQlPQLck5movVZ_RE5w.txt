This location is always busy and the food is great. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I feel like the staff can be very slow. I have noticed it the last 5 times I have been there. So it wasn't just a one time thing. So if you want good food and don't mind it taken in a few mins Chipotle is your place. There food is amazing and always taste fresh.
