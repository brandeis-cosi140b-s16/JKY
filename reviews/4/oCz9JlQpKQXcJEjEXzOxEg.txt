Where do you go when you need that greasy Mexican fix?  Me I go to Las Margaritas. 
Sure you can choose one of the other ten Mexican joints on  Independence but then you wouldn't receive the friendly service and $5 bucket of Coronitas that Las Margaritas serves everyday.  Cheese dip, tacos, and beer isn't that what Mexican food is all about! 

*Yes from time to time I will throw a margarita into the mix
