My kids love the Mexican snow cones. Everytime they want to come here they ask for a raspa de el "buki" because they think the owner looks like the Mexican singer "el buki" I don't think they even know the real name of this place. Anyway, he does have the best raspado but they are a bit too pricey which is what keeps us from coming more often. With 5 of us and at $5.00 a raspa, a single outing for snow cones quickly turns into $25.00.
