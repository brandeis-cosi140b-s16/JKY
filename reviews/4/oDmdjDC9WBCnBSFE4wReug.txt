Authentic Mexican Food.
Fresh Cooked to order. Restaurant is clean.
Carne Asada Taco was good. Asked if I wanted fresh quac & pico, " of course"!
Nice salsa bar with three different salsas: Mild (green), regular Hot & Fire ( not a lot of flavor just a lot of heat). Carrots are pickled and tasty and the also offer an onion relish.
Price are very reasonable. Will be back to try more of their menu.
