I had no idea this place was even here! A friend suggested it.
I ordered fish tacos, spicy with slaw. It was really tasty!
No beans or rice. Just a simple 3 taco plate, and some chips on the side. 
Only $10 bucks!- Not bad, right?

The service was really friendly and funny. 
The dining room was busy but definitely not crowded.

I would go back for sure!
