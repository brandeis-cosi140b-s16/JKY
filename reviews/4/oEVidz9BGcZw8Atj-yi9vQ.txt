This place is pretty awesome for a 24-hr mex pickup place. Not much room for seating and wouldn't really suggest it. Never had a bad meal here, the carne asada tacos and burritos are a safe play, add a lime or hot sauce and you are set. Not much to add about rice and beans which are standard. My buddy gets the chicken chimichanga every time, I haven't deviated from the steak too often.
