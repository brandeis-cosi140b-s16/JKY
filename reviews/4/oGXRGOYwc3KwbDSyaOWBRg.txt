I have come here to eat about 3 times a month. I have definitely spread the word about this place. The food is great, even though their menu is a little small. I have been waiting since the opening for then to get Bloody Marys though. When I go I tend to order a little of everything, but I always order the tacos that have pineapple on them. They are amazing. If you are industry you should go on Tuesday or after 10. They give you 50% off your entire bill (drinks included). The only thing that really bothers me is how loud the music is. OMG is it loud. My favorite server there is a girl named Panini (hopefully I spelled it right).
