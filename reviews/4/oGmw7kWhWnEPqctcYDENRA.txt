YUMMMM. i live in socal so i definitely know my way around a delicious, authentic mexican joint but i will tip my hat off to Roberto's. after a drunken night, i ordered 4 carnitas tacos and was shocked when i looked at my meal. HOLY SHIT. these tacos are HUGE ! and STACKED with meat ! with guacamole! i barely finished 2. the only reason i knock off a star is that i think they're meat can be a littleee bit more salty. oh, and their hot sauce kind of sucks. i'm obsessed with king taco style hot sauce and theirs is probably the exact opposite of that. still looking forward to eating here on my next vegas trip
