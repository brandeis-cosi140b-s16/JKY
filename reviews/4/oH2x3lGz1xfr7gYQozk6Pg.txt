I actually went to this place after reading Yelp reviews! My friends were very impressed with the ambiance, service and the margaritas! I thoroughly enjoyed the feel of the restaurant and was definitely impressed with the service as well. I ordered the huevos rancheros papas y queso burro. It wasn't the best breakfast burrito I've ever had but my friend got a dish made with cactus and it was VERY good! I had never experienced such a unique food as cacti and it was awesome! Definitely something I will have again!
