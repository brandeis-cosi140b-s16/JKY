Ok so we came here for a few drinks after dinner.  We arrived about 8:00 and we were able to find a table near the bar.  Now I did not have any food as I am a strict beer diet.  I did however have a nice 32 oz Tecate.  My friends had some margaritas and they enjoyed them.   

The bar was very loud but they did have a lot of t.vs and all the March Madness games were on.
The server appeared to be new but did a good job.  
Not a bad place to check out if you are town for a few days.
