Whatever you are in the mood for, the Saz probably has it.  Very cheap with large portions...I once got the chicken curry for about $6 and it turned out to be half of a small chicken!!  Bare bones service, but the value is outstanding.  They have outdoor seating when it's nice, so opt for that.  Whatever you order, it's going to be good.
