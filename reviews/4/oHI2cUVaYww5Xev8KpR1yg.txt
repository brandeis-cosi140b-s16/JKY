The atmosphere's probably the main draw to this place for a slightly upper scale mexican restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good but for all the attention to detail in the decor, i dont know, i expected a little more out of the food.

This is a good place to take mid western family members for a little southwest flavor since they wont know any better :)  The market on Sundays is nice and the staff has always been accomodating.  They have a huge banquet hall and the outdoor courtyard is the best seat in the house on a nice day. Full Bar! The deserts are great too.
