Viva El Taco has been my late night stop since before I met my husband. Now that we live in Henderson I seldom get the chance to stop. So last week when we were on the way to my Dad's we stopped by. Wow! They have not changed a bit! Still yummy as ever! 

This was my husbands first time trying Viva El Taco. He ordered the Al Pastor burrito and I got the Carne Asada burrito. Both were loaded with meat, guacamole and pico! Mmmmm soooo tasty! They also have a killer fish taco. My husband has been craving that burrito ever since!

Not only is the food awesome, but the prices are great too. If your on the east side make sure you swing by for some tacos.
