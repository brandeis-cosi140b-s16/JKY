Five stars for the food! We have been looking for good, authentic, reasonable Mexican food since we moved here 2 years ago. We both tried the al pastor, chicken, carnitas, machaca and carne asada tacos just to get a taste of a few things. Everything was excellent except the chicken. Very dried out. I had the agua fresca watermelon which was perfect. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is because we really like a margarita with our Mexican. Even though we live in Boulder City, we will drive all the way back here again.
