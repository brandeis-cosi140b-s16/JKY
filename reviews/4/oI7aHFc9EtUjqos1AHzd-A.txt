This place is right down the street from me and I popped into on my way home from work (I was too lazy to drive to my usual Mexican place). I just want to grab a marg and takeout that was better then cheap Mexican food for the evening. 

The hostess was very nice. I took a seat at the open bar and was offered chips and salsa shortly after sitting. I ordered the house margarita on the rocks with salt. It was good, but a little on the sweet side for my liking. 

My Togo order consisted of a combo meal. I ordered the 3 items so I could have left overs for lunch tomorrow. I got am enchilada, taco, and burrito with rice and bean for 12 bucks. There was also complimentary chips and salsa, which is always a bonus! 

Once I got home the food was very good! I will be returning again I the future.
