So my wife and I stumbled upon this place. We followed the advice of some dude yelling to us from across the street. I must say, it quickly became our Saturday morning tradition. I recommend the "Sancho" omelet. Take the ordinary "Pancho" omelet and add chorizo instead of ground beef. "For when Pancho isn't giving you enough chorizo, its time for Sancho"
