I haven't been to the new location until today and it's beautiful. The bar has two huge tvs and very comfortable stools. It's surrounded by a ton of high top tables half of which have those same comfortable stools. Have I mentioned how comfortable they are yet?

The service was impeccable. Drinks remained full as did the chips and salsa. The cheese dip is amazing and came out piping hot on with a candle to keep it that way. Our meals came out in the perfect amount of time to allow us to enjoy our appetizer. Our waitress was very attentive and never made us feel rushed.

If your in the area be sure to stop in and ask for Megan. She will take very good care of you.
