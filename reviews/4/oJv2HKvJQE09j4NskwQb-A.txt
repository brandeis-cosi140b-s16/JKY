Despite iffy reviews, we stopped for dinner because I had a Living Social deal to redeem.  This location does not deserve the bad rap it has gotten.  The food was good, the wait was nonexistent and our server, Larina, was a delight!  The restaurant is clean, we'll decorated and very conveniently located.  I'll be back for sure!
