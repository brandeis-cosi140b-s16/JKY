I first heard about this place from TV on an episode of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives. After seeing the episode and seeing how close I was to the location I was eager to stop by and try this hole in the wall gem. 

Walking in first timers may feel a little intimidated but the employees will walk you through how to order and they even have an option to taste test the menu items. 

I usually order a combo with jerk chicken, jade red chicken quesadilla, pork fried rice, and refried beans. The portion size is more than enough and I always have left overs. Their hot sauce is amazing I always order extra. 

I have always had a positive experience with all the employees. They are fast, and friendly.
