Currently closed for renovation, been out last 2 weeks. 

Pricey is kinda subjective , I eat here at lunch and for the price of a "---berto's" plate I get to sit in a nice atmosphere , get  great salsa with  flavor and decent dose of heat 

 So far no complaints with service and I have a  pretty short lunch time. What stops it being great? Well this is a weak four as my meals have been an odd kinda mix  of great   ingredients , prepared consistently well  E.G, salsa, the beans, the rice, the side veggies  are way above most of the fare in similar restaurants  but the protein  comes out a bit bland and is carried by the surrounding material which is a shame.  

If you have friends that think Macoa's  is great this should blow them away:)
