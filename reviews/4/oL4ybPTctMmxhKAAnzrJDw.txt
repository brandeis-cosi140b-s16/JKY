Visiting from out of town and wanted to try something that I can't find on the East Coast. This fast casual restaurant was just what I was looking for. 

Service was very friendly and we were offered samples of the various meats when they learned it was our first time there. It was hard to choose between the pork and beef but I eventually chose a bowl with the Kalua pork and seaweed rice. It was filling and delicious.
