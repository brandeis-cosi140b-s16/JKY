I went here for the first time today. Happy hour was nicely busy. Great atmosphere at the bar. The sangria was amazing and the chips and salsa were too. I got the shrimp tacos and my friend got another kind that I can't recall. My tacos were very tasty with plenty of Shrimp. They didn't skimp on that. The bartender was attentive but not intrusive. The prices were good. I'll be going back and taking my boyfriend next time. Cool little place!
