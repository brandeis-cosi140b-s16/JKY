Fabulous.  We were visiting from out of town and some one recommended this place.  I am from Texas, love to cook  and pretty particular about my Mexican food.  This place was awesome.  We caught a late lunch and such around for a happy hour.  The food was great....the Margaritas were great..even for a house Margarita, and I usually only drink top shelf.   Our service was great as well.  Enjoy!!!!
