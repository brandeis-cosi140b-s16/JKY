We used to frequent this place... at least once a week.  I will never willingly return. The food has slid so far downhill that it's not the same restaurant.  The waitstaff, with the exception of a couple waiters, is poor at best. They messed something up on our order the last 4 times we went. The manager is unapologetic, and always had some lame excuse. Also, not that he has to, but if I managed a restaurant and saw a couple come in week in and week out, I'd buy them a drink every so often. Never once happened. The other Place, Viva Michoacan near Sunset and Sunset is way better. Worth the drive when I could walk to Lindo.

update:  we we t back, and the food and service has been remarkably better. Good job, Lindo!!  4 stars.
