My wife & I visited Las Velas restaurant early on a blustery winter Saturday evening.  The crowd in the restaurant was sparse.  I'm sure the weather & the construction hurt the crowd. Fortunately, the food was first class.  We had an appetizer of tortilla chips & guacamole.  The tortilla chips were hot & crunchy and the guacamole was fresh & tasty with a hint of lime & fresh tomato chunks.  

My wife had a frozen Margarita; it was very good with just the right amount of tequila.  I had a Negra Modelo.  

Our entrees were prepared table side, flambé style.  I had the "Mar y Tierra OK Maguey", steak & shrimp grilled in lime/mesquite marinade with a creamy cilantro & avocado sauce.  The steak chunks & large shrimp were tender.  My wife had "Carne Cambalache", a steak chunks marinated in tequila and mesquite-lime vinaigrette that were finished table-side flambé style.  We both a side of potatoes that were seasoned with lemon or citrus and were quite good.  I had rice & black beans as sides.  My wife had a side of Rajas con crema, that were poblano pepper strips in a cream sauce.  They were excellent with just the right amount of heat/spice for me.  They were too hot for my wife's milder taste buds.

For desert we shared an order of Sopapillo.  It was vanilla ice cream drizzled with a chocolate sauce served with two fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon & sugar.  It was a fine finish to a good meal.

The servers were friendly & efficient.  The food was well prepared & presented and the portions were generous.  We plan to return for another meal.

We have visited a number of Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area and I would rate this at the top.  Our other favorites are "Patron" in Wexford and "Azul Bar Y Cantina" in Leetsdale.
