My friends love this place (seriously one of them has gone there like 10 times within a few months) and I have to say, it was pretty good. I love their salsas. There is this one, I can't remember the name of it, but it was so delicious.  If I remember correctly, The peanut one was not tasty at all. Their tacos was unique and tasty. I also got a burrito, it was good too. It is a little pricey, $$ for sure.
