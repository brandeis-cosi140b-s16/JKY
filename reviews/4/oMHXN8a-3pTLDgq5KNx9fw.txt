we eat here every time we stay at South-point hotel..love the trio of bean dip, guac and salsa, with the fresh basket of chips..The bean dip is so addicting, that we almost have to wrestle the grand kids to get our share..this last time we just got more! I always order the shredded beef crispy taco meal, and am never disappointed...the free margarita coupon is a plus, as I like mine over the rocks instead of frozen...service is always good, and so is the food....give it a try when in Vegas!
