If you're looking to enjoy a huge burrito, this is the place to go. Although when I went, the "burrito artist" was giving me a hard time due to the fact that I was having a hard time ordering. Since I haven't had Chipotle for quite some time, I was overwhelmed by all the options. But it was worthwhile because the burrito was superb!
