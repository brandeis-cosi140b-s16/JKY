Loved this place, especially the all-you-can-eat Taco Tuesday.  Unfortunately this location closed down, apparently.  The location in Silverado Ranch is still up and running, I believe.  But if you're in the North part of town and need something tasty, I recommend Alfonsos which is right up the street.
