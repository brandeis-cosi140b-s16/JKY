The only reason I'm only giving this place 4 stars is because of the unhappy service we received. The food has always been amazing here, and I love it! I got my sister hooked on their carne asada quesadillas. I even prefer this location to the original in Phoenix off 7th. The food was better prepared faster and fresher tasting than the other location.

I can't wait to come back again when I visit. It's a keeper!
