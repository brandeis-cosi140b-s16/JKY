4/26/2008 I went here today with a group of 8 women.  We had a lovely lunch.  We even pulled out a craft project and it felt totally comfortable.  The food was wonderful.  The staff was really easy-going and tentative considering the size of our group and our crafty nature.  :)

11/26/2011 We held our wedding rehearsal dinner at Ajo Als on the patio. It was perfect. The service was wonderful. The food was plentiful and great. The space was nice for a large group of people. We had around 40. The patio could have easily fit many more!
