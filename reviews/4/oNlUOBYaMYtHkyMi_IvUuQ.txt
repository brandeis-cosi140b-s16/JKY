Have been coming here since I was a kid (40 yrs basically).  So I have a natural love for this place just due to the memories.  The food is still good but not the best in town, but much better then most, hands down.  What truely bothers me is how early they close in the evening now-a-days.  I understand they make their money during the lunch hours, but on weekend I have pulled in there before 8 and they have been closed.  People who give it one or two stars...well ..you probably are never happy with anything
