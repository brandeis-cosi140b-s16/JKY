I'm bumping 3 star food up to 4 stars for a fun drink menu, liberal pours, and great location.  You're in the middle of the grand canal shops, many of the tables overlook the water filled canal with an italian restaurant across the way.

The host and waitress were friendly, and while service was not the most attentive, I was in no rush.

The guacamole was okay.  Not great... it was missing some lime and salt, but it was good.

I had the chile relleno, and was no too impressed.  The pepper and cheese filling were good, but the breading was way too thick and oily.  There was very little sauce, and it did nothing to curb the thick crisp breading on the chile, so it was kind of like biting into an airy cracker or cookie with every bite.  Taste was there, but just an odd experience.

The tres leches was pretty good too... but I remember trying it last time I was here two years ago and loving it.  I don't know if my tastes changed or the tres leches changed, but it was a bit disappointing having built it up in my mind only to be presented with an average dessert.

If you're dining in a Venetian/Palazzo canal shop restaurant, you shouldn't be concerned about the price, you know it's going to be expensive.  But I was fairly surprised the bill was so low for a couple drinks, guac, entree, and dessert.

As I started out the review by saying, you're getting pretty good food, decent prices, and it's a great setting to have a few drinks and sit back to people watch.
