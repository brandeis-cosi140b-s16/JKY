Visited on a Tuesday morning.  This is the best home style Mexican bistro cooking I've had in a long time in a clean and edgy setting.  The cook has prepared such delicious things as homemade salsas, roasted corn and cheese appetizers, delicious and interesting salads and tasty fresh guacamole accented with pomegranate seeds.  The chilaquiles plate was very delicous.  The watermelon cooler drink was refreshing and superb on a hot June day.  I only rate 4 stars for two reasons:  one of the newer waitresses didn't seem very interested in our table but I saw the others were hustling and later was informed the waitress was in training.  And secondly the temperature near the window was very warm.  If you are interested in trying some freshly prepared and interesting and scrumptious cuisine in a cute environment, I highly recommend.  The ambiance was also very nice there, eclectic music in the background and modern decor.
