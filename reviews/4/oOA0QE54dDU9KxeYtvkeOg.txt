I have been eating here for about two years now maybe twice a month and after some late night activities. What really stands out to me is their carne asada fries and how they got rid of a new years hangover. They offer quick service, a salsa/condiment bar, huge menu and excellent meat. This is not your neighborhood Filibertos. The only reason I give it 4/5 stars and not 5/5 is we need a drive through!!
