This place is great for takeout, always open (it seems!) when everything else nearby is not, plus it has a handy little drive thru so you don't have to get your lazy butt out of the car.  It's basically a cousin of the 'berto's chain and has gynormous burrito's. I like to grab some when I don't feel like making breakfast. The sasuage egg n cheese is my fav and JD either gets ham or chorizo. 

One late boozy night we had the Super Nacho's and they must have weighed 8 or 10 pounds! Heaped with beans guac, sour cream, cheese and steak- they were awesome but definitely a diet assassin. I'd get em again though!
