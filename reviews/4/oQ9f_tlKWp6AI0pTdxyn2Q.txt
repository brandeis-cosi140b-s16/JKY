This is a relatively new place in the area.  I've been here about 4-5 times now and food has been good every time.  I've had tacos, I've had the biryani which is a goat stew, I've had chilaquiles, I've had ceviche, and everything has been delicious so far.  The ladies who run the place are very nice and it's a real asset to the neighborhood to have them here. This is probably the closest little restaurant of any kind to where I live, which makes it very convenient, and the food is better quality then KFC, Church's Chicken or the other fast food places nearby.  Their condiments have been nice and fresh every time, too.  I'mma keep comin' back!

PS--bring cash, no cards here.
