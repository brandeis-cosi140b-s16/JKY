I would always pass by this place saying to myself I'll go one day.  Well that one day was this weekend with a friend of mine.  She had been to Tijuana Flats in Florida and I was a complete newbie.  The experience was great.  I ordered a veggie-bean burrito on whole wheat and it was pretty good.  The beans are not cooked in lard and for us vegetarians that's music to our ears.  I did end up ordering a side of queso for my burrito because I needed it to be a bit more saucy, personal preference.  I really did like the sauce bar they had ranging from sweet to super spicy sauces to add to your dish.  I would definitely go back there again and try something new because its a very chill place.  I found it to be a cross between Taco Bell & a traditional Mexican restaurant.  Anyone looking to try a new Mexican place with a bit of flare, I'd suggest you check this out.
