I went here with my grandma - taking her to Chipotle for her first time - it is about my 50th time - I've been to Chipotle's all over the Chicagoland area for years.  

I had the carnitas burrito bowl and she had a chicken burrito bowl.  The people did a great job - added a good amount of food to the bowls (especially the meat).  She liked that they had brown rice and agreed that she would get no lettuce next time (I don't like lettuce on mine - I just think it takes away from the bowl).  The carnitas were a little salty but they were good and mixed in with the other ingredients you couldn't really tell.  

I love the carnitas with black beans, white rice, hot sauce (it's really not that hot but has good flavor), cheese, sour cream, and guacamole (it's extra but worth it).
