What a great place to eat. Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and they gave him a free dessert and the server made sure there was enough for all of us. Food came out hot and delicious. The atmosphere was awesome but my only issue was the bathroom. It smells really really horrible and needs to be cleaned more. We will still come back to try other items on the menu.
