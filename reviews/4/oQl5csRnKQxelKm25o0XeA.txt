Very good fresh tacos $1.10 each.Wish we were here on Wends. When they are .75 I had the chicken - a bit spicy, definitely had a " kick ". Street taco size was perfect . Daughter. & Bf had carne asada, said it was " good and fresh " We ordered a horchata to go with perfect to cut some of the spice.Small place but staff was friendly & fast.
