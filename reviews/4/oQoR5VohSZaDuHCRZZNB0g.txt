Last night in Vegas and we were looking for something casual.  Headed next door and grabbed some seats at the bar - great view of the casino and the Steelers game on TV.  Yummy margarita, good guac, salsa was tasy but could be a little thicker so it stays on the chip.  I had soft shell tacos which were yummy and the hubby had enchiladas - both dished were very good.
