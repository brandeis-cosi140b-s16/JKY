Right-sized portions at reasonable prices. Those in our party who got the chile relleno, quesadilla and taco dorado were very satisfied. My daughter and I got the tostada and they were watery; my chicken tostada was fairly tasteless....seemed like it was just boiled chicken, so I was disappointed. Quick, very friendly service.
