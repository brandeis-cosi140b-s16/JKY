Where can you eat some of the best tacos in Vegas? My house, of course. But, I can't take all the credit. I bought the pre-seasoned and marinated meat for a recent BBQ at Los Compadres. The proteins purchased were pork chops ($2.49/lb), chicken breasts ($2.99/lb), and carne asada ($5.99/lb). The quality was great, all were easy to cook, chop up and serve in tortillas with all the toppings.

If your Spanish is no bueno, don't worry. They've got employees at this little Mexican market who speak English. The quality of their produce looked good, although prices were about the same (sometimes even more expensive) than what you would find at big chains like Albertsons or Smiths. I thought I'd save plenty of money by shopping here instead of those places, but I really didn't. I'll come back, though, to get my taco meat fix.
