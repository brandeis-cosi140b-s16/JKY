I am sorry Yelp, but Burritos are a food group! Especially for ME!

I just starting working in the area and have been in search for a place for breakfast, lunch and good eats. So I went to my trusty Yelp app, and was not disappointed to find The Original Burrito Co.

I have found my new Favorite Breakfast Burrito of all time! Number 12 Huevos Ala Mexicana: Eggs and some veggies and cheese. It is truly a well put together burrito, hits the spot every time. 

Don't forget the salsa! It is one of the top salsa's I have had!

I have ordered a few more items off the menu and I have enjoyed them, but nothing as wonderful as the number 12!
