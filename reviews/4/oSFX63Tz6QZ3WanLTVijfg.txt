I went there late last night, first because there is 99 cent tacos, and second, because I love late night Mexican food, especially if I partner it with an antacid pill.  Got tacos and rice.  Tacos were wonderful, crispy, and taste awesome.  Rice was very good (5 stars for this)   Now I usually go to the Filis on Dobson and Main, but this was on my way home.  The one on Dobson and Main puts more meat and lettuce in their tacos, so I do prefer that location.  The taste of these though were on par.  Would have given it 5 stars if they would have put more meat and lettuce in it (yes, I know, I am repeating myself).  Can't beat Filibertos, good, inexpensive authentic Mexican food....thank you!
