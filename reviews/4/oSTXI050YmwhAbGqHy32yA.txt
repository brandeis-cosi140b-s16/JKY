This review is for the chorizio tacos because every time I go to Mendoza I vow to try something new and I always end up getting these. The chorizio is finely diced, well seasoned, and topped with fresh cilantro. There delicious and at $6.00 a great deal as well.

The reason for the 4 star review versus 5 is the sides at Mendoza are middling. Certainly no reason not to give it a try though as everyone I've taken here has always enjoyed their main course.
