OMG let me just say three words, Carne Asada NACHOS! They are bombdotcom!  I love walking into this place, the employees are nice and are willing to take my order.  They have great deals going on like three tacos and a drink for $7.25, or stuff like that but I usually stick to the nachos!  I literally have to have this every other week.  My friend suggested this for me a while back, and I wasn't too impressed until I added the spicy mayo sauce.  It's like a mexican version of the yum, yum sauce = AMAZING!  I love how my nachos are still crisp even with all the toppings on top, and the vegetables are fresh! Once you're there get a stamp card, the lady was so generous that she gave me four stamps.  Get 7, and you get a free burrito.
