Johnny's green sauce is excellent! The chile relleno was unique in that it was wrapped in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried instead of the traditional egg batter.  It was crispy and delicious.   Highly recommended the pork plate; meat was very tender and very flavorful. The only tiny complaint we had is that the chips were waaay too salty.  I don't know if that was just a one time thing or if those are their standard chips. The owner was very friendly and we had a good conversation with him. We would recommend trying this place.
