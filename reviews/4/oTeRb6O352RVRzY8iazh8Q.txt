It took me a while to get in, because the name was somewhat deceiving. What is GadZooks? And what does it have to do with Enchiladas? I still don't know, but after a few recommendations I have it a try. I have since been back a few times. 

Despite its odd name, GadZooks is like a chipotle for Enchiladas. You basically pick out your filling (from about 8 choices), sauce, and then condiments (ie cheese, lettuce, Guac). Staff then cook it in the oven and send you on your way. I'm also a fan of the pumpkin cookies they have been serving during the fall. 

I haven't yet tried any of the soups, but the enchiladas were tasty. Another note- this isn't exactly authentic Mexican food, and chiles are very mild (to set proper expectations).
