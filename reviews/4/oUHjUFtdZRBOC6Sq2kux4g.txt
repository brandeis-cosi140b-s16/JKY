Tradiciones has an absolutely fantastic atmosphere.  They have amazing food and drinks.  We have only lived here for four months, and have been to this restaurant four times.  Every time we have someone visiting from out of town, we take them to this restaurant.

I didn't give five stars because the service has never been very good.  Last night it took ten minutes for our server to come take our drink order.  Then we were given flour tortillas instead of corn (twice).  But this is the kind of place where you don't really care, because it's just fun.  How can you complain about the wrong kind of tortilla when your mouth is still burning from the Camarones el Diablo and you've got a margarita (or, in my case, a Corona) to wash it down with?

Last night, they had some Mexican League Football on the TVs on the patio.  It just added to the experience even more.  GOL!

4.5 stars.
