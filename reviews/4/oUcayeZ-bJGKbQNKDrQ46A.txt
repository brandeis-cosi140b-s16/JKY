I decided to go back after the recent Yelp event for happy hour. Wasn't very crowded so we sat at the bar. I had to have another Prickly Pear margarita, it's been on my mind for a few weeks and it was as delicious as I remembered. Chips and salsa were brought out while we waited for the drinks to be made. We went ahead and ordered guacamole and shrimp ceviche. Both were excellent. My second drink was blood orange margarita, another stellar drink. This was brought out with the red snapper tacos we ordered. The tacos were very good, not the best I've had but pretty good. Service was a bit slow considering it was not busy. No napkins or sharing plated provided, I grabbed some from the closest table. I will definitely be back for happy hour!
