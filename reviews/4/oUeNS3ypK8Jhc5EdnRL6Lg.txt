I finally got to try the infamous chamango! I was a little nervous because I thought there might be a little but chamoy and I wouldn't be able to eat it, but that was def not the case. I took the first bite of the mango and it was delicious! To be on the safe side I got it with mango ice cream. It was a delicious dessert I would def come back for!

Another plus? The service is super friendly! Good food and a good atmosphere, they def know what they're doing!
