Very friendly and accommodating, with good beer options and an extremely extensive menu. They even have horchata, which is great. The food was quite tasty. I would have been more impressed if they had a real margarita, though, instead of the usual mix -- so I stuck with Negra Modelo (which is delicious). Also, I know there were seven of us and it can be like herding cats to get groups to order in a timely manner -- but there is a big difference between efficiency and rush rush. That won't hold me back from a repeat visit, though, because on the bright side -- service was very fast!!
