Excellent Margaritas and Guacamole!!!
I like that they bring chilled water to your table in a large glass bottle to help rehydrate you after walking the strip.
I had the ceviche and tortilla soup.
I would recommend both.
When it comes to the tacos, you can only order them as a combo with rice and beans.
It would be nice to be able to order them ala carte.
The staff was very friendly and the manager was very visible and making sure everyone was happy.
