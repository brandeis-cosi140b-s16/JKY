This was my first time ever trying korean/Mexican fusion food and it was a a delicious surprise. I ordered a fusion burrito and fusion nachos and fries with kimchi. The servings are HUGE so make sure you come with a big appetite. I couldn't finish my food and had to take it home. I would definitely suggest ordering the fusion fries with kimchi.
