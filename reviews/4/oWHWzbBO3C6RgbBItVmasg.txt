I have been to Zamora's over 20 times. This place has salsa and warm chips to die for, and an endless supply of it at no extra cost. They don't make you feel guilty for loving their salsa! . A "dive" atmosphere - - but who cares? I recommend the Breakfast Chili Rellenos for breakfast , which is the best Mexican breakfast I have ever had in my 32 years in Az. Excellent food Zamora's - keep it up!
(just please remember to smile at us gringos) There is one particular waitress there that has a perpetual frown on her face
