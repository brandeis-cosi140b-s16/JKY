Driving down Spring Mountain Road at night during commute hours you can easily miss this new taco truck that opened up last week.  But if you noticed the brightly lite interior of a white trailer with a few bar chairs setup right at the counter, then you have spotted Tacos "La Carreta".  The visual reminded me of the food stalls in night markets in Asia, but this is way cleaner.

Their menu is pretty simple, tacos, burritos, quesadilla, tortas, paras and even hot dogs.  The portion is smaller but so is the price tag.  I feel that it is portioned just right for you to sample more of their menu.

The Lengua Taco is my favorite of all the items I ordered.  The owner, Juan Carlos, also made me a potato taco that I have never tried before.  My mouth enjoyed the new experience.

The owner and the cashier lady are super nice, and the entire taco truck is kept super clean. Way cleaner than some kitchens I have seen around the Las Vegas valley that conspicuously display their "A" rating from the local health inspection.  The food is pretty good, but could benefit from further refinement.  But that is just my opinion, and I am not at all an expert in Mexican food.  

Service is fast and friendly. And after awhile waiting for a friend to arrive, a steady flow of Spanish speaking patrons started arriving.  So that is a good sign I think.

Come check them and support a local new business.

They are currently open only on Friday-Sunday from about 6 to 10pm.
