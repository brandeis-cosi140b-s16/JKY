Great to find places like this near the strip!

+2. Very friendly staff, genuinely friendly in fact.  Seated promptly and served promptly.  These folks really care about their customer and it shows.

+1 a great drink.  Cadillac Margarita mixed with 1800 Reposado (a healthy quantity of it to)

+1 good appetizer.  Guac mixed at the table.  

+1 good main course.  I enjoyed the flaming fajitas, theatrics and all, but the flavor was definitely improved by the flaming tequila.  Not greasy at all.

-1. Location less than desirable and attached to the casino floor,  very smokey considering how few people are in here.

Overall, I'll be back and am pleased to have found this place.
