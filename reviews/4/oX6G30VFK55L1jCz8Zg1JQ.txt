I have only ventured to this restaurant on two occasions...the first was on suggestion from Pastor Paul Wilson and then tonight when Kristi and I were checking out places to eat.

Caramba's menu is very simple, but offers a wide selection.  I chose a combination with a taco, tostado and tamale. When the food came out, it covered two plates. Needless to say, even with my heavy appetite, I struggled to everything.

Kristi ordered a beef chimi...nothing special, but very filling as well. The big compliment came at the temperature of the food that came out. Everything was hot, and definitely was prepared fresh.

This is a great place to stop in for a quick bite or bring in the family for a meal.

Kristi and I spent like $20 and left full.

The one thing that was a little weird...the charge for drink refills.
