Ate at this robertos location on Saturday with a friend of mine and I really like this robertos as it is a little bit bigger then the other robertos locations I've been to the customer service here is good and I really enjoyed the food my friend got the rolled tacos with sour cream and guacamole and I got the California burrito with Carne asada and cheese that was the bomb haven't used that word in along time but it was made me miss eating one of those in California even though the ones out there taste better this one was close anyhow I see my self checking out this location when I get the chance the place is clean can't say much about the bathrooms as I didn't go in there but I'm pretty sure they keep them clean other then that I think I will come back to this robertos again.
