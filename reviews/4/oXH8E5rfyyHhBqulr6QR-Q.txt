I went here last night while downing some beers at Khoury's Fine Wine and Spirits.  Sloppy Jo's was parked right in front so, why not?  My buddy and I shared the Spicy Grilled Cheese and the BBQ slider, and we each had a 'Red' Slider.  Hands down these were the best sliders from a food truck I have had.  I know some other places get the fame and glory but the meat on these sliders was cooked perfectly (and it didn't take 25 minutes to get our food)!  The onions, bacon, and sauce on the sliders just added another level to make them just plain delicious.  We both thought the grilled cheese had the perfect amount of spice to it and it was very cheesy, in a great way!  I was a little disappointed because they had run out of the green chiles and we couldn't try the 'Green' Slider or the Mac n' Cheese.  Understandable though because a bunch of dudes drinking a bunch of beers are going to get pretty hungry.  I don't see why I wouldn't try this place again because I'm sure I will go back to Khoury's and if Sloppi Jo's is out in front, I'll be in line for some more sliders!
