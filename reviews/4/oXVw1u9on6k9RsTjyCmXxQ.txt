La Perla Café is family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS. I went there with my wife Carol for dinner. 

Carol got the #23 combo (Tostada, enchilada & a taco) she totally devoured her meal so I know she liked it. When she was done there was nothing left on her plate. 

I got the Cimichanga dinner w/ rice and refried beans. My entrée was mouthwatering scrumptious. It was well-prepared, flavorful and came out sizzling hot. OMG, the food is SO GOOD here, all the way down to their terrific salsa!  Every bite of it was just stellar!

Outstanding Mexican comfort food. Excellent service from Sandra, our waitress. This place is has excellent food and the prices are reasonable in addition the quality is top notch.

One of the other greatest parts of the meal was the 3 different salsas they serve with their home made chips. They come in small carafes with the food.  All three salsa were extremely flavorful in a way totally unique to La Perla Café. Their salsa unlike most places is less spicy and more flavorful. Its also not so thick. 

If you love Mexican food you really owe it to yourself to check out La Perla. 

FOOD: Top quality Mexican food - MUY DELICIOSO!!! SERVICE: The people are very nice, helpful and caring. They truly want you to enjoy the food they make for you.
