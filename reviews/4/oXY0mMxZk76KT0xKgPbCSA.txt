You know, I normally love this place if I get the right food. I am picky, though. It is very hit or miss.

The corn is my favorite thing - I passionately love roasted corn. The queso chicharron thing sucks. Most of the tacos are tasty, but I have had better fish tacos... 

Their halibut taco sauce tastes like Miracle Whip - I hate miracle whip. The fish was bland.

The ceviche and all salsas I highly recommend.The house salad is definitely a new favorite!!! The torta and half chicken asado is wonderful, and they have tasty, strong margaritas. Try them all!
