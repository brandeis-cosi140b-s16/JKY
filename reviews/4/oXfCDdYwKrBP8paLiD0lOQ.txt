I went here again yesterday.  The food as usual is very good.  The chips are right out of the oven (fryer.....where ever they come from) and are fresh.  My three year old son was with me.  He got a kick out of the koi pond in the front of the restaurant.  I normally do not associate koi with Mexican restaurants........

The food was delicious.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas which were made just right.  The guacamole was as fresh as it comes. 

The ambiance matched the atmosphere.  In addition, a designated parking area in the back.

My only concern was the lack of service in general.
