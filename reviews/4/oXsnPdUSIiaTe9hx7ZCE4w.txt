After a long day in Tempe, I luckily found this place in my Entertainment Book (coupon book) so we thought we'd give it a shot.  When we walked inside, they asked us if we were there for the dancing or the food--they were having salsa classes!  We said the food and I'm glad we did because it was excellent Mexican food.  The fajitas were marinated in lime and the carne asada was also generous.  The beans were excellent, as were the tortillas.  Give this place a try.
