Why did I wait so long to try this! 

This is no typical torta joint!  This place has a plethora (do I get extra points for using this word?) of tastiness on the menu!  Tortas, tacos, ice cream, all these other dessert choices...AND....a little bakery! 

All of their agua frescas are amazingly tasty...not too sweet at all!  I had agua limon and I wanted more!  

Very clean and very friendly service!  Great little salsa bar and just yummy all around!
