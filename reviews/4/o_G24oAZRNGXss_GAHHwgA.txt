This place is definitely underrated! The first time I came here I was a bit skeptical of the quality of food I was going to receive but was pleasantly surprised. 

First off the service has always been great with friendly and attentive waiters. Then there is the salsa, if you ask for the hot...man oh man do you get hot!! I recommend mixing both salsas together and you get the best of both worlds. Lastly, no you aren't going to want to count calories if you come here but in my opinion it is worth the extra exercise after consuming this meal. The flavors in everything I've gotten here were just delicious! Recently, I got the super burrito with chicken and it was so tender and flavorful. Also tried some of my friends chili relleno...bomb.com
