Having gone to the 16th Street location a few times figured it was time to hit Mesa and try the one closest to us. Okay, so you drive through the ghetto, then you hit a nice part by the art center and then ghetto again.. this is definitely a great way to see the cultural diversity of Mesa. Be on the lookout for an old Long John Silvers building and you've found Tortas El GÃ¼ero.. 

Me and the Mr chowed fiercely! Torta Alambre.. steak and bacon sizzled with peppers, onions and cheese all on a toasted roll.. outfuckingstanding! Dowse this big'un in the avocado salsa and  your tummy will be warm and toasty for hours! The quesadilla version, just as awesome! Pastor was amazingly tender and almost as huge as the Alambre! This one dip into the chipotle cream for some spicy creamy goodness! 

Tortas are 4.99-6.60 and they are HUGE, one will do you.. me and the Mr just over order and over eat when we go out.. that's probably why were so fat, and so happy!
