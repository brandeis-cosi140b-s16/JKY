I ate at On The Border which is NOT my favorite Mexican Restaurant by any means. I ordered the Carne Asada which was underwhelming accompanied by a 1/2 cup of veggies and rice and we waited jtoo long for the salad as I had to remind them about it! , what saved this restaurant experiencecwas our sweet, wonderful, polite, delightful waiter NOAH!  What a peach of a guy, who let's the ladies order first and should be grabbed by a PR firm  because this guy has IT!...We had a few other kinks in our food order and timing.  Then the manager came out, whose name I missed, and brought us whatever we wanted and gave us 2 desserts and really cared about us....never was treated so right!  So Cheryl, Vanessa, Dan, Mike, Jason and Hayley send our thanks and we will come back just to see you 2 guys!!  Noah should be the CEO of On The Border!
