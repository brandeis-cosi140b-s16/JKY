Great lunch spot-it is quick and cheap!  I usually go with the Burrito Bowl but do like the soft tacos (you get your choice of 3).  You pick a meat (I always go with chicken but they have steak, pork, etc), beans or rice (white or brown), cheese, lettuce, tomato, salsa choice, sour cream and guacamole can be added (extra charge for the guacamole).  They have take out or seats to sit down inside. It does get crowded for lunch and the lines are long but they move fast.  The ingredients are always fresh and they give nice portions.
