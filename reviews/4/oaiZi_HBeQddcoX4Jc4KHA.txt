I thought I wad going to dislike this place just because it was a casino restaurant but I was dead wrong. The tomatillo and avocado salsa and jalepeno rojo were great! I got the shredded chicken crispy tacos and the shrimp bacon appetizer was awesome too. I saw the fajita plate on its way out to my gf and she said it was really good too.perfect place to take the family.
