Pretty good, darn fresh, and nothing's greasy. The fish tacos are wonderful, the shrimp cocktails are really good, and they serve mulitas, which I've never seen around here or in Detroit.

Mulitas are like a taco/quesadilla hybrid. The standard taco meat, onions, and cilantro is served with cheese between two toasted, taco-sized tortillas. Very nice dish.
