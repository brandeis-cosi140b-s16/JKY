OK, i love this place.. i really do, but as you will read from other Yelpers, its not always the best.. i kid you not, when i first moved to Phoenix i noticed this building,and i have lived in phoenix for 21 years.. finally i went in, and i love it. then i turned 21 and i really loved it!! the margaritas are fabulous!!! the salsa is BOMB! the food,its good, the service..S L O W, but friendly and helpful. but really give this place a try, its good stuff!!!
