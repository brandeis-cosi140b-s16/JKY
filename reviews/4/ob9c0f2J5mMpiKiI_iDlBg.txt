Go about noon on Sunday and there is a mariachi trio.  The Nana's Special for breakfast cannot be beat:  huevos al gusto, ยก the red Chili ! , potatoes/ refried beans and really good flour tortillas.

My out-of-town visitors always request that I take them back.

Note:  I am from San Antonio and cannot rate more than four stars for any Mexican food in Arizona.
