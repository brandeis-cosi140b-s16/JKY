Not really a seafood kind of guy. I'm on the record saying once you cook seafood, it's ruined!

I'll shut up now, thanks to Las Islas. 

First of all, I must say the prices are VERY affordable. $3 beers and full plates that will leave you stuffed for as low as 8 bucks. 

My chimi was gargantuan and very enjoyable...there's no way I could finish this whole thing AND all the sides it came with. I love the beans!

The ceviche tostadas were sweeter than I expected, but they were LOADED and pretty good. 

I had bite of my friend's fish, featured in my photos. Very savory, tons of garlic, thoroughly delicious. 

The atmosphere is also very good. There's a sort of a lounge in the back with the pool table, and lots of live music. You will feel welcomed and you will have fun, especially if you are hanging out with paisas. B-) 

I don't have seafood cravings often, but this is a good place to satisfy them. Just keep in mind that if you don't like seafood, it's cool that there's plenty of stuff without it. What's not cool, however, is that it's all prepped in the same place, and your meal is probably going to taste fishy no matter what. Although I enjoyed my chimi, it was very obviously fried in the same oil as everything else! Minus one star! But other than that, this place is solid.
