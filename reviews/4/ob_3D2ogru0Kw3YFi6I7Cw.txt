Saw it on diner drive in and dives,  it's a dive but a good one.  staff helpful when ordering for the first time.  Should have tried the emerald chicken ,  I got the jade chicken, the black beans were very good and the jerk fried rice was tasty. I even got a cookie with my combo.  The carnitas was average I've had better.  I would go back to eat there again.
