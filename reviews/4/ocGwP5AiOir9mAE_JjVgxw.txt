Gourmet tapas style Central Mexican cuisine that should be keeping Silvana Salcido Esparza up at nights with nightmares of losing her long held throne atop the Phoenix Mexican experience.  
While the restaurant was mostly empty and the execution mildly confusing the menu has all of the right ingredients to make it a Valley standard.  The location and decor aren't too bad either.
