Went here on the recommendation of my bartender as they called last call at the bar on Saturday, and I was not disappointed.  He recommended the Arizona Burrito, which had potatoes and carne asada, among other items, and it was fantastic.  We also ordered carne asada fries, and those were good, too.  Perfect late night Mexican food, though slightly overpriced.
