The Carne Asada Burrito was yummy. We also got some Rolled Beef Tacos as well. Food and service was good, the woman behind the counter was very courteous. The Salsa was just so-so. The Salsa Verde was very runny and not much kick. The Red Salsa was mild at best, with no option for Hot (only one flavor). They had lots of Jalapenos present, but that is a given. The new location seems to do much better for them.
