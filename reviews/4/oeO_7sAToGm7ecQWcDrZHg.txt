Another one of my go to spots for good drinks and fun food.  It gets really busy here, but if you are solo or a twosome, even on the busiest weekend night I have never had to wait for more than a couple of minutes for a drink and a spot to eat either at the bar, the hightops, or a table opens up before I need another one.  

The escabeche is great and I rave about the lamb barbicoa tacos regularly.
