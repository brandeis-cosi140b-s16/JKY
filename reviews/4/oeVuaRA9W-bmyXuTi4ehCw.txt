This place has great food and great prices.
A nice change from the typical Scottsdale fair and not your typical "hole in the wall" restaurant. 
It is clean, the staff is friendly, always the same guys there.
The menu is large, serving both traditional Mexican food as well as Burgers and fries and combinations of both.
The portions are big and the prices are small.
Everything tastes fresh and great.
FYI- The place is packed at lunch time with high school kids. There is usually a place to sit, but for whatever reason (the food, perhaps?), it seems to be the new daytime hangout.
