Great location. About time to have one on the north east side of Vegas. Not a big seating are inside but it works. The employees are wonderful. This one has a special for almost every day of the week.. On Wednesdays are Chicken tacos for 99 cents. I had it. And it was a little dry, had to add alot of green sauce. But it was good. The carne asada burrito in my book was tastier than other robertos. The Steak tasted fresher. So did the pico de gallo.
