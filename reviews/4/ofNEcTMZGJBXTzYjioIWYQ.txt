Being the closest to my house I frequent this one the most. I love their breakfast burritos so that is my go to when visiting Roberto's. They always seem to cook the bacon to that perfect crispness, as it should be and they don't load it up with cheese, just the way I like it. I have tried a few other locations that just do not compare to this one.
