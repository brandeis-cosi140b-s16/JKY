This was my first time here. It is small inside. I ordered for take out.
The prices are fair. I ordered the chile rellano plate, 3 tamales, an order of chips and beans.
The chile rellano was delicious. Huge portion, could only eat half. My husband enjoyed the pork tamales. My favorite was the chips. Honestly the best chips I have had in Las Vegas. They were hot, crispy and perfectly seasoned. 
The service was great. 
I will come back to try more of the good food.
