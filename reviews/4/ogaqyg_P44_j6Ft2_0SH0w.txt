This place is awesome! Everything is fresh and deliciously good! 

I usually have the Rumba Salad with chicken. It's always so refreshing. 

My wife will get the daily special which is a good amount between the items. 

I want to try other items on the menu but I continually go back to the Rumba Salad! 

And their churros are screamin'! Whenever we're in the area we make it point to come here.
