I love this place! 

Great Tex Mex food for sure! 

They have the best shredded beef tacos in all of Vegas, yes they do. I welcome you to try them for yourself!!! 

Also their enchiladas are yummy! 

Portion size is good, always leave full! 

The atmosphere is slightly dark and cozy, also the service is always consistently good! 

Love the free basket of fried whole corn tortillas and salsa and bean dip! Yummo! 

Check this place out you won't be disappointed!!! 

They also have a Cantina for alcohol with gaming as well.
