First time getting lunch, called in a large order for some coworkers. At first, I was skeptical because the lady taking the order was very impatient and kept saying "Okay, is that it?" after each order, which was only 5 orders. However, when we picked up the food, it was amazing. The carnitas burrito was very delicious. Chorizo was a bit too oily but still good. Would be a 5 star rating if the lady taking the order was more welcoming and pleasant.
