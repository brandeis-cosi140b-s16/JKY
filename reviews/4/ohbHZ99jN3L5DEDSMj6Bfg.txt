I was looking for a good drive thru places for tacos within a reasonable distance, and Brushfire didn't disappoint.  We ordered carne asada tacos and pork tacos as well as an order of croquetas. 

The tacos are served on flour tortillas, although you can request corn. They didn't skimp on the filling... My carne asada taco was overflowing with me that I scooped up with a fork. The pork taco was my favorite. The meat was flavorful and the pineapple added just the right amount of sweetness. 
The croquetas were tasty, although I would have liked a little more ham. 

Service was good even though we arrived 10 minutes before closing. My only complaints are that they were out of limes and one of the tacos that I had requested items left of off was made incorrectly.  But I will define be back.
