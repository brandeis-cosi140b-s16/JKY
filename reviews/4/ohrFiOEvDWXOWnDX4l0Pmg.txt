I give 4 stars because this is the best airport food I have ever had, and especially for the price. Most airports offer small sizes and everything tastes processed. 

At Los Taquitos I watched them make my good food, in a timely manner, and it tastes great. The staff was friendly even during a morning rush also! I had the crane Assad breakfast burrito and it was great. Also, you get to choose between red and green salsa if you choose. I chose green and was pleased with it.

I'd recommend this over the McDonalds you will end up spending the same amount at.
