Congrats on your opening!! Arrived at 6pm and told the patio was first come, first serve. Awesome!! Attempted to sit at an empty table, but we were told it was reserved. We did leave our name and number and at 8:30 returned back to four empty tables outside. We did ask to sit down and unfortunately they are booked until 10:30 although these are for walk ins...good luck
