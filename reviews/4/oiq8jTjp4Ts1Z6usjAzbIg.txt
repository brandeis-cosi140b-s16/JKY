YUM.  Hubby and I have a favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix but since we moved to Fountain Hills, we wanted something closer.  I am part Mexican, and I can tell you that this place is GOOD!  Not better than my Phoenix fave (won't say who), but it definitely will be a regular place for us.  The chips were good but I didn't care for that tasteless green stuff (salsa?).  They server got our drink order right (we are picky about that) and we had great service.  I got the taco place with all beans instead of beans and rice.  The whole plate was great!  Overall, a good authentic Mexican food restaurant BUT I would LOVE if they'd incorporate Tres Leches cake into their dessert menu!
