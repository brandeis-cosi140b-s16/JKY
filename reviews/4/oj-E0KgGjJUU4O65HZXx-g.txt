Great Mexican food for a late night on the run, or for lunch.  I prefer the carne asada quesadilla and a coke, but that is my fix at most dive Mexican food places such as this.  The prices have gone up since they moved from McDowell Rd., but they are still very reasonable and still serve good portions.

  It's like many Mexican food trucks...you better know what you want when you go to order or you may be ignored.  I prefer to take it to go as there is very limited seating and it is a food truck so it is outdoor, which in summer means HOT.  Give this place a chance if you're in the area and like the hole-in-the-wall feel (or no walls in this case!).
