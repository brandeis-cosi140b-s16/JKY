Let me start off my review by stating the obvious - this is Taco Bell. You have probably formed an opinion on this fast food chain long ago. This review is location specific.

I will also mention I don't eat fast food often, probably once a month if that. I hadn't had Taco Bell in years but had a sudden craving one day at work so I drove over.

The location is in a new building, and it probably took me more time to decide what to order than it did for them to prepare it. It is great when fast food is actually fast! I sat down and ate my food, which was typical Taco Bell fare, except too much sour cream and off center fillings. It didn't take me long to eat but in that time someone came around and wiped down the tables. The lady sweeping the floor even gave me a polite "have a good day!" as I left. 

As far as I am concerned this is the best Taco Bell can be - fast, clean and friendly!
