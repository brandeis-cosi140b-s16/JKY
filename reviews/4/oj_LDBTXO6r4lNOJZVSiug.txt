Maybe they are still getting up to speed... I have been here at least 5 times since they opened and have had a range of experiences I've been overcharged, they've looked at me crazy when I have asked for extra cilantro and they've skimped a few times, if I am paying $1.90 for guacamole I need a spoon of guacamole. The thing that makes me most sad is the barbacoa. It looks just as sad as it tastes I hope they can fix the recipe soon because that's my fav. Get it together guys I want to give you that last star but you don't deserve it just yet.
