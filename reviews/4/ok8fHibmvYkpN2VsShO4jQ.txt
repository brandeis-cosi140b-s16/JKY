I love a Mexican food place with no pretenses and a $3 set of taquitos. I was starved before my nail appointment at Polished next door, so I stopped in for a quick bite. I ordered the taquitos with the guacamole topping them, and let me tell you, that guacamole might have had some crack cocaine in it because it was so good. It wasn't like traditional guacamoles--a touch more spice and I might even venture to call it an avocado dip vs. a guacamole. But I still liked it. 

I also liked their little drink machine. I had some kind of Hawaiian Punch magical red drink that I adored, despite its sugar and red-40 contents. I don't know if I would return based on its distance from where I live, but it is 24 hours and has a easy breezy simple vibe that is great for food emergencies such as this.
