It was a little hard to find and went past twice!  However, although small, it had nice and a very interesting decor (loved the padded chairs).  The menu was large with very different types of tacos and burros you don't often see.  As mentioned by others,  the salsa bar was excellent with lots of choices with a surprising (and tasty) fruit salsa!  I was slightly put off as we ordered our iced teas at lunch and they were delivered in wax paper cups which was not what you would expect in a sit down restaurant. Then the meal came in baskets like you might get at a Sonic drive-in which was also a little disconcerting.  However, the meal certainly made up for these drawbacks (which in the end is the most important quality!).  We had the lunch plate with a small paper cup of beans and another with rice but believe it or not, I was very full at the conclusion of the meal and even took one of the corn tortilla off one of the tacos as I was 'stuffed'. Overall, I wish they had served on regular plates and regular glasses but the food was excellent. The service was also attentive but not intrusive. Will definitely return!
