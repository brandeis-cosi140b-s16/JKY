This was the first place we at dinner when we got to Vegas last week. I LOVE this place. Their chips and salsa are so delish. So we started out with those and a couple classic margaritas. I ordered chicken flautas and the bf had carnitas!! Wow, the flautas were ok, but the carnitas...they were as good as carnitas you find down on 26th street in Chicago (Pretty Damn Good). They were super moist and were complemented by some guacamole. Mmmm I could eat dinner here every single night. But there's just too many places in Vegas. The price, like I've read, is VERY reasonable! The service wasn't as good as it could be.
