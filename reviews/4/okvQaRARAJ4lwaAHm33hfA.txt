This is a breakfast review.  Found ourselves at the Metro at 9:30am and store not open till 10.  So we went searching  for a breakfast place and found very slim pickings....down to Mimi's and this unknown Mexican place in a 70% empty shopping center.

Wow, we both said "A hidden jewel!"  Maybe we like less spicy than some of you, but we gave our ham and eggs burrito and omelet ranchereo high marks.  Very flavorful.  Big helpings and excellent pricing. Now we need to try it for lunch - we can't believe it goes down to a 2 or 3 star!  And btw, the place was very clean and our waitress was excellent!
