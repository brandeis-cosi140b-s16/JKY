Tacos La Mexicana is the place to go for lunch. For only $5.99, you get four tacos, rice, refried beans, and a small drink. I usually get their chicken and pastor (pork) tacos. The chicken is not particularly seasoned and is more like pulled chicken. The pastor is not the best that I've ever tried, but it is definitely decent. The food in general is tasty, and the price is even better.

I also like their small salsa bar. The red salsas are all delicious, and my favorite salsa is the green one (without seeds). It is packed with flavor and is definitely their spiciest salsa.

Overall, the service, price, and food is great and a must-try!
