I love their fish tacos!!!!  The drive-thru at this location is not always consistent when it comes to efficiency but it does look like they are trying... at least they are nice.  I don't really like the other stuff I have tried here...such as the chicken soft tacos.  Also, for some reason I think it is weird that they serve fries with tacos.   4 stars for the fish tacos!
