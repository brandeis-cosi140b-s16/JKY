I'm having a Scottsdale over dose and loving it!!!!
I love the setting, the place is fun, it was pack and still service was excellent, always checking if I needed a drink (I was sitting at the bar) the staff was incredible friendly and the music was good. I still would enjoyed more if they had a live band, but makes sense its not the kind of place. The drinks were good also, the beer very cold and the cocktails  well served. I will probably become a regular but I have still much discovering to do in Scottsdale!
