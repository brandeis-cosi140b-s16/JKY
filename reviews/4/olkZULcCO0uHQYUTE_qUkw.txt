Even though this isn't the most authentic mexican food, it's still my favorite in Madison.  It's fast and cheap, and pretty flavorful.  I really like their tamales.

My only problem with it is, for some reason, it's always cold in there, and my food is always a tad on the cool side.

I miss the Atwood Ave. location, and hate hate hate the new hilldale location.   The atmosphere there is hideous, and mcdonalds-y, even though it's sit-down.
