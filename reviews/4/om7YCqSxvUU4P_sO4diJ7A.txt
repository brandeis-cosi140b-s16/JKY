Let's see $4 bucks in my wallet and hungry for some lovely asada.. Not possible you say? Then you haven't been to El Pollo Fn Supremo. I love this place. I can smell the meat roasting from blocks away.. You can get 1/4 chicken (that you can rip into with your bare hands) or beef and they pile you up with fresh tortillas, great pinto beans, marinated onions and fresh salsa. You make your own burritos with all this delicious filling mmmmhhhhhhmmmmm. 
Or you can fool your family into thinking you are a grill master and buy an entire chicken (point out how hot it was while whilst grilling when they are chomping down - major points). Seriously! It's so good. They only take cash so either hit the ATM or stand outside and spang for change.. The stoners going in to HQ are pretty vulnerable haha.
