Great place for lunch! 

You're not paying for atmosphere, but great service and good food! 

My business partner and I stopped in for some soup. She ordered the Tortilla, I ordered the Albondigas.
The Albondigas, had 3 large meatballs, but chunks of vegetables in a nice tomato broth. 

We also split the mexican shrimp cocktail. One of my favories, shrimp, cucumber, pico de gallo and avocado emerged in a sweet tangy tomato sauce. Will definitely order again on my next visit.
