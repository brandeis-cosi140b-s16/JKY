The menu has expanded!  Got there early for  dinner meal.  There are only 10 tables in here so you may have to wait at high times.  We were seated quickly, ordered no the food was out in a flash.  We ordered the Marlin fish taco and and Sonora beef taco plates.  The fish taco was juicy and flavorful; one of the best fish tacos I have had.  hUbby also like his steak taco.  The salsas were low, a tribute to their goodness.  Once they got filled up, we helped ourselves to Jicama, guac, cilantro and tomatillo salsa.  tHe guac salsa has a good kick to it so beware.  We ate all the free chips.  Overall a great food experience in the heart of the Barrio.
