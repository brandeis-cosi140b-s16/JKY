I've been here twice now and great experiences both times.  

I'm going to mention the ordering process like every other Yelper before me.  Its odd. Its not what you expect.  I've seen people walk in the door, look around and walk out.  I've seen people walk confidently in, just to be turned around and given a menu back at the door. 

This is how you do it, so you can avoid all the looks. 
1. Walk in the door
2. Grab a menu from the nifty menu holder thats located to the right of the door
3.  Follow the weird beer & wine lined path that leads around the perimeter of the store counter-clockwise until you reach lighting where you can read the menu
4.  Decide what delicious food you're going to get.  
5.  Add Churros to your list.
6. Continue your journey to the registers where you'll speak to the nice employees about what you would like to eat.
7. Tell them your name
8. Find a seat
9. Peruse the hot sauce bar
10. Find your seat
11. Listen for your name to be called and the delicious food to be brought to you.

Phew, 11 steps.  

I've ordered the chicken flauta's both times that I've been here because I like chicken, I like guac, I like queso... therefore this is my food.  I'm hoping that I'll branch out more next time, but odds are I'll get suckered back into ordering my flautas again.

The churros are amazing.  If you followed my list, you will know this.  

I like that the staff is very attentive, you will not want for a refill while you're here.  But if you haven't been here before, and you didn't follow my list (shame on you), it may be a bit confusing at first.  But don't worry, they don't laugh at the newbs.
