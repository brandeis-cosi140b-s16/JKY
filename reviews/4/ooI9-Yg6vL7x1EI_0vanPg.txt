This review will be short and sweet....

There are a few simple reasons why I gave this restaurant 4 stars.  I don't think they are the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, but they do have some good things to offer:

1.  The chips and salsa are excellent...the salsa is fresh and the chips are crunchy.  The chips are NOT greasy, which is a nice change.

2.  They offer balck beans instead of the traditional refried---which I enjoy the option to mix it up!

3.  The veggie fajitas offer REAL veggies, not just a pile of salt with a few onions in a fajita sauce.  They actually have fresh broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, and onions.  Very tasty, fresh and NOT overly salty.  They also weren't drenched in a fajita sauce, so that was awesome.  Finding good VEGGIE fajitas is difficult to do so I always try to make mention of it!!

The service wasn't very good but the atmosphere is nice and the food presents well.  I still think the prices are a little higher than some of the other really good mexican restaurants around town but overall decent option when in a pinch.
