Me and my husband went two nights ago, and at first I wasn't sure it was a good idea, and thought the food wouldn't be so great since it seemed mostly like a bar. To my surprise it turned out great! The food was delicious. I had the chicken chimichanga, and my husband had a soup ( I think it was called Pico) My chimi came with guacamole that actually taste fresh, and like it was made with real avacados that day. My husband described his soup as "authentic mexican food" which is saying something coming for him! The women were so nice, and sweet with our kids, and even gave them a lollipop after. As for the bar scene, it was in another room closed off with a door, I could hardly even hear the music. I thought it was very family friendly.
