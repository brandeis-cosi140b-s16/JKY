This place makes great food. I said great - what i mean is great tasting, not healthy. The first time I came here I had the menudo which I loved and was a perfect portion and for only $5! (sat/sun only) The 2nd time I came here I had a machaca burrito. this is one of the few places that I've ever been to that you can actually order machca without onions. Everywhere else I go they always say, well.. its already pre-made with onions in it so we cant take them out. Mexican food should never be completely "pre-made". That's just not acceptable (yes even Roberto's is included in that)
The 3rd time I came here I ordered the Machaca plate. Now this is where they get one star removed. I had the beans and rice. The beans were thin. yes I know its refried beans but I prefer mine to have more backing to them, as in more beans,less fat. the rice was ok but was kinda bland. My mexican rice has way more flavor than this but all in all it was still good. The machaca was very good flavored (ok lets face it I poured red chile all over it b/c their red chile is one of the my favorites) 

Please note: they also have the super nachos which my bf ordered for himself on one of his trips out there. freakin good. 
oh and b4 i forget they have huaraches. That's how you know its really good mexican food when they have huaraches! 
the bf usually gets their carne asada which is so tender and good. its a must get.
