If you need to relax after work and craving for margarita. This is the place! The bar is small and cute and the restaurant has a homey feeling. The service is friendly. They offer complimentary chips and salsa. 
Las Fuentes offers different flavors of margarita! I tried the mango flavored margarita and I am hooked! The prices of the drinks are okay and they do offer discounted drinks during happy hour.
