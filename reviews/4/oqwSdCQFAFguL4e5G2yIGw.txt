I am addicted to their Gringo Green salsa, which they sell by the pint and the quart.  So delicious!  Their burritos are, as other reviewers have mentioned, a bit on the liquidy side.  My first time here, I had a green ground pork burrito, and it was delicious.  The second time I got a red shredded pork, and wasn't a huge fan.  I haven't had their BBQ yet but it's next on my list.  Friends and the husband have had it and said it is really good.  This place is always packed despite its out-of-the-way location and that it's only been around less than a year...which tells you something!  They also have a lot of regulars, so I'm not the only one who keeps coming back.

I believe they are closed Mondays, FYI.
