Okay, I have been going here almost 2 years off and on, they recently closed there doors for a remodel or upgrade.  There opened again and well I recently went back and only noticed a few changes like a sign out front and they moved the stove around in the kitchen. 1st off the food is Great!  every-time.  If you like real Mexican food not taco bell type Mex! you will like Espos.  The prices are good for the amount of food they give you I order the carne asada combo plate and it comes with a free taco that's enough to fill up a big boy and have your old lady  hurting... But one problem most people face is You cant find the place, first off you would drive right by them and not notice it at all and its on Chandler Blvd. Go figure!!!  Its a family owned spot and even after the remodel it's still a dumpy looking rustic looking, greasy sticky tables and looks as if it could use a real good cleaning. There plain white walls (THAT'S NOT SO WHITE) and plain white painted building attached to a small market just looks dirty (and remember this is after the remodel) i guess they didn't want to change much about the establishment.  But i don't think many people mine that because there always packed with loyal customers.  I eat there too!

-1 point for ambiance !!
