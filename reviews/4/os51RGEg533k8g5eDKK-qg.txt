This is a FAMILY owned and operated business! So few and far between here in AZ. The recipes are homemade, and the Cheese Dip is amazing!  I am very happy with everything I've tried at Los Siete (it was started by 7 friends, which is what the name translates to "The 7 Friends") 

The portions are generous for the price... my husband and I can get 2 meals, margaritas for $20.

The staff is very friendly, and the food is made with love. Very happy to be a proud patron of Los 7 Compadres.
