Checked this place out for a Michelada (which was on their online menu). The bartender didn't know what a michelada was because he gave me a cerveza preparada instead (beer poured over lime and ice with a salted rim). It was still good and nicely cold. He also gave us a free pitcher of beer from an order mistake so that was cool. We only tried the chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty good and tasted homemade and authentic.
