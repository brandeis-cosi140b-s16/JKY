A touristy little joint with good food and a crazy fun atmosphere including dollar wallpaper,  saddle bar stools and a saucy bartender. The only downside is the distance from town. 
Try the snake venom beer and anything Mexican for a great dining experience.  
Don't forget to go next door and try the prickly pear gellato.
