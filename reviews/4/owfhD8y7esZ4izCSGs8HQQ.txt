Went last night to try it out. Love the ambiance of this place. Got there at 8 and was told it was a 45 minute wait. No worries, there is an awesome bar! Grabbed some drinks and managed to catch two seats at the bar as people were leaving. Olivia, our bartender was great! Actually, she made the night for us. She was very attentive to my requests for drinks, tweaking some of the menu items to fit my tastes. She served us for about an hour and then was off the clock but hung around grabbing some dinner for herself. When our new bartender told us that they were out of all of their dessert drinks and couldn't make me anything, Olivia overheard, came back up to the bar and proceeded to make me the perfect nightcap. She asked what I liked about the drinks on the menu and was able to modify and make her own concoction going back and forth to the kitchen to make it just right! Now this is the type of service that will keep me coming back! Food was good. Chips and salsa, tacos and green chili dip. The green chili dip had nice big chunks of meat but lacked any real type of flavor. I had to add salsa and salt to make it decent. Hubby liked it though. If they keep bartenders like Olivia around, this place will do great! Customer service is everything!
