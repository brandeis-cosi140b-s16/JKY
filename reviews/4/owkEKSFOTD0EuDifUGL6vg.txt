Decided to try this restaurant for lunch one day. Read the other reviews and like all other restaurants some good ones and some bad. Took the leap anyways. Glad we did because it wasn't bad at all. My husband had the carne asada quesadilla and he enjoyed it. I had the ceviche tostada and it was very good. The guacamole was a little bland but other than that everything was good. Our server was very good also. We will definitely try this place again so don't count it out in Surprise if you are tired of Macayos.
