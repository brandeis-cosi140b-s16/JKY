The original KoMex location is one of my favourite places to go in the city for delicious eats and friendly service.  This new location is larger and shinier than the original and boasts a bar!  (No drink menu yet though.)  There was even a large, flat-screen TV in the bar area, conveniently situated for those wanting to watch the current sports game whilst enjoying KoMex's fusion delights.  I DID find it odd that there was a large empty space in front of the entrance.  Perhaps the restaurant's order for more tables and chairs was exceptionally tardy?

I'm glad to report that the food is still as yummy as found at the original KoMex.  Service is still friendly, but my server must have been new, because she was on the slow side in responding to requests (we wanted condiments and utensils!).   We still received our free chips/salsa/guacamole and the dessert orange and prices, while slightly higher than in early 2013, are still very reasonable.

All in all, I'm glad there is a second location on the west side, as that is evidence that the owners are doing well!
