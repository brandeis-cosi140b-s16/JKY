Nearly 500-reviews and a 4.5/5.0 review on YELP for cheap tacos in Vegas? I "had" to try this spot on my last Vegas excursion.

=========
LOCATION
=========

It's located at "the edge" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.

Anyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.

Also adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).

THE FOOD
=========

~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5/5)

~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4/5)

~ MULAS - I "think" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4/5)

~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3/5)

~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal "quesadillas." They are a large taco w/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat / toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1/5)


=========
AND SO.....
=========

It was a good spot. 
Definitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had. 

As a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.

I will be back...
