Me and My girlfriend like to go to different lil Mexican restaurants to try there Enchiladas and every time we are left with just a mediocre meal but we thought we will give this establishment a try and The Enchiladas were amazing by far the best I have tasted in Phoenix it had all these flavors like I said AMAZING !!! And the rice was phenomenal! The service was alright kinda felt they didn't enjoy there jobs and didn't want to be there but other than that AMAZING!!!!! I Recommend p.s. Don't sweat the location just lock your doors and go inside lol
