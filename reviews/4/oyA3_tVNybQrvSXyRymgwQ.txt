I had high hopes for Tradiciones, so my husband I paid it a visit for lunch on a Sunday, on our way to grab some groceries at Ranch Market.
First off, after reading some other reviews, I was worried about getting a cold shoulder from the waitstaff -- but nothing could have been further from the truth. Everyone was really nice and the service was great. The mariachi music was awesome, although I'm glad they didn't come over and try to convince us to get a serenade -- I hate that. It makes me uncomfortable...anyhow, the chips and salsa were top-notch. But the meals were just OK. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas had a good green sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they weren't stuffed full of copious amounts of crappy cheddar cheese. Instead they just had *some* white cheese, which was nice. My husband ordered some chicken dish that came with a stew (sorry, can't remember the name). He liked it. We each had a margarita, as I wanted to try the cilantro margarita, but I wasn't too impressed. Granted, for $7, it really packed a punch, but the flavor wasn't too spectacular. Overall, I'd say the atmosphere adds another star to what I would consider a 3-star meal. I'd definitely bring out-of-town guests here, as it's a fun place with decent Mexican food in a town where (sorry, everyone) I find it VERY difficult to find decent, reasonable Mexican cuisine.
