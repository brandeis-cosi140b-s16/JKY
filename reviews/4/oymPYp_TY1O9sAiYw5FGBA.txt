Do not be fooled.


Don't be fooled by what appears from the outside to be a  hole in the wall.  Authentic fare, excellent prices, and good service is what you will find inside this hidden gem.  International House of Food is a no frills restaurant but it is squeeky clean and serves tasty dishes.  The owners work the counter and they are gracious and welcoming.

International House of food serves Breakfast, Chinese, and Mexican entrees it might sound like an odd collection of food but somehow it works. I was impressed with the Al pastor tacos. The meat was tender and flavorful and the tacos had a nice taste.

I think on my next visit I will try a breakfast entr√©e.   I am sure it will be as good as the tacos.
