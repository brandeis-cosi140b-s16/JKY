Went to Spring Training this year and was recommended this place by hotel staff. The restaurant is in a sketchy area so keep that in mind. 

Best part of the meal was the guacamole dip. They make it in front of you and it tastes great. We asked the guy to make it the way he likes to eat it. 

The place is very small and seats about 30. We went on a weekday night and it was still packed. 

I can see why some people say the service is bad. Our guy didn't really converse, and was strictly business per se. I actually liked it in this case, because he was very efficient. 

I'm going to try it again next year, and I might even up it to a 5/5.
