We eat here about every 10 days.  Always for dinner (when it's my night to cook).  Food is good - to - real good.  

Service is way above average because the girl that buses the tables and my family now know each other on sight.  It's that personal relationship that makes it all good.  Next visit I am going to learn her name.

Price is good for the quality and the amount of food we get.

See you again in about 10 days...
