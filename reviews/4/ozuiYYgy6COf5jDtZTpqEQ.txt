Tried their steak sandwich and empanadas for the first time ...umm it was good...i've definitely had better.. steak sandwich was good but it was super super tough to eat. Meaning the meet was super tough to chew but The empanadas were okay my girl is Puerto Rican and she really didn't like it& sandwich was 9$ bucks apiece and empanadas were 3$ I will probably try it again
