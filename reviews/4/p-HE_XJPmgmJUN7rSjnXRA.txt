We just went this week. At first we thought it was closed the lawn hasn't been mowed a fee cars have been sitting there for awhile. But the open sign was on so we went in.

 Ordered pork tacos. These were fresh and so delicious. We also ordered bistec  ala mexicana , there was so much flavor. We were loving the fresh real Mexican food. 

 The salsa they bring to your table is great with chips but salsa maybe a tad warm for some.

 The staff was very friendly and helpful.  We have been here a few times now and have not once been disappointed.
