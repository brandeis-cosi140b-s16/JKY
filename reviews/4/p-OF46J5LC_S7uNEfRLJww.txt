Best cheap margarita in town!! I love the Strawberry Mango blended. 

The food here is always fresh and full of flavor. I love the salsa bar where I can try a different flavors. 

If your hungary this is the place to go. From quesadillas served on pizza trays to the Giant Caramba burrito smothered in red sauce. It doesn't get much better then this. This is the first place I have had fundido sauce served cold, but it works well with the hot chimi's.
