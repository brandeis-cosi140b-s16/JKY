Had the chicken tacos with rice and beans. Really loved the rice and beans. The crunchy tacos are really good too! They were out of diet soda. Was kinda bummed about that. Hot sauce is ok. Sopillas are really flat and chewy unlike the normal fluffy soft ones I'm use to. Staff is super friendly. I guess they just changed ownership.
