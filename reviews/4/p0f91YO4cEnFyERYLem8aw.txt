Dos Reales has always been great whenever I've gone there.  Service is always fantastic.  The food comes out fast and the waiters usually refill your drinks, chips, and salsa really speedily.  Also, one time my friend's mom had our waiter write down a bunch of Spanish swear words (she's a teacher and has some Spanish-speaking students) and he complied.  I think the guy got a pretty generous tip for that.

Their food is real cheap and delicious, too, especially the combos.  I always get the number 11: enchilada, burrito, and a taco for about $6.50.  Tasty!  Admittedly, I haven't tried many of the other items on the menu because the combinations are just such a great deal.
