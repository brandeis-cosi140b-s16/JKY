Good food for a fast food joint.  The staff is usually very cool (I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on one of them), the prices aren't the cheapest out there but the quality is generally good, and the daily $1 deal usually rocks.  

Add to that the free salsa bar with assorted goodies....I've rarely been let down.
