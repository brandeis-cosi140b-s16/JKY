This is a great quick and easy burrito place. It's attached to the circle K gas station and makes it convenient to grab a snack if you're in a rush. 

Food is always good for a quick little joint like this. Not overly greasy or anything. The horchata is delicious and one of my favs! Everything we've had there has been good. 

They also have corn tortillas and can make things relatively gluten free, if you aren't concerned about contamination or trace ingredients. 

The cash only is a bit annoying, but hey its right next to a gas station which has an ATM inside..sooo not too bad. 

Give this place a try if you're in the mood for some quick mexican food
