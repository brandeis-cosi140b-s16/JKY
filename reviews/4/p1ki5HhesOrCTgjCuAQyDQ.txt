Went there for a breakfast burrito and I must say it was delicious.  In my opinion,  best one in the neighborhood. Ordered the bacon, egg, and potato and had them add beans n cheese. It weighted about 2 lbs. Salsa was great too. Will be back again.

There was a bit of wait but well worth it. They seem to stay busy with the bakery and all!
