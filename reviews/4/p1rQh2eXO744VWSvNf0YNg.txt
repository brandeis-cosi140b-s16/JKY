I came here after reading a friends review (thanks Lindsey) and we we were definitely not disappointed!

I told my fianc√© I had a new place to try for date night and you could imagine his confusion/excitement when Google Maps took us right to the front door of The Sapphires Gentlemen's Club...

Once he got over the fact that we weren't going to have naked women dance on our laps he led me into El Dorado.

When we walked in the place was pretty empty besides one or two other small groups but when the Host found out we didn't have a reservation she told us it would be a fifteen minute wait? I was truly confused due to how open it was but before I could protest she offered us a seat at the bar since there was no wait and it was happy hour, and I do love a good happy hour!

Our bartender was nice and quick to get us a couple $5.00 Margaritas (strong and decent sized for happy hour pricing).

You have to try their street tacos. There's no other option in my opinion. $2.00 per taco for happy hour and they are so packed full of gorgeous flavors and so full of meat, they were a steal for that price! 

Between the both of us we tried the chicken, carnitas, and al pastor street tacos.

Chicken- 5/5
Al Pastor- 5/5
Carnitas- 15/5

Best carnitas taco I have ever had! Probably in my life and I've lived basically steps away from TJ.

I would have gotten another round but my tummy was to filled with Margaritas and Carnitas for even one more bite!

We will definitely be returning for happy hour!
