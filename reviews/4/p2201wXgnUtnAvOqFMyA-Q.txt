Went there with my buddy who loves this place and I was impressed.  I loved all the food but my entr√©e which had pork was a bit dried out but still good nonetheless.  I know they have a place in socal so I'm going to give that one a try.  The beans are awesome and the fresh tortillas and salsa are great too.  You will spend some $ though be prepared.
