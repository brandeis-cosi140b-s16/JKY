Los Cabos is great! Definitely one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh. I have been eating at Los Cabos for years and they never disappoint. Their food is true authentic mexican food, always delicious and never greasy. Service is always good and food comes out fast. And their prices are very reasonable. 
Some of my favorite dishes are the tilapia fish tacos, the potato taco which comes in a hard shell taco, the fish burrito, chips and salsa (salsa is a bit spicy), and their rice and beans are the best I've had. 
Great for dining in or taking out. They also have outside seating which I go to a lot with my dogs in the summer. 
If you haven't eaten at Los Cabos you're definitely missing out.
