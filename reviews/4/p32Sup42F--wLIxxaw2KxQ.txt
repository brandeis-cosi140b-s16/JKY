It is what it is, DON'T JUDGE ME.

I just moved to Central Phoenix and one of the first things I looked for was the nearest Del Taco (which I admit is pretty pathetic considering all of the great food options near my house). I used to live in Tempe and there was a location at University and Rural that I used to frequent on late nights for the longest time. Sadly, it's been closed and replaced by some random chicken place.

Went here twice the past weekend. Love those veggie burritos with the red sauce! I also tried some nachos-wouldn't really recommend it. Super fast & cheap, great for a quick lunch or dinner-which is exactly the point.
