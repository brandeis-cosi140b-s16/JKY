I flew into town and decided to head over for the famous los reyes torta.  I've been to the one on 7th st after it being on the food network.  Both have great torta, chips and salsa.  The menu is huge and the selection can satisfy anyones craving.  Great place to come hang out and have some authentic Mexican food.  I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town
