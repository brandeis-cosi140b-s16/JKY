The food here is consistent and the place looks clean, can't ask for much more.  I usually end up with the chicken, sometimes the pork..both are good.  I like that they have corn.  I wish Chipotle would add one more thing to their topping options, but I'm not exactly sure what.  Maybe jalape√±os?  I'm not sure, but if someone from Chipotle corporate happens to read this I am happy to help you figure this out.  Holler.
