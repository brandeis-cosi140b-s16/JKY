Great portions if you are hungry or want to share. It gets pricey if you want extra guacamole or a beverage. The average meal is $10.00 
I don't mind spending this much on a meal because the quality is there. The ingredients are fresh and the service is almost always fast (unless a large to-go receipt prints out when you walk up to order.)
