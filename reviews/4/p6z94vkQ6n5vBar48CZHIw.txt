Think Joyride minus the hipsters. First thing you notice when coming in is the nice layout. Whether you like sitting inside or outside, they have it all.  It is a pretty big restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. Their menu has many options. The burritos here are good. The staff is friendly. They have lots of big TVs which is something I appreciate in a restaurant. Joyride has better food but this place has a better restaurant. If only they could take the best of both. I would go back.
