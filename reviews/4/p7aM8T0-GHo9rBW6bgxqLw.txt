In general, I usually love Chipotle. And the food was as good as it always is. But on a recent Thursday at 1:30, I was told they are OUT OF MARGARITAS?!?!? What? What? What? Dang. I would've gone to a "real" mexican food place if I had known that. The drink was my main reason for going out to lunch today and Chipotle has a margarita recipe that is Very Good .. and reasonably priced. I was disappointed on this particular visit.
