In Verona there are far too few options for Mexican food, and Cuco is the closest around. My experiences are mostly that of take-out lunches, and for that they're pretty solid. Reasonable pricing and the staff is pretty friendly. The quality of food is average with that of a Laredo's. The speed at which everything is made is quite good - take out orders are a 10 minute wait, and sit-down meals take about 10 to 15 minutes to cook. It all tastes pretty decent and the building itself looks alright. Plenty of seating all around and a fairly nice bar for Verona.
