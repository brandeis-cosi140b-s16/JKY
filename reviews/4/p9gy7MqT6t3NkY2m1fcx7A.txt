Outstanding food! The pork belly melts in your mouth and the wings on the starter list are amazing! Also worth tasting is chorizo and shrimp starter- with harissa- it's spicy but yummy!  For main dishes the short rib is great- moist and flavorful. Also worth mentioning is the vegetarian option - it came with portobello mushrooms which were marinated and prepared perfectly. If you are a bread pudding fan I'd stay away- it was a bit on the dry side but the Vietnamese Coffee is savory and a great dessert.
