I'm in Charlotte for a week.  I have no problem eating this for dinner every night... but my waistline will!

Tons of tasty food for a really good price.  Wow!  Solid rice & beans served with a side of cole slaw -- and this was the SIDE to my entree (tamale/chile rellano/enchilada combo).  Today was takeout, but tomorrow -- going to try the dine-in option!!!
