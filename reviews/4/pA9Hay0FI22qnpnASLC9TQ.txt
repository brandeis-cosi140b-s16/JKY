First visit. Great location. Next to Montauk. Has a small dedicated parking lot with 9-10 spaces. 
Service was great (Taylor was very helpful with menu choices). Brussels sprout nachos are a house specialty and real good. Portion is enough for 4-6 people. Had the poke - it was just ok. Needs more tuna and less fillers. 
Great patio but we ate inside as it was too hot. 
Nice happy hour menu too. 
We'll be back !
