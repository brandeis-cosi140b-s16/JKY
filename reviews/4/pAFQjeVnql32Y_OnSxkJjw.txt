good service, nice size carne asada tacos!

magarita was okay not amazing, could've used less juice and more alcohol..but I'm not the bartender here.
 
Didn't see the price, but $2 tacos on Tuesday and a $8 degree Margarita in the middle of downtown tempe is alright w/me!

Ill come back here and continued to bring outta-town friends..
