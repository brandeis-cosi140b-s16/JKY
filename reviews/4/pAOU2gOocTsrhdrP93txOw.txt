So what awesome things can I say about Del Taco? Well its cheap! And they have yummy crinkle fries!! So normally when I go I get the number 1. Its 2 classic tacos (minus the tomatoes) some crinkle fries, and I usually get a diet coke or a cherry coke! YUM!!

I've tried some other items, the quesadillas are ok, and the chicken soft tacos are yummy. But if youre like me, simple, but want a little more taco get the classic!! Its only .99 and it has a ton of meat and cheese!!

Its great thats its open late and they have a drive through!! Also, they ALWAYS have coupons!! Alas, I never use them : (

Its cheap, yummy, and something quick when you're hungry : )
