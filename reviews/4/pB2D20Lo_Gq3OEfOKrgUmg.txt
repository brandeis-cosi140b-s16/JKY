I thought Yolos was great!
The margarita I ordered was literally the size of my head....ok my head is small....but still....

We started with the Guacamole. They make it fresh right at your table!
It was excellent....perfectly seasoned with all the right flavors. 
The tortilla chips were hot and fresh and the salsa was nice and spicy. For my entree I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Fajitas. The Portobello Mushroom came served on a hot, sizzling skillet cut into strips. It was so meaty and delicious! They served the fajitas with cilantro rice and black beans....SO GOOD!
For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake. I didn't really care for the cheesecake but the lava cake was good. My favorite part about the desserts was the home-made cinnamon flavored whipped cream that came with them. That was something really special.
I would definitely recommend Yolos! Food and service were excellent!
