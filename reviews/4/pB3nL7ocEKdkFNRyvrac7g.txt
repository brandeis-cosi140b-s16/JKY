Me and my husband ate here for the 1st time. It was lunch time and we were hungry.  I think this resaurant used to be a diner because it has a diner feel to it but they redecorated it well. We were seated in a booth and it was comfy. We had chips, salsa and bean dip and they refilled it when we were out. Yay! I had the chicken flautas and it came with beans and rice. What is really nice about this menu is that most of the dishes come with guacamole and sour cream. Not many restaurants just give that out. The food was so good, I can't wait to come back.

The restaurant is very clean. There is a bar inside with no gambling.
This is located in the Albertson's lot on buffalo at vegas.
