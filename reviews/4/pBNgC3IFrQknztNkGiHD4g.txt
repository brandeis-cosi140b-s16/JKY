I wasn't surprised to see this place was 24 hours, on first glance it just looked like a Mexican place crammed into an old burger spot. But I'm more than happy with my California burrito (which includes french fries and guacamole), but I had to request beans.

Big, like a good burrito should be and help-yourself chips and salsa. I'd definitely eat here again. (and I can imagine having to convince whoever I'm bringing here, yeah, it doesn't look like much--but it's good!)
