This only gets 4 stars because I love the food.

Went there to get a bowl to-go for lunch today.  There was an extremely long line that wrapped around back toward the cashier.  The line moved fairly quickly, so I didn't mind.  In front of me was a tall, bigger guy who ordered a bowl with chicken.  Then I ordered my bowl with chicken.  Here's the part I don't get--I understand that you're super busy & all, but how come the big guy, who looks like he could eat less, get a bigger scoop of chicken than me, this little Asian girl who looks like she could use some more food?  Shouldn't the restaurant serve equal portions?  Where's the consistency?  And efficiency!  Just think--if a customer orders double meat, but the server scoops two big scoops that amounts to like three regular scoops or more, that is one less customer they can serve.

And then they skimp on the guacamole scoops.  If I'm going to pay an extra $1.80 for just a scoop of guacamole, I deserve a full scoop!
