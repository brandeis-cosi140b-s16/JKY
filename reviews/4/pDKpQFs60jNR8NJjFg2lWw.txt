Used to come here late night after clubbing with my sisters all night, the memories!!! I always got the double del cheeseburger... Seething about that Del sauce!!  Now a days, I'm much more of a taco gal. Never disappoints me though, their C.S is meh, but they get my order correct so that's a home run for me.
