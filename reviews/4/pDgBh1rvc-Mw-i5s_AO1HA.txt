I suppose I'm mildly surprised that I'm the first reviewer here.  Am I missing something?  

I mean, the place seems nice enough.  It's in a big market that seems popular.  

Ah, what do I know?  I'm just a guy from out of town that happened to try this place out on a whim on a Wednesday evening when a lot of the local choices were closed (such as Carolina's which was my first choice).  

I'm here to say that this place is pretty darn good.  I loved my Carne Asada burrito.  That thing had more meat in it than any burrito I ever had.  Literally, it was almost all meat.  No rice, some beans, a bit of cheese, and a ton of steak.  If that makes you happy, this will make you happy.  I even loved the little side of rice they gave which was a little more mild than you might expect, but I liked it that way.  

I loved the chips and salsa, very fresh.  I tried a shrimp taco too, and found it good although the fried shrimp was a little tough and chewy.  That probably kept it from 5 stars there.  

And the price couldn't be beat.  The burrito plate with a couple of tacos, and the free chips with salsa all came out to $13 total.  At least for this out of towner, I considered it excellent.  

Maybe there are better places and I'll find those next time.  This place satisfied my Mexican jones just fine, thank you!
