Okay so I am a huge fan of Moe's.  I have been to a few Moe's and this one lives up to the others reputation.  Maybe the only reason I like this one more than the others is due to the fact that this one is newer and not as crowded most of the time.

Most Moe's I go to have tons of kids and families and this one didn't have much of that.  It was quiet, clean, and personal.  I went on a Sunday at dinner time around 1pm and it was perfect pick me up toward the end of the weekend.  I recommend any Moe's but your in the area, and love Moe's you might want to check this one out.
