Had excellent enchiladas here and the blackened ahi salad was crisp and cool and fresh. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the live music.  Had no problem with service or length of wait as some others have. Our server was attentive and the ambience was lovely. The kids meals are $7 with the bean and cheese burrito being their favorite. Will come back if I'm ever in Lake Las Vegas again.
