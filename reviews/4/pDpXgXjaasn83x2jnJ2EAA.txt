Just like some of the other reviews you wouldn't think this place has good Mexican food, its small and busy. But man o man the food wow! Some food stuff. We will be returning to this location. We live in Chandler, but we were heading up to Anthem to shop at the outlets. My wife wanted a place with good salsa and chips. So, I jump on yell looking for "Mexican food near me" a few popped up, then I went into the subjects people commented on. And this place everyone mentioned the complementary chips and salsa. So we went. My wife, mother and my 3yr old son. My son lived the rice and beans. My wife loved the rolled tacos and the chimis. Mmmmm.... We will be back. Thanks.
