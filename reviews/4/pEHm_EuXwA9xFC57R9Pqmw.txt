I think this is one of the most authentic Mexican taco shops around......I've never had anything I don't like. Plus, they keep things very clean inside. 

The burritos are HUGE, even the tacos are pretty big. The tortillas are *perfect* and the refried beans are sooooooooooo good!! (the fish tacos too!)  I love that they have free chips and a salsa bar with cucumbers and radishes (a typical taco shop thing) They offer different specials, just be sure to read the hand written pappers taped above the cash register. 

This place isn't anything fancy, but the food really is good....and it's cheap!
(fair warning: don't come here on a diet, haha)
