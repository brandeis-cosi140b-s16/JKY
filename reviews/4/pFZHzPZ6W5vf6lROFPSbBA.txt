My roommate and I stopped by here  on a Saturday night with my groupon to see how this Fuego is holding up. I've been to Fuego Bistro before, and it was amazing, so this one at CityScape had a lot to live up to.

I'd say this place gets less than 5 stars based on atmosphere. The place kind of feels like a cafeteria and the vibe from the entire patron situation is just bleh. The best part about the atmosphere was my own company and that of our server, Brandon, who was really helpful and chatty.

Also, while my roommate got the Chile Relleno, which was okay in my opinion, I had the Fuego Tacos with pernil (which apparently is pork), and they were delicious. I absolutely loved and devoured them. 

Some other key points: The drinks were very tasty and parking is very easy. We parked at a meter (which is free after 5p), and I'm told they can validate the parking ticket for the underground parking.

Overall, I'd come back here. I wouldn't go here for a sexy date or if looking for something fancy, but definitely for a tasty dinner with great service.
