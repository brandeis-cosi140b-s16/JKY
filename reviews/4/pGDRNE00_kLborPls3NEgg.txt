We always have great service here.  The manager has gone out of his way to a few times, made us fresh spicy HOT salsa and has made my GF sangria numerous times when the other bartenders can't "do as good as job as him".

We have had some meals that one dish might not be up to par as the others, but over all the food is good.  The daily specials are great.   

This place is way better then what was previous here El Jefe....
