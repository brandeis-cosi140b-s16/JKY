We picked this place based on the Yelp reviews and I have to say it was pretty good. I'm not a huge authentic Mexican food fan and this was definitely authentic but it was good. I had the Barbacoa taco, the chicken taco, and the carnitas taco. All were good and everything is home made at this place. We also ordered the flautas appetizer which was also good, however the dinner portion was brought out instead of the appetizer. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was their salsa. I was definitely looking for more heat in it and that is just a personal preference. You could tell that it was made with fresh ingredients there. The guac was good had a good lime zing to it. My boyfriend had the same thing I did minus the chicken taco. He decided to try the beef tongue taco instead and he really liked it!!

There was a small altercation about a check between another customer and the owner. Mostly it was the customer yelling in spanish and the owner gracefully trying to accommodate him. After the customer left the owner came over to apologize and inquire about out meal. He was so nice and gracious and honestly made us feel really good about supporting a local mom and pop establishment. Without us even mentioning it he questioned the flautas order saying he wasn't sure which we wanted so he erred on the bigger portion but only charged us the appetizer rate. Really nice family run business who will treat you very well :)
