24 HOURS! It's solid. I moved from California 9 years ago & found Super Burrito superior to any berto this or berto that. Affordably priced for budget I would recommend 3 rolled tacos with cheese & gauc or 5. I love the chicken taco combo plate. 2 chicken tacos beans and rice at a great price. Try the salsa verde aka green salsa seriously flavorful, all the salsas are and they have a salsa bar inside. I always hit the drive thru though, seems to always be fresh and good service. If you want a complaint it would be hard but I would say that they used to make the best California burrito in town. When they used fresh cut potatoes. Somewhere along the line they change to these "fries like" more greasy potatoes and I loved the old version so much I just can't even order the California since they changed it. If management or ownership reads this, I would rally call, ok beg, to bring the fresh cut potatoes back to the California burrito Please? The rice is great, little cut carrots and what not add some extra color and flavor. The bathrooms are not great, it's a drive thru, after hours taco shop, so if you need to go you probably should just be happy they have one there. The bottom line is there is no complaints about the food or the hours of operation. It's worth trying out. It's one of the few after hour spots in Scottsdale you can get a decent meal.
