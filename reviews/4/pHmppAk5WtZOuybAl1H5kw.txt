We tried this place for the first time on Monday night.  DELICIOUS!  I had the Tres Enchiladas and one of their margaritas.  The server was very sweet and the food came out in a timely manner.  

The only downfall is that on the Kids Eat Free app, this place is listed as a Monday night choice.  They do NOT offer kids eat free.  The server was apologetic and explained that they are taking that off their website.  

They had a great happy hour and I can't wait to go back.  There were about five other dishes I wanted to try..
