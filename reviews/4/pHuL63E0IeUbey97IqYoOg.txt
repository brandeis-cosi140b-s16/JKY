I don't want to compare it to Chipotle, but I sorta have too. It is direct competition. They both are fighting over similar markets, so what makes Moe's different from Chipotle. I am not going to say which one is better because they both offer different experiences. 

Moe's has more have a selection of menu items (especially in the Vegetarian area). I love that. I tried the personal trainer salad, which is like a vegetarian taco salad. It was really good, minus the fact that I had to pay extra for guacamole :(

The environment was awesome. I love the fact that they don't play top 40 hits.
