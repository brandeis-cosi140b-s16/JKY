I have been super curious about this place since it opened a while ago. I suggested to a friend to meet up there one night recently- there was some sort of daily special with $3 tequila shots (I'm not sure the exact deal). Now I'm not a big tequila fan, but I love Tex Mex and it seemed to be something different. I walked in and I absolutely love the decor. I had seen it from the street biking by many times, and the way it's lit and the colors- it seems very high end and inviting. I'd love to come back another time on a date or dress up and go with a couple of friends. My friend and I go to the bar and take a look at the menu. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety of the menu and the extensiveness of the food and beverages. I couldn't believe they did lunch, brunch with a plethora of good looking dishes and drinks. And of course its claim to fame is supposedly having a larger tequila selection than any other restaurant in PA, which is definitely the highlight here. The bartender was very knowledgeable about the different types of tequila (as they should be), and he helped us select 3 or 4 small shot samples to try. The quality of the tequila was incredible- ranging from smooth to smokey, some with incredible flavors- not at all what I had experience drinking before. The chips and salsa were incredible, and- most importantly to me (!)- the guacamole was delightful! I fully admit my subjectivity when reviewing Mexican or Tex Mex restaurants, because I tend to judge/rate them by the quality of the guac. One drawback I have about Verde is that the menu is pretty expensive, probably a bit too expensive for the dishes they made. I will definitely go back for another meal and hopefully the brunch sometime- it seems that most people here have good things to say about it.
