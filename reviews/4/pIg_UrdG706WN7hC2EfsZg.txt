If you're a fan of avocado...you better make a point of going here for lunch!  That by far was my favorite part!  I had the quesadilla and my mom had tacos.  Both were loaded with meat, cheese and avocado!  All the good stuff. 
Cheap prices...$3.00 for a taco.  Little bit more than Del Taco or Taco Bell.  This is "fast food" but it tastes more home made.
Not a fan of the music...Mexican mariachi.  We just ended up sitting outside so it wasn't a big deal.
Pretty tasty...I'm sure we'll be back.
