Small family owned place with great food.  I had a the grand burrito with beef, sour cream, guacamole, rice and beans inside and it was awesome.  The beef was a healthy portion of super moist and tasty pot roast.  It was covered in a delicious red ranchero sauce which completed the great taste.

My wife had chicken in a sour cream sauce with chipolte served with rice, beans and tortillas and she enjoyed it as well.

The service was quick and friendly and we will certainly eat there again.
