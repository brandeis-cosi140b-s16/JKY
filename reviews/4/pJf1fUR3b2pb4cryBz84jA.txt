4.5 would be best! My mom and I shared the Pozole and chicken tortilla soup. My mom also got a shredded chicken street style taco. I think I got all cactus because I didn't like it but my mom did. The soups were amazing!! My mom also got a lemontini drink that was fantastic! Our server Megan was awesome! She recommended other good restaurants in town to try and was very attentive.
