For tasty, quick ,and cheap Mexican food this is the place. There aren't many restaurants in this area, so if we're looking for something close to home that won't take all night or break the bank  El Valle fits the bill. 

The servers have always been polite, efficient and accommodating. It surprised me that someone else said that they received terrible service here (FWIW I have never seen any female servers - maybe it was a different restaurant?). 

I love their pico that comes with the salsa and chips you get as soon as you're seated, and their pitchers of margaritas are tasty and fairly cheap.
