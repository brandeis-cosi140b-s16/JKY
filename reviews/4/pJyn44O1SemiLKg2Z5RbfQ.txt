I have never actually been inside, I hope it is better than the sketchy outside, but they produce some darn good tacos!

I was helping friends move and they picked up tacos for us to eat for lunch....the al pastor were my favorite, tender, flavorful and perfect in those warm corn tortillas with a squeeze of lime.  I like the carne asada also, but the pastor were by far the best.

We also got some sort of carne asada Mexican pizza, I was excited to try it, but it didn't really live up to my expectations, I thought it was a bit dry.

I need to venture back and go inside (but only in the daylight) and check out what other treasures they have hiding on their menu.  I have heard the fish tacos are amazing!
