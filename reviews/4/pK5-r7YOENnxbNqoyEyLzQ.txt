Kenny L. has been obsessed with Carne Asada fries since forever. 

Seriously.

I've heard the glory of carne asada fries and the need to go to San Diego to get them for must of the 4 years we've dated.

For the uninitiated, carne asada fries are like cheese fries with carne asada on top. Or nachos made with fries. It's an easy enough concept, but we haven't see it any place lately.

So when we were in PHX for a wedding and stopped into Filiberto's for a snack, he was thrilled to see Carne Asada fries on the menu. And I was thrilled to have his multi-year craving satisfied for a while.

The fries were good - crispy, not soggy under the load of the toppings. The meat was flavorful, and with the salsas, it became delicious.

The space is nothing special. I think it's probably been 5 different restaurants, and the current owners didn't make any improvements. But the food is good. 

And they had Kenny L's beloved carne asada fries.
