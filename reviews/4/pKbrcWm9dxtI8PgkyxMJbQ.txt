This place is a good taco place.  If you are dining in they have a waitress so it kind of feels like a sit down restaurant.  I ordered the Carne asada tacos and al pastor tacos.  Both the meats were excellent, not too dry and packed with flavor.  The horchata was also good.  My husband had the cilantro steak fries and those were good except there was way too much cheese on the fries.  Other than that everything was delicious.  The salsa and limes were fresh, the service was good.  This will be our new taco place
