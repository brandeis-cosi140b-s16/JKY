This is a really great local spot owned and ran by locals. Great outdoor space with corn hole, fire pits, kids area and even beach volleyball. The food is really good and Art the chef is great. The service was really good and I will definitely being going back! 
I ordered three different tacos steak, chicken and fish. The steak was my favorite! Art even brought me out a tasting of his marinade.... Fantastic. There are 4 salsas I liked the chipotle and tomatillo. The chips have a 17 spice seasoning and are delicious... I ate two bowls worth.
