Ahh, Rubio's. The husband have a standing Taco Tuesday afternoon date with you, and you don't disappoint!

This particular Rubio's is my favorite, mainly because of the staff. They're always smiling, in a great mood, eager to help and quick to get your tacos ready. They have my favorite salsa (roasted chipotle) and some kick-butt fresh made chips. 

Try: Chicken Taco Plate. Grilled chicken, GUAC, lettuce ... YUM!
