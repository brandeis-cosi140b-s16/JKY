Chipotle is good. We visit this restaurant every so often, and two times in the past week. We haven't had any problems. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, which makes Chipotle stand out. The employees here have listened and aren't stingy with the amounts, but also do a good job when you say to add a little of something. I'd certainly rather eat here than the other icky fast food places nearby!
