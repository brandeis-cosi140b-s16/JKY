Escobar's, believe it or not, was my very first taste of Cuban food.  And, O-M-G.  The Cuban sandwich?  Forget about it.  Spoiled me forever on a taste that... you just couldn't get _anywhere_.  As a matter of fact, my next trip to Miami, I actually hunted down as many Cuban sandwiches as I could find.  Sure, there were some more authentic, and sure, there were some a little cheaper (you know the nature of street food), but Escobar's did the thing proud, man!

Now, I can say that I've not always had the best service in this place, especially when it comes to getting served.  I also found things a little dingy!  The place could use a facelift (or two). =))

All-together, though, a nice place to enjoy a little cultural infusion and ham! =D
