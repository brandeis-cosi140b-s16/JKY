Um really, 2 1/2 stars for this joint?!?  I'm shocked just shocked!  I noticed their Smithfield location is 4 stars, and this seems more inline with what I think.  However I'm reviewing here, because this is the location that I frequent most, since it's only a few blocks from my workplace.  

This is my group's place, at least once a week!  The hot fresh salty chips with the spicy cilantroyee salsa is muy yum!  Table side guac, yes please... with extra jalapenos.  This is most certainly a lunch place, the service is fast & efficient, and the food is fresh & yummy.  I have eaten here for dinner before, and they are not known for their alcoholic drinks, and aren't uber busy during those hours.  I would stick to their lunch hour to be guaranteed a fantastic AUTHENTIC new Mexican meal.  Must tries: TABLE SIDE guac, chicken enchiladas with just about any sauce, quesadillas, and their taco salad.  MUY MUY YUM!
