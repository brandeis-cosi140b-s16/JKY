Inca salad with shrimp, a side of guacamole and some nice local white wine made for a perfect light dinner after a long flight to Phoenix. 

The waitress reminded me of Amy Poehler, so I could overlook a few oddities. For example, I noticed something floating in my wine. She identified it as a piece of foil wrapper from the wine bottle. .... Long Pause .... Then she offered to replace the wine. The pause was so long and I felt like I am in a SNL sketch. So I said "no no it's okay" and I fished the piece out with my fork. Later I ordered a second glass and it looked like a generous pour.
