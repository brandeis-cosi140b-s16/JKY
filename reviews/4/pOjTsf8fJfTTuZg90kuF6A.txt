This place is always a good time. You can expect a good crowed and fairly inexpensive drinks. The staff is good at being quick with your orders. Once you get a little liquid courage in you they also have a decent dance floor. When the night winds down they have a kitchen with a decent menu to take care of those cravings. If your on the westside be sure to check this place out.
