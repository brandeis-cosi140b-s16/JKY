I needed a quick dinner before a concert last night and really wanted salad.  I also wanted to stay close to UNLV, since that's where the concert was last night.  Ok, let's trek over to Chipotle's and reacquaint my mouth with their offerings.  Got a chicken salad sans rice but with guac and the hottest salsa and hey, it did the trick.  Service was fast and friendly -- there was hardly anyone in the joint last night at 6:30pm -- and yes, it may be a bit pricy but they claim to get their ingredients from legit places.  I'm down with that.

Tip: if you're craving a margarita, try one here.  It's pretty good and it works fast.  :)
