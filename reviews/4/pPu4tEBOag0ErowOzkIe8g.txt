I have driven past this place on East Carson Street countless times and always catch myself looking inside at how lovely the atmosphere is.  I decided to stop one Friday evening and try it out.  I was greeted by a friendly host and decided to sit at the bar.  Alyssa took very good care of me and the group I was with. We had made it in time for their awesome happy hour specials that run from 5-7 pm. She was very sweet and attentive. With her recommendation I tried one of their specialty drinks, the captains hurricane which was delicious and my friend decided on a strawberry mango yinzerita, which also was a great choice!

We tried out the dip trio as an appetizer, which comes with queso(delicious with a little spice to it), guac and your choice of salsa. Loved all of these. 

Fajitas are a go-to of mine so I tried out the chicken ones here.  Came out in a timely manner, Portion was plenty to fill me up, and they were very tasty! 

I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor inside.  I was pleased with my experience here and I most definitely will be back for another visit with friends.
