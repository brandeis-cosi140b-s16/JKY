The actual food was great. The presentation was thoughtful. The guacamole was bland and salsas could have been better. The chips suck! (I like them thick, crispy and with a little flavor). But overall for the happy hour price it was on point. It didn't take long for the food to come and it was all correct. 
The server and staff were friendly and seemed to enjoy their job. Although he did say he did not receive benefits. 

We ate outside since we had our dogs with us, but I did go inside and check it out. The setting was nice, and tables and booths were not on top of each other. I really like that! The  restaurant and women's' restroom was clean, however some things seemed to be poorly organized for them not being very busy. 

I would definitely revisit. I think it's a great place for a date, nice night out or daytime.
