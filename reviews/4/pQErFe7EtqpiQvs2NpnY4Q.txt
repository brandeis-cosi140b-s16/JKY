On our way out of Vegas we were both getting kinda hungry, so why not stop and eat Mexican food? Each time i think about trying to eat Mexican food outside of San Diego i kinda question it. No doubt SD has the best Mexican food on EARTH! Then again this is Vegas so i wasn't too surprised when they got it right. 
We walked right up and were seated right away. The place was a little packed, the Packers vs. Bears! a nice positive vibe in the place for sure. 
It took a while for us to get our waters and to even be approached by our server but after that i think the service got a good grade. I've had better, but then again the place was busy so I'm fair! =) 
For starters they offered up some fresh chips and Salsa, not bad. The chips were warm not the best I've had but not the worst. Huge plus was that they were free! a fine example of what EVERY Mexican food spot should do! I ordered up the chimichanga and taquitos. The chimichanga was kinda bare on the outside, Vegas and all Mexican shops this is where you fail when it comes to SD. The chicken on the inside though, FREAKING GOOD!! The taquitos were pretty dang good as well. The gf ordered the Chicken Tortilla soup and she said it was good as well. 
The place is just a touch on the pricey side, but being in a major hotel and on the strip you cant really expect not to pay too much.
