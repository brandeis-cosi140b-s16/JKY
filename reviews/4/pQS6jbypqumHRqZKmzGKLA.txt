I recently watched the film "Whip It" and I've had the Dolly Parton song "Jolene" randomly pop into my head ever since. It doesn't help that Vegas's newest food truck is owned and operated by a person named Jolene.

Anyway, let me cut to the chase. Hands down, my absolute favorite item on Jolene's menu is the Green Chile Chicken Stew. Wow. Absolutely delicious. I first tried it at one of her preview events. It was so damn good, it completely overshadowed the Pork Tacos that I also tried. And it's the perfect thing to be holding in your hand, outside at a food truck, in this brrr-licious weather.

As for the Pork Tacos, they were pretty good. I'll have to try them again one day. At last night's official launch, I tried the Sloppi Jo and it was also delicious. It consists of slow-roasted pork with red chile sauce, pickled onions thrown into the mix, and topped with a fried egg. You get a couple of tortillas to go along with it. Interesting presentation.

At the preview event, they handed out Sopapillas, so I got to try a couple. They can be described as light pastry pillows topped with honey butter. Yummy and a nice way to cap off your meal.

Like I did with Jo's big brother, Fukuburger, I'm sticking with 4 stars initially. I want to try everything on her menu. Regardless, when the new year rolls around, I highly recommend getting out there and supporting our newest local biz on wheels.
