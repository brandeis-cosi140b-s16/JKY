If you are looking for a consistent meal no matter what location you visit, come and eat at Chipotle. One of the healthiest fast food restaurants around, Chipotle serves up great tacos, burritos and salads...all well under $10. 

Food: One of the things I like about this place is that all the ingredients are freshly prepared and served in front of you and you can customize your burrito in any way you want. Oh, and make sure to order the guacamole... The freshest and tastiest I've tried in Vegas. 

Staff: This particular location had some customer services issues when they first opened, but have improved a lot since then. You are always greeted with a warm welcome and a smile and your food is always ready within minutes of walking in the door.
