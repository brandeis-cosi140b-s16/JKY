I got a big ole buddy that loves to eat that recommended this spot... And I usually take his word as bond cause like I said, this brotha can put down some food, and some good food at that. 

The place didn't really stand out as I tried to locate it but once I found it I ordered the carne asada tacos to see what they we working with here. I wouldn't say I was blown away but I was satisfied. Decided to give it another shot and order the carne asada fries. Now that was what I looking for! I never imagined fries tasting so good.

Needless to say, after going to Roberto's two days in a row, I'm currently on the John. But it was worth it.
