This place is one of my favorite Mexican seafood restaurants in town. I love shrimp ceviche and theirs comes closest to my mom's. The tostada has a generous amount of delicious ceviche. One is enough to fill me up and is relatively inexpensive.

I tried their chilaquiles and they were decent. Very spicy, but they weren't too flavorful. I wasn't too impressed with their rice and beans either. They weren't bad, but like the chilaquiles, they lacked flavor. I did enjoy their fish tacos though. I guess you can play it safe by ordering their seafood.

I find it difficult to stray from my usual ceviche tostada, but I look forward to going back and trying some of their other menu items. Definitely a place I'll visit when I crave ceviche!
