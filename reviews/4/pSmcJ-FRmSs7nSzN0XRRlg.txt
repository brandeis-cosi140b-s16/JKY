Can't quite understand what all the bad reviews are about, but I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga which comes with rice and beans.  It was so big I had to stuff it in.  I still left the beans and rice pretty much untouched.
It was cooked to perfection really, which is why I'm a little confused about others dining experience.
I ordered a quesadilla (cheese only), also.  Just meh on that one.
Also, got a giant order of carrot cake which they do not make but buy it on the outside to serve.  Good cake..and I consider myself somewhat of an expert on carrot cake cause I have the world's best recipe, which I mooched off a girlfriend's sister-in-law some years ago...and it took some whining and constant reminders to get it... but I finally did.
Service is kinda half-baked, but after reading reviews I expected it.  I think I had 4 different people helping me..haha!  It's ok...I got served and waited on.
I like this place.  I would go back.  I thought the food was good.  Maybe the complainants should order the chimichange platter?
As for the food coming out hot...mine was so hot I almost burned my hand on the plate.
What happened to make my experience--and I know food--so positive compared to some of these other reviews?  Was Mama off the rag and feeling good this day?  Who knows, but I surely enjoyed it.
