This was an interesting little discovery.  It is in a small strip mall that is mostly empty next to a tire shop.  You have to literally drive through here to find. 

It is basically a quick serve taco shop akin to a Roberto's.  

I had a chicken taco plate.  It was pretty good.  It seems they put more effort into their food and service than they do at most taco shops.  

The prices are noticeably lower than other taco shops.  Very reasonable prices.  Overall, the food and the prices are a good value.  I gotta say, this will be my taco shop of choice in this area.
