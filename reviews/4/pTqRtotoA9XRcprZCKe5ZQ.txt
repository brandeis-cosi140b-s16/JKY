Ahhh, La Bamba. I have such fond memories of the old State Street location; stumbling up those stairs, paying $5 for a monster burrito, and leaving happy.

While I was sad to learn the State Street location has closed, I was thrilled to find that the food at the west side location is exactly as I remembered it: cheap, filling, and fast.

Once again, Madison Yelpers, I must remind you that this is NOT authentic, high quality, interior Mexican food. It's a college town burrito chain that caters to drunken twentysomethings. Go into it expecting and knowing this, and you'll probably leave happy. However, if you're expecting homemade masa and mole, you're going to be disappointed.

We ordered two "regular" burritos: one steak, one chicken. The chicken was shredded and lightly seasoned. The steak, while not tenderloin, was moist, tender, and tasty. Neither were the least bit greasy, and I never bumped into a hint of gristle or other meat-nasties.  

I must admit that I never order refried beans, so I've never tried them from La Bamba, and I'm not a vegetarian... I'd imagine that if you're a vegetarian you should probably look elsewhere.

So, if you're not a bean-eater or veggies-only type of person, you'll find that the burritos are big and tasty.  Both of ours were filled primarily with meat - no rice filler; just meat and veggies. She added avacado to hers, and if I do say so myself, it was an excellent addition.

The hot sauce is one of my favorites; be sure to ask for a side of it. Salsa is flavorful, fresh, and has just enough kick to keep you on your toes. Chips are disappointing as they're usually a bit on the stale side.

La Bamba is really a 3.25 - 3.5 star place, but I bumped it to 4 because I appreciate what it is, the value, and the service.
