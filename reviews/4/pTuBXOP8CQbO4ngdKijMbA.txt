The food here was great! I had received a recommendation for Macayo's from my hotel....everything was exactly as he raved about. The place is spacious and bright....the chips and salsa were plentiful and extremely addicting....the service was exceptional. I chose their recommendation (Macayo Chimichanga) which was excellent and I would definitely go back! If you love mexican food, this is a great pick!
