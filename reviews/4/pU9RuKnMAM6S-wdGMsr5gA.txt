I've been eating here for years, since they were located at the top of the hill in their old location. Now they're behind Talbots and harder to locate, which is a pity. This place would do very well with a driveway access onto a busy road. I would guess that its mostly the locals that come in here now, and its good enough that they've managed to stay open with only that kind of traffic. The food is well above average, and I'm especially fond of the House Special Dip. My wife is from Denver, Co, and mexican is her favorite food. Denver has a huge mexican population, and there are many, many authentic restaurants there. She rates this place with the best of them ! Good food, good service, reasonably priced. Worth the effort to find this place !!
