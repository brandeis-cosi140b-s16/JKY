For those not in the know, I'm a bit of a taco lover, so of course taco taco is a place I found myself attracted to. The setup is pretty straightforward, there's the taco lines, depending in what meat you want, and then there's the side where you order grande tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Ive never been tempted to try the burritos here, but I have gone thru the entire meat spectrum  their strong points are suadero and al pastor, and I felt their cabeza was a bit lacking. Their carnitas was a very welcome surprise due to the fact that there are a lot of places that don't do it right.   The dining room is pretty spacious if you're choosing to eat in, they have a TV. It's nothing special but it's great if you have a nice group of friends and you guys are just hanging out. 
Overall it's a nice taco shop with good food and atmosphere
