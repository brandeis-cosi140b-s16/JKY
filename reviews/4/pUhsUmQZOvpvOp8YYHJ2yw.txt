a nice little place. glad when it finally opened as the remodel seemed to take forever.  the interior is fresh and clean but not very stylish; we usually go through the drive-through.  It's not terribly speedy like you expect at drive-through windows, but that's a good thing...they make the food fresh to order!   everything i've tried was tasty and plentiful.  seems a little on the pricey side, but again...it's FRESH food so overall worth it.  i'll keep cruising through every few weeks.  Supporting local business is important, and it's way cleaner and better than all of the Fili-o's places.
