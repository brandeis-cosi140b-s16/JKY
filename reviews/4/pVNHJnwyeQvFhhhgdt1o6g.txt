We stopped here later at night because Two Hippies Beach House was closed.  I'm glad we did, because the food was pretty decent.  I was a little nervous walking in because the whole place was empty, but that might have been because it was about to close (which we unfortunately didn't realize...so we left a generous tip ;) ).

My fiance asked, as he always does: "what's good here?"  The guy at the counter responded "anything seafood!"  Of course. It's not called Mariscos for nothin'.

So I ordered two shrimp tacos and one grilled marlin taco, since I'd never had marlin before.  All were delicious.  I didn't realize the shrimp in the tacos would be breaded, which I usually don't like, but it was pretty good.  The shrimp tasted good and juicy, and the toppings were nice (cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro).  The horchata seemed like it was homemade, and it was delicious.  The chips weren't the best, and they gave us a green salsa, which my fiance said would be too hot for me, so I didn't try it.

I took a look at their full menu while I was waiting for my food and they have a very decent selection.  We will definitely be back. Soon :)
