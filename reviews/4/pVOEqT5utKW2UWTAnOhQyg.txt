Is it wrong to covet guacamole at odd hours?  I almost always order guacamole (which somehow always tastes better than my own) and a 1/2 salad 1/2 torta combo.  Usually the kortada salad but they have a new one with pomegranate seeds and blue cheese.  The blue cheese didn't add much to the flavor mix for me but the salad itself is delicious.  The tortas are always good, I usually go for fish and the selection does vary.  Most times it's white fish lightly grilled (but highly seasoned) but yesterday I got lucky and got ahi tuna of all things.  A fotuitous and lucky surprise!
I love the Clarendon hotel, I'm glad to see that this restaurant is sticking around.  The place had a hard time getting a restaurant to stick for awhile and this one appears to be a winner.
