I have been coming to this place since they  opened about 6 years ago and it just keeps better.  Fresh made to order menu that is full of variety and taste!  The pastries are VERY reasonably priced however only 4 stars because the selection is not as fun and flavorful as before.  Not looking for more sugar pan just some of the more decorative, unique flavor pieces.  Maybe it was just because it was a Monday.  Overall this is a must hit!!!
