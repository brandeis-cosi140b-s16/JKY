Love this little gem tucked away in the Tuscany Suites & Casino. I typically would have passed this place up and chalked it up to nasty, mass produced casino food BUT I received a 2-for-1 coupon and decided to give it a shot. 

They have surprisingly good Mexican food....yummy chips, great bean dip and my favorite, the chimichanga! YUM! They also have a good lunch menu with decent pricing on the menu items. Plus they serve a delish strawberry margartia, that's the way to my heart I tell ya!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smoke from casino *sometimes* wafts in and is kinda yucky.
