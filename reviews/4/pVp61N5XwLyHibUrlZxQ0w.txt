My office is right across the street, but I always found that Roberto's has too much oil in their food. Today, I decided my starvation is going to accompany me to this restaurant that I fear for my health over.

I ended up getting a carne asada burrito, but when I asked for extra meet... The lady said, "Are you sure? It is $3.00 more..." That made me question myself, so I told her, "Never mind." 

The burrito came out within two minutes, super-hot, and ready to go. I got the condiments which included carrots, one jalapeno, and the tomatillo sauce.

I took the entire tortilla off and just put the inside on a plate. It was actually not that greasy today! I would suggest coming to this Roberto's!

P.S. Their horchata is the best in comparison to other Mexican restaurants I have been to. Even the formal ones.
