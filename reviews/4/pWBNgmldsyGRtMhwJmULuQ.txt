Went in during lunchtime on Saturday and the place was nearly empty. It took a minute to get service, but once we did, things went great. We had plentiful refills on our water, a friendly server, and delicious food.

The soyrizo taco I had was fantastic -- good news for vegetarian & vegan diners. (Lots of other options there, too). Great tortillas (tasted fresh)!

My dining partner had the Carribean tofu and was also impressed. It came with plantains and mango slices. Not too many places in Pittsburgh you can get plantains.

I'm definitely planning to return and see how they do when handling more tables!
