Not a bad alternative to Moe's, Qdoba, or Chipotle. Service was excellent on our first visit. They even split the single drink ordered for our 2 boys into separate cups for us (one less thing for them ti fight over).  They just serve burritos and salads, but the twist is that there's Cajun, Bangkok, Teriyaki, Summer, Mediterranean, and Buffalo style/ingredients besides the make your own or classic burrito. We'll be back for a second visit.
