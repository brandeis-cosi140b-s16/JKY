Chips and salsa were delicious. I had the beef taco platter can I love the fact they serve black beans instead of refried. My husband had the steak fajitas and he liked them a lot. The food wasn't cheap but we got a discount card in the shopping center attached and saved 25%.  Go to Pinto Ranch store and get your discount card.
