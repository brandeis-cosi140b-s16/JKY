Ay, ay, ay!!!!

These tacos are for realz yo.  I'm from "La Villita" in Chicago therefore I am a certified taco expert. These are legit. 

Super fresh (made right in front of your face!), tasty and totally authentic. 
I wasn't expecting much because honestly, Vegas has not impressed me with its taco-ness. 

They are a but pricey at $2 each but they are the best that Vegas has to offer. 

I tried the taco de tripitas (fried tripe) and a taco de carne adobada (think al pastor). 

Deliciously good and worth the wait to have these delicious morsels prepared fresh as you stand and drool behind the glass envisioning them entering your face.
