Chipotle is a solid 4 stars. This location in particular is great...directly off the freeway, near Bell Rd., next to the movie theater and ballpark. 

The employees are very friendly. The burritos here are large and after eating one, if you are able to, will fill you up and you'll probably skip the next meal or two. *tummy full*

There's lots of room indoors or on the front patio. Bathrooms are clean.
