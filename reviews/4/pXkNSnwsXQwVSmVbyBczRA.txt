I've been coming here regularly for over 10 years; it's definitely one of my favorite places in Chandler.  I've enjoyed watching this restaurant grow over the years, adding chips on weekend nights and accepting credit cards.

Order the fish burro--you won't be disappointed, especially if you load it down with the pico de gallo, which is the best I've ever had (including homemade).   I'll be honest, we order cheese crisps and get chips whenever possible just to eat more pico.  It's just that good.
