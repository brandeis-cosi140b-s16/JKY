I was surprised at how good this Chipotle was, seeing that it was on the strip and the line was almost out the door at 9pm. The employees took their time with my burrito, which I really like because most Chipotles really rush through. The only negative was the beer in their cooler was not cold, and we ended up returning it.

The burrito I had, and the burrito bowl my parents had was excellent. It was my parent's first time having Chipotle and they loved it. Usually fast food on the strip is more expensive with less quality than usual. Although their prices were a little more than usual, the food quality was really good. We were staying at the Harrah's, and this is right next door, which was very convenient.
