This was great local Mexican food. The yelp site said was table service but ordered at counter, from then on they delivered. We all enjoyed our entrees. I had chicken chimachanga. The meat was melting tender. And the flan was to die for. I felt like I was visiting Mexico. Rustic looking, no alcohol. Only disappointment. Will return
