It was better than I expected. Being a chain type place I wasn't expecting much but the drinks were good, food solid and staff very good.  Also, we sat outside and enjoyed a beautiful sunny day.  The staff was quick to seat us. The waitress was busy but stopped to tell us she would be right back. She got our drinks quickly. Our food was delivered by someone else in a reasonable time and hot.  The food tested good. The guac was great!  Had a waborita which was overpriced at $12 but tasted good. Was very pleasant sitting outside, watching the strip, and seeing all the crazy people. I'll be back for sure!
