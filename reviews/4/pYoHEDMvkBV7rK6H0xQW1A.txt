It sort of reminds me of a subway version of mexican food but that said : it is no Taco Bell. I've always been a huge fan of their grilled veggie burritos , bean burritos and taco salads. The ingredients are amazing and I know some people complained about the beans but gosh - they're the best part! I love that hot salsa-- pour it on!
