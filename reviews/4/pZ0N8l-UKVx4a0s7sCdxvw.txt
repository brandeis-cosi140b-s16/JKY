Enjoyed dinner here tonight. The silver coin margaritas were delicious, and strong. We had the chips with salsa trio, and one of the salsas seemed to be a ground beef and bean salsa, but was cold. It was good but the red salsa was excellent and the tomatillo was very good.
Our server Lisa was prompt to come and greet, and get the drinks, and very helpful in our selections. We opted to share the cheese enchiladas with two sauces, red and green. Served hot, full of melted cheese and just the right amount of sauce, over rice. The guac on the side was delicious, I will get an order next time. The beans were smoky, hot temperature and just hands-down delicious. Overall a big portion so we were glad we split. We'll be back.
