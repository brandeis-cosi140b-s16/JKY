I am hooked on the Langostino tacos! Ever since chuy's closed, I have been in search of good fish tacos.  Rubio's is a little expensive, but the food is high quality and worth it. Try the Langostino tacos or burrito. The mahi grilled is great also. I usually go at least once a week to have fish tacos at Rubio's.
