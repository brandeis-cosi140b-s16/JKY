Very good Mexican food. Their chips & salsa are outstanding. Best beef fajitas in town - flavorful and not too fatty like at other Mexican restaurants. The decor is typical Mexican/Southwestern but could use some updating. The baskets of fake flowers are dusty and just plain ugly. The service is always friendly and attentive.
