After leaving gym i absent mindedly missed the on-ramp to the freeway.  No problem, take Fort apache to next on ramp and get some lunch.  I drive by Baja Taco and see their signnage.  I decide to give them a try.

I like the "made to order " concept and the clear explanation on how to order at the drive thru order board.  I went with a grilled chicken burrito with rice, cheese, cilantro and enchilada sauce.  Ordered the gf some grilled chicken nachos.  Total cost for both under $10 - very reasonable !

The burrito tasted great ! decent sized ( they say the burritos are foot-long;  not sure if they are - my guess is, no ) liked the charring on the chicken chunks and just the right amount of cilantro.  slight ding for the enchilada sauce but overall, i liked the burrito.

The nachos were above average.  A little too much bean vs. chicken and more cheese definitely needed.  Still, a decent dollp of guac and sour cream - next time ask for extra cheese.

I'll defintely return
