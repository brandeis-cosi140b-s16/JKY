I think the 3 1/2 stars for this place is right on the mark.  The new Richardson's will always be compared to the old one, and it doesn't quite hit the mark (yet).  Perhaps it was because we were seated before the customary 2 coctail standing wait at the old place, but the new place didn't have the same vibe. 

On the plus side, they offer a number of seafood dishes, and know how to properly cook fish.    It was relaxed and the service at the bar was good.  They also have a decent selection of $5 wines for happy hour.  I think once the place is getting more traffic the atmosphere will improve.
