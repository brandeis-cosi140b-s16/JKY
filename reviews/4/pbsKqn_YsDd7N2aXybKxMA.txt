Ate here a couple of weeks ago and I got to say the food is good but not as good as robertos and the Don Mexican restaurant on Sahara but I enjoyed my meal the only negative is the price it is very pricey here so expect to pay more for a burrito and some tacos or fries but I enjoy this place and is part of my top 4 favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at just wish the Carne asada burrito wasn't as greasy as it was the last time I ate it but it was still good also the customer service is okay at best I have seen worse but overall this is another one of my go to Mexican restaurants to eat at when I'm in the mood to grab something to eat and I don't feel like cooking.
