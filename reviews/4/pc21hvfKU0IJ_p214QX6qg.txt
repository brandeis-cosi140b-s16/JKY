I hardly ever eat at El Pollo Loco, but when I do..it's for their pollo bowl. Their pollo bowls are not only cheap, but super filling as well! It comes with rice, beans, chopped pieces of chicken, salsa, onions, and cilantro. That's everything you need in one $5 bowl! 

If you are in a rush, this is definitely the El Pollo Loco to visit. Not even 2 minutes after I placed my order, they already had it prepped and ready for me to take to my table. I have never seen service so fast at a fast food restaurant before! I know they prepped it right after I ordered because the kitchen is open and visible behind the cashier. The pollo bowl tasted perfect and I would definitely come back here if I ever need a quick lunch or snack.
