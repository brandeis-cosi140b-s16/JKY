The family went to Frank & Fina's for the first time last Friday night. We arrived at 7pm and we were greeted by a friendly hostess who informed us that it would be a 25 minute wait for a table. FYI - They do take reservations if you call before 5pm the same day. 
     After getting seated, we were immediately welcomed by our waiter and asked what we'd like to drink. When the older gentleman returned with the drinks we were given the specials of the night. I ordered the Steak Milanesa (thinly sliced steak that is breaded) which is also served with your choice of tortillas, rice and beans. Our table also ordered an appetizer of guacamole and some melted cheese dish topped with green chiles, chorizo, and salsa fresca. The guacamole was tasty and had big chunks of tomato. The cheese dish was over the top delicious! We didn't realize it came with tortillas, so we ate it with chips. 
      My Steak Milanesa was tasty. The meat was moist and I felt like I could cut it with my the side of my fork. The beans were refried pinto beans and they were served in a crunchy tortilla bowl and then topped with a sprinkle of Mexican cheese. The rice was a bit dry for my liking. 
     I will most definitely return to Frank & Fina's Cocina. The atmosphere is welcoming, the prices are good, and the food portions will definitely fill your belly. What really set this place apart was the personal touch the wait staff added. They were quick with recommendations, and we even got served by Frank himself!
