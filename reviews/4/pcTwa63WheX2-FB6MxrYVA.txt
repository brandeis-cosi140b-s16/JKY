I went by Verde for breakfast this morning and ordered the green chile, eggs, and potato served with a fresh made flour tortilla.

The green chile was excellent. Just the right amount a heat and tang.

The potatoes were served in a chunky tomato/onion chile sauce. Sort of unexpected good taste but the potatoes seemed a bit soggy. I believe a bit dryer or crispy texture would be beneficial to the dish.

From a value standpoint they really have a value menu. Maybe too cheap. Breakfast was $5 plus tax. generous portion. 

First experience was good and I'm looking forward to trying other menu items. 

It is nice to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood.
