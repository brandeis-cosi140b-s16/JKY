Was convinced by the awesome bartender John to try the Watermelon Jalapeno Margarita and to my surprise is was delicious however a little overpriced for the size.  Atmosphere was fun even had live music in the bar on a Tuesday night.  Had a bowl of red chili with a side of tortillas and it was excellent.  Would definitely visit again.
