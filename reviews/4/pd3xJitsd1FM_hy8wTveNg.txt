First time here....came in for early dinner on a Friday night.  Seated right away. Chips and salsa were delivered right away. Got drinks ordered and food shortly thereafter. Had #7 two cheese enchiladas. Came with choice of soup or salad.  Had salad with ranch. Good portion size and good salad. The cheese enchiladas were good but a little bland with flavor. I just used some salsa with it to flavor it up. The salsa was chunky and had good flavor too. 

Con: the building is old and kinda smells that way. Not sure if it's the building or all the old people. This restaurant sits at the edge of Del Webb retirement community.
