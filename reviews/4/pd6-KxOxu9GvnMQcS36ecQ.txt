I was suggested this place by a friend who recently had a date there. I made reservations for a Friday night and was very excited since she highly recommended it. I was happy to find that there was valet service considering parking was limited. We were not sat right away but I wasn't too worried about it. Our service was great. The server was not overwhelming and very informative. I am a steak guru and decided to order the surf and turf dish with steak. I ordered it rare and it was prepared perfectly. I was AMAZED on the quality of beef that was used. I'm very apprehensive to places that serve steak considering its basic USDA choice, not prime. However, I was pleasantly surprised and pleased. I love this place and have no been back, but plan to go back soon!

I also REALLY liked the wood burning smell in the restaurant. Was definitely a welcoming smell.
