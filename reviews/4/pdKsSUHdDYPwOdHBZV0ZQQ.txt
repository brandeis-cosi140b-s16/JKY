In any other place I would give 3 stars, but for Vegas it's easily a 4th star.  Food (ok, just the tacos) are good (not great).  They are not big, the best tacos you ever ate good, but for $6 you can get 3 of them and leave comfortably full and they taste decent.  We had prompt, attentive service.  Drinks are well priced (at least the specials are).  

Add in the price and this was one of our better stops for the weekend.  One of the few places you didn't feel like you got bent-over for price gauging.
