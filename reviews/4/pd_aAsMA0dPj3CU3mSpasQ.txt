The Qdoba at StoneCrest is somewhat better than the average Qdobas in the Charlotte area.  The store clean and the service is generally nice.  Food portions varies at times from satisfying amounts to obvious skimping (just ask for a little more if this happens).  The food quality seems better, compared to other Qdobas in the area.  I typically order a burrito (either beef or pork), in which sometimes it rips apart; so have chips ready (if ordered the combo) for possible clean-up. Their tacos are overpriced for what you get, skip'em.

This location accepts the local "Ballantyne Card," which gives 20% off from 11am-3pm (Monday-Friday); this is much better than adding points on the Qdoba Card.
