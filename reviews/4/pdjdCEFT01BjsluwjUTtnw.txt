We mostly go for breakfast. It's not too cheap but nothing around here really is besides Mickey D's dollar menu. You get a lot of food for your money though. The place could use updating for sure and if nothing else, the carpet is in desperate need of replacing, but again the food is good. Wait staff is good, efficient and much friendlier to those they get to know. Parking isn't great and it's small so if you're going on the weekend, prepare for a wait. Only had lunch once, it was good too.
