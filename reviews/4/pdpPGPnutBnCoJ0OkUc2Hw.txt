I don't give any restaurant a 5STAR; but Juan's is as close as I get.  I've been going to Juan's since it used to be on the NE corner of 16th Street & Thomas (1994?); when the kids were small; now they are much older - and all still working at the restaurant.  I don't think there is one thing on the menu I haven't had.  But to give you suggestions:
* Chile Relleno - won't go to anywhere else
* Green Corn Tamales - didn't like them until Juan's
* Machaca (either Burritos or Plate)
* Refried Beans - plain & simple but the best around.
* Beef Tacos, hey I love them - can't explain it just do.
* Burritos always at least 2 meals for me.
I love that they expanded and made it with more booths.
Love Arriba's, Sylvia's La Canasta, Mi Patio, La Tolteca and many others...But, Juan's will hold a special place in my heart & stomach...
