Their margaritas are DELICIOUS!  Happy hour = $3 margaritas, and $4 and $5 "eats" that will fill you up.  They also have great free chips and salsa, and I love the location.

The bar is not crowded for happy hour, and the people who are there are fresh out of work, so it is nice to be in a "professional" crowd.

Love it and will continue to frequent it.  If you want to hit happy hour and a movie, this is a great place!
