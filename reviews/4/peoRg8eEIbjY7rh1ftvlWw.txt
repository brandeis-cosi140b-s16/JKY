Viva La Torta's!  You never knew you could find such yummy food in a strip mall!  We have done breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of the above is great!  The price is fair and the food is fresh and hot.  The one thing keeping it from a 5-star is inconsistency.  I have ordered the same thing multiple times and although it is always great, it is also never the same.  Mostly it is cheese, sometimes it comes with and sometimes without.  I prefer to always have the cheese!
