This is great homemade fast food, the portions are big and the price is right.

Perfectly cooked shrimp ceviche in tall glasses with tomato salsa.  Perfect horchata with not too much cinnamon; its a rice drink not a candy heart.  Al pastor taco is nicely seasoned and I can top it up with my own salsa choice.

Tough neighborhood crowd in the middle of the night but, everybody has to eat, right?
