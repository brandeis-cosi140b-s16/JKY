Good if you have a case of the munchies. Don't expect food that'll blow you away... And don't order the chicken. It isn't very tasty at all. I think they use white and dark meat, and me not being a fan of dark meat doesn't help. But this review gets 4 stars because the guy at the drive thru is a sweetheart. Can't help but smile whenever I see him.
