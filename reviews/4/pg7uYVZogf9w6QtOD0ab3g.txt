Fast, easy, good food. Word of advice, get your food to go and take it back to your hotel room. The line was long, but the food was fresh off the grill when we got to the front and the line moved fast. The restaurant area was a bit dirty, but it's Vegas, what do you expect? Like I said, good consistent Chipotle food, take it back to your room though.
