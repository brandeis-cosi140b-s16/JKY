I am giving Anita's a four star for their mild salsa, awesome, and their carne asada tacos.  My favs.  This place is a local favorite, there are not many places to choose from in Wickenburg.  My only complaint is that all of the entrees kinda taste the same.  This is not authentic mexican but rather mexican-american.
