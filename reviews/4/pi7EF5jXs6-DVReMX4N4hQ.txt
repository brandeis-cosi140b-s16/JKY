Visiting fr CA, happy they took reservation as I was meeting up w/local friends who had never been here and heard it was hard to get in cuz its always so busy. Table was ready half hr before I arrived per one friend who arrived early.  Service was outstanding. Food was delicious as the bulgogi was marinated perfectly and tender.   We shared  everything bulgogi: PBBBLT,  nachos, rice bowl, rice plate, as well as spam kimchi fried  rice and musubis.  The iced tea was a plus!  I need to go back and try the chimichanga and burrito.  If you like bulgogi with a mexican twist... Komex is the place!
