Papa Chevo's is the real deal. I went there early in the morning to get some breakfast burritos. Not a lot of places are open early in the morning but Papa Chevo gets out of bed early, and you better believe it. I got two burritos - one with sausage and another with chorizo!  The lady behind the counter asked me if I wanted any sauce, and I said "I dunno. Ok" and she gave me two different sauces to try, each one was like a spicy salsa but different flavors - they were pretty good.

The real question is how were the burritos though, not the sauces.  They were pretty good. Not dry, not too messy - pretty freakin' good.  I don't know what Papa Chevo looks like, but I assume he made them by hand - it didn't look like they had the kind of machinery around that they'd need to do it automatically.

So here's the deal: just go and try it out - what are you sitting around for?!
