Ricardo's is a great Mexican restaurant for Las Vegas but being from So Cal - the Mexican food there is at a whole new level of amazing.  

The owner really cares about this restaurant and his employees and it shows.  When he is there when we have visited he walks from table to table and asks how we are doing.  And most of the waiters and waitresses are very kind and your food will come out quickly after ordering.

Their complimentary chips with two different salsas and bean dip are delicious and are a perfect compliment to their amazing margaritas.

Prices are very reasonable and the food is plentiful.  Standard Mexican "comfort" food.  I normally get their steak and shrimp fajitas.

A nice side note... I love that this restaurant has credit card machines that go directly to your table to pay for your food - no sending the card to Siberia sometimes waiting for your slip to sign - the waiter doesn't even see your card.
