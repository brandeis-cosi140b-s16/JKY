We popped into this Roberto's (located on Blue Diamond at Buffalo by Rounders and a Child Care place) at like 1am after a concert. Few drinks down and we were ready for fourth meal.

My husband insisted we order the Carne Asada Fries. I thought we needed more than just that so I ordered a Bean & Cheese Burrito as well. OMG was I wrong! Those fries were huge, and L.O.A.D.E.D! We devoured them and took the burrito home for lunch the next day.

Surprisingly I've only been to Roberto's a handful of times. One other time I had a Carne Asada Burrito that was delicious and huge. One time I had Rolled Tacos (aka taquitos) another WINNER!

I will say that there is never a shortage of food with your order. This particular location was clean and the girl taking our order was kind. I'm sure we will be back since this location is right by our house.
