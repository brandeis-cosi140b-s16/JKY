I always like Pasqual's. I've tried almost everything on the menu and he only thing I haven't liked is the tamale. I have a feeling that's mostly because I don't like tamales. One complaint I have is that they got rid of the espresso-type coffees they used to have. 

The food almost always comes out quickly and is the perfect temperature. Everything is nicely flavored, and the portions are large and filling. They do have some lighter options, such as the black bean soup. My personal favorite is the tostada with chicken; it's the perfect cold-winter-day meal.

Service is usually friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere is fairly nice. The decorations are a bit odd and it's not the most comfortable place. Also, sometimes the music is a little loud and doesn't always fit the Southwestern environment Pasqual's tries to exude. Other than those small complaints, though, I highly recommend making a lunch stop at Pasqual's.
