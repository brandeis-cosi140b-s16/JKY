I'm from Madison and I have a home there, but I have lived in the Mission District in San Francisco (where the burrito as we know it was invented) since 1997. I live a block from La Taqueria on Mission Street which, according to many people, is one of the top taquerias on the West Coast. I'm not boasting - I'm just establishing my Mexican food eater cred. Brothers and sisters, I know tacos.

I met a buddy there from lunch. He recommended we meet there. I'd never heard of Francisco's before then. My buddy grew up in Mexico City, then moved to Madison for college - and stayed. He's a helluva good judge of Mexican food.

Anyway, I've eaten at Francisco's  Mexican Cantina twice now in two days and I can totally couch for their tacos. Very good, authentic, delicious tacos. They feature generous meat portions - I recommend the Carne Asada, the Pastor, and Beef Tongue, cilantro and onions on two thick, tender tortillas. Their salsa verde has a little heat, but not at all too much, and I recommend it.

The chips and salsa are the real deal. I've even had the Flan and it was also very good.

I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the platos and more specialty items, but I have been jonesing for tacos.

Great food.

Excellent service.

Great value for money.

Highly recommended!
