I don't know why so many people are ragging on this place. I've been coming here every time that I come to Vegas.

Yes, the decor inside is a little "old" and yes so are the waitresses, but don't knock that down before you get to the awesome menu.

To me, it's just a vendor serving up some good, local comfort food.

Try coming for lunch as they have an affordable menu and plenty of tables available in the area.
