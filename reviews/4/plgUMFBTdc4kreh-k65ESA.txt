So picture Roberto's. But now take away the inconsistent Carne Asda and the way you feel sick sometimes afterwards, and replace that with an extremely moist, tender Carne Asada and you have a better understanding of Tacos El Compita. I tried it for the first time the other day, and I was very impressed. It is right in my neighborhood so I will definitely return. They also have pretty awesome soft tacos. The taco plate comes with like six and it is all very reasonably priced here. The salsa bar seemed a lot like Roberto's. I was digging the red sauce. Try this place, you most likely won't be disappointed. Make this place 24/7 and open more locations and this place would be perfect. I can't wait to return and try some other stuff.
