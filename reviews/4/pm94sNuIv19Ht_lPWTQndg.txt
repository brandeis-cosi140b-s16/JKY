New place in the entertainment district of Scottsdale. Not your typical decor - more modern with blue neon lights under the bar, in the ceiling, and accented by blue walls. Very nice and calming atmosphere.

We started with the guac, chips and salsa and a couple of margaritas. We're a fan of spicy, so we pretty much devoured the spicy salsa and pushed  the medium salsa away. Spicy salsa wasn't overly spicy but did have a nice flavor. The guac came in a fried tortilla 'bowl' garnished with radish slices. It was chunky (onions, tomatoes, avocado) and was really delicious. House Margaritas were good - not overly sweet like so many restaurants tend to do.

When the name of the place has a food in it, you just have to order that food (especially if it's your first visit) so we opted for tacos: Barbacoa and Carne Asada. The refried beans looked really strange to me. Light in color and like a 'blob' on the plate - wasn't appetizing to me at all. I took a bite and didn't like them at all, but my husband thought they were great. Evidently they are not made from pinto beans, but a white bean, which is very traditional - that explains the light color. Both the barbacoa and asada were very flavorful. The tortillas were very fresh. The waiter later told us all the tortillas are made by hand on-site.

The staff was very friendly, stopped by several times to make sure our food was good, to fill our water glasses, bring us more chips, etc.

I definitely recommend. We're planning on taking out-of-town guests there in a few weeks.
