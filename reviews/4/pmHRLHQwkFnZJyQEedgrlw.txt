Stopped in with the family on a trip to Pittsburgh as it was on the recommended list at the hotel we stayed at.  Tamales De Brisquet was excellent, daughters loved the Enchiladas De Pollo.  Chips and salsa were tasty too.  Service was great, staff was friendly and our server Anna was very nice and took good care of us.  Check it out!
