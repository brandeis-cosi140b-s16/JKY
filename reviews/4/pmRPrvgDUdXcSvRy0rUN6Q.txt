I came back to try their barbacoa tacos since they only have it on the weekend and i leave a happy person! The service was excellent this time I guess they see now I'm going to be a regular..

I would have never found this place if it wasn't for this website and I have been driving past it for a few years now. I felt like I was in mx since I walked in w the music and the murals of Juarez on the walls. 
I ordered a steak torta that tasted like the good old days and regretted not seeing the chile relleno burrito before I placed my order so I'll be back for that. 
I'll hv to agree w the other reviews this is much more legit" than all the other Mexican fast food restaurants around. It's too bad today was not the weekend to try their barbacoa;))

I came back for the chile relleno burrito and really loved it i asked them to replace the cream with mayo just because i love mayo on everything! the only thing i didn't like was the enclosed smell of the place, i am such a clean freak so i wish they would have opened the doors so it didn't smell so much like beans or eggs inside:(

We were not over impressed with the flautas but everything else so far has been pretty good.
