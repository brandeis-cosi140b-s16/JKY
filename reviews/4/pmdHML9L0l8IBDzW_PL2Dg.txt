Serrano's is a classic old school Phoenix style Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is located in downtown Chandler and has preserved the intimate feel of a family restaurant from yesteryear.  

The salsa and chips are simply excellent.  The chips come out hot and fresh and the salsa is chunky and tasty.  The food is basic no frill, but great tasting no the less.

The fajitas are a sound choice when order as are the refried beans and rice.

The service is also great.  

Highly recommended for a classically great tasting and comfortable outing for Mexican food locally.
