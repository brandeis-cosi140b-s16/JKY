I've eaten here 3 times. Totally tubular tostadas man but their spinach con queso burrito with carne asada is gucci, definitely my favorite I would recommend getting it with steak, even though carne asada is steak their carne asada is more of a dried out beef which was still good but i would much rather have their steak won't be making that mistake again homie. 
I do have to knock them for their fish taco's, is that even fish? More like a fish stick, you want some deep fried tacos i would go elsewhere.
