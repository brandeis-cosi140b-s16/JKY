First trip to 1900 Mexican Grill - loved it.  Service was very attentive, food was great, and the Obama Margarita was super.  Started off with tableside guacamole; we got the smaller size ($7) and it was plenty for two.  Burrito combination plate was very good, and the carnitas were excellent.  Very large chunks of pork compared to other places, and the meat was super tender.  Some of the better corn tortillas I've had also - they were thinner and didn't taste dough-ey.  Not sure if that is a word...you know what I mean.  They have over 50 different kinds of tequila, and offer flights so you can taste three different kinds if you like.  Flights are $16.  Great atmosphere, friendly, and very clean.  I would definitely go back.
