If you have ever eaten at Los Favoritos, then you will love this place as it is the sister company/owned by the same people. Pricing is about the same as most taco joints, the tacos themselves run $2.00-$3.00 apiece and there is every type of burrito you can think of on their menu (my personal favorite, the sausage breakfast burrito...YUM). 

Of course, they also have combos featuring your typical Mexican fare, like chimichangas, chile relleno, tamales, etc. and the prices are pretty fair for what you get portion wise.

The facility is brand new, so it's clean and spacious and there's a decent amount of outdoor seating.

My favorite part is that they are family owned (they have several southwestern locations but are more or less "local"), and you can never go wrong supporting the little guy!
