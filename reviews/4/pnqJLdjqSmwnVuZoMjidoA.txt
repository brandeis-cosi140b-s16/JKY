This little place offers great value and big flavors with a quick and casual takeout atmosphere. The chili verde and beef chimichanga were pretty awesome. Even the beans were surprisingly flavorful. It's a pretty small dining area but they still offer a tv to watch while you wait to takeout or dine in. The salsas were good too but really not needed as the food has enough flavor already. We can't wait to go back.
