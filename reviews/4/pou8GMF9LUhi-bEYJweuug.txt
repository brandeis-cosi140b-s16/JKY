This place is the best thing going on in this area.  

In a neighborhood known more for warehouses than restaurants I was pleasantly surprised by how good Rita's is.  Great salsa - and definitely above average food!  Great rice, tasty beans, and the shrimp flautas were awesome!   

I've also had the huevos and chorizo there which were spot on delicious!  Friendly staff and clean dining area.
