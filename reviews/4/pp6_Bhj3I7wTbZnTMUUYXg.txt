Back I went to Roberto's for lunch, where I indulged in a large Wet Bean & Cheese Burrito and a crunchy Shredded Beef Taco.  The burrito was almost swimming in Enchilada Sauce, and the burrito's interior was chockfull of refritos and cheese with some strands of cheese on top as well--although I would have preferred some melted cheese.  

With creamy guacamole and pieces of fresh tomato added to shreds of beef inside a crisp but malleable taco shell, the taco was excellent, except not much guac was included for $1.10 extra.  Service was friendly, and a somewhat complicated order came out exactly right.  It was another satisfying lunch at this Roberto's.
