This is one of the only restaurants I actually eat at in Apache Junction that is not fast food.

The food is delicious...I do think it can be a bit expensive for what you get but I've always had really good service and the food I order is always delicious.  I love love love the chips and salsa!  The carne asada is really good!  I've had the guacamole that is made table side and that was also really good!  The cheese crisp is also very good!
