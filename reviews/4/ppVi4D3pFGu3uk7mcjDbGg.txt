It's pretty much Roberto's without the convenience of the drive thru. We Yelped other Mexican places and came across Laurita's.

My husband had a Carnita's Tacos plate and I just had cheese with tortilla chips. I know boring but I ate waaay too much in Vegas and I just wanted a snack. My husband said he prefers the beans at Roberto's. The cleanliness was meh but heck it is cheap and a little hole in the wall. Tacos were good and prices were decent.

Nice little change from Roberto's.
