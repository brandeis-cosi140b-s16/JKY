This was my first visit to Qdoba.  And I must say, I really enjoyed the Mango Chicken Salad.  Had wthat with lots of pico and verde salsa with no cheese or sour cream....no tortilla bowl.  Pretty tasty!  Its too bad today was the last day they're offering the Mango Salsa as it is a seasonal item.  :(  

I'll be back though!  Most likely only on Wednesdays when they offer my company lunch deals via email.  :)
