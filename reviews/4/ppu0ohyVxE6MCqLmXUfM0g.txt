They just opened up over Christmas. Carne Asada Burrito's just OK but the red, green sauce was awesome. Since this was our first time here we tried the puff pasties; pumpkin and apple. WOW! light fresh and tasty. It brought back childhood memories of the Hot Apple Pie at Mc Donald's, you know, when they used real apples. Give this place a try. Great group of workers....friendly and neighborly.
Update 4/15 we are regulars and love the pork burrito with an awesome green sauce.
