I stopped in because I never tried a fish taco. I ended up buying the Cabo Platter, a fish taco and a shrimp burrito. The Fish Taco's breading was way overcooked to the point of burned - I couldn't taste or feel the texture of the fish my first two bites. The Shrimp Burrito was delicious.  While I would go back again I'd probably avoid another fish taco as a result of this. Overall, it was a good eating experience and I would return.
