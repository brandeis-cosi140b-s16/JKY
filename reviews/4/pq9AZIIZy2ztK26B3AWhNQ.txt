Just moved from California and wife was craving a campechana seafood cocktail but had no idea where to go. Once again or fellow yelpersto the rescue. This place place is everything everyone said it was. A little hole in the wall with great food and great service the only reason it didn't get a 5 star was I didn't appreciate them not mentioning they charge for Ä‘rink refills.
