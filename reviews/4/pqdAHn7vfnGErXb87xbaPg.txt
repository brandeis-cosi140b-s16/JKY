The main reason why I was attracted to this Taqueria was because when I was vegan, they were able to cater to my dietary needs which, wasn't so trendy 6-8 years ago. And for being a Mexican joint, surprising that they knew what that even meant. 

The carne asada is good on anything...along with the chicken.  Located near UNLV, we eat there when jonesing for some good Mexican food. 

And to us students it's the little things that matter...they have great salsa and give you chips with every order!
