We had such a good time here for Saturday brunch that I had to give the wait staff credit.  We were a very rowdy group 5 girls visiting for a bachelorette party.  We showed up around 1pm and I know that a couple of us were already a little buzzed.  I feel horrible that I can't remember our waitresses name but she was awesome.  She just started sending out plates of the best things on the brunch menu, and all of the food was so good.  They probably sent out 7 or 8 course of food and I liked everything that came out.  I also had a few blood orange-cayenne margaritas and had some shots of their house vanilla-pineapple tequila.  All of it was great.

Also, our group was doing the standard bachelorette party scavenger hunt and that staff was being such good sports about our antics.  The waitress found us another server to serenade our bride in the restaurant, our waitress arm wrestled someone in our group, and we even (jokingly) led a prayer in the bar before taking shots and the bartender prayed with us!  lol... we had such a good time!
