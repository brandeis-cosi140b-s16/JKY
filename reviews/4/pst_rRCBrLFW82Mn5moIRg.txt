I don't come to Rosarita's Beach JUST for the food. The food is good, but there is a secret here that people don't know...What's the secret? It is all about the service here. 

The owner is the star at RB. He is a Spanish gentleman who makes you feel like he has been waiting all day for you to arrive. He is warm and so gracious. He has personal pictures on the walls and you can't help but see the place as a piece of his heart. I've never heard him treat anyone with less than his best. There is a graciousness to him that you don't find in the restaurant industry anymore.  Well, at least there's not enough of it in Vegas. He is genuine and so very welcoming. Man I feel good when I leave. 

We stumbled on this place a few years back. We come by every so often and we are never disappointed. The food is solid. The selection is what you would expect: carne asada, enchiladas, menudo, tacos, nachos, etc. I ALWAYS order the carne asade plate, nachos, or the pozole. And they are all well seasoned and tasty. The meat in the carne asada has changed a bit, but it is still yummy. They have a small salsa bar with limes.  

THERE ARE DEALS: They offer a soda with the combo plates for only $.065.

As others have said the place is clean and the decor is simple. It's not dive at all. It's a small spot tucked away in a generally sterile Henderson strip mall.  The food is good, but the service is excellent.  I've paid far more for much less. I like being treated like a valued guest. Stop by if you do too.
