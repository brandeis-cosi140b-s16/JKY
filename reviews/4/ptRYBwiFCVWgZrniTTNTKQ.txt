It was my first stop on my most recent Vegas trip. We got the chips and salsa and the mahi mahi tacos. Both were delicious. I would recommend this place for the great staff and equally great food. My only issue is the high prices for the food that isnt all that fancy. It seems to be the norm for Vegas, so I may be handing out a lot of 4 star reviews....
