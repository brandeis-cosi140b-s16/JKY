Amigos tacos
Is a great little 24 Mexican place...great for a late dinner to go after the late shift if a night/ day I fun on the strip... The food is always tasty and fresh and prepared quick and correctly exactly how you want it...  If you live in mountains edge or Rhodes ranch you don't need to go to Roberto's ever again.. This place had all you need...
