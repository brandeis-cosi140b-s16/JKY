Best quesadilla I've ever had! Me and some coworkers ate here for lunch today; it was most of our first times here. This food is definitely Americanized... But it doesn't mean that it isn't good. 

They give out baskets of chips to nibble on. They weren't very warm like I expected them to be but they were very good

The menu is not as broad as most Cantinas but there were some good choices. I got the Arizona quesadilla half which was extremely filling. Other coworkers got a tamale plate, fajitas, and a veggie quesadilla. No complaints from our table. 

Service was good and prices were reasonable. Will definitely be returning.
