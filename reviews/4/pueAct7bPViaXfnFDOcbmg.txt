Stopped in to meet with friends. We got the 3 dips and an app of pulled chicken taquitos as well as drinks. I will say I enjoyed my tropical hurricane and frozen margarita a lot. Both strong and the margarita was so thick I had to give up on the straw. The queso was the best out of the dips and the taquitos were also very good. Everyone else seemed to enjoy the burritos and salsas. Our sever was good. Stopping by to check on up as well take take our staggered orders. Now I can't comment much on other foods but If I get back for dinner I will update my review.
