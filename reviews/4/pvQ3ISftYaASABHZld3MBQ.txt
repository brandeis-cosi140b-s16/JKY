If you can't go to Mexico for tacos, then this place can fill the gap for a little while- closest to the flavor needed (except for the al pastor.... there is NO real tacos al pastor so far....) plus most of the types of tacos you need: carne asada, carnitas, buche, tripitas.... good place, how about another location in downtown Summelin?
