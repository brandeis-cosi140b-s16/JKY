Very nice local restaurant.  My husband and I wanted to try something new and different, well I should say I wanted to try something out of he norm, he pretty much likes to stick to what he knows.  So, when he agreed to try it out I was hoping that it would be good and they didn't disappoint.

To start off the atmosphere was very casual.  It was a Friday afternoon and they had natural light coming in and no lights on inside, not sure if it was part of them adding to the atmosphere or saving on energy but none the less it worked.

For lunch we had tortilla chips and salsa for appetizer, fat burrito for the meal and for a drink a Jamaica.  The tortilla chips were very good, definitely taste fresh and homemade, the salsa was just ok, a little too watery and could have used a little more flavor.  The burrito also taste homemade, fresh and it was a good size.  It was a little hard to handle but really not an issue, I was able to inhale the whole thing.  The Jamaica drink was very good.  The waitress told me in Mexico they call it "water with flavor"...I call it sorrel with sugar...it was good.  

The service was great.  The waitress was beyond sweet, very patient, explained the menu and I learned a little about Mexico.

Overall great experience.  Our total bill was less than $20, that's enough to make anybody happy for tasty food.  I was pleased and so was the hubby.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because although the food was very good it was not a WOW factor.  It taste like something I can try to replicate at home.  I would recommend this place to family and friends as a very nice local restaurant to check out.
