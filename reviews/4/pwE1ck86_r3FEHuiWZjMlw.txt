In the Mexican restaurant hierarchy, Senor Taco falls between a Macayo's and a Filiberto's, so people need to just accept it for what it is.  It is a step up from a berto's and just below Macayo's, but it is cheap, fast and pretty tasty.  They are mostly famous for their shrimp burritos, they are generously filled and full of flavor.  Plus they have lots of great daily specials.  The ingredients are fresh and they offer a nice little salsa bar too.

Don't go in expecting to be blown away, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.
