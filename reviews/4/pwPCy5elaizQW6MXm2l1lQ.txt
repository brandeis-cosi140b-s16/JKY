Honestly I didn't want to eat at the corporate version of the original Americas taco but it was just convenience at the time. I went in there expecting the worst and already have it one less star for it looking like the typical chain. To my surprise my breakfast I burrito used the same recipe as the original on 7th ave. the horchata... Not so much but I can't complain overall. I still will choose the 7th ave over all of them.
