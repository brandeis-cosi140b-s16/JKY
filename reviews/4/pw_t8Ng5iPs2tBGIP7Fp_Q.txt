Stopped in here for lunch based on the reviews... and based on the sign that said they have $1.75 margaritas all day every day (don't judge, I had had a rough day).

Was greeted as soon as I walked in, and a server showed me to a table right away and took my drink order ($1.75 margarita please).

The margarita came quickly and it did not lack booze.

I ordered off their "Specials" menu and got the Baja Chicken Burro, and asked for beans instead of rice (no problem with the request).

While waiting for the food, I couldn't help eating a bowl and a half of their salsa.  Mmmmmm, mmmmm, good.  I told myself 2 or 3 times that it would be my last chip, but I kept going each time because the salsa was just damn good.

The food came out soon after - big portion, and all very tasty (although I have to admit, the chicken itself was a little bland, but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace).

I'm pretty sure I licked the beans off the plate... don't judge.  Did I mention I had had a rough day??

Although the chicken didn't impress, everything else I had did, so this place is a winner in my book.  How could you not love a place with $1.75 margaritas?
