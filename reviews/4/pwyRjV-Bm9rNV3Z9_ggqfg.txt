This has been a qdoba i've been going to for at least 7 years. I love how soft they steam the burrito wraps. I officially think that if you are going to get burritos, qdoba might just be better than chipotle. However, chipotle does have the cilantro and lime rice. I also learned that even though it is not written on their menus, you can get the bowl style that chipotle offer at qdoba. Just ask for your burrito in a bowl with the wrap separate they will put it on an aluminum foil for you. Nice location and  i will be back for my next qdoba craving!
