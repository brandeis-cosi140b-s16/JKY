I'm a definite fan of this Taco Bell, in fact... I secretly drive past one Taco Bell to go to this one.  I don't know if it is the newness of the building or the shopping complex it is in, but I've always had good experiences at this Taco Bell as opposed to the one closer to my house.  Everything is kept really clean and the inside is really modern.

My one complaint is that in their attempt to make the interior "modern" the front register ended up with a curved metal railing that makes forming a line a bit confusing.  Not that there is ever a huge line here (which is also a plus), but it makes for a free for all if you happen to arrive at the same time as someone else.
