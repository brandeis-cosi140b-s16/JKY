I visited this location for the first time last Thursday, for Cinco De Mayo.  I think that this place was the first Mexican restaurant that I had been to in PIttsburgh.  First of all- it is a 4 minute walk from my new apartment in Shadyside. Score! And secondly, pretty damn good.  Super busy because of the holiday.  I don't think this place takes reservations- but we were still seated within 30 minutes of arriving- not too shabby.
Drinks were good and cheap, (because we were there during happy hour.) Food wasn't too bad either- not exactly "authentic Mexican" more Tex-Mex I would say- but huge portions and not too expensive, and pretty good actually.  Will definitely be back. Kudos Big Burrito!
