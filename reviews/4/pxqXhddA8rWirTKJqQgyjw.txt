The Dogg says. Muy bien Manuel's.  It's the Sonoran style type of comida Mexicano that is prevalent in AZ.   My taco was full of shredded beef and had good flavor. It was also stuffed full of lettuce tomato onions and cheese. My tostada was very crispy the beans tasted homemade and was one of the best tostadas I've ever had. Manuel's has one of the most tastiest salsas in the state. You can actually get full eating just chips and salsa with a beer and use your dinner as a partial appetizer and lunch for the next day. I miss the 32nd St. and Indian school location! But this one on 28th street has also been very good. Great service. Good food for the money. Get your taste buds over there and check out a great standard Mexican food restaurant!!!
