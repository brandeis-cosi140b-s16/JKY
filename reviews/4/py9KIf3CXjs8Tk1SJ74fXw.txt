I am normally turned off by the Caucasian-Mexican fare, but came to On the Border at the behest of my step-daughter. The hostess was friendly and prompt.  Of note, the phone rang while she was serving us and a male employee, most likely a manager, looked at her with disdain and sarcastically and within earshot of customers said "don't worry, I'll get the phone". Crass dude. But the hostess let it roll off and was kind and pleasant.
Right away, our fantastic server Tynese came bearing perfect chips and salsa. I don't care for the greasy chips that one may be used to. These were great. So great that we had to add the fantastic queso dip.  To my chagrin, I learned that the restaurant did not have Jamaica tea listed on the menu.  I was excited to have it and was shot down!
Our meals came out promptly, and were enjoyed by all. I opted for the Baja, which is a chicken and cheese stuffed avocado, paired with a sour cream chicken enchilada. I was pleasantly surprised. The rice and refried beans were nothing special, but the overall meal was great.
Tynese was prompt and polite, and should be considered an asset to your business.
We may visit your restaurant again in the future...probably when the east valley is sans snowbirds.
