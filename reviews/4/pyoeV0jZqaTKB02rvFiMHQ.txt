A great place in Vegas for those who are looking for an organic option. The service is outstanding. The bar tender Victor made a specialty bourbon based cocktail that was great. Enrique, our server answered all of our questions and offered good suggestions. The chef came to our table after the meal to make sure all was well. The manager Kim is doing a great job with the restaurant.

The food is very good. Mahi tacos, shrimp tacos and seafood enchiladas are all delicious. The black beans are good and the cilantro rice is great. The flan is life changing. It's the chef's Grandmothers recipe and its like cheesecake meets flan. Amazing!
