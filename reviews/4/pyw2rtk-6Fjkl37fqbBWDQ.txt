If you've never eaten here, order the chicken with sides or the original pollo bowl. They also have a dollar menu. It's a good fastfood place to eat food that doesn't taste like fastfood. But go for the food, not the atmosphere. The restaurant is old but clean. My husband has to eat here at least once a week, it's his favorite.
