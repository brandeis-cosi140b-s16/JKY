Stumbled into this very casual eatery yesterday while running some errands and wow, love it! The location is in an older strip mall and the seating is basic but nice. The owner was there, a super nice guy who explained all the menu items because, frankly, the menu is written on a shiny banner and hard to read.  I chose the tacos Al Pastor (basically marinated pork, with bacon and other seasonings) that is cooked for hours until tender. Then they chop it up into small chunks and make incredible little street type tacos with it. (I just drooled on my keyboard writing this). The rice is decent but the beans have a deliciously thick and creamy quality about them that I thought was out of this world. Blah blah blah and thumbs up. Eat here!
