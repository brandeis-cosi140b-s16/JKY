Chipotle, you're either a fan or not a fan...  Like them or not they have a unique taste and style about how they serve fresh and quality ingredients.  The staff in this particular location is super friendly, but not overly so. Like when I show up two days in a row, they don't even look at you funny. They are very accommodating and their smiles are genuine.

You can get as creative as you want when ordering; your imagination and tummy size are your only limits.  If you ask for "a little" they give you a little, if you ask for "a little more" they oblige you there too.  

The menu is simple. You can order tortilla chips, a burrito (your choice of meat, beans, salsas, opt for lettuce, sour cream, shredded cheese and, for an extra fee, guacamole,) a fajita burrito (which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions) a burrito or fajita burrito 'bol' (which are the same ingredients sans tortilla, in an Atkins (low carb)-friendly cardboard dish,) or tacos. 

All besides the chips, your food is made fresh as it moves down a line of people putting this in, slapping that on, or wrapping it all up.) If you get there right when they open the chips are so fresh that the bags are still warm. They offer ice tea, fountain drinks and a small selection of bottled beers like Corona and Dos Equis.

The carnitas burrito bowl with grilled veggies, little rice, no beans, extra cilantro, both mild and hot sauce, cheese, sour cream and more cilantro on top is my fav. With chips and guac (and it's really good guac), it's a meal that keeps me full all day long.  WHOO HOO!!
