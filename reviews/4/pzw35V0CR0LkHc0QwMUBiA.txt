Mi Pueblo is good, fresh, tasty Mexican food in the Ghettro center vicinity. 

Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Vegetarian options are also available.

Their salsa bar is on point. They've got everything from roasted habanero tomatillo salsa, to a standard tasty red salsa that you would expect from a Mexican joint. Eat as much chips & salsa as you'd like.

I like to sit outside on their patio, which includes misters that help cool the area down a bit during the hot summer months.

If you're looking for some quick, informal Mexican food without the bottom of the gutter bertos feel, check out Mi Pueblo.
