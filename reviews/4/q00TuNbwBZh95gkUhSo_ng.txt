I'm a big fan.  Have been for years.  Just the IDEA of going to Abuelos can brighten my mood.  I usually order the enchiladas - various kinds, love them all.

A few reviewers have mentioned the service as subpar, but that hasn't ever been my experience at all - it's always been quite good, regardless of the server.
