A really cool spot at the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap. Clean, very bright from big walls of glass facing the street and parking area, and simply but very tastefully decorated, this eatery serves upgraded versions of popular Mexican street foods: tacos, sonoran hotdogs, tortas, burritos, etc. The hot soups are really welcome on cold - and even not so cold - days, and there are ample desserts such as flans and cakes to satisfy any cravings for sweets. Good prices and very friendly service, though some items such as papanachos or elote en vaso (you have to ask for this; it was not in the menu during my last visit) may take a bit of time to prepare.
