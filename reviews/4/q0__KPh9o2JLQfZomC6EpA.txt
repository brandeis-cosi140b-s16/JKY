I love La Tolteca the variety of truly authentic Mexican fare.  

My Mom was in town from Alaska and craving some good Mexican food so I took here to La Tolteca to get her fix.  We had a shrimp ceviche tostada, lengua taco, taco al pastor, and chile rellanos.  All were excellent and with the habenero salsa they had a nice kick that left a tickle in our throats.  

I will for sure be back and I know anytime my Mom visits this is a must eat place for her.
