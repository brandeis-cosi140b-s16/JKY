We live pretty close but have only been to Cabo's twice now.  I absolutely am a big fan of this place!  Our most recent visit was on Saturday 1/19/13.  We were immediately seated, there were not many tables left as it was packed!  Chips and Salsa were immediately placed on our table, I love their chips and salsa, not my favorite, but I still really enjoy them!  They are quick to refil as well. 

I ordered a mixed drink from their menu as I did last time, but this time it came in a small glass whereas the last time it came in a huge bowl sized glass!  I wish their menu would designate the sizes, prices, etc. so you have an idea of what you are ordering.  Sometimes you want to share for a big drink and sometimes you just want a small cocktail.

Their food is awsome, I really love the flavoring that they put on their chicken!  I ordered the fajhita chimichanga and Kevin got one of their plates that came with a bunch of different items.  Both plates were excellent.  You get plenty of food for the price, I had plenty to take home with me for another day!

We will be back, hopefully sooner than our probably 8 month hiatus!
