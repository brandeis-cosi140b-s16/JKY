I was an attendee at a baby shower that they graciously held in their bar area... it was great to be around a bunch of drunk women and a crazy pregnant woman.

The server was very pleasant, she came back regularly to check on us and refill drinks.  We were able to order our own stuff if we wanted to or we could just eat the flautas or mini-chimi's on the table purchased by my gracious hostess sister.

Flautas and mini-chimi's... you can't go wrong.  Love that stuff.
