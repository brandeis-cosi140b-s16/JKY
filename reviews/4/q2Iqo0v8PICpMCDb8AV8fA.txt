Went here for thr first time today. I ordered the surf and turf burrito and my hub ordered carnitas torta. You can tell the meat wasn't just thrown on the cook top. They marinate their meat and it was very tasty. My husband thought it was the best tasting carnitas ever. and he has had plenty of carnitas in his life. Its usually it's very dry but here is wasn't. 
Salsa bar stocked with good salsa and service was good. 
Can't wait to go back and try more stuff.
