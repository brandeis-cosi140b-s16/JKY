When we pulled up to the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, located in a run-down strip mall behind a Circle K, the 1st thing I noticed was the trucks.  The parking lot (what there is of it) was full of big trucks with construction looking tools and equipment on the backs.  I thought, "this is a good sign."

The restaurant has gone through an interior upgrade, so the formica booths and tile floors are clean, but not much more.  You walk to the cashier and place your order (or use the drive thru).  It comes up in about 5 minutes.  The prices cannot be beat.  We ordered the fish taco plate and got two huge tacos in fresh corn tortillas with cabbage and fresh crema.  The rice and beans are awesome but never quite hot enough (that's why they only get 4 *).   My husband and I can get ONE platter and split it all for $6.99.  The prices on everything are reasonable and the flavors are authentic.  The folks that eat here know their mexican food.

They have a self serve salsa bar with your usual salsas, and my favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes.  Yum.   It aint fancy, but it's cheap, quick and delish.
