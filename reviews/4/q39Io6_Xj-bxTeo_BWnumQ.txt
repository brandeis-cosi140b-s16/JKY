I had the steak tacos.  They were flavorful.  I haven't tried enough of the menu to properly give more insight.  I mainly wanted to review it because of the rude valet out front.  I couldn't find self parking around so I opted for their valet.  Normally, I would walk rather than pay someone to move my car.  On the valet sign there was no price for the service.  I assumed that it was complimentary and would give a tip.  Well, I got my car, gave what I thought was a decent tip, and was told there is a flat rate.  Luckily, I had just the right amount of cash for the rate, but no extra for the tip.   I could have pulled up, put on my flashers, and made change for them.  I decided not to do this after his reaction to me being unaware there was a flat rate (even though it wasn't on the sign...) He gave attitude to his coworker about me, right in front of me!  

It was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of the good food I just consumed.

I gave 4 stars because Patron's food, decor, and service deserved it.  The valets would get 1 star, simply because they returned my car unharmed.
