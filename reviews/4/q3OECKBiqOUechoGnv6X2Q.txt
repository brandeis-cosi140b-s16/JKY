I enjoy Chipotle and appreciate their consistent food. But fresh organic food does not mean low cal.  I normally get the barbacoa bowl, no rice, black beans, fresh salsa. But lately I have gotten the crispy tacos with lettuce on the bottom, steak, black beans, corn salsa and fresh salsa. I used to get a side of guacamole and chips but found out that that one bag of chips is like 1000 calories. Ouch. No more chips. I get the crunch from the taco shells. I like that we can order with the phone app and it is ready and waiting when we get there. Unfortunately those waiting in line do not like that we go right up to the front of the line to pick up the food.
