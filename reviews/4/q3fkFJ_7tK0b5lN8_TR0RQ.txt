UPDATE:

Man, I love the food at KoMex. Their bulgogi tacos are some of the best tacos I've ever had, their teriyaki chicken is awesome, and I still like the cute girl who works here .

My problem now is that the wait is really long. I recently walked in to order a few tacos and stuff, and I waited almost 40 minutes. That's not cool. 

Still, I like it here. I'll just have to order my food ahead of time for my next trip.
