First time I went here I got a margarita then decided to try the chips and guacamole.  It was a Friday or Saturday night after midnight and this place had spot-on service and did not disappoint.  Guacamole was amazing, thumbs up!

Second time I went here was after I'd went to Eli Roth's Goretorium across the way for a Yelp event and the service wasn't so great.  My friend and I were in line, she was ahead of me, yet my order was done and rang up before hers was even started -- and there were 3 workers behind the counter.  Then they almost didn't get her order right even though she said it several times.

My order was OK, but the service was slow this time around, especially since we were the only ones in line and they had more workers than customers.  =P

Food is delicious!  And the prices (for the Strip) are spectacular.  I highly recommend going here if you want a place to grab a quick, cheap bite and hang out for awhile before your next Sin City adventure!
