Before heading back to L.A we wanted to have lunch and we wanted Mexican food. We didn't want to go to the strip so we found this place thru yelp.. Everything from  the decor to the people that work there is great.. The service is exceptional... Your drink is not even half way when someone is already replacing it.. Food is great, very good portions. They place chips, beans and salsa while ur seating down deciding what to order. We ask for the guacamole n ohh it's fresh n so delicious you can't stop eating it. You got to try this place.. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely go again.
