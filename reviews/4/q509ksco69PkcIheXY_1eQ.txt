For fast-food Mexican it's hard to go wrong with Chipotle's! I recommend the Burrito Bol, which if you order without rice is a good "low carb" option. The barbacoa is great, especially when paired with the spicy salsa. If you're interested, pairing this with the Negro Modelo makes for an enjoyable combination.
