Taberna is in the complex right next to my office, so my boyfriend & I decided to try it today on our lunch breaks. First plus: plantain & yuca chips. I lived in Costa Rica for awhile & plantains & yuca were like special treats there (I was living on a small island with no food except for what we found or boated in, doing volunteer work...we celebrated simple things like that!). Totally brought me back.  Two salsas served with it - one spicy & one a little sweeter. I loved/hated it...filled me up before my meal because it was so delicious!

I ordered the fish tacos. Three small grilled fish tacos with a chipotle sauce & citrus cabbage. They were some of the best fish tacos I've had (in AZ at least). Boyfriend got some steak enchiladas. I didn't try them because I don't eat red meat, but he downed them. Both entrees were served with their Mexican rice & spicy black beans. Really, really great. Not all entrees come with rice & beans...so if you go, definitely make sure to get them!

Being a lunch break, we didn't get drinks, but their margaritas looked delicious. I'll have to revisit them after work one of these days for that. They serve a cucumber slice in their water...I love that. Such a simple touch.

Service was great...but there were literally only five other tables, so who knows how it is when it gets busy.  I guess my only complaint with our server would be that she failed to refill my water, although she offered a refill on the boy's cherry coke like 9 times. Their patio is great for the weather right now...I'll definitely be back there with a marg in hand!

All in all...YUM (but I am way too full)!


UPDATE:  they closed!  "due to the economy" says the sign on the door.
