Food was excellent, environment very nice.  Music alittle loud, however.  Our waiter was rather rude to begin with, but seemed to regret it quickly and behaved himself for the rest of our meal.  I can recommend this place.  I was going to give them only 3 and a half stars, but my wife talked me into 4.
