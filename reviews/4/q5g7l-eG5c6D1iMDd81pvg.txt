Me and my sister were tired of eating Roberto's and wanted to try something different. My sister came across this restaurant. She was telling me how great it was so I decided to check out the place for myself. When I walked in the place was a little small, but clean. I ordered my food to go. The taste of the food to me was great, but a little pricey in my opinion for the portion that they gave you. I thought the portions are too small for the price you pay. All in all I think the food is good, but not for the price they have.
