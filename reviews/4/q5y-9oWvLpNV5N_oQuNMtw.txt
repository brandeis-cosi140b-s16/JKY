Chili Relleno is one of the best. Traditional Relleno, hard to find this good anymore. The cheese enchilada and ground beef taco are a great combo. Fajitas are a NOR recommended! Great friendly service and a wonderful local gilbert family owned business. Pricing is more than fair. Tortilla chips are always fresh.
