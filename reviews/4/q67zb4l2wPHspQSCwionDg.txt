These tacos are more satisfying than a stretch after a long car ride, or food after sex (really, its a good move).  

Pepe's is clean and the food comes fast.  I only order tacos here, mostly because I know they're consistently good.  Plan on ordering 2-4 tacos depending on your appetite.  

This visit I had a Carnitas (pork) and a Pollo taco.  They were both flavorful without being overly greasy.  I especially liked the crunch in the carnitas.  Hit up the condiment bar and add some pickled onions and salsa to give your tacos a lil' swagger.  

Get a few napkins and a beer, and enjoy the $#@$ out of these tasty tacos.
