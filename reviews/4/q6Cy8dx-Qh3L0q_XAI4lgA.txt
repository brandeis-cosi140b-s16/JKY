Hello Friends, (Its been awhile)

We ventured out today in hopes of finding something "new". I was in the area so we popped in. Reading the review of another yelper we tried this place out. When entering the location you have the "bar" to the right and the dining area to your left. 

Pretty nice looking bar from what I saw. I'll have to come back and pony up to it at another time.

Table Side Guac.... umm umm good. (Albeit too good. I ate way too much of it.)
2 different kinds of salsa, Thick, and Runny.

Ordered 2 Margarita's (no no no.. not JUST FOR ME.. but my gf also) = 15.00
We both ordered the number 37 (thanks for the tip Shaun R.)

I ate way too much salsa and chips (came out pretty hot.. thats a good thing). Trying to soak up the liq. in those margarita(s). Ok ok.. I "helped" my gf finish hers' off. 

The wait was a bit long for the amount of pp in the building. (maybe 4 other tables 2 already had their food)

Food, Drink & Tip for two = about 33.00.
15.00 of the 33.00 was for the 2 drinks.. I think thats a pretty good bargain. Since I STILL have leftovers. 

We came in around 2:15pm (Lunch special 11am - 3pm)

This place get the Arnold (I'll Beee BacccK)
