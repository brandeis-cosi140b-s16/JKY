We were looking for Mexican restaurants with good ratings to eat at on Cinco De Mayo. I called around to a few places to get a feel for which were food and/or drink specials. The one with the friendliest sounding person offering the best deals was a place right around the corner that I'd never heard of. We decided to give it a try.

Located in Park West, the restaurant is a little difficult to find. It's unmarked other than a small stand on the sidewalk out front. Apparently they've only been around since January and are awaiting approval on an actual sign. The inside of the restaurant is clean and they've started to attempt to give it a Mexican vibe, with a colorful array of chairs and palms painted walls. It certainly wasn't busy inside, but I think their current patrons go there for a more relaxed, less crowded bar. 

As for the food, I thought it was good. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. We ordered the Pollo Fundido, and I'd say it was better than average. The only bit of advice I may suggest is more sauce. Other than that, I was okay with the taste and the price.

The staff seem genuinely kind, and also very proud of their establishment. I think they still have a little ways to go atmosphere-wise (example: margaritas in margarita glasses), but I believe they'll get there.
