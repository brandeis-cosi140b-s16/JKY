When I asked my mom what type of food she wanted for her birthday, she suggested brunch or Mexican and the first place that came to mind was Border Grill. 

I have been on numerous occasions in the past for both brunch and dinner and have always liked Border Grill, but hadn't been in quite some time so was excited to see if they have stayed consistent over the years and what new dishes they had to try. We arrived at 11 on the dot and were seated quickly on the covered patio. Our drink orders were taken and the fruit and guava pastry was brought out for us to enjoy. 

We ordered just about everything off the brunch menu but here are a few of the notable items we tried. 

Loved: 

-GREEN CORN TAMALE (sweet corn * sour cream * salsa fresca) I'm a sucker for sweet corn tamales, so there really wasn't much I didn't love about this dish. 
-PERUVIAN SHRIMP AND GRITS (aji panca chile marinated shrimp * roasted poblano chiles creamy parmesan grits) - nice kick and flavor. 
-SKIRT STEAK AND EGG (egg cooked your way * crispy poblano potatoes) - My fella loved this dish so much he ordered it twice. The steak was cooked well and had a great texture. One of the highlights of the meal.
-MACHACA CHILAQUILES (slow cooked beef brisket * crispy corn tortilla chips
mexican cheeses * roasted chiles * egg cooked your way) - My mom's favorite dish. The brisket was moist and flavorful and the dish had a nice kick. Definitely a must order. 
-WAFFLE AND PORK BELLY WITH MAPLE SYRUP (french waffle * crispy pork belly * maple syrup) - This was one of my favorite dishes. Pork was cooked well and I really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavor combination. Big fan. 

Liked: 

-SHORT RIB HASH AND EGG (negra modelo braised beef short ribs * boniato yams * caramelized onions) - This dish was just ok. The short ribs were entirely too sweet and I had entirely too many onions for any of our tastes. 
-BREAKFAST FRIES (hand cut fries * crispy carnitas * chipotle hollandaise
jalape√±o bacon * sunny side egg) - The carnitas were great and had a fantastic crisp to them. The flavors were amazing, but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries, wish they were crispier or had more flavor. 
-BREAD PUDDING FRENCH TOAST (caramelized bananas * coconut syrup) - This rendition of French toast is overly sweet, but still had nice flavor in moderation. Make sure you share this and order it for dessert. 
CRISPY POTATO RAJAS TACO (roasted potatoes and chiles * mexican cheeses
guacamole * grilled corn relish * chipotle aioli) - Nice and spicy, definitely a good dish, if only it had some protein or meat in it to balance it out a bit more. 
LOBSTER PANCAKES (savory corn lobster pancake * chipotle sauce
sunny side egg * crispy leeks) - This dish was enjoyable, not a lot of lobster in it and I wish the pancake had a fluffier texture, though. 

Hated: 

-CHURRO TOTS (dulce de leche infused churros * cinnamon sugar * whipped cream) - This dish sounded amazing in theory, but when they arrived, they were hard little balls lacking flavor and texture. Definitely pass on these.
-YUCATAN EGG BENEDICT (manchego cheese biscuit * yucatan roasted pork
slow cooked egg * hollandaise sauce * pickled onions) - I can never resist an eggs benedict, the exception lies here. The cheese biscuit was overly doughy and pretty unappetizing. Nothing about this dish worked for me, which was disappointing. 
-BREAKFAST ENCHILADA (citrus chicken * guajillo sauce * mexican cheeses
black beans * fried egg) - This dish was the worst of the worst. First off, it came out cold. Nothing could be a bigger turn off. The flavor was meh and since it was cold we had no interest in delving further into it. 

Overall, my mom had a fantastic birthday meal and that's all I wanted from Border Grill and they definitely delivered all that and more. They even surprised my mom with a chocolate mousse cake to cap off a very nice brunch experience. I can't believe I've left if off my radar for so long in between visits. Make sure to get their rewards card if you're a local as they offer discounts!
