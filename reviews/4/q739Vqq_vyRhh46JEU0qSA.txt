I was a late bloomer when it came to Chipotle, and I now love it. I regret not eating it sooner. I wish they had more than one location, because if you don't live close to it and don't feel like going on campus at that certain time, you're out of luck. But it's across from an Urban Outfitters, double trouble.

I'm a fan of the guacamole, and I think the chips are delicious. My weapon of choice is a chicken burrito, but the tortillas are a little too thin. Maybe my add-ons are just too much, but the thin tortilla never makes it to the end in one piece. Then everything kinda turns into a clusterfuck. But nonetheless, it's very tasty. 

Line can be long but usually moves fast, friendly staff. Two thumbs way up, holiday fun for the whole family.
