In a small run down strip mall and somewhat cluttered inside. Looking at the awkward menu board I saw Mexican Food, Chicago Style Hot Dogs and Philly Beef sandwiches, wasn't sure if I should run or just suck it up and try something. I ordered the Philly Beef Sandwich with onions, peppers and mushrooms. When it arrived it was a generous portion on a toasted Bolillo Roll but the first bite was a wow! Nice flavor and even the toasted roll worked. I might have to go back for this sandwich and might even try some of the rest of the menu.
