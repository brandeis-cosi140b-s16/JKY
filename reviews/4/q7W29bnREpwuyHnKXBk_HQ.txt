Hidden gem of a place. Authentic mexican food. One of the best fajitas in the area. Salsa was homemade but lacked robust flavor. Sold $3.00 cokes without refills. The fajitas came in half of a grilled pineapple. Who does that?! Genius! A little pricey. Lunch for 2 without alcohol was $40; out the door for $50 with tip because the service was awesome!
