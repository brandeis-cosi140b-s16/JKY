The only thing I tried here was the vegetarian Taco Salad.
I like the crunchy shell.
Fresh ingredients.
lettuce, dressing, black beans, sour cream, tomato salsa, red salsa, corn.
It fills me up for at least 3-4 hours.
I usually get a to go box for it, but when I'm really hungry I eat the whole thing...
people wow at how such a petite gal could chow down the whole thing.
Its called being hungry.

I really wish they had the smoked chiplote tabasco sauce here cuz it would really go well with my taco salad.
(yes, I'm a chipotle addict and decided to give this place a try :p)
