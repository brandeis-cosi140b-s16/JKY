Ordered way too much food. I had the number 10 which was two chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans. Sounded like something I can easily handle... Not even close! The chicken tacos are so full of yummy chicken I was full after only having one but I couldn't resist the second one... The rice and beans were very bland, so it's okay that I didn't have much room for them. Next time I will stay away from the meals and just stick with the tacos. 
As for the employees they did their business getting our food fast and clean tables I have no complaints. Very yummy and hope to be eating there again soon.
