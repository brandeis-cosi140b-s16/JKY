Each time we visit the Chandler area we stop in at Guedo's to grab some juicy tacos with various fillings.  Without fail the shrimp taco is a HIT!  Actually, everything is a hit down to the Horchata and the Chocolate Chihuahua cake!  Seriously, if you want some tacos to down at a decent price this is the place to visit.  The ambiance is quite serene with sand floors, mood lighting  :), and lots of photos and articles about the establishment.  It's a plus, also, to have the proprietor taking orders and ringing up the orders.  Really, you must try Guedo's, it does not disappoint!
