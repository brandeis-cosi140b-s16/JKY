They had me at the $4.99 margaritas!!! Do you really need me to write more??? 

Ok...Ok....I will...these margaritas were awesome! Not watered down, or full of sour mix but actually had a good amount of the good stuff...just like I like them!!! And for that price how can you say no???

The chips were hot and the salsa had a little bit of kick, chucks of tomatoes and seasoning and it tasted really fresh. Not the best salsa I've ever had at a Mexican joint...but it was pretty good....they bring it out in a small container and everyone gets their own bowl to enjoy!

I decided to try the Shrimp Fajitas and they came out sizzling!!! Can you say YUM!!! The seasoning on the shrimp was delicious...I could have taken more sour cream and guacamole, but the rice and beans were great! 

With these reasonable prices, good food and strong drinks...its not doubt I'll be back!
