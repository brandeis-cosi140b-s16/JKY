You can't go wrong here. We started with their home made tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were extremely light and flavorful. For main course had two meals; seafood tacos (1 shrimp,  1 fish) & chicken enchilada mole. Both meals were wonderful; plentiful and prepared to perfection. Our server was attentive,  without being over bearing. We'll definitely return.
