CLOSED MONDAYS. Not in a great part of town. Park in back, or across the street. The day we visited CNN was doing a piece on the chef. Try the Guacamole (it has Pomegranate seeds) w very fresh tortillas). Filete de Tita ($26) Filet Mignon with Mash Potatoes with chorizo, Crab, Blue Cheese (smoky, Flavorful, spicy). Some overcooked some undercooked. Definitely get dessert &  coffee (big French press with a very robust coffee) a must is the Churros filled with Caramel.
