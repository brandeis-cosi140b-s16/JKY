Filiberto's is a unique place that can't be compared very well.  The previous review said it was in between Taco Bell and Del Taco.  I disagree.  I think it is more between Taco Bell and a sit down Mexican restaurant.

The food is very authentic and isn't the fastest fast food.  My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito, which is HUGE, and the shredded beef nachos are big enough for two.  The cost isn't fast food either.  A burrito is around $3.50 and nachos around $5.  But to compare their food to Taco Bell doesn't do it justice.  Taco Bell would be like cafeteria food and Filiberto's like a Mexican BBQ.  It is the most authentic fast food Mexican food you can find.  

By the way, Filiberto's is usually in a former fast food place.  The atmosphere isn't necessarily the kind where you would want to sit down and eat.  I recommend the drive through.  

I do remember the 2nd location too and the line was unlike any other I have seen for a restaurant before or since.
