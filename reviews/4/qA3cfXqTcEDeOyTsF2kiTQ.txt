Pretty decent Mexican food, certainly not the best around but not bad either.  Service was outstanding, The salsa that comes with the chips is very mild-too mild for me but certainly quaffable.  The Margaritas are pretty good and my wife was happy they had Papago Orange Blossom beer that certainly goes well with Mexican food.  We will return.
