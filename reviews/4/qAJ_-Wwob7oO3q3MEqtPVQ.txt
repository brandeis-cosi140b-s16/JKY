This is one of the best places to get "authentic" Mexican food near State Street in Madison. The irony there is that I am not a huge fan of authentic Mexican.

The food is exactly what you would expect from a slightly divey Mexican quick service spot. Solid flavors, with the tacos being probably the best item on the menu. The pricing is very reasonable, but I generally will go to places that are a bit more Tex Mex.

But for those of you who are all about authenticity, there are few better options in Madison. Check it out next time you finish your bar crawl!
