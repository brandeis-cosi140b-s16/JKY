Very good Mexican food with very good service.  Neither the food nor the service are perfect, though, so only four stars.

I like the chorizo tacos and the chiles rellenos.  I've found that they never heat the latter enough and it's often not quite melted.  This has been a problem even when I've specifically asked them to heat it longer.  Most of the people who work there are extremely friendly, but there have been one or two exceptions.

In either case, they do a really nice job and are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I would definitely recommend them.
