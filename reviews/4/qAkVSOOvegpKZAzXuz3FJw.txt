This place has always been douchbag central in my eyes, the one by ASU anyway, but I came to this new location last night for a going away party, and was pleasantly surprised. It reminded me of an ice house, but classier, with misters and food and a decent drink menu. They also play really fantastic music.. first 4 songs were all some of my favorite bands, including Passion Pit who came out of Boston, which was shocking.. and radical. Cant say Ive been to any other place that had such an impressive play list, and I am a bit of a music snob. Their nachos were enormous, and delightful, I ate every last bite, and then indulged myself in 2 more tacos after I had 3 more $2 Pacificos. Luckily for me my metabolism is amazing so I can do things like this, and I could have kept eating too because the tacos were delicious. I tried both chicken and steak, equally amazing. Our waitress was very patient, even though it was a table of 20 drunk ex co-workers of McFarlane Toys, which translates into 20 drunk super-nerds discussing comic books and video games.. She kept our drinks flowing and the food coming without missing a beat. I could tell she was overwhelmed, but nice work anyhow.. way to keep your cool. I did enjoy this place, but I am taking into account that it was Tuesday night, and really, no one else was in there.. so on a busy night this place could quite possibly suck, or be an exact replica of the Dos Gringos I used to know and had no problem forgetting.. either way, I had a good time, and I cant deny a place that has excellent music.
