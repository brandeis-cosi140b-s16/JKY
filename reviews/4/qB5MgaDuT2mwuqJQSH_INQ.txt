Used to be a regular but moved further west and now it's our "every once in awhile place" 

Decor hasn't changed in the many years we have been coming. And the reviews before of the mafia feel was pretty dead on and funny. 

I decided to celebrate mother's day on Saturday to avoid the crazy rush of a Sunday mess. 

We stopped in for breakfast with my family of 4 and always get seated in the front booth of every occasion. I think more than a coincidence :) 

The same rip has been in the corner booth since I was a teenager and now teenager daughter gets to complain when she rubs against it. 

The portions are HUGE and if you are really hungry you won't leave that way and if you are kind of hungry you can share or take home left overs. 

I have no complaints about the food here, or at least any of the breakfast items "because that is usually the only time we are here" 

Skillets are awesome, waitress's seem to know everyone and try to be friendly and even though ours was slow to refill our coffee and/or drinks the runner girl was always around with a refill and help if we needed it. 

If you enjoy a hole in the wall place that you can gather and be loud and have a great meal then you should give this a chance. But if your a snobby girl who is going to inspect your silverware and water glass when you sit down then it's most likely not the place for you.
