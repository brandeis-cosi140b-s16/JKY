this may be the only restaurant i've ever gone to based on a commercial.

if you live in phoenix and have yet to see the pitic spot playing on one of the local access stations - the one with all the weird 80s music videos - you need to get to the bikini lounge one night and wait for it on one of their shiny new flat-screens.  it features a dancing girl, a soldier, and stop-motion garlic.  someone breathes plasma from their mouth.

but words don't do it justice.

the food here is really solid.  family-run place - it's been around for decades, apparently.  the atmosphere is nice and quiet, the food takes awhile, and it's a little pricier than standard mexican fare - but it's all worth it, the dollars and the wait.  well cooked meats, well-seasoned dishes.  just try not to fill up on the delicious chips and salsa they bring out.
