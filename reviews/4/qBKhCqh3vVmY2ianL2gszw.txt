Popped in here with a girlfriend before the Pat Green concert last Saturday. I almost felt obligated to have some Mexican food before such a concert, although I knew nothing in this city could compare to food in Texas. Still, we went in.

I knew we were good to go the moment that chips and four types of dip were delivered to our table. Two types of salsa, beans and guacamole. Heavenly! The peppery salsa is to die for. The margaritas are good, too, of course.

The entree was, apparently, not up to Austin standards, but I liked it nonetheless. The Spanish rice had a good consistency (some places make it too dry) and the cheese enchiladas weren't anything to write home about, but they hit the spot.

The only downside is that the place doesn't open until four, which was pretty upsetting to find out when I tried to take another friend there later. Still, it's a good dinner spot, and Red Rock is a lovely resort.
