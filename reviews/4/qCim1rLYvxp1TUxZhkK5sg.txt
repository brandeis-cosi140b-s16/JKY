I cruised to the Burrito Co. to try the breakfast burrito. I will have to say, the breakfast burrito is superior than the meat/bean burrito.

The breakfast burritos are a nice size, fresh and tasty. I would like to see more meat. I ordered my burrito with sausage and probably received the about 2 links of sausage.

The price is right, about $3.50 for the burrito.
