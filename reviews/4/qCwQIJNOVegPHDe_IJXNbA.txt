Who would've known?! There is signage from the road, in fact as I walked up to the Shell gas station, this place is housed in I was still worried this place had closed down. But once you open the doors to the Shell, all your worries disappear.

When I went there was only one person working. He made the food and worked the register. The have a couple of table with bar stools, I think 4 total. 

I ordered the special breakfast burrito it was full of all kinds of meat (chorizo & bacon for sure) the other person I was with ordered a bacon burrito. Both burritos were full of flavor. 

If I was looking for a breakfast burrito place this is pretty yummy. Because they make it when you order it, does take some time so make sure to account for that.
