Was pleasantly surprised to find good Mexican food in a casino. My boyfriend orders carne asada everywhere he goes and said that Cabo's was the best he ever had. They have a salsa bar with about 20 different varieties of salsa. I ordered a quesadilla and a margarita, both were delicious. The bartender Tina was very attentive and helpful.
