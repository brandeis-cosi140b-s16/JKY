Best breakfast burritos around.  Huge & $4.  Can't beat that.  I get the bacon & add avocado.   The California chicken is amazing too.  My kids love the quesadillas. They use real authentic tortillas (probably have lard in them) but they are soon yuum. I always take tons of their hot sauces home & use them all week.   The red sauce is the best!  It's a taco shop but cheap & good. Not greasy like filibertos & Armando's
