Hallelujah! This Southern California girl has found authentic Mexican food in Charlotte! After visiting many a restaurant that says Mexican but only to find Tex-Mex, La Unica was a welcome find! 

My benchmark for Mexican food is always carnitas and La Unica's carnitas are excellent - tender chunks of pork with crispy edges - it's so good.  Their rice and beans are excellent too.

Their salsas are fantastic.  For spicy food lovers, be sure to ask for the salsa verde!

It is hike to get out there but the food is definitely worth it.  The service is nice and friendly and FAST!  I can't wait to go back!
