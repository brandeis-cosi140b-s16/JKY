If you like carnitas or carne asada, I would check this place out.

I've been here a couple of times now and I just love this place.  Their chips and salsa are pretty great, but their guacamole is amazing.  We haven't done the table-side yet (even the small appetizer you can get made at the table looks too big for 2 people to eat), but the small side order is the perfect size.  The first time I came, I had a combo plate with a chimichanga and a tamal.  The tamal was just all right, but it did have a fair amount of filling compared to some of the others.  The chimichanga, however, was fabulous.  I loved the flavors in the filling and it was the perfect size.  My partner ordered the carnitas, which were perfectly moist and flavorful.  Last time we came, I ordered the carnitas tacos, which came with their own smoky sauce, which added some great flavor to the tacos.  My partner ordered the carne asada, which he declared to be the best he'd ever had.  I loved the spices on it as well.  Like many Mexican restaurants here, they have a large selection of tequilas for tequila tastings or for your margaritas. 

The dining room is fairly sizable and they have a few tables available out on the patio.  I have never been here when it is completely full, but I can only imagine how loud that is.  It was a little over half full on our last trip, and I could barely converse across the table.  We also had a table right in front of the bar, which added even more noise.  I swear they have one of the loudest blenders I have ever heard in my life.  The acoustics in this place are quite lacking.

Service has been pretty good both times and the prices are pretty reasonable.  They have good food for a good price, but beware of the noise level if you go at a busy time or get seated near the bar.
