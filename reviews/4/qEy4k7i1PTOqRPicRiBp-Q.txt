I've been to Cabo many times for dinner and always thought the idea of it was better than the actuality.  However, last night proved me a little bit wrong.

The fella and I went out with some friends after work on a Friday evening, and we all managed to get there at different times. If I were the waitress, this would've seriously annoyed me, but our waitress was so nice and accommodating!  We sat on the bar side at a table, and all the doors were open since it was so nice outside.  Throw in a little reggae music and a margarita, and how can you go wrong?

We ordered the Baja Shrimp & Crab Dip and guacamole to start.  The pita for the dip is fried... YUM.  It was warm and buttery, and the guacamole was solid.  (As much as I love avocados, it's hard to focus on them when there's fried bread.)  I got the carne asada tacos for dinner.  The steak was tender and perfectly seasoned, and the peppers and onions balanced out the southwest mayo.  I wish I could tell you what everyone else got, but I was a little too focused on my own food to nicely ask how everyone else's food tasted.  Oops.

By the time we left, the place was slammed and we heard them mention a 40 minute wait.  You'd never know how busy they were from the staff though - our waitress was awesome, and the manager checked in on us once and said bye as we left.  I love some good customer service!  Perhaps I'd misjudged Cabo... I'll definitely be back.
