I am a big fan of the America's Taco in Scotsdale so I was pretty happy they opened one closer to the house. I only get one thing here. The Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's way and Guacamole and chips so take what you will from that.  The vegetarian quesadilla really needs to be rethought.  It's a cheese quesadilla with a bunch of onions and lettuce.  The plain old cheese one is much, much better.  The Beans are lard free and very good and an excellent quick lunch if you are vegetarian.  The staff here are very nice and the food comes out quickly.  They even have the option to order online and just pick it up. I am deducting one star for the quesadilla and the fact they ran out of beans one day and they didn't tell me till after I had ordered.  I had to get the vegetarian quesadilla which wasn't a very good substitute.

Try:
- Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's Way
- Guacamole and Chips
