With margaritas and burritos on the menu, this place is a slice of heaven by default.

I'm a sucker for their seasonal specialty burritos. The gobblerito around Thanksgiving is amazing, which predictably is stuffed with turkey, cranberry relish, stuffing, gravy and other Thanksgiving fixins'. I also recently tried the pulled pork BBQ burrito, which didn't disappoint! They definitely don't skimp on the meat here.

Also, a lot of the burritos they serve are often big enough to feed a family of three.

The best part? The $7 Big Azz (22 oz!) margaritas from 10 p.m. to midnight everyday, of course. You really don't need more than one to feel the tequila coursing through your veins.
