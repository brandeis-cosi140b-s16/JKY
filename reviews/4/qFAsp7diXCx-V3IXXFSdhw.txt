The staff was nice, and the environment artistic and relaxing. The menu is a bit pricey, but its the price to pay for artistic fare.
I tried to order the specialty, Chiles en Nogada, but was told that it was seasonal and unavailable, despite being listed on the menu. I then ordered the Granada con Flor de Jamaica. The fish was perfectly cooked, and the hibiscus sauce flavorful and addictive. The spicy mash accompaniment was just ok. The fresh brewed iced tea was wonderful. The olive tapanade with the bread was great as well. My husband had the carne asada tacos, which were ok.
For a local, this is a special occasion type of place. I will definitely take out of town visitors to lunch or dinner here. 
Not to mention that the local street art is the jam!
