We had just checked into the Palace Station and it was kind of late so we didn't really want to go back out for dinner.  We looked at what was offered in the Casino.  Cabo had a special of a create your own combo meal for $8.99.  It looked pretty good, so we thought we would give it a try.
First thing they bring you out complimentary Warm Chips and then some warm refried bean dip and 3 freshly made salsas.  A spicey roasted tomatoe, regular tomatoe and a green tomatillo.  The refried bean dip was warm and tasty and the other 3 seemed to be made very fresh.  My favorite was the Roasted, which had about MEDIUM HEAT.
I asked how the Chili Relleno was and the waitress said that they are made fresh with a roasted chili that is then stuffed with cheese, rolled in flour and then fried.  I also ordered a steak carbaron(sp?) taco which was like a street style taco on a small corn tortilla with fresh onion and cilantro.  The combo also came with Rice and Beans.
My wife had the Chili relleno and a pork tomale.

Lets just say, that based on the Chips and Salsa were very good and the rest of the food was even better.  Any who ventures to try a Chili relleno knows that they can be met with mixed results.  I had one one time that I swear was a Egg Omlet with Diced Green Chili's.  The one here was VERY, VERY good and had great taste.  Everything had great taste, even the black beans and the rice.

My expectations were not very high and had I looked at these YELP reviews prior to going, I'm sure I would have NOT GONE, but we were Oh so glad we did.
If you are in the neighborhood or staying at the Palace station, I would highly recomend Cabo!  It was Muy Bien!!!!
