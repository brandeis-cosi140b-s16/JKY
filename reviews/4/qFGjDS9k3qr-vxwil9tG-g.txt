Went to this joint as my friend and I decided to try it out due to our Mexican food phase after a recent trip to san Diego. 

First things first, as compared to other taco shops (robertos, amigos), this place is CLEAN. It's well maintained, and bright on the inside, so it gives your digestive system some peace of mind. 

Prices are a tad bit cheaper than that of other taco shops, so I went a little crazy and ordered an excessive quantity of food. I had the lengua, carne asada, and fish tacos, along with a sausage breakfast burrito. The standout quality within these were the quality of ingredients, fresh veggies and good, high grade quality lean meat. I especially liked the fish taco as it came served with tartar sauce and a tangy pico de gallo salsa. Breakfast burrito was above average. 

Overall, faustos will be my taco fixation for the moment, it's a small place located in a strip mall with highly rated yelp restarunts such as Oyshi sushi but don't be afraid to check this place out.
