The place is terribly pricey for a mostly take-out style joint, but on my first visit I went simple and tried the chicken burro which i had been assured was all white meat (very rare). The $7.50 burro was simple as it contained nothing but stewed chicken in a sort of mildly spicy green chile sauce, but it wasn't wet and sloppy. The chicken was tasty and loaded down with plenty of meat, so it is probably worthy of another visit for that item. The next level burrito with more stuff inside and a side of rice would have been close to ten bucks and most other items that would fill you up were at that price point and above. For the sake of the solid white meat though, it is worth a return visit.
