What a treat! I ordered the Burrito Prince for $5.99 with spicy pork, and it was so authentic. There were even those little bits of pineapple in the pork like they make it in Mexico. I also tried my friend's Carnitas Burrito Prince and think that was my favorite of the two. Plus, the burrito was HUGE and came "wet." The chips were light and fluffy and obviously homemade, and the salsas were delicious. I have been stuffed since lunch today and don't think I have room for dinner. Honestly, I can't imagine how large the Burrito King is, you would have to be a very large person to eat it I think (and I have a BIG appetite!). I really want to try the other dishes on the menu because they have a lot more than just burritos. They also deliver it turns out, so I will likely be eating a lot of food from this restaurant.
