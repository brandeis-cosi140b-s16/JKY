The food tries its best to be upscale, though I'm not really buying it. The Tacos Pastor and the sandwiches are pretty good, but not super-fancy and a bit small for the price. The place is also a bit tiny, and if you've got a group larger than four, good luck getting seats.

Why four stars, then? Because this place has a ton of tequila, and a lot of really good choices. I was a huge fan of the tequila flights (I sprung for a Reposado flight my first time there) and they've got a bar full of bottles you can't get anywhere else. I've found it annoying that I can't get a plain old margarita in the past, and then I remember that I can get a glass of Riazul for $6 and I shut right up. If you're looking to do tequila shots with the limes and the salt and the children in Campustown, this isn't going to do much for you. But if you're looking for a nice place to sit back and enjoy tasting a spirit that people normally don't sip, it's awesome.
