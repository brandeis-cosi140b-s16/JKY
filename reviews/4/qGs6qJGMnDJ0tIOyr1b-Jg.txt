This is not your run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  It is along the lines of Cocina del Sol in The Quarter--meaning chic and upscale.  All their dishes are done with flair and I would say that the quality of the food is a cut above basic Mexican food.  We had the guacamole and it was excellent.  I was disappointed that the chips were too thick and not that tasty and they didn't have the kind of salsa that I typically want with chips.  There salsa was creamier and came out of two plastic tubes.

The margarita was good but not outstanding.  If you want a healthier, higher quality version of Mexican food then this is your place.  However, there are times when I simply crave plain ol' Mexican food and this wouldn't hit the spot.  You decide!
