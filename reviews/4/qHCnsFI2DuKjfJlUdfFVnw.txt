This is what Carne Asada is supposed to taste like.  The meat is so flavorful you can it by itself, with no salsa or toppings.

The little tacos are really tasty and the salsa bar is pretty great too.

If you order the full size tacos then you get freshly made tortillas.  That is a sign of a serious taco shop.

The food is not cheap but they make up for it with big portions and free chips.
