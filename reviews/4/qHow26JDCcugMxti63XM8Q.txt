This is a really great spot in Tempe. Authentic menu with lots to choose from. 

We seated ourselves and servers were quick to provide chips and salsa. Coke is served from the bottle which is a nice touch. 

The food was great. Ordered beef head, beef tongue and sausage and cactus soft tacos, along with a bean and cheese burrito with red enchilada sauce. The beef tongue taco was incredible and instantly became one of my favorite tacos. 

I highly recommend this place for authentic Mexican food in town. 

P.S. Get the beef tongue tacos!
