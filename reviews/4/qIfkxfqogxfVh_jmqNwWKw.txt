We were going to the Titanic artifact exhibition, decided to just have lunch at the Luxor, I was really glad they had a decent place to eat there.

They have brunch special 2 for 1 margaritas, we ordered top shelf ones, they were strong! Got a little buzzed after 2 of those. 

Chips and 2 kinds of salsa: so yummy, bit spicy, but so good. 

Shrimp ceviche with citrus broth, anise, tomato, tomatillo, cilantro, sesame seeds: so fresh and yummy. 

Albondigas soup, Mexican meatball, spicy tomato broth, mint: hubby loved it for his minor hangover 

Huevos con chorizo, Mexican spiced sausage, flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, potatoes, cotija cheese, salsa verde: I loved the potatoes in it, hubby loved the eggs and sausage

The food was so delicious, service was good, I wanted to order the tequila taster, too bad I don't like tequila, better not to challenge myself before our museum visit...;p 

Good brunch, we enjoyed it a lot, tab was $47, good value in Vegas. :)
