The portions you get at Ajo Als are crazy town! I ordered a taco and a tamale for lunch and I have never seen a tamale that gigantic before! Both were super tasty and I would for sure order them again! 

The chips and salsa are good. The service was a wee bit slow, we went on a Sunday afternoon and there weren't many people there.
