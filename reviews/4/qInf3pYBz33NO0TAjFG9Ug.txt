This place looks daunting from the street... run down and attached to what I think is a convenience store. The place looks just the same on the inside. You walk to the back of the place and order from a window and they call out numbers when the food is ready. They have a self-serve soda machine, which is a bonus because I'm a sucker for refills (but hate asking for them). 

We took our food to the tables outside (we cleaned one off ourselves) and had a nice chat in the AZ sunshine. The food was good, I just had a taco and a side of rice (we had just eaten a full meal a few hours prior) but they were delicious. Hoping to get back again soon!
