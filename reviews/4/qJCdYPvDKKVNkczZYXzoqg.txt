Great outdoor seating, local vibe, decent frozen margaritas and tasty tacos.

We like to go on Taco Tuesdays with the Phoenix family as it is practically around the corner, the girls love their waitress and we love the margaritas and shrimp tacos.  

Forget the ground beef tacos as they are mediocre.  Chips and salsa are decent but not memorable.  

If you want REALLY good food and frozen margaritas then go to Z-Tejas.
