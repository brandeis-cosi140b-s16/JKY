Friendly service & it just works for us :)

We've been coming here for years and we always order the exact same dishes! This is very unusual for me but it just works for us as we always share. We start with the chicken flautas which are always on point with some guacamole on the side & sour cream. We then move into the steak fajitas! We get our veggies cooked extra long & the flavors are on point. We always drizzle some extra fresh lime juice and the steak is cooked to perfection. 
We recently started adding the churros to our dinner because they are too good to pass up. Overall it's a very casual place and the service for the most part has been consistently good.
The Suncoast is definitely geared towards seniors and I actually like that! It's quiet and we just slip in to enjoy our meal & then we're out...
