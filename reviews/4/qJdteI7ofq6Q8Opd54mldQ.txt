If I've got to have some fast food, I may as well get something I enjoy. Chipotle always seems to hit the spot without being a grease bomb. I've had some issues with using the order ahead on the site and coming to pickup (showing up at or after recommended time and they didn't even have the order in front of them) but they usually can still have me in and out in a few minutes.

I haven't tried too many of the other things but everything I have tried, I've liked. My drug of choice? Black beans, sour cream, lettuce and pico, hot, and corn salsas.
