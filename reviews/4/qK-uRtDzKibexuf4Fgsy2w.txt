This is a great quick Mexican food restaurant. Like others have said, this is more than a couple notches above Filibertos but just a hair down from Manuel's, Aribas, or Macayo's. The hot sauce for the chips is great . . . Not too hot but not watered down like some spots. Go for their Pollo Fundido . . . . The best this side of Julio G.'s
