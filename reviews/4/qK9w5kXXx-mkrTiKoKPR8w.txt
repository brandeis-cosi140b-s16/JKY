My husband and I go to this Garcia's about once a week. The previous reviewer mentioned the food is spicy. I don't know what the food in VA is like, but Garcia's is extremely mild in my opinion. I grew up in Cali and have lived in AZ for the past 8 years so I grew up on Mexican food and love spicy foods. The salsa is extremely mild, much more sweet than spicy. And the bean dip? Very tasty but certainly not spicy. As far as Mexican food goes, Garcia's is right there alongside most Mexican restaurant chains. The reason I love them so much is their fajitas!! The marinade they use for the chicken is the best I have ever tasted. It is really the only thing I ever order there anymore. Another great thing about Garcia's is they have 2 "healthy" dishes available for people who are watching their waistlines. I have had both (Grilled Chicken Flautas and a Chicken and Spinach Quesadilla) and both are pretty good for lower calorie fair.

I would certainly recommend this Garcia's. Service is almost always good, it's never too crowded and the food is not bad and very affordable.
