Excellent breakfast burritos and chorizo platter. Also try the tacos, rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole. I wish the carnitas was actual shredded pork but it is more of a cut up pork chop. No complaints overall although I have had a french fry end up in my burrito once. Would also be nice if they packaged the food separately. If you get a combo that includes enchiladas they put the other item (taco, burrito, etc.) on top of the enchilada. Makes it a bit messy and would prefer the other item be wrapped separately. 

Staff is friendly and the food comes out pretty quick.
