Ate here today after work!  The exclamation point was unnecessary because I eat here a lot after work on Fridays.  Also eat here a lot on Saturday mornings.  That explains my weight gain.  The green sauce.  Get the green sauce/salsa.  Everything is good that I've ever had but the green sauce/salsa takes it to the next level!  Eff that red B.S!  Go green!  Usually get a taco and burrito.  Good prices, great green sauce/salsa!  Is it salsa or is it sauce?  You be the judge!
