Wade through the Atrium at the Wachovia building and head down the escalator.  Hang a right and you will see the line for Johnny's Burritos.  Even after 1:00 on a Friday the line was still out the door.  However, the line moves quickly and at the end of the burrito building process you walk away with your own custom burrito (or salad).

On my first visit Johnny started my veggie burrito order followed by 'regular size'?  After sizing up his customer.  He then went on to give me a cinnamon jaw breaker for Fireball Friday and explained that my take away bag would contain napkins and gum and that I should peel the foil and eat as I go.  After some encouragement that the first time was the hardest, I was on my way down the line.

You can finish your meal in the heat/air conditioning of the atrium for some extra people watching or on a nice day sit outside in the court yard in the sun or shade.  You can't beat that with a yummy burrito stuffed just the way you like it.  At the very least, you have to envy this guy for his enthusiasm and creativity.
