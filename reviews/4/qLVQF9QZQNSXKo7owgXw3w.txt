Zabas is a great place to go when you need a quick, fresh, Mexican inspired lunch. I used to come here after classes at UNLV and grab lunch before heading home to study. Now that I'm living in the Mountain's Edge area I don't get here as often as I would like. Typically I stop in when I'm at Aaron Brothers or Nordstrom Rack. It's a little treat in the middle of my shopping Saturdays. 

Their style is much like that of Chipotle, but I like that it is locally owned and operated, and not a national chain. They have obviously mimicked a style of Chipotle, but hey, it works so no complaining here. The restaurant is always clean, with plenty of seating.

I like to order the Grilled Chicken Salad or the Grilled Chicken Zaba Bowl. Their salsa and fixins have great flavor and are made with fresh ingredients. The guacamole is great and I love that hey have Cholula! Much better than Tapatio :)

Thank you Zabas for healthy Tex-Mex style food! Yummers!

oh, and you can order online now! Isn't technology neat?
