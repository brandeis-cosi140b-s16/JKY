We sat outside to enjoy The Strip view and were treated to a good, quick lunch. We ordered food and in less than 10 minutes it was at our table. Amazing. Try the tacos al carbon platter, street tacos on corn tortillas with fresh ingredients and nice spices.

The wait staff was laid back and cool. A great view and a nice meal.
