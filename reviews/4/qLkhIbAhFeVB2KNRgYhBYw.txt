Cash is King.

Was turned on to Los Mocajetes by a friend.  It's a quick drive from my work so it turns out to be my go to spot for a nice lunch.

Spanish and English menu, pretty straight forward.  They don't try to flood their offerings with BS filler items, they go straight to their featured item as the first thing listed.

The Molcajetes (volcanic pot) is basically a mexican mixed grill served in a warmed pot.  You get a protein along with some roasted tomato sauce, some veggies, edible cactus stripes, and some mexican cheese.  Your protein can be chicken, beef, shrimp, octopus, pork rib.  My wife loves the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajete, the Beef is what does it for me.

I've also tried their tacos, enchiladas, and quesadillas.  Surprisingly the quesadillas are pretty good.
