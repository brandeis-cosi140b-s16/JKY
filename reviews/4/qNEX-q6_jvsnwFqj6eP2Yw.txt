I had to write a positive review after my last two. And who better to review positively than Mad Mex?

This location is pretty huge and very busy at happy hour. We went on a Friday night and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table for two, but it wasn't a big deal. I had the Mad Mex burrito (if that sounds like the correct name) and a big azz frozen apple pie type seasonal margarita. Which hit me like a ton of drunken bricks halfway through my burrito. Wow! Tequila is both my friend and my enemy. Anyway. The margarita was delicious, the burrito was delicious, service was good, and I have no complaints. Everything I've ever had at Mad Mex is good :)
