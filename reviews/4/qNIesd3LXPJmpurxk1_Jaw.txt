Their beans are amazing and have been for the 20 years we've been eating here. The carne asada tacos are delicious, the guacamole luscious, the machaca and the chiliquilas plate is fabulous. Love their rice and their enchilada sauce. They have done a great job unifying the decor recently. The service is fast and always consistent. Oh, and if you go for lunch, they usually serve soup before the meal and it is yummy!! They do a great job with large parties too. Terry, one of the owners is always so welcoming.
