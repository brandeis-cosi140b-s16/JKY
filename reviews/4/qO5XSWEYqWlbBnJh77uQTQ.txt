If I had to pick one restaurant to eat at every day for the rest of my life, odds are very good that it might be Chipotle... they don't have a ton of options, but the food they serve up is fresh and top quality! I love that the chain goes out of their way to supply the freshest vegetables and as much naturally raised meat as  possible! The Steak Fajita Bowl is my go to dish, but you honestly can't go wrong here! 

This particular location is damn near spotless and staffed with some of the friendliest, accomodating folks you'll ever find in a fast food joint! The inside dining room is a lot smaller than other locations I've visited, making it hard to find a spot to sit if you're eating in during the busy lunch or dinner hours, however the patio offers ample room for overflow (when it's not 110 degrees out).
