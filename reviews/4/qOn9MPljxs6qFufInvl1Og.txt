Love the salsa, can't beat it if you like it somewhat mild.   Chips and salsa plus the hot salsa are free, and refilled in a snap.  Food is excellent and the menu varied.   Never been disappointed.
It is always clean, outside patio with mist and a smoking section, TVs throughout the bar area.  Service has been terrific.  Food is served hot and with fresh ingredients.  Parking on private lot, well lit.
