The atmosphere is what makes this place special. The food and margaritas aren't the best I've ever had (I'm admittedly biased coming from an area that has fantastic Mexican food) but they are pretty good. I like that they offer three different types of salsa with the chips as a starter. My one year old loves feeding the ducks and looking for turtles. Overall, this place is great for families and big parties. I will definitely be back.
