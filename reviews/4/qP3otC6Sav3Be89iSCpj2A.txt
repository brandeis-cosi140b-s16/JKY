my boyfriend brought me here for my b-day last weekend. we thought the food was decent and good portions, also not too expensive. for the cheap ass people who want a $4 burrito, why are you eating in the hard rock casino, ofcourse you are gonna spend a little more! we had a great waiter, he never kept us waiting for anything. Also the place is loud and fun, it has the hard rock vibe. all and all we had a great time and i would definetly come back.
