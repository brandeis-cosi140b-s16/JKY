Zaba's Mexican Grill is a good place to go to eat fresh food with healthy ingredients. It would be a good restaurant to go as a family, or with friends or associates for lunch or dinner. This would be a good place to have kid's parties too, as it is kid friendly. The burritos on the menu board  are big enough to share with someone else, or to take home to reheat for a second meal. No hours are posted at this new location, or on the flyers in their store. Zaba's Mexican Grill has six other locations in town also, that would be good to visit too.
