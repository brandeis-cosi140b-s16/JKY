I was really wanting good Mexican food so I met my wife here for lunch.  We arrived shortly after they opened.  The dining room was (predictably) empty so we were seated right away.  The waiter came out with chips and salsa and promptly took our drink orders.  The chips and salsa were your typical chips and salsa.  Nothing fancy.  The waiter (who, by the way, was engaging and very nice) brought our entrees.  I ordered the super enchiladas and they were really good.  My wife ordered a taco and chile relleno and she enjoyed it.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes (keep in mind we were there at about 11:15am).  I will most definitely be eating here again.
