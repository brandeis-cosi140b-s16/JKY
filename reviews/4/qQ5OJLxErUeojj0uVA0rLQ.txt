Very good Mexican food. Very casual, almost to the point of seeming like a self serve place, but there was table service. Not a ton of atmosphere, but service was friendly and food great. Mexican flag enchiladas were very good and chips/guac/salsa addictive. Full bar too, so being able to get margaritas was a plus too.
