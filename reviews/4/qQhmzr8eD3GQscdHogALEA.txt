Steak burrito, enchilada style was excellent!
I got mine with the cilantro rice, black beans, steak, and hot sauce.
Even though I got their hottest hot sauce it didn't seem spicy at all.
They put the enchilada sauce and cheese on top then send it through a little conveyor belt oven that toasts the top beautifully!
A little lettuce and pico on the side... yummy!
