This is my husband & I's favorite Mexican food in town. It's vegetarian friendly. I order the Cheese enchilada w/onions most of the time or Bean and Cheese Burro (burrito) with or without sauce and have never been disappointed. We always choose to eat in the bar, there is never a wait there and service is fantastic.
