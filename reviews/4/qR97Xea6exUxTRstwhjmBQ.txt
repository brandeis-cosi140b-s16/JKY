This has quickly become one of my favorite places for some good and inexpensive Mexican food. The location is easy to get into and out of which is a definite plus for take-out. I have tried probably over half of the menu and have never been dissapointed. My personal favorite is the fish tacos which come with a delicious chipotle sauce. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner and margaritas with some good friends. The staff is very friendly and helpful and delicious free chips and salsa are always a plus. One tip: don't order the queso, its a waste of money.
