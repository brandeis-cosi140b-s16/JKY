The above reviewer definitely got it right when he called Mama Lupitas the "ultimate hole in the wall" restaurant.  I didn't read a review on it but rather drove by it and decided to give it a shot.  Coming in, I saw it had an authentic Hispanic vibe to it.  The tables were clean and plentiful and i was promptly helped although when i went it was relatively empty.  I'm not a huge Mexican food fan so i tried the huevos con carne asade.  The steak was very good and seemed to be of high quality although the eggs were a bit on the small size portion wise.  The price was good and slightly cheaper than comparable Mexican places.

Overall the only annoyance i found was that the jukebox they have in there can get quite loud if you sit in a close vicinity to it.  That makes talking to someone quite difficult.  Thus I give this place a strong 4 out of 5
