If it weren't for the cleverly timed coupons that arrive with my mail, I wouldn't come here nearly as often as I do. (read: never)  Not that I'm here so much anyway, but enough. 

The regular prices are just high enough to exclude Pollo Loco from my normal rotation, but with those coupons, it's better than an even bet that they'll get me in the door.

Today's Carne Asada tostada and free taco were truly exceptional in flavor and value @$5.42 all in, and hit all the (appropriate) pleasure points. The well seasoned meat was a bit more than a tad past the perfect cook, yet eminently edible, including the well thought out ingredients for this very tasty "salad in an edible basket".
 With a delicious creamy cilantro dressing, a couple salsas and fresh lemon from the condiment bar, all is well in my world .

Service was, as usual for me here, pleasant and efficient, with only the most minor complaint over housekeeping. When the cashier came out to clean tables, she passed the salsa bar twice without giving it the quick wipe it could have used.

Other than that, Thumbs Up, Chicken- Pushers!
