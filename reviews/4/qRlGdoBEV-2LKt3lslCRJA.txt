Yum, tacos... Ok the thing that stood out the most was how fresh everything was. The salsa bar..a definite plus... I love a good salsa... My favorite the Strawberry Salsa.  Wholy cow was that good! The quesadilla was bigger than I've ever seen I couldn't finish it!!  Loved, loved loved the artwork, The only negative I could find was that the furniture for some reason felt a little awkward like I was in everyone's way while they were trying to get in line to order, but that really has nothing to do with the food.  I'm givin' this place a thumbs up... authentic and delicioso!
