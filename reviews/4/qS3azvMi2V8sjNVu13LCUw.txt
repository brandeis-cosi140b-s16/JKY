I have been going to serrano's now since 94.  How can you not love their chips, salsa and bean dip!  It's always fresh and delicious!  

Make sure to order a hard shell taco with beef with your meal, you won't be disappointed.  Their cheese enchiladas, tamales and chimichangas are all great choices.

They have daily specials and they get you in and out the door quickly.

BONUS: They sell fresh homemade tortillas there.  You can stop and pick some up to go and they are absolutely delicious!
