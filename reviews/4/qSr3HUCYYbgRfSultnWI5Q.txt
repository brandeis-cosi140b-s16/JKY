I'm proud to say that this was the first Mexican restaurant my parents ever took me to. I was six months old. 

My love for their food is undying. After every painful breakup, bad test grade and off day, I know I can run to this restaurant and be greeted with warm smiles and delicious food.

If their extensive menu confuses you, here are my favorite dishes:
Machaca scramble: amazing. I love breakfast foods and this makes eating breakfast for dinner easy and delicious.
Flautas: amazing. Especially with a side of beans.
Green chile burro: so good.
Anything with a tortilla is good. Their tortillas are the best.

And every meal is finished with free fried, sugar and cinnamon-coated crisps.

My only dig: Nearly everything is fried. There is no "light fare." But if you're in the mood for an authentic and delicious Mexican meal, look no further than El Bravo.

Word to the wise: You get faster service if you seat yourself in the room immediately to your left after entering the restaurant. If you sit in the first room you enter or the room to your right after you enter, you won't be served as quickly. (Just a little something I noticed.)
