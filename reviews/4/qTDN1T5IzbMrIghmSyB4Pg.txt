I hope writing a review after just one visit is not proven to be premature. But with that said I was very surprised how good the Carne Asada Burrito I received at Amando's was. The first thing that struck me was how hot and fresh the tortilla was. You can tell they make them fresh as they still have a hint of rough flour on the exterior. The place looks like a low budget fast food joint but on this initial visit I was quite pleased. I will stop there today for lunch and take a friend so look out for the follow-up!
