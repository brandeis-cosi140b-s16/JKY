I have been wanting to go to Carlito's for such a long time & I am so glad I finally did! As my husband is Native American whose family comes from New Mexico, he grew up eating NM food, which is different than Mexican food. But people don't understand that & give this place bad reviews because of their own ignorance. 

Anyway, the green chile is amazing. Haven't tried the red yet. Food was great, and there was a lot of it. My only gripe is that the fry bread & sopaipillas weren't 'all that.' My husband's grandmother knocks it out when she makes us fry bread! Comparing the food to what we had when we visited NM, it's very, very good. Santa Fe wins by mere inches though. 

They even have New Mexico chilis for sale! Connect with them on Facebook and they will post when the chilis come in and when they are roasting chilis.
