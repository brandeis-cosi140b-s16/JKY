It was really good. The service is excellent and it has some pretty cool ornaments; nice ambiance. We had the carne asada plate which was delicious. My gf had the menudowhich was not bad, just a bit too much fat on the menudo. 
The bring you chips, salsa and frijolitos mmmmm really good! It could use a bit more lighting in some areas.  They got this old guy playing music  from back in days.... de la era del caldo lol.
