I can only comment about the "Hard Chicken Tacos" since that is all that I have tried. But I have had them 4 times, and all 4 times they were great.

It's not easy to find "good hard tacos" in Phoenix.  Fast food chicken tacos are ALL crappy.  Some or most of the "Mexican" food restaurants try to fry their own corn tortillas and fold them into taco shells ( /Fail ) or just sell "rolled tacos."

These at Federicos are good taco shells which don't fall apart from the first bite, and don't get "soggy on the bottom" too soon.

The meat has a very good flavor - not too salty and not too spicy, but definitely not drab or bland.

Price is good too.  They run a special where you can get 5 tacos and a drink for like $5.29 or something.  It's crazy cheap, and the portions are not small.

It's my "go-to spot" for hard tacos.
