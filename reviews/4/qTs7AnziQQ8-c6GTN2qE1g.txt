Stopped in because of a free taco coupon. Very glad I did. Ambiance was updated casual. A step up from typical fast food. The cashier was friendly and personable. I ordered a chicken and steak taco without onions. The order came out with just cilantro, as requested. There were 3 salsas to choose from. Nice to have the variety as one I preferred with chicken and the other 2 were both tasty with the carne asada. I'm a huge iced tea fan. They had a very fresh tasty fruit flavored tea. I'll come back with my husband. I think he'll really like it too.
