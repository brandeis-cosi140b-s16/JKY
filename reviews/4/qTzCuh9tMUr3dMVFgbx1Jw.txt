We've been going here for 10 years or so. It's moderately expensive so eat here maybe once a year. Had forgotten how good the food is here. Negro Modelo on tap starts it all, the machaca is great, the chili rellanos are very mild, the standards are done well. Salsa is wonderful. 

Guards in the parking lot give you a feeling of being back in Mexico (and your car is safe), staff is friendly, bright inside, some nights there are roving mariachi groups.
