Ambiance - BASIC!  FOOD - Phenomenal!  The amount of Carne Asada in the small and large taco versions was enormous - price was VERY reasonable - the size and quality of the corn quesadillas   (I had the mushroom and added Carne Asada - and tons of the cilantro, onion, lime juice, and some of the red and green salsas all brought to the table in large quantity.  The Horchata was great - light on the sugar - with plenty of taste.  Anna our waitress provided great service and was very patient with a lot of questions - ready to go bk again....
