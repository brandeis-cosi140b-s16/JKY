There are few places that are delicious hole in the wall chains.  In fact there really are no hole in the wall chains except Two Hippies and they do it right.  Upon entering two hippies you will see all kinds of crazy decor like a twister mat on the ceiling, chairs... on the ceiling, etc.  Your food options consist of Burgers, Hot Dogs and Tacos, where as your beverage choices consist of regular stuff like various sodas to flavored tea and lemonade.  The flavored tea and lemonade is AMAZING, the flavor in the flavored teas is so good you don't even need to add sweetener, that's impressive.  The food is equally as delicious, I had 2 tacos one was fish (not fried, baked tilapia -so good and healthier) and green beef, they have a red beef and green both are cooked with different peppers and marinades,  The green beef was amazing I'm def. looking forward to trying the red beef as well as the "cactus" taco which is just insane sounding.  Two thumbs up, bring cash though because that's all they take :)
