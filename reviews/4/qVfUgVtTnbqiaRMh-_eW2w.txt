I came here for chips, four salsas, and a beer. Yep I said four salsas because you must ask for the hottest one. Could of been hotter but it mixed well with the bean dip. The hostess was very polite and conversed well. She was very descriptive of the specials, even told me what the bar specials were too.
I sat down and my server was quickly on me to get my drink! After giving me a few moments, she helped me choose my meal because I couldn't make a decision. We went with the Baja Chop salad, because I'm trying to eat better. But when it came out I could tell it was a high calorie salad. But good though so I ate it of course.

The staff was very attentive and I found them to be very friendly too. I don't come here a lot but I may have to start. Especially for the chips, salsa and Beer!
