I give the ambience of this restaurant more like 3-stars.  Our waiter was I believe the co-owner of the restaurant.  This place is definitely a "mom-pop" restaurant.  The owners were both very much there and very friendly.  I was very impressed with the food.  I had the shredded beef tacos with rice/beans.  The rice tasted like the rice my mother-in-law makes so definitely a family recipe.  The beef was excellent.   My husband had the carne asada and though the quality was excellent.  The margarita wasn't so great--too sweet but overall, a place I'd go back to.
