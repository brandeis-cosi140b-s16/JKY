Since moving to South Charlotte my wife & I have struggled finding a Mexican Restaurant with great food at a reasonable price. The struggle is over. Monterrey delivered great food, great service at a reasonable price. We are just mad it took almost a year of bad experiences before we found it. To top it off... I Love the Salsa!!!
