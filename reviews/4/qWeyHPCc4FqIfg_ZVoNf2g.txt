This is one of my regular fast food joints - fast food that is actually good for you.  I always enjoy the chicken burrito with black beans, cheese, medium salsa, sour cream and lettuce.  My wife enjoys having her burrito in a bowl not wrapped in a tortilla.

This is a national chain, but they do a good job of keeping the ingredients fresh.  The service is quick, as the counter people pass your food down an assembly line, adding the burrito stuffings right in front of you, then passing it on to you after prompt payment - cash, debit/credit cards accepted.

They have the usual fountain drinks, ice tea, beer and wine

Quick, easy and tasty.
