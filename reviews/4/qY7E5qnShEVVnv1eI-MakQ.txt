Yes, I'm a fan of Abuelo's- excellent food, great atmosphere, good prices. The chips served after you are seated are accompanied by 3 salsas (green chili citrus, hot verde and "regular") and all three are really tasty. They're unlimited but be careful, don't spoil your meal. 

If you like beef then try the Durango burrito. My wife always goes for the enchilada trio (chicken, avacado). You get to select from sides like rice, papas (mashed cheese potatoes with chilis), and various beans. The margarita list is solid, and the house ritas are really pretty good. There's a great lunch menu if you're visiting midday. 

The staff has mostly been friendly and attentive every time we've visited- the place is good for kids as they have  nice menu for the little ones. The "main room" has a skyscape painted on the ceiling, so our toddler enjoyed that room. For the quality of food, I think the price is right- although expect to pay a little more than Macayos or Serranos. It's worth it, go visit!
