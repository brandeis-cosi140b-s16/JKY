its the monday after a whirlwindish weekend in vegas. my head is throbbing, my stomach is slightly nauseous, and i'm sitting here with my camera in my hand flipping through the memories of this past weeked. WHY DO I NOT REMEMBER A DAMN THING? oh thats right. i had waaaaaayyyyyy too much to drink in a short amount of time. so as i flip through my camera i notice the following:

1. me looking relatively sober. i remember this pic. i think we were getting ready to go out. oh look how happy i look.
2. me at Tao. yes. i went to Tao. i remember that. 
3. me at Diablos with friends. where the hell is Diablos? how did we get there? did we take a cab? who's that weird guy in the back? 
4. me with my head in between the boobs of a woman sittng on the bar who is pouring alcohol down my throat. from the looks of her she works there. god, i hope she works there. do i remember this? not so much.
5. jagerbombs. lots of them. in a row. who bought these? 
6. tequila shots!?!???!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? wtf is wrong with my friends?
7. me smiling and sitting next to some guy. vague memories of him being from alaska maybe? alabama? one of the A states. sure why not.

i woke at 11a the next morning with a vague memory of awesomeness. according to my friends' accounts, i was in rare form and diablo's was there to provide all sorts of alcoholic debauchery. i also somehow managed to completely lose my treo and my dignity. 4 stars, diablo's.
