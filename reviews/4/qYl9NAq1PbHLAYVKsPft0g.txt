Came here before a game at the Cardinal's Stadium which allowed for a short 2 mile drive to the game from the restaurant.  The restaurant is moderate size with bar seating and we were able to grab a table for four without a problem.  The music, lighting, and TVs were all at the right level.

Having never been to the restaurant before we ordered a variety of items.  We tried the taco sampler plate, a chicken enchilada, and the house margaritas.  They also bring you house chips and salsa though I believe it is worth asking for their salsa verde and pico de gallo for $1 extra, their house salsa was way too thin for me.  The fish tacos were hands down the best item on their menu that we tried.  The fish was fried to crispy while still being moist and not greasy.  The creamy sauce and slaw complimented the fish well.  The rest of the tacos were okay but not as amazing.  The rice and beans side was small.  The house margaritas were weak but still refreshing.

I'd come back for the fish tacos and their fresh chips and salsa verde.
