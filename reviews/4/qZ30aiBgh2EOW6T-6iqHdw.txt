I was craving fish tacos and horchata so, I went here. I forgot they don't serve fish tacos. Oops! Well, I was already here so, I might as well get something else. Tacos El Gordo is always a good choice - most people would agree which explains the long lines at their other locations. I came at the right time when there was no line and the place was practically empty - it was weird.

I normally get the same items: adobada taco, carne Asada taco, Al pastor taco, horchata...and carne Asada fries when I feel like I deserve it. Great meat-tortilla-fixins ratio. The flavors are wonderful. And tacos are inexpensive. Sure, the horchata comes from a vending machine but I still like it. I can drink as much horchata as I want and take it home with me. Mmmm...

My bro-in-law likes their tripa taco. I don't eat tripe so, I'll just have to take his word for it.

The people that work here have been the friendliest group out of all the locations I've been to. They have more tables here than the other locations. This used to be a Sinclair gas station but the gas pumps are still there. Can I pump gallons of horchata?

I came home with puffy lips and itchy throat - I also forgot that tacos have tomatoes and I'm allergic to them. But how can you eat Mexican food without tomatoes??? The discomfort was worth it.
