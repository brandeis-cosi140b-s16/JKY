Tacos are great. Service is good. Price is a little on the higher side.  Cod and Mahi Mahi are the best tacos I had so far. Tried the lobster tacos and they were not as good as the other ones. 

Don't ask for water probably the worst tasting water in the state. Filtering or something not sure why. 

Baja sauce is delicious.
