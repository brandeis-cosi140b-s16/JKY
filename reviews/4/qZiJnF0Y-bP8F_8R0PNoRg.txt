Food was yummy, service was excellent. I got the "camarones al mojo ajo" it was very buttery, but I liked it. My hubs got "southwestern shrimp burrito" it was super creamy and heavy, but also very good. Our server was amazing! He was attentive, polite, but also gave us our space. I look forwArd to going back. Their mango shrimp quesadilla is legendary. It's my favorite things on the menu so far.
