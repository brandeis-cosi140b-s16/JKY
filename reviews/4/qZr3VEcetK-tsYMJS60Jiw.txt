Was a little nervous to try this place after reading some of the mixed reviews but went last night with a group of 10 coworkers and we all had a fabulous time. Our waitress, Cathy, was great - sweet, didn't mind making 4 separate checks, prompt with Food and drink service and refilled our waters without asking. Eric was also great - he seemed to be in charge of the chips and dip and didn't mind bringing our more than a few refills for us. Seriously some of the best bean dip I have ever had. And the salsa is super flavorful and fresh with big chunks of onions tomatoes and cilantro throughout. Also - ask for the spicy salsa. Doesn't have as much texture as the original but has a nice kick! Even the chips were great - thin cut and served warm. 

We each ordered some margaritas on the rocks which were tasty. Not the best I've ever had but they will do. Several coworkers also ordered a variety of Mexican beers which they enjoyed. 

When we finally ordered the food, it all came out timely, correctly, and at the perfect temperature. Everyone seemed happy with their meals. Some of us were just too full from chips to finish though. Cathy didn't mind bringing boxes though! I ordered the pollo ranchero. The chicken is diced and mixed with tomatoes, green chili, and onion. This was the best part of the dish. The refried beans were yummy too but the rice was a bit bland. Would have liked a side of the guacamole which was on every other entree plate except for mine. But I was able to steal a bit from someone next to me. The dish also came with two large tortillas which weren't even necessary but were a nice addition. They were a bit charred which gave them an awesome flavor. Finally, the fresh Serrano pepper on the plate is a cute touch! 

We had brought our own cake for this occasion and Cathy didn't mind bringing out fresh forks and side dish plates for us. She didn't force any of the restaurants desserts or coffees on us either. 

Overall, I would come here again!
