I purchased a groupon for Super Mex.  I can't belive I never knew about this place.   It's not a fancy place, we got a seat right away.  The waitress sat us down, and  took our drink order.  Ok, I can sometimes be typical, I wanted a strawberry Margrarita, then she started rolling off other flavors.....Whoa, hold up, wait a minute.  My husband isn't even a Margarita kinda guy, but she mentioned a blue something margarita on the rocks, that sounded really good.  So My husband ordered that.  I decided to go with the Mango Margarita.  Well, she thought I was going to stick with the strawberry margarita, so she brought that out?  I reminded her I wanted the Mango Margarita!  Oh...she forgot, so she gave me the strawberry one on the house.  It was good, I prefered the mango over the strawberry, but I really liked the blue one my hus
band got on the rocks!  I'm not an on the rocks kinda gal either, but it was awsome.
The chips and dip!  OMG, I've never been to a place where they fry the whole corn tortilla!  yea, the whole round thing!  lol  You get bean and pico de galo.  Not bad.  My husband order a burito, it was huge, with this green looking guacamole on the  side, but don't let the looks of the guacamole, fool you!  It was good!  I order the combo plate.  Rice beans, tamale, and enchillada, all shreadded beef.  I really didn't think I was going to like the tamale...yep, another shocker!  I really liked it, the rice and beans were on point.  This place is open 24 hrs, we will be back.
