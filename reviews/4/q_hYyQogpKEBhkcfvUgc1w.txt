Don't be fooled by the whole in the wall look & the vacant building around. The food is awesome. This is one of my favorite burrito places. I almost exclusively go here. The steak & bacon burritos are our favorite. The burgers are ridiculously flavorful. They cook them on real mesquite wood. You can smell it a mile away. Imagine it if you will. The labor, the passion, the cost to cook on wood & pass that flavor in to the customer. And the service is good.
