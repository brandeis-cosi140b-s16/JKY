As a veteran of So Cal Mexican food some 30 plus years, I feel qualified to say this is the real deal on Mexican food. Its upscale, the decor and the menu prices reflex this but in the end, they deliver the goods when it comes to bringing your table great Mexican food. Reservations are recommended on the weekend as this place was packed by 7pm!
