Mall food courts. Not known, at least in these parts, to be the haven of exemplary eats....Most malls have your basics covered, chinese, mexican, pizza, burgers and so on. 
Tony's, however, is really a step above the average. The food is really really good. Ok, so they don't make their own tortillas on site, big deal. The food is fresh and prepared to order and best of all, the dudes making the food are super nice and will customize just about anything. 
I kind of order off the menu a lot and they were more than careful that they got my order right, double checking with me as they went, "Sir, you don't want onions, right? Why you are correct  my man!"
They have a selection of lunch combo plate specials and even with that, their prices are pretty inexpensive. 
Sorry Hot Dog on a Stick, sorry McCrappy's...Tony's gets my money every time
