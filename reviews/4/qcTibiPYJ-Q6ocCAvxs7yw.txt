NOT your everyday fast food Mexican restaurant! You will be pleasently surprised and find that you will return again and again to Tortas el Guero.

What the heck is a Torta you ask? It is a traditional sandwich on a lovely homemade style bread that they serve in several sizes from regular to a gargantuan creation suitible for small armies.

The menu is quite diverse, covering simple combinations that you have likely had someplace else to some that typical Americans will find truely unusual. The Cubana seems to be the favorite amongst the folk in my office, but the Pastor, (Spicy seasoned pork and pineapple), and the Chipotle Beef are also some of my own favorites. Rest assured though that they are all delicious and worth coming back for.

The tacos are smaller than you are used to seeing, but there are four of them on a plate and they contain any number of delicious offerings. A large selection of quesadillas are also offered and can be a meal all on their own.

There is a fresh "salsa bar" that has fresh cucmubers, seveal different hot sauces, pico, quacamole and fresh limes to bring even more flavour to your meal.

Everything on the menu is less than $9.00 with most of the tortas being $6.00 or less, so the value is very good. Atmosphere is, well, it's a sandwich shop so there really isn't much in the way of atmosphere. But hey, the food makes up for that!

Come by and give Tortas el Guero a try, you will enjoy it!
