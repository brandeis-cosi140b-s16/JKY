First time trying this place and will come back. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. 

The lunch portions are great size and accompanied with delicious chips and salsa. If you want the hotter salsa you have ask for it. 

I ordered the Spinach Enchilada were good if you love leafy spinach. Did not care for all the ends with the enchilada.
