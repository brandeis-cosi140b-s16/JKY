Went here last Saturday night for dinner on a blind date and was impressed w/this little diamond in the rough! Be careful that you don't drive past it - their signage is not lit up at night and not very big and I flew right by it! 

Yes, it's nothing too fancy/pretty, but the food is great and the customer service is fast and friendly. I had the cheese enchilada and beef tamale and couldn't finish it - it was pretty tasty! My date had the Shrimp Javier and said he always orders that and seemed content with the quality. We both had ice cold Pacificos and had a great evening. 

I will definitely be back for more!
