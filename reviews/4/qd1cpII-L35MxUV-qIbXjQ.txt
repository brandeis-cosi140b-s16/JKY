We come here on every Vegas trip we take. Time and time again it turns out to be one of the better meals we have in Vegas. We always get the same thing, the carne asada breakfast burrito. It's mad cheap and very satisfying. I've been to all the foofy places on the strip too like Robuchon, Savoy, Gordon Ramsay's and Bobby Flay's places, STK....yeah no thanks. I don't see the point in dropping a mortgage payment on one meal. If you're on a date or trying to impress a lady don't take her here. If you're hung over to the wall and need some sustenance to detox this place is it. It'll leave you plenty of money to retox that night.
