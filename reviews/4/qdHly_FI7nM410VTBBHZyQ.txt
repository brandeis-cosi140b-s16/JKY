We eat here constantly for lunch - fast - consistent - awesome mexican food and bomb pastry's too. Those cone things... get one... you can thank me later.

They do take debit and good chips and salsa while you wait but I've never had a lunch order come out more than ~6 min wait. refills on cokes and chips and a small little dining area but it's classic chandler hole in the wall with awesome food.  You have to go here
