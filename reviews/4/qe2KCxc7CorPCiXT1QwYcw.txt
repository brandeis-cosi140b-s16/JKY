So ... this review is based on my memory, which in fact was slightly, um, obscured by some beverages.

Here's how it started; looking for my cousin -- "Whooooo!" Girl, there you are! We park at the bar -- promptly order margaritas. Another couple people join the group, "Whoooooo!" I think there are about 12 of us scattered in this group around the bar.

My other cousin finds *something* in her drink. This is where things get hazy. Not quite sure if it was a hair, bug, or a body part at this point. The bartender gives us all free shots, "Whoooooo!" Here we go again.

Next thing I know is I hear Sly mention that she has had 9 drinks already. Didn't we just get here? Isn't it only noon? Didn't my plane just land?

I need a nap. Next thing I know is that I wake up at 4:00, somehow I am back in my room, I slap some eyelashes on for the party ....

good times.
