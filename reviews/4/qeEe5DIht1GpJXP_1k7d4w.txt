I definitely can do Chipotle once a week... on a good week, I can go there twice.   There has to be something said about doing simple things well, and Chipotle excels here.  Their menu and ingredients are simple and not too complex.  Sure, you may not get a variety, but at least they know what they are doing as far as what they do provide.  

My usual go to is a chicken bowl, white rice, pinto beans, chicken, medium salsa, corn, guacamole, and lettuce.  When they are out of guac, I usually go the cheese route... but you can't go wrong.

Depending on if there is a line, (usually there is) you can get your food and be eating within 5min which is great.

This location has parking in the back - off of a busy South Blvd, I'm sure they are not hurting for business with all the other shops around this location.  Just be careful when you pull out of the parking lot due to the Chipotle food comma you WILL receive (it's just a matter of time).
