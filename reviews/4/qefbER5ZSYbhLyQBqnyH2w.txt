This place wasn't bad at all!

I went with a co-worker for lunch. I Love the colors inside the place.
Vey bright!!
I got the taco/enchilada lunch plate.
It was very tasty, and honestly pretty on-par with what you would expect from a Mexican joint for lunch.
The one thing that I DO like very much is the roasted corn that they put in their rice. YUMMMM!  That's is a big time win in my opinion.

I have been to one other Plaza Bonita; in Cottonwood.
I ordered the Pollo Mole.  
AMAZING! 
I wish there was a better way to present it, as it looked like Chinese style stir-fry chicken, on a plate of chocolate soup. LOL
BUT, after I ate all the chicken, I asked for extra tortillas( which were kindly retrieved), and I sopped up the remaining mole sauce( which is sweet, with a hint of peanut butter)
I have yet to find a Mexican place here in AZ that matches a place back east called EL TORO.  Im hoping to find one.
Plaza Bonita is it so far.
