I've been going to Los Olivos for years now and it's still one of my favorites. No matter what you get it's great! Service is great as well. There is a reason this restaurant has been opened as long as it has and attracts the crowds it does. 

Great homemade mexican food, great drinks, and great location (both locations have great food and service).

Certainly worth a try if you haven't been.
