In L.A., you see Mexican fast-food-ish-type restaurants who feel the need to offer you not only Mexican, but burgers and fries, too...at Acapulco, however, they've traded burgers and fries for sandwiches. I'm not really sure I get the whole Mexican-Sandwich Fusion concept, but I thought the food was pretty good nonetheless.

I ordered the Chicken Cheese Quesadilla Lunch Special, which was pretty scrumptuous...and was actually quite a lot of food, particularly for lunch (which I love, cause I'm always complaining that lunch portions are too small...). The plate was kind of piled high with quesadilla goodness, and it came with a nice, big side of guacamole (I love guacamole...). The quesadillas themselves were dripping with grease a little more than I cared for, but besides that, no complaints...they tasted great (lots of cheese and chicken) and were especially good with a little guac smeared on top...mmmmm.....

I'm sure I'll be back here again.
