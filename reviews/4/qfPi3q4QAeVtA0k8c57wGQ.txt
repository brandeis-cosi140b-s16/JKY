I went to Blanco for drinks with my husband and a friend.  My blood orange margarita was spot on... YUM!  We also had two desserts: donuts and sundae.  They were both very good and I recommend getting both together because then you can dip the donuts into the ice cream.  I was only here on vacation otherwise I would stop in frequently for drinks!
