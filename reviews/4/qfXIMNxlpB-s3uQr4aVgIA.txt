It's been on my mind to try this place and when a friend invited us to a birthday party at The Clarendon, it seemed like the perfect opportunity.  The restaurant itself was quite cute.  The house margaritas are outstanding and clearly NOT from a big plastic jug labeled "Margarita Mix" (I'm talking to you Canteen Modern Tequila).  The service was a little slow but it was quite crowded and we were not in hurry.  The chips and salsa were delish but as a longtime Phoenix resident, I bristle a bit at having to pay for them.  Based on the experience of previous Yelpers, I stuck to the tacos.  My carne asada taco was delicious.  My ahi taco was awesome but I should note that it seems to be a seasonal item.  Everyone at my table was pleased with their meals.  The drink menu was extensive and this seems like a great happy hour destination.  Ole!
