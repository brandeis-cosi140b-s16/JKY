It took a couple recommendations to get me to stop. Tucked in a strip mall, it's easy to overlook. However, I have to say the chicken taco plate rivals any of my fave hole in the wall Mexican places. The interior is a blend of repurposed Pick Up Stix chairs and a giant photo menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner options. The prices are super affordable, and the service was pleasant. I was in a rush and opted for takeout. They forgot my side of guac, but the flavor of the marinated chicken more than made up for it. I intend to swing in for breakfast and definitely for my next taco fix.
