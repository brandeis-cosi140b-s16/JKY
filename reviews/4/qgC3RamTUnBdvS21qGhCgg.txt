The decor and Margarita's were both amazing! Very fun vibe in this place, and I love that one side of the bar is open street side for some fresh night air, and so you still feel connected to what's happening on Mill Ave. 

The bartenders are super attentive and fun, but the wait staff are constantly changing tables which takes away from the relationship aspect of dining and can be confusing when you're trying to pay your tab and leave. 

Wasn't very impressed with the food - the salsa for the chips tasted like ketchup and BBQ sauce, and the fish tacos were just OK. 

Summary: great place to go for drinks and atmosphere (sit at the bar), but make your dining plans elsewhere.
