There are so many reasons to love Chevy's!
Awesome table side guac. It's delish and they will adjust the spiciness and chunkiness to your liking. They do great promos all the time, like buy one combo get one for a penny. Fresh homemade tortillas that you can watch being made! Fruity margaritas! Prickly pear, melon, etc.

I am a very picky eater, and a vegetarian, but they are always willing to make substitution and make things totally fresh to accomodate me. This is one of the few places I will drive 25 minutes to eat at.
