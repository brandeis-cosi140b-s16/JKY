Not that Taco Bell would normally be considered a Four Star restaurant ~ however when rating Taco Bell's to each others. . .this location is very good. It's in a great location so it's quite busy yet its always very well maintained ~ doesn't seem to have a lot of turn over ~ very well trained friendly staff. The menu is always changing ~ nice variety ~ always fresh. 

It's a blessing to have a inexpensive clean place to grab a bite to eat.   Love that Taco Bell has gotten on the healthy food option train.  It's good . . .and getting better. 

Blessings
