Great service here! When Jack is working the window everything is always perfect. He makes sure your taken care of, always with a smile on his face! Nice people make your eating experience and mood change completely!!! I would give this location 5 stars if they didn't close earlier than normal Taco Bells. They are my closest location from home...
