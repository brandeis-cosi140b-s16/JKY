Rubio's is pretty pricey for Mexican fast food, but they specialize in seafood. And if there's anything Long John Silvers has taught me, it's not to go cheap on seafood.

Anyway, I'm a big fan of Rubio's fish tacos and mango crispy shrimp tacos. The roasted salsa also is tasty, although the chips could use some work. Rubio's beans flat-out stink.

For a combo of two tacos, chips, beans, salsa and a large drink, expect to pay about $9.
