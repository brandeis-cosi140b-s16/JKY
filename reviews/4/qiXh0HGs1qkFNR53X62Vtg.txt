Yay, still a fan.  Menu needs updating, and would be great if they had more specials.  Also, the house margarita is good, but I liked it better when they squeezed the limes at the time of order, not premixed as they do now.  Simple solution, just order a margarita with a tequila other than what the use in the house, which is El Jimador.  Might I suggest Chamucos.  I also agree with Kaite W, bring back the killer Chilie Rellano.
