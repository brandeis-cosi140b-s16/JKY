It is brave to make yet another Mexican restaurant in an area flooded with them. The key here is uniqueness.

At first I was a bit reluctant as restaurants in hotels don't tent to be that great.

On the outside there is a bright orange eatery inside a repainted old hotel. The entrance is also the hotel lobby entrance, and the hostess stand is located awkwardly in the middle of the dinning room.

For lunch it was quiet busy with with many parties of 2 filling up the 4 tops and a sole person holding down a table of 8, so we sat at the dark bar.

A quick glance at the menu found a few veggie options like veggie tacos and fish tacos. I went with 2 veggie one fish and we split a guacamole.

The guacamole was good, rough mashed avocado with cojeta cheese on top. The real star was the red hot sauce, it was thick like a paste, and had a really deep flavor beyond that of just spicy. The chips were nothing special.

Our tacos arrive in a neat meal \/\/\/ . With one lime per 3 tacos.  The veggies were good nicely roasted with a nice texture and savory rich flavor. The tortilla was a crude hand made tortilla that had a moist thickness to it that I liked.  The fish in the fish taco had a great flavor sear to it.

I saw on the board a 2 for 1 taco Tuesday that would be a great deal. Either way I just want more of that hot sauce.
