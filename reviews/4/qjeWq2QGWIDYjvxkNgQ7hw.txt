Let me start by saying I'm really into tequila.  Ok, really, really into tequila...Juan Jamie's has a diverse selection of tequila's (80 or so) and for me, this place is all about the happy hour special.  Two tacos and two pours of premium tequila (anything under $15/pour) all for $18.  Super cheap.  My receipt had something like a $20 discount off normal prices (even their normal prices are are on the lower end for what I was drinking).

In addition, the bartender was jovial and knowledgeable about the selections.  I'll be back the next time I'm in Chandler!
