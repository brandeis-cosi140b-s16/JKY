Yeah :) Tamales here are awesome :) My husband and I were driving around and decided we would stop when something sounded good for dinner....Mexican sounded good. So, we got our pacificos and ordered some tamales and a burrito. The been burrito was nothing special, but the cheese tamales were incredible!! My hubby really liked the chicken ones as well. We will definitely be back to eat more tamales. They were excellent and made for happy food babies in out bellies :)
