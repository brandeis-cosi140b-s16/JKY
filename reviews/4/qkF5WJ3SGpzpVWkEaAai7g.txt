This place is amazing! It's like a more upscale Mexican place that gives you better quality food in more of a Scottsdale, contemporary casual setting, at a very good price.

I came here for lunch a few weeks ago. There's a really nice shaded outdoor seating area, an awesome lunch menu with delicious drinks (they have a full bar), and approachable, friendly service. 

I had the Linguica (portuguese sausage) with house rice, and also tried the braised short ribs with house rice. Both dishes were amazing! I also had the Mexican Martini, which is basically just a delicious margarita.
