Another great meal at El Rico's. I had the flautas and my husband had the tacos.  Best chips - I could go there just for this reason. We really enjoy their normal salsa... aren't too impressed with their "hot" salsa. I really enjoy spicy salsa, and I found this tone rather bland and not that "hot".  Thankfully their normal salsa is exceptionally good!!
