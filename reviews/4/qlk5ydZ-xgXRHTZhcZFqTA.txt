Patio seating is great. Waiters are awesome. Food is middle of the road. It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.  Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.  Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.  It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town.
