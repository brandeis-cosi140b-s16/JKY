Very good carne asada. They serve it in tacos, burritos or plates including rice and beans roasted jalapenos and roasted onions, YUM! They also have Mexican sodas that are made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup, which tastes way better. They also have a fresh salsa and vegetable bar which is really good. Delete reason to grade down from 5 to 4 would be that rarely and I mean rarely the steak is somewhat tough. But when that happens or just send it back and they replace it for me.
