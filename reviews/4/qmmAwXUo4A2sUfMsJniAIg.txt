I love Yolo's! Def a great spot to get some bomb Mexican food. Their drunken noodles are amazingly delicious as is their spicy chicken tortilla soup. This place will def be visited every time I come to Vegas.

They also have a hookah night on Saturday's for $25 a hookah (so I was told) and they had a DJ Sunday night.

Service was very polite and courteous.
