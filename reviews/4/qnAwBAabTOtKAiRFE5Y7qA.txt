Stopped in here for lunch as I needed to do laundry across the parking lot and I am not disappointed. Had an asada taco, fish taco, chicken, pastor and lengua tacos.. all tasted great. Rice and beans were worthy side dishes, one might think how hard is it to make rice and beans...apparently you've might not have eaten in Utah where the local flavor is "bland"

If you love Americanized Mexican food and never venture of the well beaten path then do not bother. This restaurant is definitely on the road less traveled and turned out to be a fantastic experience for me.

For you heat and spice lovers you will find the kick here that burns going in and coming out.
