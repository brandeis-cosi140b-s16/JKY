Macayo's oh Macayo's, how I do love you so so MUCH.  I have been going to Macayo's for over 15 years of my life.  When I moved away it was the very first place I requested to go when I got off the plane.  My grandma knew almost all the staff, which were extremely friendly by the way! 

My favorite thing to get here is the bowl of albondigas  soup and a large TCT; *drool*.  I have tried other things of course such as the yummy cheesy enchiladas, the big tasty chimichangas, and rolled tacos.

I have never experienced bad soup, chiladas, or TCT; and I'd say I have been well over 200 times so that's a pretty good record.  I must say though, hence why I had to minus a star, there have been a handful of times when I have gotten chicken items to find it was over cooked and flaky.  I would have to say it's hit or miss; but the other three items- you just cannot go wrong.  

Hawg dawg, now I need to go get some! :D
