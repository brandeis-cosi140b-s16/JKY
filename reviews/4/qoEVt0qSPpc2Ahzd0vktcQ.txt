A HOT Dog Buffet you say? (yes a hot dog buffet and it is real good). Robin N. Rand H. and myself went here for lunch and it looked like they were going to get one or two stars because most of the trays were empty. Well as it turned out they have all these empty trays but they cook your dog when you order it which is much better anyway. There are about ten different hot dogs you can order and 3 I ate were all great. They also have all the hot dog condiments imaginable. The BBQ chicken wings are also very good.So if you like a good hot dog you will love G's.
