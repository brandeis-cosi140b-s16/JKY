Went there while in Phoenix for work.  The ambience was nice and the food had a lot of flavor. 


I am not sure why other reviewers expected authentic mexican.  Walking into the place, you can tell this wasn't a typical mexican restaurant.  This food was more southwestern type cuisine, rather than mexican.  I'm from southern California and you figure out mexican places based on the menu.

The salsas were flavorful.  I ordered the enchilada suizas.  the tomato cream sauce was great.  a lot of flavor.  Used the leftover sauce to dip chips.
