Yikes... as much as I frequent this place, I am puzzled as to why I haven't reviewed it - or maybe I reviewed another location by accident.  Anyways....  This location at Overstreet is super convenient to my office so I do get breakfast AND lunch here often.

During the lunch rush, this place can be a mad-house with the line that stretches from the start of the counter out into the Overstreet mall main drag.  There is a dividing wall to keep it all together and make sure no one jumps the line and they recently added some extra pony walls for the dine-in guests to have more privacy and more crowd control (my bet).

The folks working the line are always nice and the line moves fast (if customers know what they want and how the system works).

This location also does breakfasts and lunches for offices so sometimes you can see the booths on the side of the restaurant are occupied by items for catering.
