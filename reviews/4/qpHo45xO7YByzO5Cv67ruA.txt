I might a bit of a snob when it comes to tacos being from southern Cal, but Roberto's is really good. This location is my favorite in town - you would think they would all be the same, but this location is the best.

The portions are big, the food is cheap, and it tastes good. It's a little greasy, but hey, it is a taco shop. All of the meats are marinated and have good flavor. The burritos are awesome and huge, tacos come fried or soft shell, and then the Super Nachos.... I think these  break the maximum calorie barrier, but they are good.

Staff here is nice. They are quick, good cooks, and the cashiers will joke around with you on occasion.

No alcohol here, but the place is connected to a bar.

We have a different Roberto's closer to us and we drive a little out of the way for this one. Good place, good food.
