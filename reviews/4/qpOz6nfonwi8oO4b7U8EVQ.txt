This location is pretty much always busy. I didn't know the opening time and arrived 5 minutes before the doors opened. There was already a line, and employees opened early to accomadate.

Service was a bit slow, but understandably so, since it was so early and certain menu items were still being prepared. I managed to get everything I wanted into my burrito bowl without any problems; the employees take customer requests with aplomb.

The prices at this particular location seem a bit steep after having lived several years on the east coast, and I was a little disappointed that I had to pay more here for the same meal at a restaurant chain.
