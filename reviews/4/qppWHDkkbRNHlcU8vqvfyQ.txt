Good, fun place to hang out.  Good bar drinks, and their street tacos were very good, any variety, we had them all.  A bit disappointed with their nachos though.  Some of the chips were soggy when first delivered to table, and not enouth spice to make them stand out, but otherwise tasty.  Good service and very friendly staff.
