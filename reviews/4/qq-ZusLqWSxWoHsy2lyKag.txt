Fresh Chips and salsa/ queso are awesome. My steak burrito wasn't seasoned but weighed about 2 lbs.. I would have seasoned it myself , but there weren't any salt/pepper shakers, or hot sauce on any of the tables and the in attentive Wait staff was of no help. My friends chicken fajitas were great and seasoned well. Service was slow as molasses. Overall a good experience. Just don't be in a rush to get out
