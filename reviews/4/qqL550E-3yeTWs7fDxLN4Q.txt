Believe it or not, I'm not crazy about Mexican food. I think it started 30 years ago on my trip to Puerto Vallarta...ended my week there having Montezuma's revenge. I know it's not the food, but it didn't help. 
Celebrated my daughter's birthday there and she ordered the Chicken Fundido, my wife had the Mexicano and I had the tequila lime shrimp. The food was piping hot...I mean, when you took a bite, you had to swirl it in your mouth to cool it. The food was excellent. If you plan on dining there, call a couple of days in advance to make a reservation. Even though it's been open several months, on a week day, there are still patrons waiting 40-45 minutes for a table.
