This is one of my families favorite Mexican resturants. My daughter loves the baja pizza. The appeitizers are large enough to eat as meal within itself. I also love the Grande Chimmi dinner either chicken or pork. I've also tried out the salmon which was really tasty. All in all a great place to have Mexican food.
