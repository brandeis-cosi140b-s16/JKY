The foot long burrito. Omg. I have been wanting to come to this place for months! The drive thru wait was about 15 mins (assured me they were actually making my food and not just defrosting it), the hot salsa was actually really hot! Which I loved, and there was only one person in the drive thru ahead of me (which further explained the wait). It always looks empty when I drive by but that is no indication of the food, will definitely be back!
