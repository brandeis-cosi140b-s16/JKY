YAY!!!  I FINALLY found street tacos in Scottsdale that are quite tasty and hit the spot when I have my King Taco or El Taurino (both in LA) cravings!  

Priced at $1.25 each, they fit in the palm of your hand and you can choose your meat preference.  I got the carne asade & steak and then they top it with onions and cilantro.  The chicken rolled tacos were quite good also and they were perfectly fried with a soft crunchy texture.   I'd recommend both without hesitation.

AND, if you like spicy, you gotta try the habanero sauce.  I like spicy but this really knocked my socks off.  I probably sniffled for a few hours.

Don't expect gourmet.  This place is quite the dive but pretty authentic :)
