Order tacos at the right bar and everything else at the left. Then slide on over to the cashier to pay. Pretty confusing layout since the cashier protrudes out closest to the entrance.

Everything is customizable as you go along the food bar when they prepare your food and they have many additional options of salsa and add-ons at their salsa bar. Had delicious lengua tacos, but my carne asada taco was way too salty that I barely even touched it. Chicken nachos were also very good and only $5 for for decently large sized portion during their happy hour. The other drink and food items on their happy hour also looked very enticing. 

Pretty nice atmosphere, especially when compared to LA for street-style Mexican food.
