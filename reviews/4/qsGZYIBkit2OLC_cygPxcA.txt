I'm gonna update this Roberto's because the overnight chick is now wicked awesome. Have ordered from her a couple times and she is smiley, likes her job, and gets stuff right. 

This morning, my tortilla was scalding hot because it was so fresh. I would much rather be burned than have gross old tortilla enveloping my breakfast deliciousness. Much deserved star bump for the overnight chick! Roberto, give her a raise!
