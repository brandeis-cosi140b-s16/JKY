Las Tapatias is a new Mexican restaurant that's opened about 2 blocks North of Sahara & Maryland. It's not fancy like other Mexican places close by, it's pretty sparse and basic and has the hard eat it and beat it seats. But I've found that a lack of decor can quite often mean that the owners are more focused on the food. 

When it comes to ordering here the menu is in Spanish so I'm grateful for the pictures, (I snapped a picture of the 1 page menu for everyone to see) and that the owner speaks limited English. I ended up playing it safe with a chicken quesadilla and chicken taco...as you can see from the pics this didn't come with rice and beans or other Americanized side dishes. It is what it is, and the quesadilla was huge. And I didn't have to go to the counter to get it, it was brought to me, the same as my Mexican Coke was. 

I do wish that my chicken had been a bit spicier, but again I don't want to slam this place at all because most likely my wishes stem from a failure to communicate on my part. I gotta learn my Spanish at least when it comes to food. But what I got tasted pretty good, and I will be going back to try more stuff on their menu. And one last thing...I didn't leave here hungry. They have several drink choices in a glass cooler and it appeared they were making drinks...I saw fresh pineapples and other things there but was sitting far enough back and too busy eating to see what he was making. Again for those who are stuck on this side of town for lunch, it's worth a try. After all one can't eat Thai food every day (well you can but), so this offers some variety.
