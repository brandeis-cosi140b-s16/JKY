My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place one Sunday while driving around, passing time and looking for cheap Margaritas!  This is the place for that!  @2.75 margaritas during Happy Hour.  $3.75 during regular hours.  Who can compliant right?!  My point exactly!

Both times I've been I ordered the combo fajitas (whitefish and shrimp).  They're excellent!  My boyfriend ordered the grilled zucchini for an appetizer and finished with the Grande Burrito... both excellent!

We had the pleasure of meeting some of the owners during our first visit here.  They were really, really cool, fun and nice!  

Give it a shot you'll enjoy it!
