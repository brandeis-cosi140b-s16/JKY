Was out last night at a mixer at PT's pub... I pretty much go every friday night. 
It was late and after a couple of cocktails and no food ... it was time for food .. .seriously! 
El Pollo Loco is in the same parking lot so me and my friend Hoss headed over and got some chicken. 
I have typically had hit and miss meals with el pollo loco , sometimes I will get chicken and it will be raw in the middle ... that or just over cooked. 
Last night it was perfect. I love how they marinate this chicken it just tastes so stinkin good.  So I pretty much devoured it like a wild animal (not eating since 9 am will do that to a girl and it was 1030pm) 
I have to say I am not crazy about their mac n cheese... and their potatoes are a little funky ... but the chicken was a double plus good. 
I might have to remember to do this again next week.
