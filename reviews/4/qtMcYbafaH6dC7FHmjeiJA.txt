Been coming here for over 25 years making this one of our first stops for Mexican food in the Valley. Chips and salsa are supreme. Light and crispy. Salsa is fresh and flavorful. Spinach queso like no other. Had my usual #2, red enchilada, shredded beef taco and tostada.. Way more food than most people can  consume. Had to have shredded beef taco first, the best anywhere.  Red ench next and easily done but no room for tostada. Although the food was very good it wasn't as good as I've had. Always five stars but this trip was 4****. Still definitely worth a stop for authentic Mexican flavors.
