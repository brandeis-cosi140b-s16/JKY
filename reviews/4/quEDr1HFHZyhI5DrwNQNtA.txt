This was my first visit here.  It was almost a 3-star review, but I am bumping it to 4-stars because they have a $5.95 menu with a few popular items that comes with their regular menu.  I'm pretty sure that no other Mexican restaurant (or any restaurant for that matter) hands you a "cheap menu" along with their regular menu!  

For a small family like mine, the $5.95 worked perfect.  Order one entree off the regular menu, order one off the cheap menu, and you can walk out of there at dinner for less than $20.  

They serve chips and salsa at every table - the chips are served as whole tortillas and you have to break them up to dip.  I have never seen that before and I can honestly say I have probably eaten at over 1,000 Mexican restaurants in my life.  

For our first visit, we stuck to the basic enchiladas and tacos.  
The food was very average.   We really liked the mexican rice - it was better than at most places.

Our service was average.  The restaurant was pretty busy on a Wednesday night.  We plan to return and try some other items.  All in all, a good dining experience.
