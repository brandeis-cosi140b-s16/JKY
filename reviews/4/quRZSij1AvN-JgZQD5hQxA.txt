I try to shy away from "chain" restaurants, but this one is exceptionally good.  I'm a sucker for Mexican food anyway - heck I used to frequent this place at least once a week.

The prices are great, usually the place is not that busy, so you get a good, hot meal without dinging the wallet (or purse) to hard.

The dining room is split up to 2 sides, I guess at one point it was smoking and non-smoking (is my best guess)... but it was always exciting to come in and figure out which side they would seat you on.  For the longest time my roommate and I kept getting seated on one side and couldn't figure out if the other side was much better.  The grass is always greener...LOL but in this case, I don't think it matters.

The chips and salsa that are offered with everything are pretty good, the salsa has a bit of a kick to it so I like it.  You can easily fill up fast on chips, so be careful.
