Visted twice in the past few weeks.  First visit was for happy hour, and I tried three items at $5 each: the house margarita, the churrasco (steak skewers) cooked medium-rare, and a Tex-Mex take on eggrolls.  LOVED the margarita... one of the best I've ever had!  Really liked the eggrolls (pork, carrots, black beans).  Can't say the same for the skewers, though, as they weren't cooked enough- chewy texture and still pretty bloody, actually.  Yes, I ordered them cooked medium-rare, but I've ordered steak burgers at the same temperature before at a few other places and all came out very edible.  These weren't.  If I were to order them again, and I probably won't, I'd go for medium to medium-well.  
On the second visit, I had their cheeseburger, cooked medium-rare, with smoked gouda (wow!), sweet potato fries as the accompanying side, and (subbed) chipotle mayo.  I found the buns used very, very tasty- loved the grilled texture.  Last, but certainly not least, the sweet potato fries were superb!  These were light, non-greasy, no cinnamon-sugar coating, and easy on the salt.  I loved it both ways- at times plain, and other times dipped in the chipotle mayo.  Should I ever have a craving for SPF, I'm heading to Cafe Carumba!  
Very friendly service and clean women's restroom.  I'll definitely be back!
