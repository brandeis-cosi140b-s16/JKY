Their Angus burger is incredible. So is their Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno. According to their website: "Poblano pepper stuffed with a seasoned filling of smoked chicken, chopped pecans, apricots, jack cheese and raisins. Served with green chile mole, roasted tomato cream, Tejas rice and black beans."

Let me tell ya, it's so worth it! 

The atmosphere is cool, too, although it gets a bit noisy Fridays around 6 p.m. The lighting is dim and it's conveniently located off Mill Ave, so you can always spring for Gelato after wards, or just wander the street, checking out stores and people watching.
