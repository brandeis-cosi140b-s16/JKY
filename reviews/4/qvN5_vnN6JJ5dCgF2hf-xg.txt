I am craving a Pork Barbacoa burrito as I write this! My first visit to Cafe Rio was a bit daunting, I must admit. I was meeting friends for a birthday dinner, and they had already arrived and had ordered. This is a cafeteria style restaurant. Since I wasn't familiar with the items on the menu, I told the server, 'Please be patient with me, its my first time here'. Big mistake. He shouted loudly, 'It's her first time!' And every server behind the counter started screaming, "It's her first time! It's her first time!' OMG. Ok, after I got over the initial shock, and ordered the Pork Barbacoa burrito with black beans, with a dollop of sour cream,dollop of guacamole and some pico, I realized that heaven was in my mouth! The burrito was huge, and I really attempted to eat the whole thing, because I couldn't stop eating it~
Can't wait to go back and try their salad, and their tortilla soup. But trust me, I won't tell them it's my 2nd time there..
