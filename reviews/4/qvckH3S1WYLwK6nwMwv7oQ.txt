I live in Chicago and my father in law took me to Mi Amigo Ricardo when we were on vacation in Arizona. This place feels like home and I hope to go back every time with visit the Phoenix area. I was introduced to the owner and his sister. My father in law told the owner that I like to make tamales so the owner came to our table and talked to me for 45 minutes about tamales. He brought over their tamales and let me try them. Also he gave me some of their chile powder for free for me to take home. This was so nice of him and I will never forget how great they were here and can't wait to go back.
