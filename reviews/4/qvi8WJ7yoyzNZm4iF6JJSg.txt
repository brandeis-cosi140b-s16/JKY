The only Mexican restaurant for us in Surprise. We are thrilled with the quality of the freshly prepared food. It is open until 10 and we have taken advantage of this late hours.
The food comes up quickly and that is impressive considering we are a party of 6. We have never waited more than ten minutes. Modifications are never a problem.
We are there often enough that they automatically poured a horchata for my teen when we walked in. It's that invested, personal touch that makes this restaurant so much more than the competition.
