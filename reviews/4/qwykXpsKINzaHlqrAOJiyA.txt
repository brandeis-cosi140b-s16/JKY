I went for lunch and was a bit worried as I walked in. Not ever been here and good authentic Mexican food is hard to find. I ordered a beef tamale and chicken enchilada plate. The tamale was very good soft masa and not skimpy on the meat. The enchilada had good flavor too. The rice was a bit bland. Salsa has a little kick would label it medium but the chips needed salt. The margarita was good and strong. 
My boyfriend ordered a bowl of pozole and it was very good. Very good flavor and spicy and the pork was very tender. 

Service here was good and friendly. I would come back here again.
