It's funny - I wrote a review about another location of this restaurant and wasn't too impressed, but now I come a couple times a week. I usually get the lunch special of two tacos, beans, and rice. It comes with a drink and is a good price. They have the bar with various sauces and fixin's. I like the green and the brown salsas the most. I have had the chicken enchiladas, the potato, and the nachos (not the small nachos, the pachos). All are good. The tacos and enchiladas come plain and you dress them up yourself on the bar. 

Pick up the free chips at the counter. This is one of my two most regular lunch time establishments. If you go at lunch around 12:30 it has been known to be packed. I try to get there at 12 and there are a few people in line, but not as bad.
