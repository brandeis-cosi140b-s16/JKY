How is it possible that I have not written a review for Los Taquitos, it's been one of my favorite lunch spots for about a year now, need to get on the ball!
Found out about Los Taquitos like most from Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives! I love me some spicy food, so of course I order the Bombero burrito, it has great favor, and to some it packs heats, but for me its lacking in the heat, I like to have that eyes tearing up, nose running cuz its packing heat experience, but it's a great tasting burrito, its smokey and perfect burrito, just add some hot sauce to it and BAM! got some heat! I also dig their street tacos, delish! 
Little heads up if going during lunch, phone your order in, it cuts down on the wait time!
