Never been here before but it's 90 seconds from my house.  The wait was only @20 min at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Got us in and seated.  The chicken fajita was great but I need to rave about the Carne Asada chimichanga.  The meat was the most tender I have ever had.  Really top notch.  Drinks were great, ambiance was great (newly remodeled).  We even got a visit from manager Stacey who was very insightful, kind, and interested in our experience.  Nutella empanadas are amazing.  All in all, a huge hit.
