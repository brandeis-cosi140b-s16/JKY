We were in a hurry and came here for lunch because we wanted something quick. The line was pretty long, but it went really fast. You can see them making fresh tortillas as you get up to the counter.

I got a fire grilled steak burrito and it was huge! They make it as you are up there. You can also get your burrito enchilada style, with sauce and cheese over it, which seemed to be very popular. 

They put the food in an aluminum tin, so if you can't finish, you just grab a cover to put over it and take it to go for later. For a Mexican fast food place, the food was pretty good. Next time I go back I'll have to try one of their taco salads.
