I've been here several times. Always the food is 'ok', and  service usually subpar, or just plain terrible. Came in tonight with my boyfriend for some nachos and a few drinks and we got Devin as our server. He was fun and attentive and definitely the best service I've EVER had at this place. Even though it's Memorial Day weekend and crazy busy he still made time for us and checked on us frequently without being overbearing. He also really sold me on the clam bake special, I just wasn't that hungry. Looking forward to coming back again and having Devin as our server.
