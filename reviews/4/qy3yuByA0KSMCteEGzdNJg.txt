Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get takeout right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout.
