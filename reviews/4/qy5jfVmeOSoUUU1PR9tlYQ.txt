Okay they are so nice here. I came to use my free dessert coupon for my birthday and I received complimentary chips and salsa after I was seated. I ordered the brownie dessert and it was pretty darn good! Very rich: homemade brownie topped with dulce de leche ice cream, goat milk caramel and walnuts. I wish I would've taken the rest to go but I had to rush back to work. I would definitely come back and try food from their menu, their tacos sounded yummy and they had a few vegetarian options which is nice. I liked that it wasn't super busy when I went, which was during peak lunch hour.
