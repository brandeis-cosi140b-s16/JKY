This place is conveniently located right near my apartment complex and is open 24 hours! It's perfect for my late night cravings. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the food tastes different depending on what cook is there. I usually always get the same thing, the rolled tacos, and sometimes the rice and beans that come with it taste totally different. So I don't get that consistency as I would with another eatery. Despite that, everything is great!
