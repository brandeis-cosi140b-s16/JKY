I decided to visit here for lunch today and I was very pleased! 

I got there around 2, immediately sat down and received warm chips and very delicious salsa...I just decided to play it safe and ordered the Speedy Gonzales which includes a taco and enchilada with rice and It was at my table before I knew it!

The portions were huge!!! Lots of rice, and yummy meat in both the taco and enchilada and the sauce was delicious! 

For $5.89 at portions sizes like this I'll definitely be back and I'm excited to try some of the other options on the menu!
