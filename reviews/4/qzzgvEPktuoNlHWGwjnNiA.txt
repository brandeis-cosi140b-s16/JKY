Had dinner here tonight. They just opened this week. Currently they do not have a credit card machine, so they are only taking cash. They also do not have their liquor license yet. Those things to detract one star. I had enchiladas verdes. They were fresh and good tasting. The best part about this particular restaurant is the four salsas that they bring to the table when you sit down. They also bring cheese dip, pico de gallo, and chips. I would have been happy to make my meal of the salsa verde, pico gallo and cheese dip! Note that additional baskets of chips cost $1 each. The decor in the restaurant leaves much to be desired, as it looks like a generic hotel restaurant. They have not had the opportunity to update the decor in order to give it a Mexican flare. My waitress spoke very little English however she made a valiant attempt to understand my southern accent. I finally gave up at halfway through the meal and started speaking to her in what semi broken Spanish I could. I will happily come back in a week or so to see how things have progressed. Hopefully they will be taking credit cards by then and will be able to serve margaritas.
