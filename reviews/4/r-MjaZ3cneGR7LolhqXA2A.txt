El Norteno! This is the kind of place you would drive by and wonder about but perhaps not attempt. All I can say is try it, you'll like it when in the mood for this type of place. The tacos are awesome, the red chili is great. The daily special is as cheap as you can get... $3.99! This is a gem of a "taco shack" type of place. The seating is spotty but hey... you get what you pay for. In this case you pay very little for a big return in good cooking, no frills on the dinning area though. How many places are going on 30 years!
