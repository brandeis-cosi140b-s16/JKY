Here for dinner with a group of colleagues, all got different things but all solid dishes. I got the chicken fajitas which were very good. Odd location, as mentioned its connected to a gentlemens club but there are 2 separate doors on the outside - its kind of funny as you see people walk to the front of the building to mentally bet on which door they are going to!
