Freshest breakfast burritos and juicy, flavorful, delicious meats. Their carne asada and pork is really tasty. I've tried their tacos, nachos and burritos and have yet to be disappointed. 

Also, the fact that they have a drive thru is such a plus. 

Grab a breakfast burrito on a Sunday for a great hangover meal or try their San Francisco burrito (basically a "California burrito") - you can't go wrong. I think I like this place so much because you can tell just by looking at their food that it is cooked fresh and with quality ingredients. 

Super B Burrito doesn't serve greasy, cheap canned food that's ready in a couple of seconds or heated in a microwave. It's kind of like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle - not as greasy and heavy as Roberto's with quality ingredients that remind me of Chipotle,, while still maintaining that authentic Mexican taste. 

Yum! :)
