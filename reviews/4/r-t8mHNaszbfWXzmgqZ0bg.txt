Came here on a Sunday afternoon, not busy at all. Service was great, the food was pretty good! We had both the fish tacos and the chicken tacos. Better than other Mexican places in the same price range! The Fried Ice Cream has patron XO drizzled on top... It was delicious, and was big enough to easily split between 4 people. I would recommend to it to others!
