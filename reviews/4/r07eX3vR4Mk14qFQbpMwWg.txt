I have never tried a Korean Mexican fusion so we had to come here and see what it was all about. Pretty good food. Couldn't taste much of the Korean fusion, but all still good. 

Fish taco (4 stars): Liked these tacos the most. Had the most flavor. 

Shrimp taco (3 stars): Shrimp are so tiny! Wish I would have known it was baby shrimp. 

Chicken Fries (3.5 stars): A little bland. Needed more flavors. We loaded on hot sauce haha. I lived in San Diego for 4 years where Mexican food ruled, so these cannot compare to the pollo asado fries I would get down there.  

Complimentary Cips (4 stars): Crispy and good! So addicting to munch on.  

SERVICE (5 stars)
Everyone was really nice. 

ATMOSPHERE 
Almost like a fast food restaurant but not since you can sit down and they will come to get your order. Clean tables. Got pretty busy towards closing time.
