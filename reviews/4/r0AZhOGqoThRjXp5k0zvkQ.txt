This place is a hidden gem and when driving through here for years I have to say the exterior makes me a bit weary on whether this place is capable of producing great food.  We decided to stop by for lunch with a few compadres from the office.  The moment you park in the back and walk in you know toto would be saying we are not in Phoenix anymore but he would say donde estamos aka as where are we?  This place is an interesting spot and the experience was beyond my expectations.  

I want to come back as soon as we can make it to a margarita kind of night simply because they have a great array of tequilas and the food was spot on during my visit.  You have to respect a Mexican spot that has a very small menu, this means confidence!  They have a great Agua Fresca selection that they will continue to refill for you.  Our table tried all different plates and they were awesome.. I recommend their chilaquiles.  

Finish off with a great flan and you will quickly realize why you never came here knowing it was here all along.. 

If you can uncover what is upstairs, please do so as it leaves me wanting to sneak in and find out.
