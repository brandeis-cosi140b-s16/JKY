Decent airport food.

I usually am here in the AM, so I do breakfast.

The pork carnitas burrito is awesome (for the airport). Its made to order so you can substitute as you like it. (For me no cheese and sub black beans instead of potatoes)

Also they give A LOT of food (I usually can't quite finish the whole burrito by myself) so you get a bang for your buck (um, FINALLY an airport restaurant that doesn't follow the code of "shitty and overpriced")

Also the coffee has a nice flavor (not the normal burnt black that I actually LOVE), and it comes in one of those taller glass mugs (I would prefer a regular mug, but I guess it makes it look nicer?)

Overall one of the cozier places I've hit up in the airport.
