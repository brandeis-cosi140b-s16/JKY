Place was nice and well decorated. Got sat right away.  Service was excellent. Food took a while to get to the table over 45 min. With my mexican pho taking the longest at 55 min and when it came it was overly salty. Spicy crab roll was GREAT. Manager came over and addressed the wait and food. Def will be back.
