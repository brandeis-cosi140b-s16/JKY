First time here and loved it. Our server Valerie was awesome and had great suggestions. 

We had the trio salsa and chips. All had great flavors and not too spicy. 

I had there chicken enchiladas and loved them. I cleaned my plate. 

We also got the family tacos. Potato and chicken were the two kinds we picked. I like the flour tortillas over the corn. 

Loved sitting outside on the patio with great Bob Marley tunes. 

Easy street parking was free.
