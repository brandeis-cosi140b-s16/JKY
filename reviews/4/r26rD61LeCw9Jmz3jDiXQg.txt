Chunky fresh guacamole, great chips and for my first time, calamari tacos.  I also tried the blackened mahi- mahi fish tacos.

This is a fast food type of environment however each meal is prepared to order.  Fish was freshly grilled, guac was very fresh with large chunks of avocado and calamari tasted freshly fried.  

For a drink I recommend trying the horchata which although it was from a fountain, tasted delicious.

If Yelp offered a 3.5 star I would have gone that way as although the offerings were a bit more unusual than most Mexican fast food places, it was just alright.  I round up to 4 for the effort in freshness and creative menu.
