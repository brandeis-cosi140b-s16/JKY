My family is a big fan of this place. Normally a restraunt inside a casino is not for us. HOwever, this is an exception. The food and service always seems great. The salsa and chip bar is wonderful. They have refried beans on the bar and they are some of the best I have ever eaten. Not sure how they make them sooooo good. 
This place is great. Will defiantely be back over and over again!!!!!
