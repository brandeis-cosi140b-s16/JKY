Stopped by after a quick trip to Bass Pro and ordered a ton of food to take to our hotel. First timer and I like it. We ordered 20 of the meat tacos and several street tacos. The street tacos ain't as good as the taco trucks in Hawaii but it was delicious. The workers here were pleasant. I'd return!
