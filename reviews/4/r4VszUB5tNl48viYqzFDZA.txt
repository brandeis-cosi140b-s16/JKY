Loco Dorito Supreme taco's render me powerless! They are my delicious, edible, finger licking good kryptonite. Oddly enough, I don't normally even eat Doritos, lol! 
I haven't gotten anything else on the menu, so my food commentary stops there. 

I use the drive through, which is always fast. No matter how long the line is they are quick & the staff have always been friendly. 

I wish they had Coke products instead of Pepsi, but I should probably be drinking more water anyway, so no real complaints here :)
