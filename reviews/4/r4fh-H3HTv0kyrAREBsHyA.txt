Roberto's is a chain thats been popping up all over the Las Vegas valley. What do they serve? Good cheap mexican food. The burritos here are a little different from the ones I had back in Cali. Usually I'm used to having rice and beans in my burrito but the ones here only come with meat, sour cream, guac, and some pico di gallo... Not that I'm complaining or anything. What I usually end up getting is either the Carne Asada Nachos or the Carnitas Burrito. They have a huge menu with tons of other things but I stay loyal to my choices. Another thing thats good about this place is the consistency. I've eaten at Baha Fresh several times and each time its pretty hit or miss. Roberto's is guaranteed to fill you up and/or give you some comfort food to cure your hangover.

So the next time you're hankering for some good cheap mexican food at 5am after a night of drinking and partying... GO TO ROBERTO'S! The kicker? You can go there when your not drunk either and its still good!

Check out the picture I posted. I guarantee it will make you HUNGRY!
