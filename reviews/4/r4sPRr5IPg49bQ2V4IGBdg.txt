Food was decent, a little heavy on the onions on nearly every dish, not everyone is a big fan of onions, red onions, green onions, white onions. The calabas were spicy, the carnitas chimi was again full of onions, getting the point across here, beans were also full of onions. I still gotta say though the waitress was great also the waiter was too, they worked together and kept our glasses full, work on the onions and we should be ok
