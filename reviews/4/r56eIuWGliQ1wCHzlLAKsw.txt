very impressed. I have to say I am glad to know the creators of Delux and Zen 32 continued their goal of owning the Biltimore neighborhood when it comes to to quality, moderately priced, creative cuisine. The only reason I am giving them 4 as opposed to 5 stars is because the burrito my sister got was a little too messy and it got on my table cloth:) The fish tacos were superb though, and their rice is amazing... because I love sweet corn in just about anything.
