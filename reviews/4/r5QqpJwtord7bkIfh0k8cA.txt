La Condesa not only has two of my favorite tacos The Baja Sur Shark Taco, and The Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco but the hole in the wall feeling you can't get a chain place. 

The seating is community style with large tables and smaller ones. It's a little tight space wise but it works for the style of the restaurant. Prices are reasonable, food quality is great, and they have one of the best if not the best salsa bars I've ever experienced. There's also a full bar for those that drink.

This place is awesome and I love that I can support local business while getting my grub on!
