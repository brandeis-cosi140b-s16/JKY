Don't fear a line that reaches to the back of the restaurant,  it will move fast! I usually go to the north location,  so this ones seems a bit more unkept bit that's ok...just older I bet. Tried the red machaca burro and added sour cream...delicious! The horchata didn't speak to me here,  though. It was bland,  so I'll have to try again next time.
