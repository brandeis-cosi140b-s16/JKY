This little gem is located inside of Sun Villiage, a 55+ community. However, it is open to the public.  My in laws live there and my mom is looking for a place in there as well. We decided to try out the restaurant which I have heard is pretty good. Mom and I go in for lunch, and wow, Im kind of shocked at the decor. Somehow, it isnt at all what I pictured.. It was well, a little diner.. with blue booths and chairs and dated.. but ok. 

We sit, have great service and both order from the "basket menu".. for $5-6.00 you get a giant beverage, and a basket with fries, and your choice of a burger, fish (this is what I have heard is great here) and shrimp, and oh, something else but I cant recall it now). Anyway... just great. I ordered the burger with cheese (it was extra) but it was the perfect portion size and just delish. Moms fish & chips... wow, my favorite. While I am not a fish or seafood person, I am slowly venturing into it by means of fish frys. I know, not the healthy way.. but my way nonetheless. I loved it.  Its nice and crispy but not too heavy with coating.  

It was good enough in fact that since it was a Friday night, I was telling my husband about the place and we went their for dinner. So  2x in one day for me. 

Nice variety of menu, very good service and very good food. It is really worth giving this place a try. 

Note: if you go for dinner, go early at say 4:30 or 6:30 but get in before 7 when they do the final sitting.
