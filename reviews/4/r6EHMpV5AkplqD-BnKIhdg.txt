A really nice spot. Odd hours. Meant to be more of a catering business, they've added some tables to accommodate the wishes of their patrons. Super friendly owners, mom and pop feel, excellent food. 

The enchiladas (mole and green sauce) were superb. Coming back to soon to have those again. The empanadas were good (although the choices seemed less authentic -- meatball, bbq pork, e.g.) 

Overall, splendid. We'll be back to try the tamales.
