This Chipotle delivers Chipotle's classic fare but in a more secluded location than the one on Forbes. This Chipotle has much shorter lines and their food quality is generally better than the other one. It also has a parking lot. CMU students, you guys should flock towards this one. It's actually closer, but the walk there is sketchier at night.
