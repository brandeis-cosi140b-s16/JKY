I eat here embarassingly often. I'm talking 5-10x a year or more ! .. I'd like to say I'm drunk everytime I eat here, but like Veronica I eat here sober as well! I haven't gotten food poisoning from Taco Bell and they haven't screwed up my order very many times either. I always do the drive through, but so far so good ! The Beefy Cheesy Burrito for .99 with the rice and sour cream they are serving right now is my kryptonite. Damn you Taco Bell and your cheap crave-worthy eats.
