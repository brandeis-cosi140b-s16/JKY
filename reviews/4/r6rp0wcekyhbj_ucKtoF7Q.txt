Lots of vegetarian options and gluten-free friendly. Good food knowledge from the servers. Bussing staff on point and food runners explained all dishes (hate it when they just drop it and walk away). Manager stopped by the table. So for a new restaurant they are running smoothly. Loved the food and the patio seating. Also great non alcoholic drink options
