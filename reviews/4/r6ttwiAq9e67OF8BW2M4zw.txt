This is one of the few chain restaurants that I love. The happy hour is pretty relaxed but it does attract the khaki-pant-buttondown-shirt crowd. The stuffed porked tenderloin is delicious and I'm a big fan of the appetizers. Plus the Sixth Street margarita (on the rocks WITH salt, thank you) is worth fighting downtown Tempe traffic.
