I had oral surgery scheduled the next day with general anesthesia.  And, after reading and having to acknowledge in writing all the dire warnings of unwelcome side effects that could potentially occur, including death, I gave some real thought to what food I would like to eat the night before the dental procedure, for what could be a last meal.  And after great reflection,rather than selecting a gourmet experience, Filet & Lobster, or a high-end AYCE casino resort buffet feast, I opted--surprise!--for a Shredded Beef Taco and Bean & Cheese Burrito at Roberto's.  And they both were delicious!

The burrito was large and elongated in shape, with the smoothest, obviously slow-cooked Refritos imaginable, and oodles of melting Cheddar Cheese.  The taco had a crisp wavy shell, mounds of Cheddar Cheese, fresh lettuce, added diced tomatoes at no extra charge, and some requested Guacamole at a nominal cost.

It was only my second time at this Roberto's, and on this occasion I encountered no mixed up order or cleanliness problems.  A solid 4-star experience all the way!
