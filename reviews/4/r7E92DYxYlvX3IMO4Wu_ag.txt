This is definitely one of the best Mexican places in Champaign. The food and drinks are very inexpensive and the portions are generous. It is a bit scary how fast the food comes out, and has always worried my friends and I just a bit. However, when we're hungry and it tastes delicious, we seem to forget all about our worries. The service is always great. Also, if you want to drink there and the weather is nice, it's not a bad walk from campus.
