Border Grill is great!  We were at Mandalay for a concert and wanted to grab something to eat beforehand.  I'm so glad we picked this place to eat.  When we walked up, it looked very busy and no open seats.  We asked how long the wait was and the hostess told us there was seating downstairs at the bar and also on the patio!  

Since we didn't know what to order, our waiter/bartender recommended the Queso Fundido!  It was so delicious.  With the chorizo added in, it had a great unique flavor.  I think we would have licked the bowl if it wasn't frowned upon. 

He also recommended the Border Classic which had 2 of three appetizers.  This was perfect for us.  Tomales, Chicken Tacos and Empanadas.  Yum!  

If you are here for an event or just a fun night, definitely stop in!  Great service and great food!
