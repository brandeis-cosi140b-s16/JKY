As a chain restaurant and slightly on the edge of being called fast food, I really enjoy Chipotle! 

The food is fresh and delicious! Chipotle has a philosophy for their products, "Food with integrity." They offer vegetarian options and naturally raised and hormone free meat options. It makes me feel good about not just eating delicious and a lot of it, but also from a company that is trying to be environmentally friendly. On each cup there is a story about one of their products or how they do something in the company...it's fun to read. 

The staff there are very friendly! I was a bit surprised at how helpful and friendly they were as I was going down the assembly line for my burrito. It has indoor and outdoor seating to suit all types as well. You can even order online so it's ready when you get there.

Great food and great service! I'm a fan.
