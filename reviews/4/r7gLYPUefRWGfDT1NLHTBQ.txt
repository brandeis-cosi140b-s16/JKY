Prices are reasonable with decent portions.  Not incredibly sure when exactly happy hour is, but I swear every time I'm there there is some sort of special going on.  Went there on a Sunday at 6pm and had $3 big boy Blue Moons!  Sweet!

I prefer the bar area to the dining room, but it can get full in their pretty quickly.  There's also an outdoor dining area attached tot he bar area that I would think would be awesome for parties.

I'm a fan of the food too - ingredient lists are readily available w/ carlorie count on my items as well.  Super easy to stay on target with your diet (you can also induldge as well - win win for everyone!)
