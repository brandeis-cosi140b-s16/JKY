Went to Mundo for lunch on a weekday. Very busy, a lot of business people and elected officials and other dignitaries were there. Seems like a local hotspot being near the county offices.  We ordered the Chilean Seabass tacos, and the skirt steak salad.  Both were delicious, well cooked, and perfectly seasoned.  Service was prompt, our waiter was knowledgeable, and the price was great.
