Short: Surprisingly great fusion place. Reasonable prices, great flavor, in an older part of town.

Long: Came here with a friend. Ordered three tacos with the three types of meat (there are more, for extra). Came with cabbage slaw and some "salsa" on top (not spicy, but wouldn't call it pico-de-gallo). Afterward, was served chips with salsa and guacamole (kinda watered down, though). 
Food was great. All the meats had strong flavor, the slaw on top contrasted with them nicely. I think I liked the beef best (forgot which one was which). What really surprised me was the side-sauces that were a real treat for someone like me. Nice touch.
You do pay a small premium though. $2 for each taco is a bit much when they're not full sized, as you can get around the same size in other places for $1.25/75. 

Come here if you want to try a different spin on mexican food. There's better places out there, but not as unique as this one.
