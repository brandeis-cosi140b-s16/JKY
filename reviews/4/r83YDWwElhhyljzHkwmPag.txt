Tampico chicken was recommended by the waitress and did not disappoint.  The food was fresh, nicely presented, and had excellent flavor.  Visited on a Thursday night at 5:30 p.m.  The place was quiet and the service great.  Customers started arriving in mass around 6.  The portions were generous and although the interior was more bar-like than Mexican, it didn't disappointment.  The neighborhood was somewhat "shady", but the food made up for it.  Will go again.
