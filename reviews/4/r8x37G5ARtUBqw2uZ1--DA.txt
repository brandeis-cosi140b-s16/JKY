Been here a few times and have had good food each time. They close fairly early for a place that's right next to a movie theater, but it's worth it. The chips and salsa are free and they are delicous. The chips are lightly fried and not too salty and the salsa is the perfect amount of hot and not too chunky. They always have food specials along with their $4 margarita and I have not been disapointed. They offer vegetarian options for the food specials, which I appreciate. The service is friendly and fast and even though one night we ended up staying 30 min past closing time, I never feel like they are trying to push me out the door.
This is a nice, cheap, yummy Mexican restaurant without any flashy side. It's good food for a good price.
Good choice for hanging with friends, a meal before the movie or a casual night out with the SO. Not such a good choice for a first date where you're looking for romance and roses.
