carne asada is really really good. i like it best in the burrito form. i rarely enjoy any beef dishes at mexican joints. usually, its chewy, tasteless and greasy. the carne asada here is none of those things. i love the pastor tacos as well. just like "tacos and beer" taco shop in acapulco. the only thing i wished is that the pastor had a better crust on it. it is supposed to spin on the spit like a gyro and have a crunch to it, but it really doesn't. its worth getting the chips and salsa. the staff is very friendly.
