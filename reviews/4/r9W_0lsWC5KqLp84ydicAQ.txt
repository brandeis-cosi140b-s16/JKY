5 stars for the service. The people here at this particular Rubios (2 shift leaders: a girl and guy) were so helpful. They knew exactly what went into the food and were so helpful when they were not sure...they went to the back and checked ingredients. I LOVE people like this especially when you don't expect any sort of reasonable service at a chain fast food restaurant.

3.5 stars for the food. Excellent "fast food" type. Me and the hubby had the grilled veggie burrito..with portobello mushrooms, beans, rice and various different veggies. A very interesting sauce and the chips were really good. 

4 stars for the killer salsa bar. With 4 different types of delicious salsa and unlimited refills.

3.5 stars for the price. About $6 for each burrito. A bit expensive for "fast food" but really it isn't. But since I'm confused if I just had fast food or not I can't decide if this was a good deal or not. Lots of thoughts going on right now in the old head. 

5 stars for the churro. Warm, powdery cinammon, soft inside...oh gosh....churros are the new elixir. 

Love going to Rubio's when I'm in San Diego visiting the sister but this first visit of mine in the Vegas area has been very promising. 

After a lot of complicated math and averaging and weighing probabilities...I am giving Rubio's in Green Valley a whopping 4 stars. Which is seriously amazing because I give Taco Bells everywhere about minus 300 stars.
