sandbar is an attractive place. i went there with a couple buddies to check out the happy hour. ive been here a couple times before but usually on a weekend and wasted and its pretty cool then.

we sat at the outside bar where the sand is. if i thought about it i wouldve brought sandals. im joking.

happy hour is good. 1/2 off apps and drinks, so roughly $2 domestic pints. 

we mostly enjoyed the food we had. i got the carne asade fajitas. good stuff. 

cool bartender and plenty of girls to round out the atmosphere. 

surprisingly i didnt get wings this time, but ill be back, and will update this review.
