First time here at Ritas, and I can't say enough positive things about it!! Our server was Eva and she was AMAZING super friendly and knew alot about the menu which was helpful for our first visit. Food was very good, the service was fast and the pricing was decent. If i did have to pick one down side it would be the outside curb appeal. It shares a plaza with an auto shop and looks kinda run down, but once you get inside its very clean, welcoming and decorated nicely! Totally worth it. We definitely will be back soon!!
