I love Tacos El Gordo, but actually think that I would go here.  Everything was very good, and fresh tasting.  The refried beans are salty...but very good!  We got three of the of the taco combos.  Wife got the fish, loved it.  Son got the carnitas...it was okay, a little boring considering the rest of the meal, and I got the chicken mole taco, A-, the spicy carnitas, A, and Adobada, A.  The real star is the thicker and mild corn taco they wrap those things in.  The food came quickly, and eating outside at the Container Park is quite cool in its own right.  Oh crap....one more thing.  Three taco plates, a margarita, a Dos Equis Draft, and a horchada for $42.  While not amazing, it is definitely not absurd either.
