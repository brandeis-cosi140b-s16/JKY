I was a skeptical about this place simply because I'm not a big fan of Mexican American restaurants.

However, prove me wrong and you shall be rewarded!  Needless to say, Black Chile proved me wrong and I loved it.  I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, which I thought were amazing.  The beef was tender and the spice was just right.  Chips and salsa for the table was okay at best.  I've had better salsa.  Drinks during HH was decent, I'm going through my whiskey phase.  Beer & wine is good just not that night I attended.

Service was real quick and accommodating.  

Ambience had the old rustic western feel.  The room had a Southwestern modern touch.  The crowd was young and hip.  Restrooms were downstairs in an entirely different space, which I thought was pretty cool. - Enjoy!
