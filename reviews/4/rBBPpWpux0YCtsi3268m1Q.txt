One of the first Mexican places I liked when I recently moved here. Unfortunately even though there are so many locations this is the closest one which is not really close, lol. The food is pretty good, not the best but really good and way better then Fredrico's. The only grief I have with this location is this one lady.. she speaks really quiet and mumbles through the drive - thru intercom. I ask her to repeat what she says and she gets so annoyed. I even thought maybe it was the system, but when I pulled to the window, I saw that it was her. But it's not like she's working the drive thru every time I go so.. I'll deal.
