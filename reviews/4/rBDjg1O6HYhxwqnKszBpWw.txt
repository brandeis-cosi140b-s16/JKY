There was 9 of us in our group. We went here after our weekly Thursday meeting, Normally we go (when we go) for Mexican food to another restaurant but we all wanted a different Mexican food establishment this time around. If you have read my reviews about Mexican food restaurants I always start with how the salsa tasted to me and then go from there. The salsa was a combo of other places hot and mild chunky salsa so it was OK but the chips were served hot and added that "little" extra that marked their salsa & chips right there with some of the best.

Now to the food: My dish was the Fajitas de Macayo. A flavorful treat of steak Fajitas grilled to perfection on top of  a bed of grilled onions and green chiles. Served with sour cream, guacamole, shredded cheese, Pico de Gallo, and refried beans. I asked our server (waitress who's name  I didn't  get) if I could get a side of grilled vegetables instead of the  refried beans. She said no problem so I substituted the  refried beans for a side if grilled vegetables. I expected I would be getting grilled onions, and the other grilled vegetable that came with the meal but instead got grilled zucchini, squash, broccoli and some other grilled veggies. But it was all good just not what I expected.

My wife got a como plate of Shredded Beef Enchilada &  a Shredded Beef Taco served with refried beans  she really liked the Taco and next time wouldn't get the Shredded Beef Enchilada. all in all she liked what she picked out.

FOOD: Everyone in our party liked what they ordered. AMBIANCE/ DECORE: typical modern Mexican restaurant d√©cor .clean interior. SERVICE: Outstanding. Especially considering every had something different . they provided excellent customer service.  CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. This restaurant is spotless. The prices are excellent. What else do you want from a Mexican food restaurant. I'm sure we will be back RETURN FACTOR: 100%
