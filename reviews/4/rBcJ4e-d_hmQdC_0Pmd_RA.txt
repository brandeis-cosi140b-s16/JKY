One evening I had hungry, loud, complaining kids in my car and, out of sheer desperation, I turned into the drive through of this completely 
non-descript "berto's" looking kind of restaurant.

WHAT a find!  Outstanding food, fast, cheap.  Happy day, happy kids.  We've been back a few times for pick-up.  No ambience, but that's not what they are about. Expect really good really reliable old school Mexican food.
