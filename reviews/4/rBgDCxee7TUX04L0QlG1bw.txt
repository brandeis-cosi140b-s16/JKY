I am going to class that is up the street from this place and I don't finish until 9 PM.  I always drive by this place.  One night I sitting in my seat with a pain in my stomach.  I needed to eat something.  The only problem was that I wasn't in the mood for a fast food burger or I didn't want to wait a long time for some good food.  It was then, that I remembered this place was open 24 hours.  I had my mind set the last 45 minutes of class all I could think about was a burrito.  

I pulled up and decided to walk in the restaurant because I read they had a salsa bar.  When I walked in the place was pretty clean and bright.  What I noticed right away was how familiar the place looked.  I noticed the menu with the pictures of the food and even the way it was organized.  I had to go back outside to make sure I was in the right restaurant.  I had a bad case of deja vu.  Let's just say this place very closely resembles another restaurant that serve similar food and their name is Spanish for Robert.  

I ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  I saw some pictures of it on Yelp, so I was excited.  I was really hungry too. It only took a few minutes to get my burrito.  This bad boy was HUGE!  I was happy because I was really hungry.  I wanted to get home so I waited to eat it there.  When I got home I inhaled this piece of heaven wrapped in a tortilla.  to be honest it was just a regular burrito but for some reason it tasted really good.  This is place is legit.  If you are in the area then you definitely have to check Don Tortaco out.  Cheers!
