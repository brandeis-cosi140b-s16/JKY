I have always loved this place!  There is something about the ambiance here, and Cave Creek in general.  When I lived in the area from 1998-2002, I would frequent it for lunch at least once every few months.  Now that I live in the far SE valley, I will still make the occasional "trek" up north!  The food is very good, in my opinion, and I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in my day.  Today I ordered the chicken enchilada lunch w/ green sauce, rice & beans.  It was just delicious...piping hot, not too spicy, with large pieces of chicken breast with that greasy, cheesy goodness smothered on top.  It was too hot to sit out on the patio, so a nice table with a view of the pond was relaxing.  Yes, the pond water is dirty!!!!  But the ducks and turtles don't seem to mind :)

I've been here a few times in the evening, and the enlarged patio with the fireplace and tree lights etc. make for a wonderful place to have a few drinks and enjoy a nice relaxing dinner.
