Went in for lunch the other day.  I wasn't expecting much, but when my coworker and I got there, the parking lot was packed.  It must be a decent place.

There was a line to the door, but it moved pretty quickly. I got a chicken burrito. My coworker got the carnitas.  We both enjoyed the burritos.  

I was a little worried at first because the chicken was Cheeto orange. I don't know what sort of spice mixture they soak it in to make it that color, but it tasted just fine. 

The drink menu was just cans of soda in a cooler. I'm not a fan of places that do that. I like a fountain drink. I like free refills. Around lunch, I need all the caffeine I can get to make it through the remainder of the afternoon.

I don't have anything bad to say about this place. Like Chipotle, Qdoba, Burrachos, and Pancheros, it does what you'd expect.  It's not really better or worse than the others, but I would go back.
