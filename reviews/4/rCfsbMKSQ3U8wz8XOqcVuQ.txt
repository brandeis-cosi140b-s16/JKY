The menudo here is perfect. It's been many years that I have had menudo that tasted this good. We had both the red and the white. Both were spot on. Served with Bolio rolls that were toasted just right. The best menudo experience in the metropolitan Phoenix area. The staff was friendly and attentive. The guitar player sang for us which was a nice touch.
