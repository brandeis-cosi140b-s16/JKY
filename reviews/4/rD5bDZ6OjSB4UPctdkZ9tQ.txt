Not a bad quick meal between flights. 

I had very low expectations because of the poor ratings on Yelp. 

Perhaps that is why I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy my shredded chicken nachos. Keep in mind the nachos have white cheese, not yellow cheese. 

The dish had good flavor and the chips were thin and crispy. 

When you order, make sure you have a little time. The restaurant was half empty and the meal took 10-15 minutes to arrive.
