Love chipotle. I love the direction that they are heading in with locally sourced (when possible) and real, whole foods. I always get a chicken salad -- hold the dressing -- with lots of extra salsa. Never had a bad thing at chipotle. Their guac is fantastic for fresh fast food and their tortilla chips are next level. I prefer them to pretty much any traditional Mexican restaurant. The employees are great and their corporate office handles complaints well and in a very quick time frame.
