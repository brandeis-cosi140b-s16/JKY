A true dive..but don't let it fool you! The menu is quite extensive and delicious. I went with the #12 Daily Special. For $6.99 you get 2 mini asada tacos and 2 large fish tacos along with a small drink. SOOO flavorful and very filling! I've got my eye on the asada quesadilla next time...and you better believe there will be a next time! Prices are super reasonable and the ladies running the window are extra friendly.
