i love this place the tacos are cheap delicious andthe meat flavorful and moist, and its one of the few places that has a nice variety of meat from cabeza,birria (my personal fav) and fried tripas which i usually hate but love here. the salsas are also super tasty never overpowering . only thing i will say is if you care about the ambience this place doesnt have alot but the foods so good you wont even notice as long as you have good company
p.s the sushi is awesome try the kissi roll you wont regret it
