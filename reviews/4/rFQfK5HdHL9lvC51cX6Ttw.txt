We ordered the beef fried rice and four fusion tacos (chicken and pork). The pork had more flavor but both were good, we had no complaints. You have a choice of different sauces you can add on your item which really kicks up the flavor a notch! Best part; complimentary chips and salsa/guacamole! Plus our bill was less than 15$
