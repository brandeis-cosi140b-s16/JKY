Before I write anything else about Baja Fresh I got two words for ya: Mango Salsa. OMG do they sell it to go in large quantities? I need to ask when I go back! 

It took a bit longer than I liked to place my order but that's the only complaint I have about the place. It's clean, the service once they get to you is fast, and it's priced right. I liked the salsa bar...the 6 pepper salsa was really good but it took a back seat to the over the top mango salsa. That stuff...is pure awesomeness in a little cup. 

I ordered a wahoo bowl, and as I was looking at the bowl I didn't see any processed or artificial crap. I saw fresh veggies, perfectly seasoned and flavorful fish, not too much rice, and the portion size was good without being excessive. That's important when you're trying to watch portion sizes and you find a place with good food. 

Will I be back? Absolutely. I'm looking forward to it. 4 Stars definitely seems appropriate here.
