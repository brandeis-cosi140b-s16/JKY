Great place to pick up some late night Mexican food. They never mess up your order and their portions are huge! 

I love their beef enchiladas. They're always chalk full of meat and smothered in delicious cheesy goodness. Their Mexican rice and beans are also very good. 

Their drive thru is super convenient but sometimes it's easier to call in your order and pick it up. Staff is really nice there too. They don't speak much English but their smiles make up for it.
