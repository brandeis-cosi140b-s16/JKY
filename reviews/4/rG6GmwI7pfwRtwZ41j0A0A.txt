Really hip hangout. I went at night though, and I imagine it would make a nice daytime chill place during summer. I met up with a friend who had a cabana rented, which was cool but it's ideal for a small group; pretty cool that there's a tv in there! Our mexican food appetizers were tasty. The gals working are cute and friendly.
