When my office asked where I wanted to go for my birthday lunch I didn't hesitate at all before saying Barrio Queen.

As someone who's loved the original Barrio Cafe for the decade or so its been open, Barrio Queen is a worthy addition to the lineup. For those who are used to the original, Barrio Queen is just as tasty, but has a little more room and better parking.

Whether you go for the three tacos for $10, the Cochinitas Pibil torta sandwich, an enchilada, quesadilla or anything else on the menu, you will likely be happy.

Because it was my birthday, we also decided to try the desserts. I thought the chocolate cake was delicious and my coworkers liked the churros.

I haven't been there at night, but I hear the margaritas and other drinks are tasty as well.

My only complaint is that they seemed a little understaffed at lunch. One waitress seemed to be handling the whole place and as nice as she was, she was a little overwhelmed so at times we had to try and flag her down for service.

All in all though, Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Scottsdale.
