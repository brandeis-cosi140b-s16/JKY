Everyone should know Chipotle by now. Nothing super fancy but sure hits the spot sometimes. It's a lot easier to special order burritos and quesadillas and have them made in two minutes than it is to do it at home and clean up the mess. Of course they along with all other similar quick fix burrito shops cram gobs of beans and rice and cilantro into everything so I usually state specifically little or no rice and beans double the meat and pay for it. But it tastes better.
