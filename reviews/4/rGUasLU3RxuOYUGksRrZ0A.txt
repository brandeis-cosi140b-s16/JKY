Today was the first time we went to this location. We ordered the Carne  asada  fries and a Carne asada burrito. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. And the food was good. Usually at other locations the Carne  Asada fries  are a little on the greasy  side , but not today we ate all our Carne  asada fries   they were perfectly crispy,  cheesy and Definitely  not greasy . My burrito was awesome made special to order (because sometimes I can be difficult like that) I give this place a four  out five stars. Would of been five  stars if the place didn't smell so much like cigarette  smoke so much,  it was very unappealing.
