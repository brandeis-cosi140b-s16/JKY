Granted, it's been years since my first (and only) visit to Zapata's, still a fave of my sister's who lives in the city, but this is the best place I've had AUTHENTIC sangria, outside of Madrid!  Yes, sliced and halved fruits steeped in good red wine, not fruit juices.  At least, that's how our sangria was served all those many years ago (late 90s or early 2000s).  I plan on asking her to take me here again on my next visit next month, so I might have an update!  :)  Stay cool!
