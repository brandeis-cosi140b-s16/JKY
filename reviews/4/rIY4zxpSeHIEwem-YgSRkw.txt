What a great franchise! Chipotle restaurants have been sprouting up everywhere in the Charlotte area lately and give us fresh, bold Mexican food! Emphasis on fresh, they have amazing braized meats that really deliver on big flavor. The choices are on the limited side, but that is fine with me because they are nearly perfect on the options they do have! Do not get discouraged if there are 30+ people in line, their line kitchen setup moves customers through like a breeze! 
The one thing I noticed one time was that I asked for double barbacoa, but when I saw my receipt I was charged for regular! Last time I was there I ordered the same and they rang me up the same, I told the cashier that it was a double, and she said don't worry about it. She had already taken my card and it seemed like they just wanted to keep the line going. Great discount for me I guess, three times with double barbacoa with no extra charge!

Looking forward to my next trip to Chipotle!
