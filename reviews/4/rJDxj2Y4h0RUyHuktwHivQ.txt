I have been to El Pastor plenty of times but haven't had the chance to review it. The fact that I have been back many times should be a tell-tale sign that I enjoy their food, but let me explain why I am a fan.

I am Mexican-American (Chicana) and I got some delicious, authentic Mexican fare made by my wonderful mom while growing up, so if I go to a Mexican restaurant a second time, it has to be good.

El Pastor is honestly one of the only Mexican restaurants I go to in Madison when I am craving some yummy tacos or some mole.

My personal favorite are their tacos de lengua (cow tongue for my adventurous eaters). Sprinkled with onions and cilantro, they are simple perfection. I also enjoy their chicken flautas, gorditas, and anything covered with their mole. Don't forget to wash everything down with their sweet horchata (flavored rice milk)!

Of course nothing will compare to mom's home cooking, so I can't give them a 5 star, but man am I hungry after writing this. Yum!
