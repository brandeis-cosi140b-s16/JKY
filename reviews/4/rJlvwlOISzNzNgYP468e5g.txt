Sometimes the best restaurants can be found right under your nose-passed this place many times on my way home from work. Was craving Mexican and after seeing the reviews decided to venture outside the box of my usual Mexican haunts. I ordered the Enchiladas Vallarta and savored the creamy cheesy sauce.  The entree was served with white rice & black beans, a nice change from the typical Spanish rice & refried beans.  I washed this tasty meal down with a perfectly potent frozen Margarita!  The decor was Cantina-cute!  Nice neighborhood joint to enjoy a cold delicious beverage with an equally delicious meal.
