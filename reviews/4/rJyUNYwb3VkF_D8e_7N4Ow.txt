Good bet for Happy Hour in the Biltmore. 

Nice menu featuring a fairly impressive margarita (even though that's not my usual drink). There are good prices on the food items as well, though the $5 chicken skewers tasted a bit glued-together, at least the chipotle sauce was good. 

Service was good and without complaint.

The patio area has a certain comfortable vibe to it-- like it's just exposed enough.
