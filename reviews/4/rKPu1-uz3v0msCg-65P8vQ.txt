I went here for family dinner celebration.  The restaurant is located inside Sam's Town Casino.  Free self parking.  Great atmosphere and service.  I had pi√±a colada, steak borracha and banana foster.  They were all delicious.  The banana foster was so yummy!  I would definitely come back here again.
