Great place to dine on Mexican food with a twist, and sip on yummy cocktails, sangrita margarita is my fave, while enjoying the ambiance and decor!  The location at Tempe Market Place makes it a great place to grab drinks and dinner with friends, before seeing a movie at the TMP, and of course the shopping.  I love the Carlos Santana inspirations all throughout the restaurant.  It is slightly pricey, but its quality food with unique ingredients.  The chicken enchilada suizas are really great, and I love the duck tacos!
