Went here for breakfast looking for some Mexican food.  Let me just say right now that  as a Californian I wasn't ready for the intensity of Arizona Mexican food.  The stuff we have here is totally pussified.  Food a Mi Pueblo was much richer and cheesier.  Definitely flavorful, though.  We loved the salsa and bean dip that came with the chips.  I got the bandara breakfast, which was a HUGE portion.  Couldn't finish for fear of dying of a heart attack on the spot.
