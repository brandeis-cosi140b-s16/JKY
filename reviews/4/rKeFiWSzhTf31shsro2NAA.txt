I absolutely LOVE the pulled pork or chicken salad at Cafe Rio. It is layered with so much goodness. First, a homemade tortilla with melted cheese then loaded with rice, beans, meat of your choice, lettuce, pico de gallo, queso fresco, guacamole, tortilla strips, cilantro and fresh limes. Topped with their house Tomatillo Ranch. Trust me guys, if you are a ranch lover like me, it is to die for, especially when you dip your tortilla in it! It is safe to say that I am a regular here!
