Went here for the first time for dinner last night. I finally found a place that makes Agua Chiles! So I had to get that! Plus I did the carne asada burrito fully loaded. I liked how it wasn't a monster burro and enough for one person. I also liked how you got all the I ingredients in one bite and every bite. 
Salsa bar was a nice touch. The cabbage was brown so that needed some improvement. But Like the previous reviewer said, mix the hot and mild and it's the perfect Chunky salsa with a kick. 
Husband ordered the shrimp burro. Warning:the secret sauce has mustard flavor. Didn't expect that in a shrimp burro. Typically they have a chipotle cream or some kinda creamy sauce. Surprisingly it actually tasted good!! Just a shock. Lol
They have a great variety and very clean. Wouldn't mind going back.
