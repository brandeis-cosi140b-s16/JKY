This is one of my favorite dive mexican places in Phoenix.... the place it pretty clean for a mexican place despite the shady looking outside.  Everytime that i have been there i always get the lunch specials... they are a ton of food and cheap (5 to 7 bucks for a large plate)...  The staff is very friendly and they get you in and out in a hurry... i have never been here for dinner... and not sure if i want to... i like being in that area during daylight hours.
