A friend of mine decided to meet up at Cantina, since it had been a while for both of us. Needless to say, it did not disappoint. The guacamole was good, as I remembered. I ordered two tacos, one chicken and one fish. Really cute, especially with the house margarita. I look forward to get back again soon.
