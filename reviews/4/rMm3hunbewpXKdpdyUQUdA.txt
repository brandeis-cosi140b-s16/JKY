Always a good bet.  The red sangria is awesome- there is a little kick at the end that I suspect is some cinnamon combination.  The fish tacos are tasty, and the salsa is super fresh.  They are known for their tequila selection, and I saw there were tequila flights tonight.  Tequila and I no longer have a relationship, but my friends swear by the margaritas.  The friendly and diverse waitstaff support equality, which is great to see. Added bonus- they take OpenTable! I'm a fan!
