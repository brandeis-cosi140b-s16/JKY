One of the nicest Mexican buffet options I have ever seen.  It is great to have this location right here in Surprise.  The dining room is nice and the menu selections are amazing.  Prices are a tad on the high side for me, but in retrospect, the food was worth it.  

Avoid Abuelo's at the Arrowhead Mall area, and stay right here in town for a wonderful dinner!  

Service has been spot on each time we have been here.
