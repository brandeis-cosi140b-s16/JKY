Cold chips n salsa. Not ideal for $7.50 when the beef and bean salsa is also served cold and none of the 3 are up to spicy standard. The seating is also odd, they try to sit you close to other tables when clearly there are empty private tables. We made friends with our neighbors and good calamari. Just came for drinks and apps-and hey my boyfriend reminded me to not be a donkey so 4 stars here.
