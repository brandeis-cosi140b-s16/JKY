I went here because I wanted Mexican eats after my haircut east of the strip.  This restaurant has won the best of Las Vegas award for best Mexican restaurant in town numerous years (it's advertised proudly on their entrance).  Sweet, looks like a winner.  Friendly servers, large restaurant, lots of employees so you're never without.  (I think there was a separate beverage guy and chips/salsa guy).  They start you off with a soup of some sort.  Good but rather simple.  Chips were good, salsa not hot, bean dip meh.  Wife had the standby chimichanga, and she was pleased.  Carnitas were good.  My kid's beef taco was nothing more than a shell and beef (not ground).  No lettuce, cheese, nothing.  My kid was okay with that though, but I thought it was strange.  My other daughter's chicken burrito was just as dry and boring as well.  Prices were a little steep, but it was pretty busy (no wait though), and based on the awards they got I would charge more too.  It's a safe bet for Mexican sit-down (nice booths, friendly staff, even a singer), especially for non-Spanish speakers and families.  If you're willing to gamble, there surely must be better hole-in-the-wall types of places around.
