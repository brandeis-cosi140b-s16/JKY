Small little hole in the wall spot - HUGE delicious plates!! After day of drinks and too much sun, we needed a real solid meal. My brother in law found this spot and hesitantly, we left the hotel to try it out. So glad we did!! Cheap but delicious - the meat was on point. Everyone ordered different plates and everyone loved what they got. I had both the carne asada plate and the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries are a must have. Ridiculous amount of food - fries piled with guac, sour cream, cheese, and really well made carne asada all over it. Get it!!! Need a food fix after a Vegas weekend - this is your spot!
