Chipotle is usually quite reliable for rather fast, quality "fast food" southwest food.  It's hard to go wrong with the veggie or bean burrito.  Food is always consistently good, though they're a bit pricey with the chips and salsa as an additional charge.  With drink, chips & salsa, I'm north of $7 whereas it's under $5 at Rubio's.

This location isn't terribly busy at lunch because of the shopping area not being too close to so many professional businesses.
