I put this right up there with Chipotle in terms of quality.  Prices are relatively the same. Chips & queso are amazing. I had the 3 tacos, one chicken/steak/grilled pork/. The grilled pork, wasn't too great, but the steak and chicken were, they tasted fresh, and juicy, even 30 min before closing time.
