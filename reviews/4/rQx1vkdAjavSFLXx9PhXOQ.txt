I love their nachos!!!! So good and huge!!! If it just a party of 1-3 if you order the nachos you don't need to waste your money on anything else. The two of us ordered the combination nachos with the pico on the side and a combination quesadilla. Both sooooo  delicious and both ended up in to go boxes lol. 

The nachos piled high with tortilla chips then doused with nacho cheese sauce and more chips then cheddar cheese meat a spoon full of guacamole and drizzled with sour cream. We both dug in at separate ends and didn't even eat half of it and only barely touched the quesadilla. I would have liked to have more sour cream and topped with some black olives. My friend asked if they had olives and our stunning server said "no black olives only green ones from the bar, we get asked for olives a lot." Ok Diablos get the hint the people want black olives on these expensive nachos!!!  Ok so as for drinks don't order the green door it sucked! I love fruity girl drinks this one did not have a good fruity flavor. It was green from midori but the flavor was just off. 

Ok seriously the servers here are all beautiful women and they wear high heels. I've known lots of servers and none of them wore high heels. But anyways our server looked like a music video girl. Fake boobs, extensions, fake lashes and extremely pretty. She was really nice. The girls don't actually bring you the food some strong guys from the back do. The guys are really polite and nice.  

The decor around the bar is fun and cute things to read. Like "Be nice or leave" and other sayings. The rest of the first floor is really dark. There is an upstairs but you have to pay to go up there because of a band or a dj. I think the price was $30 for guys $25 for girls. The front of the building has a big she devil on top you can't miss it.
