One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.

It's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha) 

Weds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each
