Yelp is usually spot on about places so I had been pretty leery about trying a place with such low ratings ! With my coworker's enthusiastic love of this place, I decided to give it a go - and now I can say for sure, Yelp is wrong !

Atmosphere: Ok so there isn't any, but I'm ok with that. It seemed clean, it's cozy, whatever. It's a hole in the wall.

Service: Extremely fast and pleasant at that. The waitress was chatty and nice. Absolutely nothing negative to say about our service. In and out of there in 30 minutes flat ! 

Food: Fantastic! I had never had good chile verde before , but in case you're looking for the best in Vegas - this is where to find it. Think a light delicious meaty broth with sweet delicious chiles floating around. Think TONS of succulent soft, tender pork . Think the most filling bowl of $8 goodness you'll ever find. Sorry Pho, but this "soup" is tastier than any bowl of Pho I've had in my life ! 

Overall -I'll be back! Don't let the low Yelp ratings scare you off. Apparently they didn't order the chile verde.
