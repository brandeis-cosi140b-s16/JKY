Baja Fresh, a nice, quick alternative to your local Taco Bell...  It is a restaurant that I have been to many times.

Personally, I love their quesadillas.  They are extremely cheesy, and they are filled with your choice of meat, with some Guacamole, Sour Cream, and Salsa on the side.  Each one of the entrees have chips included.  Try some of their Salsa Verde with some cilantro... It's a very good combination.

If you really like their food, then buy their "Collector Cup".  For $9.99, it includes 1 free drink, followed by 99 cent refills for life.  A good deal if you come back to this place multiple times.

Good restaurant, good food, good place.
