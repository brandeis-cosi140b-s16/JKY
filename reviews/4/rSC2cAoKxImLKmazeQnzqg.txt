I have been to this place a few times over the past few years. I get the same thing, the pollo fundido. It satisfies my Mexican cravings.

The atmosphere is fun, maze like. Service is decent and like most places if something is wrong they are quick to fix it. This is a great local restaurant. I love how it lacks the ultra corporate feel of most main-stream joints. Great Mexican!
