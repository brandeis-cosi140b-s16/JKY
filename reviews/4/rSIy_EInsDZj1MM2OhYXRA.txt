Muy Bueno! I hate that Hot Taco is getting such a bad wrap, I was pretty impressed! 

The first time I went the service was pretty bad.. Hints why I gave them the 4 stars (sorry Taco). The waitress acted like she had no idea what was on the menu, and took her almost 15 mins to finally get our drink orders. But the food was still tasted great. 

The second time the service was much faster, and she actually knew the menu (her name was Murphy, ask for her). The food was still spot on, and I have to say it may have tasted a little better. 

I recommend Hot Taco. But not their desserts, save your sweet tooth for a specialist.
