I have passed this place for over a year and the parking lot is always packed. The food was pretty good but for the $20 price tag for steak tacos I expected more. The portions were very large however so I guess that balanced it out. I was only able to eat half of my meal the portions were so large. I got 3 tacos and an entire plate full of rice. Only issue with my food was that the tacos were drinched in salsa to the point where they were falling apart (the salsa was just poured over the entire plate and not on each taco). 

As for the customer service everyone was very nice and polite. I would definitely go back here again, but just order something different.
