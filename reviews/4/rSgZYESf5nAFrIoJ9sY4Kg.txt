There are very few times when I like to just go out  and get drunk and this place does the job.  $6 cab ride and a $40 tab will help me get to where I need to be.  I don't believe I ever went here during a week day so can't comment but the weekends can be interesting.  I always get a laugh at the people who are stumbling out of here at 2am.  Either that or I'm stumbling and they're walking straight but I believe its them stumbling.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed in the service.
