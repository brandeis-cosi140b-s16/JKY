We bought some show tickets and added was a coupon for 1/2 price entree's to La Salsa. Probably wouldn't have gone there if it weren't for the coupon, but the location was really convenient in relation to the MGM Grand. 

Food was good, but the best part was margaritas by the yard! And it was pretty darn tasty at that. We ate when it was pretty slow, so the server was there often to check on us. Even without the coupon, it was reasonably priced. 

Nothing spectacular, but if your a below average joe like me, sometimes it's nice to eat some Mexican food and get a good buzz on without spending a ton. Oh, and you get to keep the yard glass your marg comes in.
