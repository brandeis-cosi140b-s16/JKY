I love Mexican food. It makes my heart go *pitter-patter* when I think about it. I've eaten a lot of it in my day. This cute little restaurant is a great go-to when you're in the area. All of the food I've tried has been very good, including the amazing chips and salsa. It's nice to have a not-so-fancy place to retreat to when the city life of Snobsale starts to bring you down.
