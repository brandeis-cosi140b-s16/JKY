Excellent food, best chips and salsa I have ever had.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Services was fast.  The help was extremely friendly and my water glass was never empty.  I ordered the two crispy tacos with rice and beans.  $18 is not a bad price.  The 4 instead of 5 stars was because the margarita I ordered seemed a little light on the alcohol.  Getting ready to watch Zakara.  I love this trip to Las Vegas!
