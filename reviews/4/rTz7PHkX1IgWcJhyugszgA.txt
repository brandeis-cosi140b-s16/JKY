Riva's is the flip side of Mexican fast food. Meaning Philiberto's can go suck it!

They seem exactly like any other Mexican fast food joint. To the untrained eye there is no difference...then you get your food and taste the salsa. 

WOW! Someone knows what they are doing. This place consistently kicks out quality food that satisfies. I have always been very happy at the end of the meal, and later on as well!

Drive through as well!
