This place has changed it's name, it is now Viva Mexican Grill , the place is very clean and the food is really good. It's open for breakfast, lunch,and dinner. Staff is friendly and welcoming. I did meet the owner on my visit,  she's really nice. I see why the staff is welcoming, the owner promotes it. 

I had the breakfast plate, it was just what I needed to start my day.
