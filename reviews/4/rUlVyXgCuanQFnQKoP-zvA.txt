I've eaten here atleast once a month and let me just say, I didn't get this fat by not knowing good Mexican food.  The prices are a bit high but the quality's always matched it. Growing up 45 minutes north of Mexico; I can honestly say this is as authentic as you'll find in the area.  I only gave it four stars because I don't like cinnamon in my enchilada sauce and sometimes theirs is a little to much.
