I was in the mood for some cheesy deliciousness when my significant other suggested Azteca. We started with some salsa where I was schooled in the proper way to spoon it on your tortilla chip. I found the salsa just ok- I like mine a little more chunky and less watery. We also ordered a side of guacamole which  unbeknownst to me was served table-side. 

My only real gripe came from the table-side service. While it tasted good, the "chef" loomed over us for quite awhile afterward in obvious attempt to garner a tip ( there was a huge tip jar tapped over the side so that it practically touched our table and  screamed "tip me!"). My boyfriend gave a few dollars but honestly we are tipping our servers, and paying for the Guac, why don't the table-side chefs just take a portion of the tips? I just found it to be a little tacky honestly. 

The food itself all tasted delicious. I loved my enchiladas (2nd only to La Paz), and his Arroz con pollo was great too. Drinks were filled fairly regularly and service was fine. 

The decor and lively birthday celebration singing make this a nice place for the whole family. The prices are beyond reasonable too so it's definitely budget friendly.

Best of all the little complimentary dessert, fried tortilla with cinnamon, honey, and whipped cream, was a perfect way to end the evening. 

I won't hesitate to come back!
