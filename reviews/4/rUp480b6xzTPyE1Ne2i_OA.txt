Family locally owned business , yay, love those!! A friend liked his burrito which was too big to finish in one meal. I can only rate on the sopes, the only thing I order there since they are so good & not easy to find around Vegas. Love that the owner who is the usual cook in back, will make me a special vegan order with beans, lettuce, tomatoes & avocado. 
Traditional food, not Americanized. Which means the salsa is thin, not pico de gallo style, but it's flavorful & I don't really need to fill up on chips & salsa there anyway.
