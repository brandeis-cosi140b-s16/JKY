Stopped in for some Ranchera, went home with a bunch of fresh and cheap veggies, snacks, beers and sodas.

This is a really good representation of a valley carniceria; penche gringos may turn up their noses but valley g√ºero's who know what time it is will dig it. They had a fantastic looking seafood counter, everything looked super fresh and you can't smell even the slightest hint of fish in the air. The staff was very helpful to boot. This is likely your best option on this side of town.

Heads-up on the address, though. It's actually 1708 W. Bell Road...there...that should keep you from crashing into the QT trying to find it.
