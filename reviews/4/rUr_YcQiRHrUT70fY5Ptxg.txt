Seriously! I don't understand this little place. It's small, hot, cramped and tucked away in a hard to notice place. Thus the 1 star reduction. But the food is out of this world! The Carne Asada is off the chart amazing. If you are close to this place, stop in and order anything. You may have to take and eat it at home or down the street but you won't be disappointed in the least.
