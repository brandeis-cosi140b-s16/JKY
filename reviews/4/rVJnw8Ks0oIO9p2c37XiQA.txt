Located inside the MGM Grand, this restaurant is a sure thing for Fresh Tex Mex.

The delicate chips & salsa will make you feel compelled to mix & match the various flavor combinations between the carefully selected spices and varieties of salsa flavors.  Try the table-side quacamole and you can practically make a solid meal out of just the chips.

The trio appetizer was surprisingly filling and the pomegranate margarita was deceptively delicious.  To be honest, on my several different visits, I rarely made it past the appetizers because I was so full!  The service was spotty from visit to visit, but the quality of the food was high enough that service was forgiven.  A great place if you're looking to hang out and enjoy your stay- the service was entertaining and friendly when they were around.
