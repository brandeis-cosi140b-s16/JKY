I tried out Tijuana Flats for the first time thanks to a yelp event. As a fan of Mexican food, I'm always willing to try as many places as possible. This place has a different vibe than your typical Mexican place. You won't find the typical cheesy Mexican restaurant decor at this place. They have brightly colored graffiti art covering the walls and tongue-in-cheek wall art. 

As part of the yelp event, I got to try the tijuana trio, jalapeno poppers, chicken soft tacos with rice and black beans, chicken flautas, beef burrito, and cookie dough flautas and cinnamon sugar churros.

The tijuana trio (salsa, guac, queso) is a great appetizer. The chips are lightly seasoned and the guacamole is surprisingly delicious. I say 'surprisingly' because sometimes chain Mexican restaurants can make bland guac. Not the case here, though. I didn't try the salsa or the queso because the guac was holding my taste buds hostage.

Jalapeno poppers were delish but HOT. Don't think because there's fried dough, sour cream and cheese that the heat is diminished because it is not.

The chicken soft tacos and black beans were good but the rice was a let down as it was over cooked, as in crunchy rice pieces. This may have been due to the size of the event and having to prepare a large amount so quickly so I won't knock it too much. 

Chicken flautas and beef burrito were OK but not anything I'd order on my next visit.

My favorite part was dessert. The cookie dough flautas (with chocolate syrup) were decadent and I'm still thinking about them. SO GOOD and I implore you ORDER THEM if you go. The churros were good but I've had better at other establishments.

Overall, I will be coming back and trying out the other locations (there are more TF locations coming to an area near you in NC!).
