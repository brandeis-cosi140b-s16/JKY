We walked in at 820pm. Party of 10!. I'm sure they gasped...They told us the fryer was already off and no fried food was available. That's the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars. Otherwise, the food was incredibly outstanding. We had shrimp cocktail... awesome! The shrimp ceviche, delicious! And my cousins both ordered the chef specialty fish filet... oh my god that's good. I'm from orange county, California out here for mx vs usa game and yelp hooked me up again!!!! Thiis place is on my must go back places.   Just a little earlier next time
