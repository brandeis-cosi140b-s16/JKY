Tacos De Juarez never fails to satisfy my Mexican food cravings.  

This is another one of the valleys long running, authentic, Mexican joints that just use a tried and true method of success: keep it simple!  Fresh ingredients and traditional menu choices make for a consistent and tasty output, each and every visit.

I always love the tacos here and the chimichanga is cooked perfectly and covered in sour cream and guacamole, both of which are the perfect accompaniment. I order an extra side of rice because I never feel like I get enough, but for the price point, who cares, you never spend more than 10-15 dollars per person.

If you are on McDowell heading down towards the arena to take in a Suns game, you can stop here and be rest assured that the food will be great.
