Discovered this place thanks to Yelp.   Friendly,  attentive staff and clean dining area.   Food came quick and everything was tasty, with reasonable pricing.  Our group ordered chicken fry bread, adobada fry bread, and a couple of burritos.  Everything tasted great and the kids (small and tall) all gave thumbs-up.   Definitely recommend.
