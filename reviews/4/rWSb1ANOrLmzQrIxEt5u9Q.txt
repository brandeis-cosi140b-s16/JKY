My friends wanted Mexican food for dinner and although I was in the mood for sushi, I went along with there suggestion.  

We sat in the front area with a view of the mall area and viewed all the rowdy drunks coming in from the pool area.  I wanted to sit inside to experience the restaurant, but we were already seated.  

Started out with some tasty chips, salsa and ordered the $13 table side guacamole. The combination fajita isn't on the menu, but if you request it, you will get it and pay dearly. It was $42, yes you read that right. 

The plate was huge and sizzling with veggies, steak, chicken, and shrimp. It also comes with tortillas, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, guacamole and sour cream.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare, shrimps were huge and tasty, but the chicken super dry.  

Are waiter was super nice and even brought me an extra $4.50 soda before I even took a sip of the first one.  I told our waiter Leo that the chicken was too dry and he asked what he could do to make it better.  I asked for a couple more shrimps and he delivered 3 more.  

My total bill was $53.00 which is pricy for Mexican food, but the food was mostly good and the service excellent!
