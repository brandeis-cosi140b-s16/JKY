I do love me tacos and thank goodness this spot is not far off the strip.  its actually on the Strip!!! I can stumble my drunk ass over there from the Wynn casino.  If you go ne time pass 9p there will be a long ass line guaranteed.   I came here cuz my friend suggested it and thank goodness I did.   tacos go about $2 ea.  There are 3 different lines for certain meats so pay attention to the line your in.  people on yelp talk about the spicy pork but I suggest the cabeza and Tripas.   yeeeeeeeah boy were they good.  The two tortillas can't hold all the meat they pile on there!  Grab ur soda from the souvenir store next door and grab some tacos.  U will not leave hungry. you can put your $ on that.
