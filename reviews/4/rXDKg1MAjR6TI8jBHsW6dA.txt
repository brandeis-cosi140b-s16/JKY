Decent food, good drink specials and real fish tacos! Similar to other Spanish restaurants, they have Taco Tuesdays and Margarita Mondays I think? It might be Friday actually....I'll get back to you on that. 

I normally go through two baskets of chips and three cups of salsa all by my lonesome. That's a good sign. The rice and beans are always consistently well made. Enchiladas are okay, but street tacos are a yessir. 

While they offer authentic beer battered Baja style fish tacos on either flour or corn tortillas, they sometimes lack flavor. A little sprinkle of salt will solve that problem! Substitute corn over flour tortillas and you will have an epiphany. Cheers to corn tortillas!
