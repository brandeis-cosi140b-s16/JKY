A little kitschy, a little run down, but the food was delicious!

The menu is massive. You could bring anyone here and they'd find something to eat that they are into. I had a veggie burrito, boring I know. My neighbors had fajitas and everything smelled wonderufl. I admit I had a little order envy. 

We had a huge group, about 20 people and they handled us with ease. Service was cordial and quick. I thought it was a leeeeeeetle weird that they use table salt for the rim of the margaritas.
