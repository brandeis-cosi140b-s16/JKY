Very pretty inside!  Great prices!  The service was a little slow, but the food was great!  The tortilla soup was my fav!  The chicken fajitas are only $8.99 with your players boarding pass!  They also have a nice sized salsa bar with a great selection of salsas, from mild to extra hot!  You really cant beat it with the price and taste of food!
