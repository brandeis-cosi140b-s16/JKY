Was told by a friend that this was the best Mex in town. The hubs LOVES chips and sauce so we checked it out. It was obvious that they are new and have a few kinks to iron out but the food is not one of them.
I ordered the quesadilla with fajita style pollo esado and he ordered fajita style carne asada tacos w/ rice and beans. 
Plenty of chips and sauce we delivered to the table and the chips were freshly made. Salsa was delicious and not too spicy. 
I'm sure it will only get better as they are open a while longer. I will def. go back and also tell my friends about it.
