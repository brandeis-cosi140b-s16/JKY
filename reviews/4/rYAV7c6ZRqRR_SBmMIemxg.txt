The sun still rises in the east.  Birds do fly south for the winter.  And Border Grill Mandalay Bay, after 15 years, remains a solid, "Mexican" dining experience.

Note:  This visit was prompted after less than stellar visit to Border Grill's newest location at Caesars Forum Shops.

By the numbers:  17 dishes, 4 drinks, 3 hours, 2 overly stuffed friends, 1 great meal.

It's called "Small Plates".  For $45pp it include EVERYTHING on the menu (or in our case, server selected and coursed dishes).  It is an all encompassing gastronomic view of the restaurant well worth the thousands of calories.  BURP!

The result, unexpected standouts.  The green corn tamales, excellent.  Filled with umber sweet corn and balanced with a simple but acidic salsa.  The peppery watercress, crisp almost apple like jicama and sweet orange salad topped with bacon wrapped, bleu cheese stuffed dates and a creamy coriander vinaigrette, another win.  Beautiful balance of flavors and textures.  

Very well made ceviches The Baja (shrimp, fish, lime, tomato, and jalapeno aioli) a true standout.  The sweetness of the shrimp is accentuated by the fresh, acidic tartness of the lime.  The tomato provides a perfect bridge between the flavors.  Slight spiciness adding complexity.

For mains, if there's mole, it's a winner.  Great Oaxacan strip steak.  Tender and juicy.  It's beefy flavor heightened by he earthiness of the slightly spicy mole.  The pork en mole, porky, earthy goodness.  The addition of pickled veg brightens the palate after every bite.

Very weak selections of wine and beer.  Well designed selection of hand crafted, margaritas and mojitos.  Be very careful with the blood orange margarita.  Jalapeno in the drink and rimmed with spicy mole; it packs a very spicy punch.

Excellent, friendly service.  

Per the restaurant, the menu is being updated in the coming weeks so act fast for a last try of the favorites.

Redemption.
