Juan's Wednesday.
It's a thing! (At least where I work...)

While I can't vouch for the restaurant itself, I do know the food to-go is awesome. I got the carne asada burro which was $4.79 and worth every penny. Beware of food belly: it's all meat! (Well there's onion, cilantro, and guac in there too, but it's mostly meat) The tortillas aren't quite as good as Carolina's, but they are a little denser/stretchier which is good when you're not up for messing around with a messy burrito. The meat was flavorful, and lean! I hate when there's a bunch of fatty goobery pieces in the carne, and Juan's didn't disappoint. I only ate a little over half of the burrito because it was so big...and I needed room for chips and salsa.

Now the do or die: chips and salsa. I fancy myself a salsa connoisseur, and this was 8/10 only because I prefer a chunkier salsa. The flavor was really great though: smoky and spicy and obviously fresh. The chips are house made and perfect--firm but not hard, and crispy delicious. Hence my conversion to Nachos next week. 

Normally, I reserve nachos for sports bars and happy hours, but next Juansday I am totally ordering the machaca nachos. My work husband got them and they look/sound delicious.

Give it a try. You know you ... JUAN to. *dies laughing*
