Never go to Woodman's East hungry. First have a blackened fish taco from El Poblano, located right in their parking lot. The fish is well seasoned and moist. The toppings include fresh avocado so the taco is creamy and delicious. The restaurant is co-located with bakery Pan y Pan. Their food is fabulous and very reasonably priced. Whatever you spend you will save when shopping!

You can eat or take out. My routine includes eating in the car while I finish making my list. i always need extra napkins.
