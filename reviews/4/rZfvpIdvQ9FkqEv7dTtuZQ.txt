Pancho Taqueria is awesome. Not only was there food very good, their service was incredible. I really wish I had the name of the guy working the register because he was remarkably friendly and helpful. If this place was located closer to my house, I would probably be a regular. 

Okay, so I tried a carne asada torta, a tripas taco and a couple bites of the al pastor. The torta was on par with some of the better tortas I've had in the past. I can't compare it to Los Reyes or anything because it's simply carne asada, salad and sauce (unlike the craziness at Los Reyes), but I can say, "Wow!" I've always wanted to be more adventurous with tacos so I got tripas. DON'T GET TRIPAS! Haha! Not Pancho's fault, but mine. I've come to the realization that I don't like fried bone marrow on my tacos. And, as far as the al pastor, it was good, but not authentic according to my girlfriend. One day we will find authentic al pastor in Phoenix. One day...

If you're in on the west side during the day and want some cheap and delicious Mexican food, give Pancho Taqueria a shot. It's good.
