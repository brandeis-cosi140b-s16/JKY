We tried this place on a whim after driving by. While the atmosphere really drew us in, we were glad we stayed for the food. Per our server's recommendation, we selected the pork, carne asada, cod, and shrimp tacos. Overall, the tacos and drinks were good. Not sure how these tacos compare to others in the Valley (we are new to the area) but we enjoyed them.
