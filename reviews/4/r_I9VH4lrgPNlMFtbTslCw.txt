Garcia's came highly recommended from a friend.

Service was a little slow but we didn't mind as we really had no where to be - just my wife and I enjoying our first night in Phoenix. 

The food was quite good. The house margarita was fantastic. The dessert was very tasty, although unnecessary as my dinner and the free chips and salsa prior had pretty much bloated me. 

Would definitely recommend.
