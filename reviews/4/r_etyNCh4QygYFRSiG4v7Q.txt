--Updated again, and hopefully final Review---

Left with few appealing options and driven by starvation I came back into Doce recently.  My resolve apparently did not last long.  

I was hoping to remain anonymous during my time there, but unfortunately it was obvious that I was recognized by the staff almost immediately.  Apparently being the first person to leave a negative review of a 5 star restaurant makes you pretty recognizable.

During my time there I was treated very well by the staff and the food was excellent.  When I asked for the check I was told my meal was on the house; an effort to compensate me for my negative experience here.  I tried again to pay for my meal and the staff member was adamant that my payment would not be accepted.  I thanked him, tipped, and was on my way.

Hopefully my previous negative experience was a one time thing. I plan to continue coming back, and I encourage others to do so as well.
