I wish I could give it 3.5 stars, but it wasn't an option.  

I honestly don't think I've had the right thing here, but I see the potential.  I had the brisket my first time and it was pretty good.  Not the best, but pretty good.  The second time, I was dumb and ordered a Club.  Bad move, not worth it at all.  I need to go back and stick to the Southern food, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Having said that, their potato salad is great.
