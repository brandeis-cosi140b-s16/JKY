I admit to being a mexican food snob and a new mexican food appreciator. I was initially soured by the flavored iced tea. I ordered the meatloaf for something different... I certainly got something totally unexpected and it was a treat. The chorizo in the meatloaf was outstanding. It wasnt dense and heavy like moms... sorry ma! It was super tasty.. the potato pancake was a nifty spin on mashed potatoes. . So it wasn't the usual staple.. the veggies were also a surprise a nice wine finish was a great compliment. 
My partner in crime ordered the chorizo stuffed chicken breast. The sauce was the show stopper.. all in all it was a solid meal. I will crave that meatloaf.. so I will be back. Good job!
