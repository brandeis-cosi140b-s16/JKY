Don't be too shocked,a carniceria in the barrio of El Mirage. However this one rocks.  
The pollo preparado or chicken faijita meat is the sole reason I visit this tiny hole in the wall and a near weekly basis!!!  Its the best hands down.  Food City has nothing on them in terms of pollo.  Grab a few pounds of marinated chicken, a bag of real tortillas (no mission tortillas for me thank you!!) and fire up your grill!!  Invite your friends over and its fajita night!!! Their mexican cheeses are great too.  I prefer the ranchero and my hubby the cotija.  They both are great in the fajitas.

The meats are good too, just pick your cut and they add the meat to a bag of marinade and you're out the door.  

Fair warning, this is in El Mirage!  Don't be to surprised if English is the second language here!! There have been many times the check out girl told me my total in Spanish.  The guys behind the meat counter speak english so you're safe.

Also this place has recently changed names it is now Carniceria Uruapan.  its right next door to the cell phone place.
