I drive by this taco shop treat on a daily basis and love shopping in the Melrose District. Mexican food restaurants line the streets of Arizona like every day is Cinco de Drinko, so I had to check them out and see how they earn the title of America's Taco Shop. 

During the work day, I'm on the hunt for lunch spots where I can be in and out without a true sit-down experience. Someplace with an outdoor patio is a plus, unless it's a sauna outside. America's Taco Shop had just that. You enter and order at the counter, then you can chose indoor or outdoor seating. Sadly, it was a bit windy when I went and in addition to my plastic silverware running away from me, the misters decided I needed a mid-afternoon shower. 

With such Yelp reviews, I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience, so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was. He said the Carne Asade Burrito was hands down his favorite. I'm not going to question the man who lives and breathes by the restaurant.  They brought me chips and salsa while I waited. The chips tasted fresh and probably homemade. The salsa had a hint of a kick to it but not enough to send you to the fire hydrant. Then came the burrito. The tortilla was homemade, fresh and like it was straight from Mexico. Very tasty! The burrito itself was pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for guac so I wish I'd asked for some on the side. I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this burrito pretty much melted in your mouth. 

So on days when I'm a lunchtime loner or the social butterfly with friends, I'll definitely recommend this spot for tacos....wish I could have tried the margaritas. 

Cha Ching! The cashier pointed out two great traits. 1. Taco Tuesdays: four tacos for $6.00. Not bad! 2. Happy Hour. The happiest hour of them all with $2 beers and $1 tacos. Looks like I'll also be making a stop on my way home from work!
