I've been eager to try Cinco having lived in Mexico for a few months and having traveled there many times. After reading so many negative reviews, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was crowded and the service was a bit slow, but overall the whole experience was good.

It is definitely not your typical Pittsburgh/Mexican menu. There is no list of 50 combination platters, which is good thing in my book. And there are a variety of dishes beyond the standards you can find on every Mexican menu in the area.  I had the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde. Very tasty. The one disappointing dish was the sopa azteca. Despite listing garnishes on the menu, the soup did not come with them.
