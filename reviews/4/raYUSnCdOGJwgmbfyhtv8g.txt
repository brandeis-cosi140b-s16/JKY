We were at a conference at PH and stumbled upon this place for lunch on 3/5. We had a party of 7 and waited no more than a couple if minutes for a table. 
Ambience: low key rock n' roll theme restaurant. Looks like a place that could get nice and rowdy later. They had a nice patio that appeared somewhat crowded. 
Service: pretty decent. Our server came right away to introduce herself. Drink orders were taken right away. She came often for refills. Most if food came put right away. One dish had a mistake and took a little time to be corrected. 
Food; pretty decent. Chips and salsa were good. I had the chicken sabana. This was recommended by the waitress. I couldn't tell how big the plate was, and she recommended against ordering more. Food was good and tasty. A little in the oily and greasy side, but good. I liked the chimichurri sauce on top. The chicken was flattened nice and thin and was still juicy. 

All in all, a good lunch. Value was decent and well. Good for groups.
