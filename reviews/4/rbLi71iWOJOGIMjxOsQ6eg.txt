My wife and I just stopped by this restuarant while driving back from Yuma to Phoenix.  The Pork Carnitas I had were well seasoned, coming on a cast iron skilled with grilled onions.  The sides were nothing exceptional, but on the key portion of the mean (the carnitas) the food excelled.
My wife had the shrimp fajitas and given a generous portion of shrimp that she also thoroughly enjoyed.
You have to go a bit out of your way if you traveling along I-10 or AZ 85 to get here, but it's worth the trip.
