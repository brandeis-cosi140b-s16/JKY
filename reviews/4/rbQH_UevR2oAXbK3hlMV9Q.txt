I try my best not to go to fast food chains , but this place is definitely different , every thing is prepared to order and is fully customizable to your like or dislikes , I usually go for the tostada salad these days which is awesome , it's filled with your choice of meat , fresh romaine lettuce , guac , cheese , pico and choice of black or pinto beans in a crispy flour shell ( which is so hard not to eat the whole thing ) , the flavors are great on everything I've ordered here , used to rave about the chicken quesidillas but have been trying to eat a little healthier ( that's why only eat part of the tostada shell lol ) , there salsa bar is regularly stocked and fresh as well ,  beware tho of their queso and chips which can leave you with a craving at the oddest times , usually when they are closed !! It's a rather large serving of chips with a smokey chipotle cheese sauce to dunk those freshly made chips in, Omg yummy !! There are way more health conscious choices available , but I like what I like lol ! So if you are in the mood for some freshly prepared Mexican food , that is relatively good for you and is not Taco Bell or some tackily decorated mom and pop shop where greasy is king then this is the place  you gotta try !!
