I was in town for an interview. It was late in the evening. I was fighting nerves and hunger that kept welling up when anxiety was unable to keep it down. I needed food fast, safe food that wouldn't haunt me in the morning. Pickings in the area seemed scarce.

When, 'lo, a burrito champion revealed itself for the win. 

I had a delicious chicken burrito with black beans and guacamole. It was fat; I was happy. My only disappointment were the lackluster chips. I have been spoiled by the variety found in wheat chips, and TBF's were just too plain jane. 

But, what made TBF such a pleasant discovery still was that, despite it being late and there being only two customers, service was beyond exceptional in this rundown stripmall location. 
I was greeted upon entering, and offered a taste of a curried chicken they were featuring. Delicious. The hospitality, warmth, kindness I found in TBF, not to mention the cleanliness and presentation of what is otherwise a fast-food joint, bumped them from an a-ok to man! I want another the next time I'm in town. They even have Jarritos, my non-alcoholic comfort drink during hard times. 

I left calm and content, ready for the next day's intensity.
