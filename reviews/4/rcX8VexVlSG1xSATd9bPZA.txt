Aimlessly driving down Eastern looking for a place to find something for dinner that would please the entire fam is not always easy. We roll right by sin city sushi and then passed cafe Rio and just keep on truckin... At this point we all started getting to the point of being "Hangry" (so hungry you are angry)... so i made the executive decision to start searching parking lots for places that we have never been. After all, we must find new places to yelp about. 

After the third parking lot the pink fluorescent lighting of Faustos caught our attention.. Yes a little Roberto'esque but we figured, "Why not?" 
Unlike many of the other places I have reviewed lately this little joint was packed.... You have the Indian family to my left getting down on a huge plate of chicken nachos and the group of mid twenty couples sitting in the corner eating this stuff family style like they are at a Mexican buca di beppo. I have never walked into a small place like this and have to stake claim on the last table left to sit in. 

After we put our order in I noticed they have a cafeteria type serving cart in the middle of the room that has the salsas and pickled jalapenos and all the fix-ins.... Only problem was that the place was so busy I could barely get to it. About 10 minutes later our grub had arrived, i had ordered my own plate of carne asada nachos and was amazed at the size of this thing.. the meat was great and perfectly seasoned the salsa was fresh and well worth the 2 arm wrestling and thumb war matches I had to survive to get to the salsa cart. 

This was a pleasant surprise when you look at how we ended up here. The reason why i took one star away was the tacky interior design.. Obviously i am not expecting some Mexican ultra-lounge but the pink walls with crooked pictures could be updated just a little.

I would recommend the food if you are looking for something quick to eat. Be prepared to leave full and with a box because the portions are huge.. Enjoy!!
