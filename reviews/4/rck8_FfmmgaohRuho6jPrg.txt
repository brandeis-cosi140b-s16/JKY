If you're feeling a little hungry, drop in for some carne asada tacos. Reasonably priced, and a-ok in my book, even if I have to douse them with a little more salsa than usual. 

If you're wanting a solid meal, go for one of their specialty burritos. It has like 4 different kinds of meat in it. A little on the salty side for me, but I was so satisfied with the beefy, porky goodness that I had to swear off flesh for a couple days after so I could recover from my meat hangover. 

And if you're feeling real hungry...like Harold-and-Kumar-when-they-finally-get-to-White-Castle hungry, then go for one of the fries. I am convinced that no human being should attempt to try the chicken bacon fries alone. It's a MONSTROSITY. You'll WANT to finish them, but won't get through more than 1/3 on a good day.

It's a notch above the drive-thru places on every corner, but costs the same.
