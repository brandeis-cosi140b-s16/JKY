People, stop complaining about this location. The reviewers are right, its a dive and there is no excuse for the dirty floors, tables, and bathrooms. They just don't want to spend the money.  Shame on them. They are certainly bringing in the bucks, and I love Carolina's but I will not eat at this location, it makes me angry because of the condition, especially with 2 more locations in North Phoenix and West Valley.

The Carolina experience can be sublime ( 50% of the time ),  average (40% of the time), and below average the rest of the time. I have certainly gorged myself and keep coming back for more. It is still the standard for me. And they make the best machaca in the Valley. God bless them all.
