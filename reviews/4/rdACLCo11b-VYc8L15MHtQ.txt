This place is delicious. It's a bit pricey but the best Mexican food I have found in Vegas. Being a LA girl it's been hard for me to find authentic tasty Mexican food. The only bad think is the happy hour menu isn't as good as the regular menu. It's really bad actually. They need to revamp happy hour menu and they will be a five star restaurant. But I must say they have the best tortilla chips and salsa...yum yum yum
