This review is for their "Taco Tuesday" - $1.50 selected tacos.  I ordered 3 tacos - all crispy.  I tried the roasted vegetable (my favorite!!), the tempura fish (pretty good), and the beans and cheese (just okay).  The service was quick and the food was good and very inexpensive.  I'll definitely be back for a quick & cheap lunch!  Great vegetarian tacos at an awesome price!
