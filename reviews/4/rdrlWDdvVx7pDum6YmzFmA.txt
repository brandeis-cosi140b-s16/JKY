Love love love rubios and taco Tuesday's! I always come here for the tacos on Tuesdays. The guy Ryan at the cashier was great and def one of the harder working employees. When I walked in there the floor was covered in sticky goo and my feet kept sticking to the ground. Also there was tons of lettuce and onion and cilantro on the floor. 
Ryan was the only one to start sweeping the floor and tidying up the place. 
The other employee was like "aww Ryan, where were u the other night when we needed the floors sweeper?" This just tells me the employees don't take pride in their work here.
Regardless of that mishap, the food here is amazing and always crunchy goodness.
