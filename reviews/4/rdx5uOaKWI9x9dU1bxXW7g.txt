We've been to Salsa's already twice now in the past couple of weeks.  Why?  It's been convenient, we had coupons, and we were in the mood for Mexican.  

The interior of Salsa's is average, but it's just good enough to let you know that you're in a Mexican restaurant and not a diner or strip mall restaurant.  

To start, they bring you the traditional chips and salsa.  The salsa has a little bit of a kick to it and you can see the fresh cilantro in the tomato puree.  YUM.  

Our first visit in the past couple of weeks, I ordered the Burrito California with pork (to be different, since I always order chicken).  The mezquite grilled pork was/is phenomenal.  It was so flavorful and chunky.  It was so good in fact, that I didn't even consider anything else during our 2nd visit in two weeks.  I ordered it again.  The burrito is also topped off with a green tomatillo sauce, which I love, too.  

If you didn't have a coupon, I can see where the pricing might be a bit higher than other local Mexican restaurants, but what Salsa's does right is provide a high-quality, delicious, satisfying meal.
