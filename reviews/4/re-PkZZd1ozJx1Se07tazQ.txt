Very good Mexican place! I got the enchiladas verdes which were a little too spicy for me but very good. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla which was AMAZING! I wish I ordered it. Friendly staff and comfortable setting!

Been here twice... The second time I ordered the guacamole which they made fresh in front of u! We loved it and will order it again.
