This place is amazing for fast food mexican,
authentic taste, good portions & daily value menu is really great! Amazing salsa bar inside for fast food mexican, not as watered down as other joints.
It would be 5 stars if the night staff wasn't so terrible! They will over charge if you're not careful. Beware!
