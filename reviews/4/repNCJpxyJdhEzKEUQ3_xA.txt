This is an excellent mexican restaurant!  It's clean and has a great ambiance.  The food is excellent and the service superb.  The only thing I didn't like was their thin house soup but the other people in our party liked it so it was probably just me.  We signed up for their e-mail list and they have done a good job keeping in touch with us.  Letting us know about entertainers that will be there and special brunches etc.  Definitely worth trying!
