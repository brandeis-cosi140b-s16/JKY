Yumm, I always enjoy Mad Mex but I've never been to the Shadyside  location. We ran into a detour right on highland avenue & almost gave up. I'm glad we didn't though! I enjoyed this location so much. I always liked the oakland one despite size but this one had so much more space & had a great airy vibe, not to mention the cool painting and decor. The service was pleasing and the food was fresh & hot.
