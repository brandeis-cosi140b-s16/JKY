Good food and good service. I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I like it all. Don't let the westside strip mall location deter you. Get the handmade corn tortillas with whatever you order. Try the huevos rancheros, tampeque√±a, or camarones a la diabla. I also enjoy the micheladas (large and cold). Also a great stop if you are trekking across Glendale to watch the Coyotes or Cardinals.
