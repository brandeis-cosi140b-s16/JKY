A little more home style compared to Roberto's and Fausto's. I had the Steak Special for their Grand Opening offering of $3.99... Great deal! Steak came whole as opposed to the Carne Asada plate version and half the price. 
Ordered two beef tacos and was pleased with not only flavor, but size as well. A little nice touch with the tacos was the mix of Mexican and Cheddar Cheese.
I'm looking forward to trying their weekly specials in the future. If you like Roberto's and/or Fausto's give The lessor known Don Tortaco a try.
