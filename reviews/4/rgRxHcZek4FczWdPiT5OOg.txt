This Taco Bell is vastly improved since I last visited it over a year ago. 

Recently, I decided to give this Taco Bell another chance since I had stopped going there because of them always getting my orders wrong. This time, they got the order right and the food was pretty good. 

In terms of service, the drive thru was pretty quick and the folks working there were friendly. This location recently underwent a remodel, so it seems that the management also got a makeover as well. 

I've stopped back since then and each time the order was correct and the service was good. I think this Taco Bell may have finally got the message regarding their lousy service and food.
