Seriously I love Chipotle! Fresh ingredients and simple choices make this place a top favorite for when I want something "healthy" that's not a salad.

I stopped in last night, the store was pretty empty which was a bonus for me, first class service. I got my usual, chicken bowl, add one spoonful of steak with all the fixings...seriously add all the toppings you have salsa, corn salsa, cheese, sour cream and lettuce and then add guacamole. Please and Thanks!

It was fast, the service was great and as usual my food tasted great. 

Mmmm....Chipotle!
