I am a huge fan of the breakfast burritos here. I usually get the egg, bacon, and cheese. I am very picky about my bacon but La Canasta makes it super crispy, which is exactly the way I like it. The best part about this location is that they have a drive-thru. It's an easy way to get some breakfast on the way to work in a hurry.
