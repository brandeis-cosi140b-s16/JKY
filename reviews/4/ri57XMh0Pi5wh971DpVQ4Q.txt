A group of 7 of us came by at 7 on a Friday night....and the place was empty! I am talking like maybe one or two other tables. 

We all ordered some food; tacos, pork green chile, nachos and salads....and I have to say, all were pretty decent and I felt that the pricing was reasonable.  All of the entrees came with a choice of 2 different sides, and they make some great homemade potato chips. I wouldn't describe this place as a Mexican restaurant, but more Southwest. Nobody had any complaints as far as the food went, the service was good, and the atmosphere was nice. So why was the place so empty????
