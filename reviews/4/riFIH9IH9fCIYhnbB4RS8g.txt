I don't eat out often, as I am admittedly picky about my food's quality, freshness, and the cleanliness of the restaurant. I can vouch for this Moe's as always clean with friendly people...greeting each customer with a loud, "Welcome to Moe's" when I enter. The food is also fresh...often made that day. You have a good variety of what I call a Tex-Mex foods...taco salads, burritos that are too large for me to eat in one sitting, and you can have it 'made to order' your way. You get chips with your meal and their salsa are good, no matter which one you choose. Monday they have some kind of 'special' and are packed so I usually don't go then as I am only feeding myself. They also do catering and one clinic I worked in used to have More catered frequently. The hot foods came hot and cold foods cold, all prepared in closed containers.
