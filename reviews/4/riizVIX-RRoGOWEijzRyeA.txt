Loved the decor of this place, just the right amount of crooked, colorful paintings on the walls. There was a lady singing with the mariachi band when I walked in, which made me immediately like the place. I knew I was in for a good experience. 

I wasn't super hungry, and because I did my research, knew I couldn't finish an entire entree. So, I got a seafood quesadilla which consisted of a crap load of shrimp smothered in cheese, guac and sour cream. I mean, this thing was pretty gigantic for an appetizer item. My friend got the Idaho Nachos, why, I don't know, but it was pretty much huge potato wedges with pieces of chicken, all covered in cheese and sour cream. Strange, but it worked. I know, not typical things you'd order from here, but they were all satisfying and I know I'll come back here for an enchilada next time. 

The waiters were attentive, and a few were even rather good looking, hellooo Alejandro ;D. I digress, but anyway, our glasses were always full and they were very generous with the chips and salsa. They even gave us dessert which was a puffed up, fried tortilla drizzled with honey and cinnamon. 

I'll be back Azteca!
