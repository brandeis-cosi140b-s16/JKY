Great food at a great price.  I ordered three carne asada tacos that came with sides of beans and rice with a medium drink.  My grand total came out to $5.95. I've spend $2-3 more for the same meal at Filiberto's across the street.  The beans and rice were quality.  I've stated before in a review for another restaurant that the quality of the beans and rice can make all the difference.  Many places are generally the same when it comes to the main event of the meal but so many places serve lackluster beans and rice.  Tacos Mexico does not.  Everything about the meal is quality.

The salsa is legit.  Very hot.  So much so that they have a sign warning people.  It's not too hot for seasoned salsa veterans but for the average, um, white person it might pack a wee bit of a wallop.  It must be authentic style salsa.  I've noticed that some places serve salsa that has a very earthy or natural taste (maybe even bitter).  I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it but it's almost as if hot peppers were blended or pureed with nothing added.  Bottom line, this stuff is hot and fantastic.
