I went to the one in Mesa on Baseline. I loved the vibe, service, and decor. They have witty jokes on the walls and the whole place makes you feel like you are at a party on the beach. We ordered the carne asada burrito and the mushroom burger and the sweet potato fries. We got the dessert pear and blackberry lemonades. You get 1 free refill so we tried the blood orange and the guava flavors after. Everything tasted great. I would def go back and get the mushroom burger. The prices are super cheap and the portions are huge.
