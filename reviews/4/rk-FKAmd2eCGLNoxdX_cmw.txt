Great neighborhood spot for drinks and snacks on the patio. It's not our go-to spot for dinner even with the new menu, but you can't beat the beer, wine and taco prices during happy hour. We love to stop by any night of the week for a quick drink and let our little one burn off some energy running around the patio. Service is a little slow outside, but once you let them know you need help, they're always friendly and accommodating. Manager was very nice when we had an issue with the bill. We'll continue to go here and probably give dinner another try eventually, but for now, we love the happy hour. We also enjoy the occasional live entertainment.
