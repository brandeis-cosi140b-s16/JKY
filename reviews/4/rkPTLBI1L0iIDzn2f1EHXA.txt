I've been eating here since I was a little kid in the 80's. I have tried many of their dishes over the years, but mostly I'd order a dozen or two tamales (chicken-green and the cheese and pepper one). I must say the food is almost as great as it was when the owners were cooking themselves. They have the best Tamales, Chile Relleno and green enchilada suiza around. The only downside is the dozen tamales price is rising faster than our economy's inflation. I remember when the dozen was 12.95 now its a whopping 21.95. Its still worth it, but if they keep going up they'll lose a 25+year patron.
