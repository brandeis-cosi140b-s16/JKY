Expectations were low based on the overall so-so review average, but I came away impressed. Had a large happy hour gathering from the office, and tried many appetizers, all of which were fresh and tasty. We had one waitress servicing a massive group and she absolutely nailed it, always there when you needed her, super-pleasant, and just on her game. Drinks were good too. Will give it a shot again for dinner.
