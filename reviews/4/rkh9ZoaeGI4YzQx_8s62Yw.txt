This was my second visit here-- my first visit was a few years ago, the last time I was in the Phoenix metro area. There are so many good Mexican places here that knowing which one(s) to visit can be a bit overwhelming, so I rely on the locals to give me tips.

My sisters have lived in AZ since 1995 and this is one of their fave Mexican places in the West Valley. One thing I must comment on is their salsa. I LOVE THE SALSA AT MANUEL'S. I'm a fiend for good salsas and Manuel's has some of the best around, in my opinion. The food is fresh, decent Mexican, though pretty Americanized by my standards. It's served by friendly people. Gets busy here on weekend nights but definitely worth a visit.
