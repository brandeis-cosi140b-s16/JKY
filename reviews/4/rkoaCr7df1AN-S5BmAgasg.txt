Best chips EVR!!!!! Gil's makes their own tortilla chips from scratch & they are absolutely fantastic. I also particularly enjoy the green chile salsa, so delish.

For the main course, I ordered up a cheese enchilada with chile relleno combo. Food items were drenched in a good amount of chile sauce. The chile relleno was deeeelishous. The cheese enchilada itself was nothing too special & I didn't eat much of it. The rice & beans were delish. Rice was thick & tasty. Everything is made to order and home made, which shows in the food.

No alcoholic beverages served at this restaurant, which is one drawback.
