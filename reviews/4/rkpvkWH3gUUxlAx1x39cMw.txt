I really enjoyed lunch here. The tortas were very unique and delicious! Full of flavor very good combinations. I had a norte√±a torta, it was packed with avocado and cheese. Yum!! The USA torta was good too. 

Our waitress was very friendly. Always smiling and making aure we were doing good. 

Boo-hoo no beer is sold but its not a big deal, get an  agua fresca or a liquado instead, those are great as well!

Overall you have to appreciate this place for what it is, a local torta restaurant, well worth the trip!
