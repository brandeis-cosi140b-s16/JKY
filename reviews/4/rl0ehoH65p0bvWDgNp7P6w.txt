I'm a bit obsessed with Chipotle and was incredibly excited when one finally opened in Dilworth (now they just need a location in Uptown). I first fell in love with Chipotle in Minneapolis 10 years ago. It's just simple, good, fast food. 

Given all the Chipotles I've visited and burritos I've eaten over the past decade, I used to be frustrated with the South Boulevard location. Some of the employees weren't nice and they hadn't really mastered the art of rolling a burrito. But things have improved greatly there. 

I'm pretty loyal to the chicken burrito bol, but everything there is good. If you're trying to keep things healthier, go for a salad and avoid the sour cream and cheese.
