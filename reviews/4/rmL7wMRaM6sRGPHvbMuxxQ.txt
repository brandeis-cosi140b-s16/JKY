Really good food at reasonable prices. Huge portions and a very attentive wait staff.  We didn't have reservations, but were seated within just a few minutes (on a Friday night).  We got there moments before the dinner crowd swarmed through the front door.

Another plus is they don't water down their margaritas like most other places do.

I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 solely because of the off-key singer in the live entertainment.
