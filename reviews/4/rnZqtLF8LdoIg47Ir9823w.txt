It's Mexican food at the Flamingo, so my expectations were tempered. So, this review is on a bell curve.

1. The place was pretty busy, but we got service right away, and it was very friendly and attentive.

2. We all ordered salads. I had the chicken fajita salad, which came with a hearty portion of protein, so yay.

3. Tons of chips and salsa.

4. The people watching scene: if Duck Dynasty and Vikings (the warriors, not the football players) pooled genes, these were the product of their special love -- but in a really hot way! ;D
