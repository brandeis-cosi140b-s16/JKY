Tableside guacamole: you know it's super fresh! The portions are very generous; the 2 of us could not finish it all. I would have preferred less lime, but it was still excellent and the sun-dried tomatoes were an interesting touch.
Carnitas Nachos: Again, super generous portions. The pork was so tender, but the chunks of it were huge (to try to scoop up with chips). This was fork-and-knife-nachos. The black beans and cotija cheese were flavourful and complemented everything. Also, I think there was a full avocado's-worth of avocado chunks mixed in. 
I really loved the chips and all of the variety of salsas.
I ordered a Sangrarita (sangria margarita) and it was great, too.
