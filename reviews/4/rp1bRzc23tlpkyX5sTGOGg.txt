Good Mexican food, great price.  I am a fan of the Carne Asada burrito and the Guac is pretty good.  Customer service isn't wonderful by any means, but the place is clean and the price is great on the pocket book.  My one burrito with rice and beans was enough for dinner and lunch the next day! Yummy.
