These tacos are very satisfying after a night of drinking, not gonna lie. If you're downtown having a good time and you want something to fill that void then Pepe's Tacos just might do it for you.

On recommendation from my friend who brought me here I ordered the carne asada tacos (2) and got an order of fries (ay! very gringo of me! so said my friend). Oh well, I can't help it if I'm white and I like fries!

Glad my friend suggested the carne asada tacos, they were bursting with meat and were very flavorful. Got a few different salsas and slathered these little suckers with salsa and lime. Oh man, they were tasty. You're gonna want to get more than one that's for sure. The fries were pretty dang good too. They put some kind of spice on them that gives them a real good kick. You're gonna like it if you like different tastes. I definitely suggest getting an order of fries with whatever you get here.

Ya, the location is a tad ghetto (doesn't bother me), but the place was clean and there was a lot of families in here when we showed up (kinda late actually). 

It's a good little place to get some bomb tacos in my opinion.
