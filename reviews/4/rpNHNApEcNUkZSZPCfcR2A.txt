So Sad!  

I went to Cafe Carumba for the 1st time this weekend, and was VERY excited  to sit and the bar to drink and eat until my hearts content.

But it didn't happen because the owners of Cafe Carumba decided they didn't need to pay rent.  There was a nasty note on the door from the property manager, and most of the things in the restaurant were cleaned out.    

My only hope is that these guys will get their act together (and their finances) and open a new one.  

Oh well, I got drunk anyways.
