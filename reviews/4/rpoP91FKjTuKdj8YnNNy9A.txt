Chipotle is my go-to for a low-cal lunch during the workday (a chicken salad with no cheese or dressing, but plenty of salsa, for anyone curious). I order online and head straight to the register when I arrive. Aside from being convenient, this allows me to avoid the giant line that forms every day around noon. 

The food is standard Chipotle, which I happen to like a lot. The restaurant is clean and pleasant, albeit noisy. The parking lot seems to be modeled after parking lots in the 7th circle of hell.

The only gripe I have is that my online order is rarely ready when I arrive. Unless I'm 10+ minutes late, I often have to wait for my food to be prepared. But, since the online orders are put together in the back, it's still much faster than waiting in line.
