A great place for Mexican in Montelago Village!

Rough economic times have hit the place hard.  But luckily there are still some great restaurants here including Sonrisa!  The dining area is open and colorful!  The service here is phenomenal! They are all friendly and very attentive!

They bring complimentary chips and salsa for the table.  They are warm and delicious! We started off trying their Queso dip.  Good for white Queso dip but could've used a bit more flavor.  I opted to try the prawns enchiladas.  So good! The prawns were large and plenty of them stuffed inside.  

If I'm in the area again, I would make this stop again.  Thanks for a great meal!
