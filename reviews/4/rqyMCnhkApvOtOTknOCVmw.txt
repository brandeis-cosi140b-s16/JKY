This is my favorite taqueria in the city hands down.  The spot reminds me of Mexican food trucks in LA. The menu is very standard: tacos, burritos, asada, and some other basics.

Typically when I come I'll order the burrito; medium or large depending on how hungry I am.  I'm a purist so it's rice, beans, and meat in the burrito for me.  I've had the chicken, lomo, and carne asada in the burrito and I love it all.  For me this is the best thing on the menu.  The meat is well seasoned and it's just really good!  I've also had most of their tacos and have loved those also.  Their tortillas are made fresh too! How awesome is that?!

Their fresh salsa is a bit watery but you see that it's fresh so no complaints here.  Also, they bring out this super spicy salsa in this red container with the salsa that is SO good!!! 

The place is also always clean and the service is quick!
