Waitress Jessie is very friendly and informative. We ordered a meal that we intended to share and it was brought on separate plates for us (bonus points for that). Food is good (had enchiladas). Salsa not too spicy (for me). Will come back when next craving Mexican food. From what I saw, the restaurant is clean. No complaints!
