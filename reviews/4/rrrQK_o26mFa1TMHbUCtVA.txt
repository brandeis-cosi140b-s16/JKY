Waits can be little long(weekends) plan accordingly!
We were visiting Madison and heard of this place and we were in the area so planned on stopping here.
The Pizzas we ordered were: 1. Featured Pizza without Bacon and 2. Make your own pizza with eggs, smoked Gouda, basil - WOW! My first time eating pizza with eggs and this was awesome! 

They do have a decent collection of craft, local beers.
