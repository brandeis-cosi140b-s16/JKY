Definitely some of the fastest served food in the area. I always enjoy their fajitas, queso and margaritas. While not the most exceptional mexican food I've ever had, its always consistently good. One of the things I think they could improve on, is specifically with their chicken in the fajitas. I almost feel as though the meat wasn't cooked fresh on the spot, but earlier in the day for quick service. While thats great for turnaround and getting food out, it leaves the chicken feeling dry and not as fresh as it could be. If they are looking to push their quality they could really look into a different way of preparing their foods. Overall though I really like coming here and will continue to.
