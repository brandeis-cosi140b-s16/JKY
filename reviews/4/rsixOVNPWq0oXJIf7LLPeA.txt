Phat Phrank's makes yummy Mexican food!!!

Its really hard to find high quality Mexican food off the strip these days. 
Luckily, I found hidden jewel at a locally owned family restaurant.

The food is made fresh to order and delicious.
You have to try the fish tacos it's the best in town!!!!
If you love barbacoa like I do, the Catota Roll is amazing and full of flavor.
Breakfast burritos are fabulous, so much better than Robertos. 

Frank is a nice and friendly guy!! 
i could tell he loves to deliver on food that makes people happy.

I'll definitely be back!!!
