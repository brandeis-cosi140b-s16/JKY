Although the prices here are higher than in California, fianc√© said we HAD to come here because she was bummed the one in our area had shut down after only 6 months. Probably because it wasn't charging Nevada prices?? 

Anyway... pretty straightforward restaurant for Chipotle-style food. And conveniently located near a 24 hour fitness for the gym junkies who want a healthy choice after their workout. 

The guy who prepped my tacos I believe was the prep cook who came over to help because they were getting busy... which came out to be a good thing because he ended up putting good-sized portions on my tacos that I ended up having a chicken bowl after my tacos were finished :)
