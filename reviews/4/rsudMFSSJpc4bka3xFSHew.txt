Love this place. Love the guy, he is super friendly and love the food (for what it costs .. 3 huge tacos for $6 even, including tax). 
Yes, the chicken could be a little spicier or red or something but it's not bad at all. 

Tacos come with your favorite meat, beans, onions, chopped cabbage and tomato and melted cheddar cheese. Tacos come (VERY IMPORTANT) individually wrapped in a piece of foil with a (very important too) a fresh and green (not old and brown) wedge of lime. 
I like each taco wrapped individually in a piece of foil because otherwise they will get very messy and wet like those tacos at Chipotle restaurant, I love them but I hate the wet messy tacos Chipotle has).

Any way, tacos come inside a paper brown bag packed with two different salsas on the side (red and green). 

This place has a fabulous outdoor and sadly dusty patio where you can eat your tacos. Imagining yourself sitting in some place in Puerto Vallarta with an ocean view, except, of course, the view here is Camelback Rd. 

They also have dozens of magazines for you to read while waiting/eating your food. I should also point out those magazines are current and not from 1985. I sat next to a Architectural Digest magazine and it's the same issue currently sold at the store right now. 

The only downside of this place is that they do not offer fountain drinks. You must buy a 12oz can of soda or beer. 

If you are a pro like me, you stop at QuikTrip or McDonalds first to buy a large size soda before coming to this place.
