Decent menu selections, better than average service for a restaurant outside of downtown, and a fair price.  It is hardly authentic, but we dine with our six year old often and Pedro's is a great place for kids or to go after work to watch the game.  They have changed the salsa twice and it still sucks.  I was informed by the manager that the old recipe was 'too spicy' for people in this overgrown Mayberry.  Over all it is decent with pretty good service.  4 stars are for value and service.
