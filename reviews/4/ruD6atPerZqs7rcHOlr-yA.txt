We came here to grab a quick lunch and to check out the new spot in town! The atmosphere was open and inviting, I loved the lighting! The bar in the middle of the restaurant was equipped with TVs, perfect for football season coming up! 

The food was delicious, we were very impressed! Their trio of homemade salsas and chips are fabulous {We even asked for a big bowl of their mild salsa because it was SO good!} Then we ordered the guacamole that was topped with pomegranate seeds. Yum! For my meal, I ordered the carne asada burrito that was simple but perfect. A yummy flour tortilla packed with loads of steak, pico & guac. I also ordered a side of the 'creamy' rice & beans. I was going to go healthy and order brown rice but was convinced that the creamy rice was worth it, and they were right! I left with the second half of my burrito + rice & beans for leftovers! ...Huge portions! The only thing that I wished was on the appetizer list was a queso dip of some sort {shhh, it's my guilty pleasure}. 

The menu also has a variety of different tacos, bowls, tamales & enchiladas. We'll definitely be back to try some of those!
