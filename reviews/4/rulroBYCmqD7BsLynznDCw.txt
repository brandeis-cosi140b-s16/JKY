Food was awesome. Only bad thing was our fault, we got food to go!  I would have much rather eaten this food at the restaurant so it maintained its freshness!  

Flavor was great on everything. We will definitely be going back and making this a regular spot. Forgot to mention the happy hour specials are awesome too!!!!!!
