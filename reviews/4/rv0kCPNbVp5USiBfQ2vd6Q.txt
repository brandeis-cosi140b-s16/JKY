Tried this place yesterday for lunch and really enjoyed it.  I had the Green Chili Pork with the corn tortillas (just like corn better).  The pork had great flavor and spice.  I did request a small cup of their extra spicy salsa, which actually had a hint of sweetness to it but good.  I liked the beans and rice as well.  The horchata was very tasty and a good balance to my lunch.  

For those not into meat I was there with a veggie eater and he enjoyed the no lard black beans with the veggie tacos (again corn tortillas here to avoid animal products).  

I will be back to try another dish here for sure.  Also, it is nice that they have free parking in the back instead of filling the meter.
