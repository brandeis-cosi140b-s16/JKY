Well, let's just keep the Chipotle train goin'! Nothing but great things to say about the staff at this joint, the always stellar burrito, burrito bowl, salad, and anything with copious amount of guac. Never a complaint to be found from this side when it comes to the menu. 

I will, however, say that the access for this location is simply atrocious. Good luck gaining entrance into the pygmy-style parking lot they have going on here....ever. Unless you're coming from Elizabeth on Charlottetowne or from Dilworth/Myers Park on Kings, you're screwed. Only two entrances to be found. Take your pick, do a U-turn if need be, THEN commence enjoyment.
