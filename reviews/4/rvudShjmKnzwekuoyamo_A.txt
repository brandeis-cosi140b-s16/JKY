Stumbled upon this place on accident and wasn't to excited because the outside isn't flattering.  We were greeted as we entered and was one of few tables.  Interior is not as flattering but we took to the menu.  Food was amazing, authentic and fresh.  The Margaritas were delicious as well.   Price was right.  As we ate the service slowed because there was one server for the entire place and a lot of tables came all at once.  Overall we decided we would definitely be back and were pleasantly surprised.
