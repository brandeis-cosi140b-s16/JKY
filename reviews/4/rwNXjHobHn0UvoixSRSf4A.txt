I stopped in here during a lunch break at a nearby work conference. It was 10am and I was jonesing for a breakfast burrito. The atmosphere is nothing fancy but it was clean. The lady at the counter was very nice. I ordered a breakfast burrito without meat. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but they make everything super fresh. The potatoes in the burrito tasted freshly cut. The burrito itself was scrumptious and hit the spot, even though it was just a little greasy. If I lived closer I would definitely return for a hangover burrito. ;)
