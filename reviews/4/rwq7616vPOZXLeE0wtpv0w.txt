Been going to both locations for around 6 years off and on.  What can I say..unique Arizona place.  The unique ordering system takes a bit of effort to master, but it does work.   My favorites include the jerk chicken (which I order w/ jerk fried rice), the jade chicken,  the emerald chicken, the hengrenade chicken and the quesadillas.   A unique place w/ a unique menu that is always worth the drive.
