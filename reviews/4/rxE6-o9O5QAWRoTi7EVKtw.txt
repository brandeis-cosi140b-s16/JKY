El Encanto is about 35 minutes from my house, but we drive there as often as we can to have their lunch. I love the mole chicken enchiladas! The best I have ever tasted! My husband likes their fajitas and tacos. You can't go wrong with these items. I gave it 4/5 stars, because their margaritas are not very good. They are watered down & you can not taste any liquor. However, the food is amazing and if I lived closer, I would eat here all the time. This is a GREAT place to take your guests when they are visiting AZ and if you're the one visiting, this place is a must!
