Had an AM flight out of Vegas and got to the airport early. My girlfriend was hungry so we stopped in here for a breakfast burritto.  She had the steak which was bland and mediocre at best.  I had the works with choriza.  It was really good. Very surprised.  Was big enough to share  Coffee was pretty weak.  Waitress was nice and the service good.  If your in need of some breakfast eats I would give it a shot.
