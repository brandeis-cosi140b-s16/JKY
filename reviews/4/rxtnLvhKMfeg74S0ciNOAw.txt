Pretty cool little dive type bar across the street from the Hard Rock. It is located in a  strip type mall area. Nice patio area outside to chill with tv's. Ordered some wings which were hot and juicy. Love that they have buckets of beer. Can't go wrong there. I wish i could give more info about the place. It seems like a hip spot as I also ran into some other friends that grew up in Las Vegas here. Check it out.
