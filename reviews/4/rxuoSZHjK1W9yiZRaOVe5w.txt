Service: The customer service is excellent. Everyone is very nice. Dalvik was serving our food, while Sara was our waitress. Both were very helpful in my decisions to pick my food. 
Food: margaritas were great. White peach is way better than the house original. 
The appetizer ordered was the extreme tostada nacho. They were great. Real tortilla chips. Ground beef. And cheese. Great cheese. And it comfortably fed four hungover people. (Big plus on that)
I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito. The chorizo was mild and not what I find in a Mexican supermarket. 
My girlfriend ordered the green enchilada. She loved it. The sauce was the most notable. The refried beans however, should have came from a different can. The rice was good. A little crunchy but the enchiladas made her forget. 
The big day burrito was fucking good, said my friend. He ate it all. 
The big daddy bowl was excellent. 

My opinion, if you were raised in America with parents making Mexican food, you'll love it here; it's great Americanized Mexican food. If you're an immigrant, you might want to stick to the hole in the wall down the street.
