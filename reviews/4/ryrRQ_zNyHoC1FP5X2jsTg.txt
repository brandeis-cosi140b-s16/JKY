I was road tripping through Phoenix on my way to Sedona and was craving some breakfast like foods on the cheap and quick.  Lo and behold a burrito place in the strip mall where I  as grabbing some groceries.  Sold.  They have lots of Mexican food options but I went with a chorizo and papas burrito and it was large, cheap and didn't give me gut rot.  That is three stars right there.  I also got some horchata and it was ok, but nothing to rave about.  The place had the feel of a local chain, but I wasn't really there for atmosphere so I don't really have anything more to say about that.  All in all this place did right by me and that makes me a fan.
