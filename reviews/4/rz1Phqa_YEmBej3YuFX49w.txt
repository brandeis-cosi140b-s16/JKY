Go for the top shelf margs.....stay for the drunken chicken nachos! OMG! Wonderful favors and such huge portions!
I think the location of this eatery, just steps from the latest in slots play, has to be taken into consideration in advance. It's not a place to feel like you've escaped the strip for a quiet meal! However, it's DEFITINTELY a place for a good time, some incredible munch-ables, and an easy transition back to the gaming floor!
