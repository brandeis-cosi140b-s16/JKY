I finally had the chance to eat here the other day and it was rad. 

I got a black bean burrito and it was so big I had to eat some of the filling before I could even pick it up. That is my kind of burrito! 

All of the ingredients seemed to be pretty fresh and tasted excellent. When you need lunch on the go, this place is perfect.
