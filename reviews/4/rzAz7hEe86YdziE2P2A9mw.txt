I always thought that someone should open a bar with a pool and was extremely excited when I heard of Spanish Fly. I stopped by on a Saturday and it was packed. It's easily the most popular day drinking destination in Scottsdale. The bar was filled with beautiful people and yes there were douchebags. I don't know why people who come to bars like Spanish Fly and complain about the douche factor. You're at a pool party in Scottsdale. What do you expect? I came back on Sunday and had a great time. Sunday's aren't as busy but I like it that way. They do serve food here and everything looks great! I was impressed with the place and I look forward to spending my future Sunday Funday's here.
