Been coming to the Power Road 'On the Boarder' location for over a decade, seems we got to know everybody over the years. Lots of good times! 

Solid 4 star food with 5 star service, my favorite franchise in the far east valley. 

Well ... franchise's being franchise's a corporate action was bound to happen. With virtually no personal turnover in 10 years, the corporate weenies no doubt cleaned house to make the numbers look better. Only ones left are Larry, Curley, & Moe. (Sorry I couldn't help myself)

But seriously there were only 3 employee's left that we recognized, felt so lost we simply quit going ... can you say ...Boring!!! 

Only because our bank is next door did we finally stop by on St Patty's Day around 5 PM.  Surprise, surprise we got a decent hand made Margarita ... OK ... lets stay and eat.  While the happy hour specials are ... & have always been 'seriously' uninspiring,  I'd have to say the 'regular menu' food was back on par. 

We've been back 2 more times now and surprise, surprise, each was a 4 out 5 star experience. They say time heals all wounds, not quite sure about that, but at least things are starting to flow again around here.  Hell they even have Don Julio 'Anejo' & Micro brews on tap now.

A revamped Happy Hour menu with a small discount on the 'good beer's' & margarita's would have my posse back on a regular basis.

C'mon you weenies, loosen up & let the good times roll.
