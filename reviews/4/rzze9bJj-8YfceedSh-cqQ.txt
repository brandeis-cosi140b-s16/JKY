Just happened to hear about this place on one of the Yelp talk threads. The conversation was pretty amusing. Either way the food here is really good.

Located in a really small strip center with a small eating area. These guys grill up some tasty Chicken. They have a simple menu with counter service and a delivery area that extends out about 5 miles. Nice!

Ordered the Half Chicken Plate with a side of Beans and Rice. It also comes with some spicy Chili Peppers, Pickled Red Onions, Lime, Tortillas and homemade Salsa. The Mexican sodas that they have are always a fun treat as well.

Service is very friendly and the ordering process is not very difficult. You can get a 1/4, 1/2 of whole chicken and they will cut it up and have it ready to go. 

Hoping they may eventually add some more proteins to the menu. How about a little marinated Beef, Pork or some spicy Shrimp.

I'm definitely a BIG FAN and recommend coming over and giving these guys a try. You will probably see me over here for an early lunch. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large enough to fill you up. QUE FANTASTICO!
