I have been spoiled to have always had homemade menudo, so I was a bit skeptical to try an actual restaurant! Well, one day I just felt the need! After going to 2 different restaurants that served menudo on the weekends and both of them being out, I found El Taco de Chandler!

Even though I was convinced that I actually did cross the border somehow and winded up in Mexico, I actually kind of wanted it that way! BRIGHT building on the outside with people riding their bikes/lurking around the parking lot, but hey!, why not?

They serve good old mexican cuisine! Even that grilled whole fish (not sure what it's called, but it's creepy looking and delicious) and of course, my beloved menudo! The seafood selection is pretty big and the girls who work there are really sweet. It's obviously one of those neighborhood hangouts, as they seemed to know everyone who walked in the door by name. 

The tortillas were clearly homemade and the menudo was fantastic! The best part is that they serve it all week long, not just Saturdays and Sundays. It might look shady from the outside... and inside actually... but trust me, it's good! It's either go to a modern-looking restaurant to get americanized mexican food or go here and get the real thing, your choice.

I'd like to go back and try their other entrees, too. They all looked good and what I saw other people ordering smelled/looked delicious. If they could get menudo SO right, I have a feeling that everything else is just as good.

Oh, and they serve beer. :)
