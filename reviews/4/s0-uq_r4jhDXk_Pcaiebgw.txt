WIN It was quite wonderful. The dejected look on my friends face was priceless when they brought out the salsa with no chips. It would have been nice to have but the shrimp quesadilla made up for it. The mango smoothie I had was a little closer to room temp than I preferred but, I'll be back for sure. The burrito gracing the cover of Phoenix magazine is calling me.
