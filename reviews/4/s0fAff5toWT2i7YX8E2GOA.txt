Tried the tacos and their unique quesadillas. Two thumbs up - though my waistline might not appreciate too many of those fried quesadillas, lol. They'll have to be a treat - not a regular thing for me.

Their salsa bar is a lot of fun. Be prepared to spend some time sampling all of them.

Gotta love the dia de los muertos decorating. Unique!
