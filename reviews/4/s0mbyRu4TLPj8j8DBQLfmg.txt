Was here for a Yelp event. What a selection on the menu. Don't forget they have their Tuesday-Tijuana Tuesdaze special- Two Tacos, Chips and a drink for only $5.49. Did not want to forget their Throwback Thursdaze  for only $5.99.

Fiesta time here at Tijuana Flats. Glorious food and delicious too.
Chips with three dips all freshly made. All time favorite is the Guacamole.

Was not prepared for the Atomic Bomb that totally blew me away. Felt like a cartoon character with stem coming out of my ears after biting into the jalapenos poppers. I do not have an iron stomach or gut. Bring it the water hose. It was not so bad after the first bite. By the second and third bite I did not feel a thing. My immunity built up to the hot and spicy stuff.

The entrees were delicious. Chicken Tacos and Beef Burritos. Top of the evening with Churros and Cookie Dough Flautas.  Got my sugar fix for the evening.

Excellent service by the entire wait staff. Coming over to check if we needed more drinks and how the food was.
