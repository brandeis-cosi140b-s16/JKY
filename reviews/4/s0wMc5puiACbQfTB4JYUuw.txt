Quick Review™
* Trailer in the NW side of the Payless Tire (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tire-shop-payless-las-vegas) lot offering delicious, genuine Mexican taco cuisine (2$ a pop) on the corner of LV Blvd & Bonanza. Don't be scurred. 
* Among the best tacos in all of the Las Vegas Valley.
* Cash for anything under 10$ or some similar amount.

It's a stand/trailer. It's in a non-gentrified part of a major city. Uh oh .... Automatically: people are scared. Don't be scurred. Nick Diaz wouldn't be scared. Stockton! (Free Nick Diaz!)

I have only been here in the late afternoon or late night and I am still alive. I was just here last night (Friday) at 2 A.M. Still alive. I'm sure there is a Chipotle® in Summerlin or Green Valley where you would be more at home at though, if it is that serious to you.

This entire review section is dedicated to putting forth the hypothesis that it is perfectly safe here. Crime statistics show that crimes against persons are overwhelmingly committed by people that the victim knows/knew. If you know a methhead that resides on and off at one of the two Siegel®s within jalapeño throwing distance of Buen Pastor, then keep going to Summerlin Mall for your authentic Mexican. ¡Payaso baboso!

I have tried everything here. Everything! Well, everything besides the burritos. That's ridiculous and not Mexican. Or tripas because that is just gross.

Full disclosure: I am not huge on al pastor. I also have no clue what promotions they have here (if any). I come -- eat -- and go on my way. Chicken is my favourite because it may be the healthiest offering here. 

No desserts except very very very seldom they offer a flan that is not to my likening. Half or more of the time I have patronised, they also don't even have horchata. Of course this is not scientific at all. Maybe they have horchata during the daytime and run out every day at 2 P.M.; I don't know. Figure it out on your own, asshole!

There are also cans of soda-pop, if you do that. I once heard "coco" as an option when I asked what drinks they had (when it was obvious there was no horchata) so I figured it was either coconut water or the old Coco Rico® soda which is just the only carbonated beverage (along with Inca Kola®) which will get me to drink nasty sugary mess. The guy gave me a Coca Cola®. Fuck ... and I even know Spanish. 

Pro Tip: Coco/Coca = Original Coca Cola®
Pro Tip: Mande = What's up/huh?
Pro Tip: Don't get anything from the candy vending in the parking lot of the tyre place.

There are car park stalls available whenever I go in the southwest corner of Payless. Actually, there is parking available whenever I go. YMMV.
