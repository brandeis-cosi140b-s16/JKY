Took advantage of the Tuesday night special - $4 sangria, $3 burritos. Both items were good and a good value for the price. Complimentary chips and salsa on the table is a great perk. The manager introduced himself on our way out of the restaurant and the wait staff was all friendly and prompt. Our server split our checks for our group without batting an eyelash. Looking forward to trying more dishes here.
