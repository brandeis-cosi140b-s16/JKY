Now I do love Mexican food... That being said, the food was ok. It is a lot like Roberto's in food options and taste. The place was clean and about average in noise at one of these places. The girl operating the register was friendly and was happy to answer any questions we had about menu items. Having eaten at a large number of Mexican restaurants I can get picky. Here is what we ordered...

Carne Asada burrito: size was good. I could not finish all of it. The meat itself was good in flavor and tenderness but the burrito was dry. I was surprised that there was no sauce on or in it.

Carne Asada chimichanga: It's a good amount of food, my wife couldn't even finish half of it. She liked it. It came with sour cream and guacamole on it. 

Horchata: One of my favorite drinks. This was a little too sweet. Might need to make an adjustment to the amount of syrup in the mixture.
