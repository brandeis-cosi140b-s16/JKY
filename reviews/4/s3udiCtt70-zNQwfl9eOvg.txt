This place is a gem! Tacos are amazing, service is prompt,  and the portions are generous! I got a couple of carne asada tacos and a soda, they have amazing pico de Gallo! Definitely a great place to stop in and grab a bite. Gave it 4 stars because they gave me chicken in one of my tacos Lol. A million times better than Robertos (starting to find out that a lot of places are better than Roberto's ). Recommend this place wholeheartedly.
