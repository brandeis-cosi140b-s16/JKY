Love Cafe Rio Sweet Pork! We try to come about once a month. Last night we decided on a sweet pork quesadilla and shredded beef nachos (with shredded cheese, black beans, and sour cream on the side) to share. I had never had their shredded beef before. I liked it! The sweet pork was amazing as always, and the tortilla was full of it! So good. As for the service and ambiance, the girl behind the counter seemed a bit scattered, and the dining area was full of noisy kids. They were also out of unsweetened iced tea. So some disappointments, but the food makes up for it. I also like their stamp cards so after 10 stamps you get a free meal!
