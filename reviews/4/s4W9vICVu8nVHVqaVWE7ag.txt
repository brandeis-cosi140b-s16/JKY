We have been here a number of times and have always felt we got a good meal for our money.  It is not the fanciest place but hey, it's a place to eat. 

As others have mentioned you start with freshly made chips and two types of salsa, as well as a bowl of refried beans, a nice combination.  If you want more salsa, just ask.  For me the chips is just a vehicle for the salsa to ride so I always go thru a lot of salsa.
 
For dinner I usually order the enchilada's but on our last trip we all got the all you can eat tacos for $6.99.  What a deal.  You have a choice of beef, chicken or fish.  I started with chicken thinking they would be fairly small so I could try the others.  But by the time I got done with my first plate (and all the chips and salsa) I was already almost full.  But being a huge fan of fish tacos I just had to try some.  They brought them out and they were a very decent size piece of fish.  The garnish was just about right and the sauce was tasty.  Although for me I think they could have put a bit more sauce on the taco.

Dang, "where's the beef?"  I never did get to the beef taco. Next time we go I think I will ask for a variety of tacos on the first run to make sure I have room to sample them all.

My only complaint: the Margaritas were a bit on the spendy side.

You can have dinner here for under $10 but $10 to $15 is more the norm depending on your choice of beverage.
