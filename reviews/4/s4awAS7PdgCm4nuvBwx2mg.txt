I have always loved pink taco, a great choice for lunch, comforting and relaxing, we have been to this location before, I always crave chips and salsa after too much drinking the previous night! 

Friendly host seated us at a booth, lunch menu was so good, I was almost too hungry to decide what I wanted! The patron margarita was so tasty and strong, loved it with salt. 

I tried the lobster taco, grilled lobster tail with fruit salsa, rice and beans, the lobster was so tender and yummy, tasted even better with hot sauce! Hubby tried steak tacos, flavorful steak pieces, very delicious. The churros were as good as always. Both of us enjoyed our lunch food so much, Pink taco never disappoints! 

Our waitress was extremely attentive, kept our water full, took away our empty plates so fast, all the girls there were so cute and pleasant, I was happy just looking at them!
