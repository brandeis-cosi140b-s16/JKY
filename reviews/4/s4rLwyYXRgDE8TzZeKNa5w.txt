Came here to celebrate my birthday dinner.  The ambiance was ok....with lots of lively activity over at the Yard with the games, almost too loud.  The service was less than spectacular.  The host answered the phone right when we walked up and it was very awkward.  The waiters were nice but just not as attentive as they should have been.  I will say it was the best Pozole I've ever had and I'm a Pozole connoisseur.  My entree, the Steak and egss were OK.  The OG Margaritas were great too.
