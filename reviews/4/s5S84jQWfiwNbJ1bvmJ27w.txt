This is one of those hidden gems off of the Las Vegas Strip that should be known by everyone who loves authentic Mexican food. If you travel to Vegas and have a car (wouldn't really recommend a taxi ride, but hey, to each his own), you need to come to Casa Don Juan!

Since there isn't a single place on the strip that offers authentic mexican at a decent price, my family and I always head over here at least once during our Vegas stay. Although slightly overpriced (it IS still Vegas), you can get a very decent sized meal for $15-$20. 

I always judge a mexican restaurants' credibility off of ONE FACTOR - their RICE! Most mexican joints have either rice that's too dry/wet or too bland. The rice at Casa Don Juan had that perfect blend of spices and was just the right consistency. I purposefully saved it until the end so that I could end my meal with a bang!

The food itself is pretty good in general. They have all the regulars like combination plates and specialties, but they also have tamales everyday (which is not very common). They're pretty good as well and offer about 5-6 varieties.
