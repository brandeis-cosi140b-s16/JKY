This place is near my boyfriend's house, so we found ourselves ending our days there on the patio. We were there during the week so it was never crazy packed, but there was a good crowd of people. They have good drink specials, and the burrito I had there was pretty bomb. I'll definitely be back, plus this one looks a lot classier than the one in Tempe.
