The food was closer to a 3 star rating but the friendliness of the staff, the immaculate kitchen and the relatively fast service bumps it up to a 4.  We tried the torta Paquime and the torta Mexicana.  Both were good but the Mexicana was better.  Saw someone else get what I call taquitos and a huge order of nachos, after we were already eating.  Those both made my mouth water and wish I had 2 stomachs.  Worth stopping in...
