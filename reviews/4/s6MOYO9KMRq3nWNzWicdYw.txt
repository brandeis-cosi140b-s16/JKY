Although I'm #teamchipotle , this is my go to spot while studying at the Union. 

The pork is pretty good, the queso is a nice touch, and they don't charge extra for guac. (Can you say hallelujah??) 

What really impresses me about this place, and the true reason I believe it merits 4 stars, is the friendly service. Every time I have visited this location in the past couple years, the staff has been INCREDIBLY kind, helpful, and accommodating.
