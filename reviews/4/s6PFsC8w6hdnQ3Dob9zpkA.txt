This is exactly what I'm looking for in a Street Taco Cart!

They have great Pastor Tacos...image that...and from a place called Taqueria La Casa Del Pastor?!?  They give you an option of pineapple with the Pastor as well...the correct response is "Yes please!"

They also do really solid Asada and Lengua.  They have other meat options too, but I have not tried them yet...and in addition to tacos, they also offer other selections such as Burritos, Gorditas, etc.

One of the true highlights for Taqueria La Casa Del Pastor is the salsa bar!  They have some wonderfully flavorful and spicy salsas.  I like heat, but don't like it when there is only heat without strong flavor...don't have to worry about that here!

Thanks to Alison Y. for pointing this place out to me!
