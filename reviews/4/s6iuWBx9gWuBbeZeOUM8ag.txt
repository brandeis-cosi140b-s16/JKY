It was the perfect location for what a few friends and I have deemed $20 Tuedsay.  This is the same night that they run their all you can eat taco special.

They have six choices of meat fillings for said tacos and you can also go with either corn or flour tortillas.  You get your first four with a side of rice and refried beans.  (I would like to just try fried beans once to see if I am wasting my time. - Mitch Hedberg)

Now, being of a svelte nature, all-you-can-eat deals are usually wasted on me.  But at $7.50, I still felt like I was getting a deal.

The food was delicious and the service was great.  Not sure if it was the fact that my former Duke linebacker buddy put down about 13 tacos or we were cute guys to the heavily tatted dude serving us, but we even got a free round of Tecate's thrown in there.

The only odd thing is the fact that they share both an entrance and bathrooms with CommonHouse next door...
