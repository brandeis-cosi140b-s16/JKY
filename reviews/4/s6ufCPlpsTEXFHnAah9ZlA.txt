Food is great but the restaurant is pretty dirty in the seating area. Peeling wallpaper dirty baseboards food on floor etc. Staff is nice. Men's room is pretty bad, dirty grout broken tiles dirty floor smells like urine. I am visiting Mesa so maybe that is the standard here but it could be improved a lot. Dirty restrooms seem like it may be an indicator of other problems. But food is great.
Update: came back again the next day. Salsa bar us awesome. Highly recommended. I hope they can clean up a bit.
