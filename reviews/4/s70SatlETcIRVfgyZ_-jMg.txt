Great food, great price, good selection of items as well. You really can't go wrong and won't go home hungry. We always get the queso dip with our chips. 

It can be busy on the oddest of nights and then sometimes the service takes a hit. But great all around. Best place for Mexican in Sun Prairie hands down.
