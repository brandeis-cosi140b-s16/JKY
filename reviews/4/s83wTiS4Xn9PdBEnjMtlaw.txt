Very enjoyable lunch after a long morning of traveling.
After an early flight from Oregon wanted to get out of town a bit for a more low key introduction to the local cuisine before heading North. Great location, welcoming young waitstaff, cold brews and warm chips made a fine howdy do. Hubby had the quesadilla supreme- wisely choosing the half portion- even though he's a big guy, it filled him up nicely. I had a local taco egg scramble with some very flavorful beans. Tortillas had just the right amount of lard to give good flavor and texture.
Great start to our vacation. Oh, and the lunch proves were very reasonable as well.
