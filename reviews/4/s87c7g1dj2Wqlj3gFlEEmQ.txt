I'd hate to be the first to give Maria's 4 stars, because it is a small local business and the lady who takes our orders has always been sweet. The restaurant is definitely on the small side and pretty bare - just a few booths and tables and the Mexican channel is always on in the corner, but nonetheless, pretty good food for the price you pay. I came here for lunch today and ordered:

 California Burrito - $4.84 (including tax) - great deal, it's a huge burrito and pretty yummy in my book!

I also had the street tacos before on a previous visit, but they're definitely not taco truck quality like I was expecting. 

The hot sauce is pretty good, not too spicy, but just adds that little extra flavor that really makes the burrito delicious.
