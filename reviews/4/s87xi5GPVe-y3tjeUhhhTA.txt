My family and I have been dining here for a few years now. Only thing I don't like are the odd hours, because it can be confusing at times. Seriously. There was a time we went to have lunch sometime during the week, and it was 3pm. When we got there, they were closed.

Anyway, the food is great. The service isn't bad; not AMAZING, but not bad. :)
