My friend and I stopped by Mundo before heading to the Smith Center to watch Wicked. We started off with the guacamole and it was delicious! They also gave us chips and salsa. The salsa had good flavor but wasn't quite spicy enough for either of us. We both ordered the sangria and I would highly recommend it.  

We're both alike and we can never decide on one thing. Since she's a vegetarian, I decided to go with a veggie entree so we could both try two different items. She ordered the garden quesadilla and I ordered the garden enchiladas. Both entrees were pretty good!  I would definitely like to go back and try one of their meat entrees though. They also have a brunch menu that sounds amazing. I will definitely be back sometime to give it another try.
