Hit this place for dinner on a trip to Scottsdale.  My buddies wife said it is the bomb and booked us reservations.  She was right.  Everything we ordered was delicious and the pork belly appetizer was amazing.  We wish we had only ordered a bunch of small plates and apps as they were plenty filling.  Portion size is awesome and dishes are definitely shareable.  Pricing was reasonable as well.  

Service was a bit slow but our waitress was super friendly and made solid food recommendations.
