My friend and I were looking for a place to catch up so I could hear all about her recent adventures to Europe. There are some cool deals around Pittsburgh on Tuesday nights, but I had been wanting to try Verde for a while and the 20% off Taco Tuesday was definitely a draw.

We started with the chips, salsa, and guacamole. Everything was delicious - the chips were still warm, the guac was nice and chunky, and the pico de gallo was a great balance of acidity and tang. I think we could have done with more pico, but that's minor. I had the pollo tacos and pescado tacos and both were great. The pescado was spicy and I had never seen carrots on a taco before, but it worked. The pollo taco had moist meat and a deep flavor. My friend had the camarones taco and the carnitas taco and had glowing things to say about both. I can't really comment on the drinks, since we both just had cans of Tacate, but next time I'm there and don't have to drive, I'll be hitting up a margarita. We both had Mexican ice cream for dessert and it was super creamy and rich.

Our server was great - attentive, friendly, and able to recommend some of her favorites to us. I was nervous to go after reading some of the older comments on Yelp, but I would DEFINITELY go back again.The only thing I would caution against is going when it is very very hot. It was a 90 degree day and there was some air circulating, but I don't think there was any a/c on. I was pretty sweaty by the end of the meal, and so was my friend. I can't believe I'm writing about sweat in a Yelp review...but there it is. Anyway, Verde: you should go.
