I was visting Phoenix from Chicago and this was the place that all the locals were telling me to check out.  I will say that I am glad that I did check it out.  Although I only checked out the lounge area.  There was a local act in the main room, asking $25 for admission.  Sorry... that's a little steep for one guy on an acoustic guitar.

So the lounge it was.  The lounge area is pretty sparse, which works.  Just tables and chairs.  Apparently a DJ plays later, but we left a little before midnight an still no DJ.  Oh well, maybe next time.

One suggestion, get another bathroom.  Having to wait behind a line of 5 girls is never a good thing.
