Not a huge mexican food fan in general, but Guedo's was fun and pretty good (for mexican.)  Fish or shrimp tacos & burros are very good, tostada & torta were pretty good.  Love sitting outside in the sand :) The no credit card thing is weird but there's an ATM literally at the front door, so get over it people.  They just don't want to be hassled with the extra charges, I'm ok with that.
