Now I admit the only reason I first walked in is because there's another EL Charro where I was growing up in Montrose California. It's not the same owners, but the food is really good. Maybe a tad bit overpriced, but it's an enjoyable experiene. The wait staff has always been reasonably friendly, but as long as they do their job competently (which they do) I really don't care how much time they take to chit chat with you. It's not the prettiest of restaurants, but that doesn't bother me. I"m willing to try any hole in the wall as long as the food is good. The only think that bothers me is that they don't serve Coke or Pepsi, they serve RC Cola. Not the biggest deal in the grand scheme or thing, but it might throw some people off. All together though, I would  recommend this place for sure. I don't get to eat there are often as I'd like anymore since I no longer live in the area, and it's quite unfortunate, as it's hard to find decent Mexican food in my area.
