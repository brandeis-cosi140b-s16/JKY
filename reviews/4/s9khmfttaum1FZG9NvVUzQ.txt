I like the Cochinita Pibil the best. Not a fan of the other tacos and I could do without the rice and beans. The horchata is something to write about. I have never had horchata with fresh ingredients...Very Tasty. The server was nice and quick. You have to get your own salsa so stock up. Would love to stop by again!
