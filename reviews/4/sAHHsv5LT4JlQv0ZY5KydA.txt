I love hosting large groups here! They are so accommodating, will do separate checks and provide excellent customer service. I've had at least 5 events with parties of 20+ people (sometimes even last minute) and they don't bat an eye. 

The food is pretty good and they have a very large bar selection. The tortillas are fresh and my favorite dish is the shrimp fajitas.
