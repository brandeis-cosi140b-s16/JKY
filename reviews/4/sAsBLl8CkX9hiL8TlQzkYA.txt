This was my first time here.  This place makes me wish I lived closer to Mill Ave.  

Walking around Mill on a hot Saturday afternoon, looking for a place to have a snack and a drink and found this place.

The place was pretty empty when we got there and realized school's out for summer and it's a hot AZ weekend. 

Ordered the chips and salsa for the app.  Impressed with both. The salsa was very different and unlike anything I've had before, also served a trio (pico, green and red).  All 3 were different and very good.

The service was top notch.  James, if I recall correctly.  He was very attentive and was more impressed with his service when I noticed the place had gotten unusually crowded in the 15 minutes or so we had been there. 

We ordered some street tacos.  Upon James' suggestion, did the pork and fish tacos.  Both were superb.  The fish taco had some toppings I have never had but made it spectacular and the pork...there are no words.  With a pineapple salsa, it was amazing.

They have an extensive drink menu, especially the Tequila, hence the name of the joint. The tequila was priced within reason, especially the higher end Top, Top shelf ones. 

The only reason this place did not get a 5star is the seating arrangements.  The table is especially low and you sit on bar couches that make it very difficult to not hunch over or get food all over your clothes.
