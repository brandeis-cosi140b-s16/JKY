They serve beer (actually a full bar now)!!!  
This time I got a crunchy carnitas taco and a blackened chicken taco, SO good!  The carnitas is very flavourful, tender and the blackened chicken has a little spice.
When we were leaving we saw a couples order; Carne Asada and Chorizo nachos, they looked phenomenal and they said they get them all the time!!!
