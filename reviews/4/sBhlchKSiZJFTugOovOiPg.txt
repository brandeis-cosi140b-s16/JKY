The food is great!  The place looks great as well, it's very clean and organized.  The only thing I might mention is that the service feels rushed, as if they're trying to get the line shorter by confusing everyone by asking what we want before it's actually our turn to order.  Often times I must repeat myself a few times before they get what I want, which is frustrating.  However, like I said before, the food definitely makes up for it!
