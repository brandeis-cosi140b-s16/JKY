Thinking of cheap Americanized Mexican food and cheap cocktails.... Come here. Our server was awesome, the food was prompt and delicious.  There was a salsa bar and unlimited chips to go with it.  They gave us an extra margarita on accident!!!! I've been looking at the other reviews for this place and I have to say... I thought I was judgemental!!! All I want is a server who doesn't hover but knows when to refill my glass, a friendly smile, good food, good cocktails. The prices can't be beat and my server... I think his name was Luis but I'm not sure... Always had my glass refilled.  There's nothing worse than an empty glass and a thirsty patron.
