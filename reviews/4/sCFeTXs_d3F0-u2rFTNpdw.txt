Charlotte certainly isn't lacking for Tex-mex food, but El Cancun always pleases me.

Don't get me wrong-- this is your typical tacos, burrito, chips & salsa kind of place, but compared to others in the area, I find it more satisfying and a better value for your money. Lunch, especially, is nice because you can eat for about $5 plus tax/tip. I'd say this place is on par with Azteca on Woodlawn, if you need a comparison.

Daily specials are your standard fare-- one day has cheap Corona, another cheap margaritas, for example.

If you are in the area, definitely give it a try. If you are up in Charlotte, I wouldn't both coming all the way down.

Staff's always been friendly, and one of the big guys there always seems to remember what I ordered last time, even if it's been a few weeks.
