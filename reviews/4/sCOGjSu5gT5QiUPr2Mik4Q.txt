I'm really loving all the local businesses that have popped up around this area. My brother had us go here for dinner with the family to we had a chance to check it out. We went in on a weekend and sat right down. I loved the interior and had a nice modern Phoenix vibe to it. 

I ordered the enchiladas trio and after a couple bites I could tell the similarities to Gallo Blanco. Turns out I'm NOT a fan of Mole winch was one of the 3 enchiladas but the rest tasted good. Oh almost forgot, ordered the guac with the chips and salsa, such a good idea their guac is so delicious!! Of course just like Gallo Blanco they have the squeeze bottles of red and green salsa and of course my wife and I emptied a bottle. 

Overall good experience, quality cooked foods, and good prices for a local trendy restaurant.
