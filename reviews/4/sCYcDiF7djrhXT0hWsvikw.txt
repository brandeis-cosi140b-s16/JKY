Yeah, everything is just a little bit more expensive on The Strip.  But at least here it feels like you are getting a bit more for your money, unlike some of the other blah blah eats on the strip.  The environment is great, inside the Luxor and the d√©cor is very modern with a pretty fancy but sporty looking bar area.  The staff was friendly, you get FREE CHIPS and salsa that tasted homemade.  You get TWO types of salsa, green and red (spicy and mild).  Then the food, cooked well, presentation was great, and the servings were more than adequate.  The drinks are made with fresh squeezed fruit so prepare to buy several because they are just damn good.  And the food was served quick.  Will be back on our next trip without a doubt.
