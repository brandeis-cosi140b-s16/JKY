Came here for happy hour.  $3 tacos and nachos and half off beer and drinks.  We ordered some chicken tacos and they were very good.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of the margeritas.  Turns out they use organic agave nectar and fresh lime juice instead of sweet and sour mix.  Really good!!!
