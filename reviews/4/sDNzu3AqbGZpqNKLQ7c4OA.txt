I am literally distraught that this place is closed. Oh how I looked forward to my Pancho's run when I go back to AZ but obviously this isn't going to happen. I have to admit after the manager from Fort Worth left the quality went way down. Pancho's is a childhood staple as I grew up in Fort Worth and my grandpa used to take us every Saturday morning at 11 am. (And you BETTER not be late!) Goodbye my tex-mex in AZ for now I will have to wait until I make it back to Texas to eat you again. This is the one I frequented while in Fort Worth:
