I've been to la tienda y la taqueria a few times now. The tacos are a must, along with the Mexican cokes and futbol jerseys. On my most recent visit, I was surprised to see they've expanded the dining room and added a bar. Unfortunately it was a work lunch, my name isn't Corey and I don't work for Yelp, so trying the micheladas isn't part of my job. Bummer. However, the torta milanesa was nonetheless intoxicating, beyond its bigger-than-my-face size and onto its tender, breaded and seasoned chicken, fresh avocados and tomatoes and lightly toasted roll. Perfect food-coma lunch. Probably a good thing I couldn't have that michelada after all. Go at a time you can get both.
