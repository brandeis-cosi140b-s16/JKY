Loved it. Just...loved it. Very hip vibe, very fun decor (can't go wrong with Lego Storm Trooper posters and hexagon tile walls), and the food...mmmm! The hubs didn't care for it too much, but he would prefer a big-ass burrito wrapped in foil to something with complex flavors and interesting ingredients. :) I love him, but he's not a foodie. I really enjoyed it--the tacos were fresh, brightly flavorful, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The house wine was great, too. Didn't taste cheap, and at $9 a glass, it better not be! The kids' menu was totally do-able for my picky 6 year old. She had a quesadilla with fruit salad and gobbled it up. We told her no churro for dessert if she didn't...that did it! 

Dessert took 20-30 minutes to come out. Not sure what happened, but they noticed, and they comped the dessert, plus gave us a $10 voucher for next time--very classy move, and saved the experience. 

I'll be back, probably not with the husband, but with my friends who are more adventurous!
