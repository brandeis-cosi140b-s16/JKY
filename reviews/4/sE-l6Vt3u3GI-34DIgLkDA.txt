I'd give it 3 stars compared to 3 Amgio's and sabor, but I'll be nice here.  4-5 star tacos, great salsa, and reasonable prices on everything else.  Not too much to hate on.

If in this area, I won't go here on a normal basis, as I do like the other places I mentioned above.  But the southside and northside La Unica's are my favorites in those areas.  All the locations have the same salsa and tacos, and that's really all I go for.  Its cheap, its easy, and its good.  What else do you need.  I certainly don't need some weird shrimp dish or something with a super rich cream sauce.

Service is friendly, food is good enough, you just won't find me at this location very often.  I hope you guys are happy with that 4th star, I thought twice.
