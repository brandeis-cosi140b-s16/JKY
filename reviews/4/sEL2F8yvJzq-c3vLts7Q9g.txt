We went to the one on E Desert Inn Rd., let me start by saying the food is awesome and the portions are plentiful!  The cheese they use in their food is so good,  the enchiladas were amazing and I'm sure it was the cheese! The chips and salsa are also super good, they give a bean dip along with the salsa which is equally delish! 

The only things that  I would complain about are the margaritas and our server. Starting with the server, he was really short with us and very unfriendly. The other staff members were so friendly though, so it wasn't such a problem as it could have been. The margaritas were terrible, they tasted like a glass of sweet and sour, literally the tequila was unnoticeable. With that said, I can handle dinner without a margarita and an unfriendly waiter as long as the food always tastes this yummy!
