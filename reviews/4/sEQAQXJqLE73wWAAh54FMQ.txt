The food is great and the place is a hole in the wall. Typical environment for places with good food. Probably more suited for a quick lunch than a dinner. No alcohol. I got the two enchilada's and was a little surprised when I could not choose to get a chicken and a beef..so the menu is pretty rigid. Overall - the food was delicious and service was friendly.
