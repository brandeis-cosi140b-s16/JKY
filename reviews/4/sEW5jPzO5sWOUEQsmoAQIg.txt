Went there with hubby and mother in law. They bring out chips and salsa and bean dip at the beginning. I'm not a Mexican food expert but we all loved our food. I ordered the shrimp enchilada and after trying the other dishes, thought that mine was the best. SCORE! Our server was friendly and quick. The place isn't fancy looking but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.
