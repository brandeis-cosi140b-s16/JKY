Was working in this area of town and was starving. Thank god for the yelp app. Reviews were right on the money. I got 2 carne asada tacos on flour tortillas. This place is legit!!!  Was truly surprised once I entered the business. It was clean and the staff was friendly. If I'm ever back in the area I will return. Thanks yelp nation for steering me the right direction.
