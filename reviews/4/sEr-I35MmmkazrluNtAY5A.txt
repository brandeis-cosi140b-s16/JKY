This place has the best lengua (tongue)of any of the filibertos restaurant. And the chicken enchiladas are great too.I would if given them 5 stars but there was one occasion it was thick and not as well cooked maybe the regular cook was out that day. Other than that best one I've tried in the Phoenix tolleson area.
