We often eat at El Pollo Loco when we are at our home in Reno. I tired one here a little over a year ago and was very disappointed. 

Well As I was traveling west on Indian School I noticed this store and said to my self, why not. 

I ordered and received my order quickly, it was all done by a very pleasant young woman. 

Got home, opened the package and found I actually got what I ordered. 

Ate it. Liked it. So when in the mood I will trek back to this location for more yummy chicken. 

The place could use a bit of a scrubbin though. Oh well can't have everything, huh.
