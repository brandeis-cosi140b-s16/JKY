I love Taco Bell, but just make sure you review your drive-thru order before you leave the window. Being that teenagers work there they often mess up the order. Also, when you order sides of sauces they don't fill the cup up all the way. Just remind them you paid $0.25 and to fill it up to the brim! I mean really! 

The employees there are mostly great! They are getting better with customer service recently which improves the quality of your order.
