Casa Reynoso is definitely nothing fancy, but the food is good and consistently so! I've eaten there about a dozen times and each time has been great. The service isn't great, but it is more of a hole-in-the-wall so I don't expect much. The servers aren't overly cheesy and trying to win a tip. They simply take your order, and bring you good food, followed by the check. That's it. It's usually busy, but I've never had to wait to sit down. The complimentary chips and salsa are great too!
