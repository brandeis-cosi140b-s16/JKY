I have driven by this restaurant everyday for the past several years and never given it a thought.  Last night I tried it and all I can say is wow.  Started off with a Patron margarita, which was very well made.  I had a fish and shrimp taco.  Both tasted extremely fresh.  My wife had the fish diablo, and it was the highlight of the table.  The diablo sauce is fantastic.  Give this restaurant a chance, you will not be disappointed.
