Once again Modern Margarita and Brent hit it out of the park for our big group. This was our 2nd time going on Sunday for the all day Happy Hour. The food and service was fantastic and no delay. I tried the new Steak Tostada and i can say that i wanted it again the next day. Great flavor lots of meat. My favortie margarita is the honey watermelon with sugar trim. Chips, salsa and guacamole made the rounds and was fresh.
