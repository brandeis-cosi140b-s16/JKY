The last review I wrote was for Pane Bianco... now I move on to DEL TACO, cuz that's just the type of guy that I am! 
Why 4 stars for Del Taco? For a chain taco joint, the taste, value, and service are unbeatable. 39c tacos, everyday! That's less than $4 for 10 tacos!! Quite the meal if you're broke! I've always loved the Del Classic Chicken Burritos, as well as the chicken soft tacos too. There are always spectacular deals, and the staff members at this location are particularly friendly and efficient. Also, this location is much cleaner than other Del Taco's I've experienced!
