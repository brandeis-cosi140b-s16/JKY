First, let me say the service at this restaurant is some of the best I have ever come across - prompt seating, prompt drink ordering and delivery to the table, fresh chips and salsa.  Coupled with their great service are some really delicious Mexican food recipes using fresh ingredients.  Try the cheese enchiladas - fresh homemade sauce makes them great.  I'll be back!
