4 stars because this place is great for fast food.   It's a little hidden but worth finding.  The lime infused rice is wonderful, the burritos are HUGE and all the meats are always fresh and well prepared.  It's great that you can get in and out of a place so quickly with such wonderful food.  This beats Jack in the Box or most other fast food places by a LANDSLIDE!
