Carnitas Guanajuato is located in the old Knife and Fork building on Sharon Amity. When you get our of your car, it smells like roasted meat, rotisserie chicken or grilling pork, it smells delicious. 

The menu has the mandatory, basic Mexican restaurant items, but where they differ, they offer all kinds of meat, kind of reminded me of a Peruvian restaurant. By the looks of the photos on the menu, they pile the plates high. One item caught my eye, a pound of pulled pork, yes please. I would like a large plate of pork, enough to feed four. 

I decided on ordering queso, guacamole and an al pastor taco. So when the server came around, I ordered, refried beans, jalapenos, sour cream, queso, and guacamole. There were so many little dishes on the table,  they also greet you with three salsas, pico and lemons. (LOVE) Every little dish on the table was delicious, you wanted to keep putting different salsas on bites, each bite would be a blast of comfort and heat! What a rush!

We never made it to round two for the tacos. Maybe a reason to return today!
Sad to report it looked like beer only. No tequila. Gasp.
