I went there with my bestie to meet a friend of mine (and his co-worker) from way back when in college. The four of us sat on the patio at a surfboard table chatting it up, eating appetizers and listening to tunes. 

What's not to like? I love the beach, beach atmosphere and sand under my feet, so the Sandbar is the next best thing.
