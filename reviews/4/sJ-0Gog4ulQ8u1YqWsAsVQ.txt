I ate there with 6 others and we ordered two baskets of chips and salsa. To have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant was strange but it was only 3 dollars and this is Vegas after all. The server however was quick to bring us more chips free of charge which was awesome. The salsa was great with a good spice to it. I ordered the Ancho Chili Halibut which had great flavor to it. Sided with a slightly too bland for my taste cilantro lime rice and black beans which were delicious if a bit runny. The halibut was slightly over cooked but only just and was so good the toughness is almost not even worth mentioning. I was not expecting much from this place but I was very pleasantly surprised and would be more than happy to come back.
