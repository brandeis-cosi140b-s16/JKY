This Mexican fast food restaurant looks run down but the food is good. I like their daily specials Monday thru Friday. 99 cent Taco's on Tuesday and 99 cent Bean burrito's on Wednesday. 60 cents to add cheese.

 There is one friendly old Mexican guy that works around midnight to 6AM. He makes the best Bacon, egg and cheese burrito i ever eaten. He always greets me by saying in a thick accent" How are you doing my friend". 

Wish i stilled lived near this restaurant. i used to always eat there.
