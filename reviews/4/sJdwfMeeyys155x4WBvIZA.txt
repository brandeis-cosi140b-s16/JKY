I came here a couple of hours after the big quake of '15.  I needed to take my mind off of how frightening it was to feel such tremendous geologic power.  OK, so that is a bit of an exageration.  I grew up in SoCal, earthquake country USA.  Feeling that little temblor we had made me home sick and I needed a couple of good tacos as a remedy.  

I had to try Taqueria El Buen Pastor.  I think I tried it once as a food truck and wanted to give it another go.  I ordered one asada taco and two el pastor tacos complete with pineapple.  I went to the salsa/topping bar for some cilantro, onions and green salsa.  This trifecta is what makes it for me.  I topped each of my tacos with the three and chowed down.  

I went with the asada first.  It was fine.  The meat was tender but not overly flavorful.  The el pastor tacos were better.  The pineapple gives such a punch in the arm to that pig.  There was a bit of gristle in the pork but nothing severe.  I just picked it out and kept going.  As good as the el pastor was and the asada wanted to be, the real standout here was the tortillas.  They were warm and fresh.  They only time I have had corn tortillas so good they were homemade.  I would come here for just the tortillas and have a side of meat to put inside.
