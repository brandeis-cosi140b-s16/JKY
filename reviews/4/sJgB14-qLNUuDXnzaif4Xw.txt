You can definitely tell management has been  making efforts to improve this franchise. The staff are mostly friendly and prompt. The tacos are filled to the edge with ingredients, and the line moves pretty quickly now. Sometimes they leave an item out of my order or give me unsweet tea instead of sweet, which is the worst, but most of the time everything is great.
