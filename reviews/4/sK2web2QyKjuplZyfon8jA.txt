We were looking for something new and different and we found this place Los Molcajetes means Mortar as in mortar and pestle which their signature dish is served fresh from the oven in a big Mortar.  Unique!  

We drove quite a way to get here there was a line out front, always a good sign.  We found out it was one family waiting for a big table and we were seated right away.  We were greeted with a Mariachi band singing for a table nearby and a friendly waitress came to out table very quickly.  She was super nice and seemed like she really wanted us to enjoy our food and have fun!  We each ordered a margarita and we got a small taco to split to start (that was a mistake).  When we got our dinner the Mortar is for two people and with the chips you munch on with a really spicy salsa.  Tons tons of food no appetizer needed!  The food was awesome and it had more ingredients then the normal to add to the taco you make out of your mortar.  Soso good very happy girl.

They had a clown walking around doing ballon animals a mariachi band the spanish music awards on a guy selling CDs came thru another selling candy bars and a woman selling stuffed animals!  A LOT going on!  It didn't bother me they do not bother you unless you call them over so it just kinds reminded me of laying on the beach in mexico!  LOL
