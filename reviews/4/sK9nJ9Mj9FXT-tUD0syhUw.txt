I was visiting in LV and this was close by.  Beings I'm from a small town with few restaurants like this, I gave it a try.  I liked it!  I had a HUGE Nacho Burrito for lunch.  I went back for dinner and had one of their salads.  The salsas are really tasty.  All in all I'll be back whenever I make it back to the area.  It's on the order of Rubio's and Chipolte, which I've tried in other cities, not mine for sure........
