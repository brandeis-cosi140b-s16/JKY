I went to Barrio Queen on New Years and I was very impressed. The manager made an effort to come to our table and inform us to think of the menu as "sushi". Strange--- I know, but it makes sense. The entrees are small and you can order one or two to start and then move on from there... The tacos are delicious! Its actually comforting, in my opinion, to go to a mexican restaurant and know that you are not going to be served these extreme portions nor leave stuffed and ready to explode.
If you like fish tacos, try the dos xx battered pescado tacos. So good!
