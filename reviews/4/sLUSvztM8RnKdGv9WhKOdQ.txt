I was finally in the area to try this place and would not let the opportunity pass by. 

I got there close to closing and the food was still very good! The service was also great! Always a good sign of good business. I examined the menu for a minute before I decided on ordering the carnitas plate to go. While I was waiting for my order, I picked up a couple different salsas to try. They were both good too! 

The plate came with a good portion of carnitas with lettuce and guacamole next to it, rice and beans, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas (I went with the corn). I dove into the rice and beans first, they were pretty good. Next, I assembled a fat taco and ate it rather fast with the salsa I brought back. Safe to say, this place is legit. 

I seen a lot of things I wanted to try on the menu so I will definitely be back.
