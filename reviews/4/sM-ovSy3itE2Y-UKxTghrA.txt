I have been coming here for so many years maybe every 4 months or so, either with my parents that live in the area or with a group of friends that also live not too far.

Yeah the place is always busy, parking is crazy, etc etc. But i feel its worth it, they have great specials all the time and the dishes I have tried are very good but not amazing. I always get the fajitas or nachos, both are tasty so that is what I stick to. Chips and salsa are good, chips are crisp and the hot salsa isn't really all that hot. 

For me Valle Luna is a convenient place to meet, have drinks and catch up with friend and family....get there early or at 5 for the specials.
