My daughter and I had lunch here today for the first time.  Nice atmosphere, fresh chips, good salsa and hot sauce.  My daughter loved her chimichanga. I had a combo with shredded beef taco, enchilada, rice and beans, all good.  Plenty of food, we both brought home half of our plate. We are looking forward to coming again and trying some other things on the menu.
