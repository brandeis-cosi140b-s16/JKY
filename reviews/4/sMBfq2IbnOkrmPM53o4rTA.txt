Great Food served fast and cheerfully on a Sunday night in a town that pretty much rolls up the sidewalks at dusk.
Alright, that's not very fair to Phoenix, I'm sure there is plenty to do in the wee hours of the night if you know where to look and I don't.
Fortunately I noticed Two Hippies Beach House yesterday night and remembered it tonight when I wanted some good food, fast and cheap and fun.
The prices are a solid value, four tacos, chips and salsa, mango lemonade and a bottled water, all for under $14. Plenty of food for two and very filling. Unfortunately they take cash only. Fortunately they have an ATM with a very reasonable dollar fifty service charge right in the building. 
Decor and atmosphere is fun and laid back. Outdoor seating is varied and if you can't find a comfy spot to sit and enjoy your food you are way to demanding.
Four tacos, one Green Beef, one Cactus, one Chicken, and one Carne Asada, were all very tasty. I opted out of the cabbage they use in leu of lettuce (crispness factor) out of consideration for my somewhat picky tummy. The Carne Asada had some gristly and fatty pieces and was overly peppery but still palatable. The green salsa could use a bit more kick. And the chips were fine, nothing to write home about.
Had a chance to speak with the owner since we closed the place down. Mo is a terrific guy who is more than happy to answer questions about his suppliers and general business philosophy as well as his life, family, hobbies and interests. We very much enjoyed talking with him and will check out the other restaurants in the group.
