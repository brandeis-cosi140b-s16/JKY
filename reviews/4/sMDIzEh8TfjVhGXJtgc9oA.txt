Very good food! You get a lot of food for your money. The servers are always very friendly and attentive as well. I always get nachos and everything is DELICIOUS, I even purchased their Groupon deal. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because their "birthday song" for guests is extremely loud and disruptive. They use loud whistles, bells and the whole nine, you can't even hear the people at your table while it's going on. Other than that, great restaurant!
