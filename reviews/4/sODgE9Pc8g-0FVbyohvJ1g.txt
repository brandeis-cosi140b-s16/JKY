This is one of my family's favorites! We have been coming here for 10+ years, and the quality and recipes have never wavered! Know that I married a bring my wife here once or twice a month, her favorite dish is the quesadilla with Machaca, plenty of cheese, and a healthy portion of meat!   I have a couple of favorites! The Sonoran style enchiladas are amazing, as well as their green chile burrito! This place is very reasonably priced, with great service, an authentic Mexican cuisine. Do not miss out!!
