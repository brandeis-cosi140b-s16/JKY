Yeah, pretty decent mexican food, GREAT big giant margaritas.  

Done lunch and now dinner 3 times here.  I don't wanna advertise this too much because I'm afraid that if too many people catch on, the restaurant will figure it out and put a stop to it BUT...Once a buddy and I figured out the secret to getting hammered on their margaritas for cheap:   Order a pitcher of margaritas with NO ICE.  They are OK with that!   You get 3x the amount of margarita, and they will still bring you glasses full of ice.  Go figure.  Winning, Duh!  

I guess by reading these reviews that it's hit or miss with the food, but their margaritas are worth going there for, even if the food does suck on your particular visit. They are just damn good margaritas. KILLER margaritas.  Seriously.

Also, regardless of the food and other qualities that make a restaurant what it is, my take-aways are always based to some degree on how good of a time I had there.  If the food sucks, but I still have a good time, I'm gonna remember that and that's gonna be reflected in my reviews.  Maybe it's just the good company, I don't know, but at this place, I have always had a good time, and I don't remember the food ever being less than good.  

Go have yourself a good time!
