I've ordered food from this location a couple of times and never had an issue. I love that you can order and pay for everything on their app. It's always ready by the time I arrive and it takes a few minutes to pick up. I highly recommend ordering through their app or online if you are limited on time because this location is always super busy around lunchtime.
