This will be my Mexican restaurant for out-of-towners.  The ambience is hip and cool (has a Brooklyn/Williamsburg feel to the place).  It's not your typical authetic Mexican Restaurant.  

For a frame of reference - I really love street Mexican food - Cabeza, Lengua, Chicharone, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Al Pastor Tacos - Not the restaurant for these types of tacos (La Salsita, Ta Carbon is where I'd go)

For dinner, my fiance and I got way too much food...

Prickly Pear Margarita - on the sour side - not bad though
Guacamole (made from scratch) - really really good, but I can make it at home
Oaxacan Tamale (wrapped with banana leave) - very good flavor
Pork Taco - not bad
Beef (Carne Asada) Taco - very good flavor, goes great with the salsa
Fish Taco - very good as well, flaky meat this is not too dry and yet flavorful
Beef Torta - probably my least favorite dish...don't get me wrong, the meat is very good and tasty and the bread is good - just not my cup of tea
Posole - nice broth that comes to life after you add all the garnish and the chili sauce (I think it's Guajillo chili but I am not 100% sure)

Not a very expensive bill even though we got all this food - we had a lot of leftovers.  

If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant that is unique, hip, cool to out-of-towner...look no further than Gallo Blanco.
