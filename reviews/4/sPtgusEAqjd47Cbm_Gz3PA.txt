I did not find the gorditas that fascinating. But later I found out that every gordita in different regions of Mexico are made differently, so then I got it. The meat is super good and smooth. But I believe that meat will go even better on their Guaraches, tacos, or sopes. I don't think on there gorditas it was all that great. I ordered the two gordita plate. I loved the plates and the salsa! How often do you do somewhere and find the plates where they are serving the food to be great?

  I had a chipotle and a chicen one. They were both good. Oh yes Su N. the Gorditas are $3.50! Not four bucks. Either way if they were 4 bucks you won't find them cheap anywhere else, so live with it. Why go to a restaurant and complain about making them yourself for then? Kinda very missing the point of going out and tasting other peoples ways of making food right? 

  The gorditas Ive' ate in the past are estillo Michoacan so thats why I was so taken back when I got these. I just didn't know. The seating was pretty cool and it was clean inside. All in all whenever you pass by this place, to me, you always imagined it all nasty and dirty inside, but quite the opposite. OH yes they open at 10AM on Sundays and the rest of the days too.
