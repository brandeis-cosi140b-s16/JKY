I did catch an episode of Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives and since they did get Matt's Big Breakfast right, I was hoping for the same for this place. I have to say the Bombero burrito rocked! It was so tasteful with the right amount of heat (certainly not 5 alarm, but nice), and other Mexican spices. The kids had two $1.15 taco's each which was the right amount for them (if you're an adult, I would probably get 4). The place is tiny, not the best setup, but the line moved fairly quickly.  I'll certainly be back, it ranks up there with Carolina's as one of my ATF for Mexican in the valley.
