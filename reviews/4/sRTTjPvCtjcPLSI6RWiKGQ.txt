Came here on a whim since I was getting my car washed by Mexicans next door, who did a great job by the way, heh. At first, I thought it was a ice cream shop but then I saw the menu and the sign behind the counter advertising the food they sold. The girl at the counter didn't quite understand what I asked for but her coworker did and asked her in spanish to hand me a menu. 

I grabbed a seat at a table nearby and perused over at the selections available. It was relatively empty since it was early afternoon and the sun was definitely bearing down. I was sweating hard like the fat ass I am and got a bottle of coke. It was the legitimate returnable bottle of soda but they charge more for it but the girl didn't quite understand that I was asking for a fountain drink. Like I said, I don't think she quite understood much English. I ordered a three tacos to try: pastor, jerked pork and another pork selection. The waitress then brought me over some chips and two different kind of salsas, a tasty red one and a spicy green one that looked like liquidy quac. The green was not as flavorful as the red one but had a little more spicy kick to it. The tacos came and I added some of the salsa to it. Pretty good.

All in all, a good experience. Prices on the tacos were a little more than I like but not expensive. It would've been better if the waitress understood me a little more but it sufficed.
