Best tamales!! Delicious food! Had the caldo de camaron and it tasted just like my own. Most places don't put veggies but this place does plus avocado which is rare due to the host cost. Only downfall was the wait time for the food and the place was understaffed therefore, not very attentive with drinks, chips, or other necessities.
