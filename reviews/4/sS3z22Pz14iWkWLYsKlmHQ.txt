After our waiter brought out a torta, I wondered why I didn't get one myslelf, although the beef sope was itself a meal to behold.  Enough for 2 people, the beef was plenty tender and it was seasoned quite well.  My friend got a cheese quesadilla, which was also good, they bring you veggies to eat with your meal, instead of just some rice.  When in the neighborhood and looking for a tastey cheap meal (no alcohol, though) Tortas La Presa does the trick.
