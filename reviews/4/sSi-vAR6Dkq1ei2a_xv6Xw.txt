La Parilla Suiza is one of my local faves. I probably go there about monthly - sometimes more, sometimes less. The food is great and reasonably proced.
  I understand there are several, but I've only been to this one. I like the environment. The kitchen has a large window and you can watch some of the preparation. The wait staff is always very friendly. A few times they've even had mariachis playing table to table.
  They use a lot of white cheeses, which I really like. I don't order the typical mexican tacos and enchiladas here, so I can't rate them, but the main entrees are really good. I'm a big fan of the Champignones Suizos - a mushroom and cheese appetizer. I've had the chilaquiles, chicken melt, parillada de pollo, and others, and always like them. I really like the churro beans - it's more of a Pinto soup than the typical refried beans. I've not tried the mole, but my son who likes mole enjoys theirs.
  The price is good. I never wait long. The facility is good. The service is great. The food is great. What else can you ask for?
