I went to Rosita's as a reward lunch with my team from work yesterday, let me tell you going anywhere with us is a challenge in itself!, we have Juan aka lunchbox, who can certainly eat his share and more! We did give Rosita's a headsup that we were coming even though there is just 8 of us, but the place is always busy!
We got there and were seated right away and got Lauren as a waitress,  she took great care of us! She even got assitance to bring exta chips and salsa which by the way was super yummy! Love their super size cups, never have to ask for a refill they're like a half gallon size, perfect for my diet coke addiction! 
I decided in 2013 to enjoy life more so I ordered dessert first, the shortcake soppapiah, fabulous! I had the spincah enchilada with white sauce which was melt in your mouth goodness! I am a lucky girl because I sampled my coworkers lunch, a tasty bite of a chimichanga, and a fajita! Oh yes and I got a bite of the fried ice cream too, can you say pajama jeans, I needed them by the time I was done! Everything was fantastic, service included!
