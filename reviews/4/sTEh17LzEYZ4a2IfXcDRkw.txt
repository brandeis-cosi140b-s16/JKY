Went back again for the Sopapilla and it was half the size as the first time I went! It was still good but it it was also not as flavorful. Maybe it's was a different cook. I also found that the internet has items on the menu that aren't available to order, that was a disappointment as I really wanted the chips with queso blanco and New Mexico green chiles. 

If this place wants to succeed they need to work on consistency, other than that I really like this place, hope they do well.
