Setting the mood.... South Phoenix just received a nice cleaning by the way of a quick downpour of rain last weekend. It was awesome. We decided a good Mexican meal was the celebration for rain in AZ. 

Saturday evening right at dinner time. The place was busy but we were in and seated after a 15min wait. The building sits a ton of people. 

We ordered the Green Chili Beef Chimi. The chimi, rice and beans were  the perfect size to split. The green chili  had a great flavor, enough beef etc. The rice was good but the standout was the beans. Man they were good. 

The chips and salsa are ok. I like my salsa a little chunky but it had good flavor. 

The prices seem reasonable and the staff was ok. We will be back.
