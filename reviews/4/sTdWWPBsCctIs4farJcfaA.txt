The food is freshly prepared and far lighter and more flavorful than any fast food place.  The service is pleasant and efficient, at close to fast food prices.  

The mahi mahi is so flavorful, and I love the grilled fish burrittos, especially Baja style - some of the best I've ever had!  The fish tacos are also excellent, any way you get them (I've tried many different versions, always great).
