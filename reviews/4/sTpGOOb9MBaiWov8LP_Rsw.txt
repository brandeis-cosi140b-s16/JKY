Always here for their California burritos... The burritos are huge and can be easily shared by two people.  Their jalapeno and carrots are somethin I havent seen at other similar places, id recommend it if you,re lookin for some heat! The drive thru service is fast and friendly.  I have seen they did remodel the inside seating and does not look as,roughed up as before... There is a drawback when using your card to pay- 50Â¢ addtl charge, which shud b done away with.
