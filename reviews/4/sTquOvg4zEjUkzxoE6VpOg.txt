I go to this Filibertos a lot. Normally their portions meet the cost Today though, when I got home an looked at my Taco dinner that I always get - I was very disappointed. I don't know if they had a new cook, or what. But - everything was about half the amount it always is. The rice, beans and beef in the taco. Hope this isn't the new normal - or I will quit coming regularly. Otherwise, their food and portions are decent.
