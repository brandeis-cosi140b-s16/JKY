3.5 but rounded up to 4 

It is quick and convenient when I am jonesin' for Mexican food.  No frills, just simple standard Mexican fare (tacos, burritos, tamales, etc).  They have a different soup every day of the week.  My favorite day is Wednesday - Cocido Day.  Cocido/Caldo de Res is a flavorful simple beef broth with chunks of simmered meat. large pieces of potato, carrot and cabbage.  A very simple soup but satisfying.  
Friday is Menudo/Posole Day - Again flavorful and satisfying.  

Their portions are generous and their prices, I find, are real world and not downtown prices. This also solidifies the 4 star rating.  The staff is friendly and food good.  Simple...
easy...
