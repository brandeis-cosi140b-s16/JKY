I'm so bad for coming here after my boyfriend talked me into getting turkey tacos! Lol. I've never had a bad experience at this place. They have never messed up my food the 4 years I've been coming to this location and all the staff are usually nice. Thank you del taco for keeping me full and my wallet happy.
