Due to the fact that my mother had never experienced it, and that there is one located less than a mile from our digs here in Queen Creek, I had no choice but to take her Chipotle virginity this afternoon.  I would say that this location is fairly comparable to all of the others I have been to, but with much more indoor seating available.

Obviously, because this is a multinational chain, their menu offering is the exact same as all other locations.  We opted for the Carnitas (trying to provide the authentic Mexican experience here people) on a salad (authentic no more) piled high with all of the fixings, and of course, a side of guac for the lady.  For some reason the medium salsa ended up being a bit spicier than I remember, but super enjoyable nonetheless!

If you are unfamiliar with this chain, it is important to note that THEY SERVE ALCOHOL!  Yes you read that right, bottled beer and margaritas (even Patron if you're feeling fancy) are available for the thirsty adults that want to close their eyes and get as close to the real deal as possible.
