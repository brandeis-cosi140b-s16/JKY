The place is probably not the best looking restaurant you can find in Mesa. The building is a bit dated and the decor is as well. However, the staff is very friendly, efficient, and helpful. When you order your food and the restaurant and bar are both packed, you can still expect to get your entire order in less that 5 minutes. The food is awesome and about as authentic as you can get.
