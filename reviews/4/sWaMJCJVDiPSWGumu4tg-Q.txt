A seat yourself, cenPho authentic Mexican restaurant. A patron for over ten years and the food and service has not yet left me unsatisfied.  Friendly staff with great smiles, family- ran, booth or table seating, fun decor, good chips with delicious home- made salsas, a variety of delicious dishes, and speedy service.  Try the mole, barbacoa, albondigas soup or anything on the menu and you'll be fulfilled and content.  One con: no beer on tap.
