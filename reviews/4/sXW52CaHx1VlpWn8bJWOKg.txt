A great place to stop in for hard to find, long lost flavors of my youth, in Pittsburgh.

Las Palmas is nicely stocked, and seems to have become pretty well established, thank God, because food is bland without jalapenos, chile, and Cholula. 

I usually make my own salsas at home, but they make a great tasting salsa verde, which is super convenient. And I didn't even know I could get ready made Horchata, until I saw it in the drink cooler, (even if it's made with milk)... Until I get back to the southwest, I'll stuff myself with pan dulce, menudo, and horchata here.
