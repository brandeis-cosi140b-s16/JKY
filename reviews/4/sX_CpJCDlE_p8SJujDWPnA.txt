If you want tacos for lunch that are real and not from, "Taco Hell", this is the place to go!  Small, comfortable, quiet, and excellent tacos.  The lunch carne asado tacos are the bomb!  They are pretty fast too so you don't have to worry about your time being sucked up waiting for your food during a busy lunch.  The only reason they lost a star for me was the flan.  It was overcooked and too hard.  If they can perfect the flan, it would have been a perfect visit!
