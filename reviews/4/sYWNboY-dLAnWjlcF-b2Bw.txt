I really love this little place. The ladies here are always sweet and polite even tho there is a slight language barrier but have no fear. I have an iPhone translate app and all is good :) My favorite to get if the nachos and there beans and rice is always fresh. Great customer service too. *Bonus is that I can call my order in ahead of time.
