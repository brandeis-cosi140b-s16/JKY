I get an opportunity to stop in this place every chance I can....it has great food, beautiful people, and the personal service puts it over the top.

The waiter is quick to get your drink order, and while that elixir is being created, freshly made chips and 3 types of salsa are placed on your table.  While you gorge on this appetizer and wash it down with your adult beverage requesting a second round, your appetizer of Mexican Sushi is brought to your table.  You have to try this dish!  

For dinner, I recommend the mahi fish tacos...just enough with the fixings to make your stomach say "thank you."

If you don't order a third drink, perhaps dessert is an option...what could ruin the evening at this point?  Notta...

You just have to at least try Mundo once to say you'll be back.

Yes, it's in the beautiful and monstrous World Market Center, but take some friends and I know you'll have a memorable time.
