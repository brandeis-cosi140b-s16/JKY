This location has been a Mega Cafe and a Cocos, The other day I was driving by and I noticed it was open again, this time as a Mexican restaurant. Today I was working in the area when lunch time arrived, so I gave it a try and am I glad I did.

I walked in and was seated, it was early so there was no crowd. The waiter immediately brought the menu, salsa dip and bean dip with tortilla chips and ask for my beverage choice, I chose iced tea. 

I scanned the menu, a lot of variety. I ordered one of the lunch specials, a beef chimichanga.  While waiting I started eating the chips with the dips, both were very good and the chips were freshly made. I'm enjoying the chips, look up and my meal is already here

It was a nice size chimichanga, with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo on the side, with rice and beans. The chimi was excellent, shredded beef and cheese, the rice and beans were average, but good.

All this for $7.50 including the drink. I will be back often.

The staff was friendly, the food very good and the prices good. Give it a try
