I have to give a quick throw down update to Robertos... This place is walking distance from my house and the neighbors and I have been having late night beer pong tourneys and well nothing soakes up a stomach full of beer pong domination like a giant burrito, my new hangup is the breakfast burrito with bacon... This location is one of the cleaner and friendliest... I was shorted a side of Guacamole one time but other than that mishap the location has been spot on and helps to take care of any late night suffering!!
