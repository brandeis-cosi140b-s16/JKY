When this place first opened up, I was completely addicted.  I'm a creature of habit and a slave to convenience, and seeing as how it's close to everywhere I usually am both of those teamed up to fill me up with so much Taco Time food that I was basically a mobile Taco Time.

And hey, it ain't bad for Mexican fast food!  It sure beats the crap out of Taco Bell and was a welcome change.  Their crisp chicken burritos are good, their chicken soft tacos are a delight, and I'm a big fan of their smothered enchilada that they give a funny name which I can't remember at this time.

The mexi-fries are awesome.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for the stuffed kind, sometimes I just feel like being a tot purist, and they're always totally good.  But, seriously, it's a tot.  It's hard to mess up the perfection of the tot.  Mmmm, tot.

Inside they have a little salsa bar with salsa and ranches and chipotle ranches that make sauce fiends like I really happy.  Also, for the weird ones like me who have distinct ice preferences - They have great ice.  The tiny crushy cube variety that's good for post-soda chewin', not great big hunks of ice.  And they have Cherry Choke.  Always a plus.

Once I saw a roach.  I try not to think about that too much, and I know that even the cleanest of places (cause, really, it does look pretty clean) can get the random critter from time to time.  But, I did see a roach and sometimes I CAN'T forget it.
