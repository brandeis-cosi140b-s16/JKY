Wow! Tastes as good as I remember back in my UCF days. First off, its hard to come by establishments on East Blvd with ample parking so Im thankful they have a big lot. I love the casual atmosphere and GAWKED at the salsa bar as I walked up to the counter to place my order. I got a wet veggie burrito smothered on red chipotle sauce -- it was DELISH! Quite large, but I managed to eat most :-). The salsa bar was like a play place for me, as I love spicy food. I wasnt a fan of the vinegary sauces but I did enjoy several (cant remember the names at the moment). Service was swift and the wait staff were friendly.
