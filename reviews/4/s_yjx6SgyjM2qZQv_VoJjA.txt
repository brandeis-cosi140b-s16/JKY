Big fan of this place, one of my  happy hour hangouts. The food is good, try their mechaca and shredded tacos. Their house margaritas are strong and tasty.  It looks alittle dive but still attracts a large following and is a local favorite in the area,  Great bartender-Daniel will take good care of you. Overall, a great family restaurant!
