So I guess the place has been here for about a year and a half, I've never noticed it before but happened to be shopping in the area and my husband and I decided to give it a try (after checking Yelp reviews first!).
We were here on a Thursday afternoon, around 2pm, not at all busy which at first worried me a bit but then again it was Thursday afternoon. We were seated right away by the hostess, the server was at our table in less than 5 minutes for our drink order and was back again within another 5 minutes for our food order. The menu prices are very reasonable and if you check in on Yelp you can get a free dessert (I think there was two free options to choose from).
I ordered the Carne Asada plate, which came with the standard rice and beans and a side of tortillas. The Carne Asada was good, not the best I've ever had but it was good. My husband ordered a burrito and I can't remember which one it was but he said it was very good. We also saw that they serve Menudo on the weekend, which my husband loves, I'm not a fan but I'm definitely willing to come back to try some other dishes. I want to say they have a Mariachi band on either Fridays or Saturdays but I would call and check which day it is for sure if that's why you want to go :)
