For shame.   For shame.


Ok, this review is not to talk about the food at La Condesa .  I am a huge huge fan of the food and service, and everything else about this place except one thing.  While eating with a friend from Tucson, he recognized the art on the walls as being the art of famous San Francisco artist Sylvia Ji.   So we called the owner over to ask about the artist.  She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?      

The owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these "artists".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings.
