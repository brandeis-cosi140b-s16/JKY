I have been living in New Orleans for a long time, so I have admittedly low standards for tacos and tex-mex. While in town for a conference, I stopped by Rosa's for lunch, and got the fish taco plate with beans and rice. The fish taco was very good. If I had been in town longer, I probably would have gone back again for dinner. And like another commenter said, the faucet shaped like a pump in the women's bathroom is pretty great.
