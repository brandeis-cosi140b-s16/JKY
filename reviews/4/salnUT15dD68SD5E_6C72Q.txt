I stopped here for breakfast after taking one of our rabbits to the vet. My girlfriend had machaca burrito and I had a chorizo burrito. I didn't taste hers, but she's picky when it comes to mexican food, and she loved it. My chorizo burrito was also great! It wasn't greasy like some places. Best of all was their horchata. Sounds crazy but true. Sooooo many places make it too sweet, too milky, too watery, too cinnamony, but it was perfect here. I'd love to try more here, but it's too far from home.
