Based on my carnitas dish alone this place should be a five star. 

The restaurant itself is very inviting and roomy and comfortable. We munched on chips and salsas while we ordered our food and waited for it to arrive. Delicioso! Our waitress was very nice and friendly. The menu itself is very affordable with many different, classic options.

I went with Carnitas and the man went with enchiladas. As far as taste, they were both spot on. My plate was so huge, there was no way I could eat it all. I was able to share my food and still have plenty to take home. 

Sadly,we ordered the queso fundo dip with chorizo for an appetizer and it was so disgusting. I have had this previously in other places but I was appalled at the taste. We did not finish it.

The kid menu is okay. Not the best but still kid friendly.

We definitely will come back.
