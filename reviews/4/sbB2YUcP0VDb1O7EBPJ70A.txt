I have been coming to La Perla since I was a boy. When I wouldn't go to school for some reason my mother would always take me for lunch. They have the best ground beef tacos anywhere... the mild salsa is outstanding... the beans are great they have a chorizo flavor to them... excellent chimichangas and enchiladas. The one bad thing I will say is the place is a little run down. You sure don't want to go on a weekend night when they open up the bar you can't hear yourself think... unless that's your kind of thing. But the food is excellent and they have never let me down all of these 40 +years
