I avoided this place for a long time because I heard it was a chain and immediately decided it would be terrible. I was wrong. 

We decided to give it a chance a few weeks ago. The salsa choices are amazing. I had fabulous fajitas (with far more toppings to choose from than most places) and my boyfriend had fish tacos which looked amazing. And the Sangria Swirl-- yum. 

We were so happy that we literally came back a week later. I had enchiladas (the choose your own trio) and they were all awesome. Try the chicken enchilada w sour cream sauce. 

My birthday is coming up real soon and I'm pretty sure this will be my choice for dinner!  On the pricier side but it's totally worth it.
