The menu has changed... the terrible salmon from before wasn't even on there, so that was a plus from the start.

We ordered the pitcher of the agave margaritas... needs more tequila when you are going to spend $26 on that!!

Other than that... everything was great.  The chile relleno was AWESOME.  Cheese enchilada... AWESOME. 

The wandering bard (I call him that, but he was mexican... don't be thinking British) was pleasant and humorous. :)
