How is it that I have lived in the area for nearly three years and never even knew this place existed.  I have been missing out on some good stuff.  Thanks to my fellow Yelper's I was able to find out about Cilantro Tacos and try it last night as it was more or less on my way home.  I was very impressed when I first walked in.  The wooden tables with the check patter table cloths is a quaint little touch.  The menu is a bit hard to ready being on the large side and directly above ones head.  Thankfully there is a hand held menu that is more easy to view.  I spent a couple of minutes deciding on tacos.  I never was fully able to decide on a protein for the tacos though so I went with one each, al pastor, carne asada and pollo.  They were the exact kind of taco I love.  Simply meat, cilantro and onion wrapped in two corn tortillas.  The al pastor had the addition of pineapple as is customary but the basics were the same.  I also ordered elote to compliment my meal.  A full ear of fresh and crisp corn on the cob topped with mayo, cotija cheese, chile and lime.  I never expected to like corn on the cob with mayo but man was it delicious.  I ended up with mayo and spices all over my face.  I'm glad I was at home when I ate it.  I would have been embarrassed to have done so in public.
