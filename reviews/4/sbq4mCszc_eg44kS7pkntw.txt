Went there with a co-worker since its only a stone throw away from work. We both ordered the carne asada burrito. It was huge but somehow I devoured the entire thing. It was really flavorful and juicy! I literally had meat juice dripping  right out of it. Think of the Carl's Jr. commercial but instead its a burrito :).  I think next time I'm going with the street tacos so I can try both pork and beef.
