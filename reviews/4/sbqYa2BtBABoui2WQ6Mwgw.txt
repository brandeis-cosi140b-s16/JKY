Great atmosphere, great food, great service.

I had the veggie tacos, and my husband had the chile relleno.  Both were really good.   For dessert, we had the flight of three mini desserts... passionfruit tres leche cake, banana empanada with coconut sorbet, and brownie with cinnamon ice cream.  The first two were great, the last one was so-so, definitely too much cinnamon in the ice cream.
