I love Cantina's food. I mean, I really love it. I always get the pork belly tacos because nothing else matters. They have apples and radish on them. Why would I order anything else?

The drinks are pretty good, they are all REALLY strong! I wish they had more non-tequila options but oh well. Just one thing: don't order the bloody marys unless you like well vodka mixed with salsa. Luckily, if you're here for brunch most of their cocktails can double as socially acceptable day-drinking options, so avoiding the bloody marys isn't too hard.

The other thing I love about Cantina is their outdoor patio, which is the perfect summer chill spot. I'd actually give it 5 stars, if it weren't for the horrible service. I know it's a dive bar, and I'm not expecting the best restaurant experience of my life here, but the servers are seriously unhelpful and at times, just plain rude. Still, it's one of my favorite happy hour spots. Pork belly always trumps poor service, in my mind.
