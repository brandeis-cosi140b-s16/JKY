Holy cow what a great hole in the wall. We read the reviews and needed a pollo fundido fix since we had not been in Phoenix for a few years. It was a 25 minute drive but totally worth it. She had the pollo fundido and i had Via Mexico. Both great. The special extra hot salsa isnt really hot but has this smokey grilled  chile goodness that we couldnt place but want to duplicate. 3 margaritas on the rocks were $8.97. We are Austin foodies so we have no shortage of good tex mex but this place is special and a do over for us. Oh yes...fantastic service.
