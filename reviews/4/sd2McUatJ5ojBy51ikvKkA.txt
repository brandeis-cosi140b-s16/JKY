The fig and bacon pizza was fantastic. The careful blend of the meat, fruit and cheeses made each bite a little different, ranging from sweet to savory, but each better than the last. Also, as others have said before, the crust was great. 

On the other hand, I was disappointed by my son's pepperoni and sausage. The tomato sauce tasted of vinegar and canning, and the toppings didn't have the same levels of flavor as those on the specialty pie. It almost feels like common pizza is treated as something not with the same effort.
