My family and I LOVE this place! We have dine-in at least 3-4 times a month. The food is really tasty and affordable. The staff had always been very good and attentive.
My only, albeit slight criticism, is its a small place with limited seating. 
The " Coastal Trio" is my daughter's and my favorites. 
Best fish Tacos in AZ.
