We picked a restaurant like a dart on a dartboard.  It had a great atmosphere, not crowded, and the waitress was really friendly and courteous.  Food was good, the shrimp tacos were about a 4, but we were disappointed, or rather spoiled with the shrimp cocktails. The juice was kinda watered down, not a whole lot of flavor, unless you add Tapatio and the free chip salsa to it. We were used to shrimp cocktails from south of the border, so we had a higher expectation. No big deal, we loved the food, the service, and the location.
