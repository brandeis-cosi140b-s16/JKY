Um.  I love this joint.  Seriously.  It's the vegetarian burrito for me with black beans, obv, with lots of that hot salsa!  Mmmmm!  If I eat the whole thing I'm full for a good 8 hours....and my burrito is always so tasty, that yep, I'm full for a good 8 hours.  I wish I had the self control to save half for later.  

I'd give this 5 stars, but I'm kind of a health nut and we all know those white toritillas are def not healthy!
