After reading so many reviews about the carne asada fries, I had to get them. Upon returning to work from the drive-thru (love that there's a drive-thru!) the wonderfully delicious smell nearly compelled me to mow down small children and old ladies in an effort to reach the lunch room faster. They don't skimp on toppings and the salsas provided only enhance the yummy factor. The price was $7.03, more than I was expecting for an order of fries but the serving size is easily two meals for one healthier than I. 
Happy I found this place!
