I'm a little surprised by the number of so-so reviews of this place.  I had the Crispy Chicken Flautas appetizer as my meal.  They were filling, but more importantly, they were deliciously spicy; I really could've used a glass of milk to cool off!  I'm looking forward to going back and trying something different.
