Stopped by today for lunch. Awesome Mexican Food! I gotta say the best Mexican food in Tempe!! Loved the chipotle sauce! It goes good on all every dish. Didn't get a chance to try out their seafoods, but that's gonna be for my next visit.  I hear the margaritas are fantastic here, with an extra tequilla. Will remember to stop by at this place when I visit Tempe next time.
