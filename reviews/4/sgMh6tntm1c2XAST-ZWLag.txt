Se√±or Taco is one our favs for Mexican food here in Phoenix. The first time we had it was the location in Fountain Hills. Once the one in Glendale was opened we were excited as is was now close to our house and their burritos rock! I would have to say almost anything on there menu list is good. Their salsa side bar is great with roasted peppers, salsa and jalapeno carrots. 

My favorites are their breakfast burritos, all other burritos and their fish tacos. Yummy!
