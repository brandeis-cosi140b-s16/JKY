My first trip suffered from start up issues such as cold side dishes (which were quickly resolved).  The food though was very good. Returned over the weekend and everything was top notch. Everything served hot as it should be.

Burritos and chimis are very well done. Their menu offerings are made fresh daily and it is evident in the taste. The pork is properly smoked and bursting with flavor. The Spanish rice is fluffy and seasoned the way it should be. What can I say about black beans or retried beans? They are what they are but flavorful.

Nice selection of beers on tap and a variety of wines. Decor is executed well with a nice, but subtle, upscale note. Prices are reasonable for the service and food you receive.
