My son dislikes and avoids Mexican food at all costs. However, when we visited this little restaurant the first time, that all changed! The owner (forgot her name at this moment) was there and she made us feel like family. She convinced my son to get a taco and beans and he immediately became a fan! Now he asks if we can go eat at the "Nice Lady's restaurant". My husband and I also enjoyed the food very much. LOVE LOVE their chips and salsa and the service was very good. Yes it is a small place and the service isn't as fast as most chain restaurants, but it is a great exchange for feeling comfortable and relaxed in a "restaurant" atmosphere.
My only  downfall......I wasn't a huge fan of the chili relleno, but the other items I have tried on the menu are very good.
