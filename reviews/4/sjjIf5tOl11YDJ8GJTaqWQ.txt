5 Stars for the Food.

2 Stars for the Service, which can be hit or miss.

The Stand makes the best burger in the area--hands down. (The burgers here are better than anything you could get at Zinburger or Delux, which are both in the same neighborhood.) I love that the burgers are made from a combo of short ribs and chuck. They're super flavorful and juicy.

The burgers here are so good that they turned my vegetarian boyfriend (who had been eating nothing but rabbit food for a decade) into a carnivore. True story. Thank you, The Stand. Danny's entire meat-eating Greek family thanks you.

I've tried the tacos a bunch of times. If you're thinking of getting them, don't. They're nothing special. (One time I ordered veggie tacos and bit into a whole cinnamon stick that somehow accidentally made its way in there. That kind of ruined the Stand taco experience for me.)

If you're a newbie, I recommend ordering a Stand Burger with cheese and a custard-y, delicious Banana Stand shake on the side.  You will NOT be disappointed.

You might, however, be disappointed with the service. Today I ordered my food and received it within 5 minutes, which was awesome. But in the dozen+ times I've visited The Stand, I have typically waited a looooong time for food. On one occasion I waited 20 minutes in the drive-thru after placing my order. (The woman waiting behind me was so irate that she drove off even though she'd already ordered.) On another particularly painful occasion, I waited about 30 minutes inside the restaurant to get a takeout order consisting of two burgers, two tacos and fries. 

Oh, and my fries have been cold probably 50% of the time I've eaten here.

I realize that I'm griping a lot here. I do so in the hopes that management will read this review and try to iron out the service issues. 

Overall, The Stand is the bomb diggity. Despite the long wait times I've experienced here, I'll keep coming back for the burgers and shakes. They're the best in Phoenix.
