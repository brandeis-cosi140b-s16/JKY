I eat here at least 3 times a week.  The cooks are so down to Earth , and also make me smile when I come in. 

I normally get two tacos, steak or ground sirlion. I like that this place is so close to my job and that the cooks are nice.

One con- None of the cooks ever mentioned a  rewards card to me. I would think that since I eat there so much some one would have told me.  I  do have a rewards card now. But with the amount  of money I spend in here I could have had 5 free meals lol. No harm no foul.
