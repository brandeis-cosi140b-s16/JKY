So I'm not a local, but we were walking around Brookline and stumbled across the taco stand outside Las Palmas. Not sure if this is an everyday, but it's at least there on Sundays. It's a simple operation: one guy manning a griddle to heat up tortillas with a selection of meats and a condiment bar. I only tried the chorizo, but it was pretty good. I added salsa Verde, cilantro, and pickled red onion to make a pretty yummy taco. I wasn't in love with the tortillas... They almost seen doubled up, but they're just too thick and dominated the flavor a bit. Otherwise, a great spot to grab some pretty authentic street tacos.
