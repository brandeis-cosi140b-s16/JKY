Espo's is a great authentic Mexican food place in the valley.  They are one of my favorites for their pork green chili and their tacos (with any of their meat selections).  Their seasoned meat has a great flavor and goes well with any preparation methods.  My friends love their chimi and burritos too.  Also the style of the place and decor will make you think you're actually south of the border.  Even the counter service style is typical any time I've visited Mexico.  Their rice and beans are even every well done, not ignored like most Mexican places in Phoenix.

Only difficulty here is that in the summer (ya know, for 7 months) it is a little warm in here.  Let's Americanize the AC unit so Espo's can be one of my summer go to places.  For now though, I have to recommend them in the less scorching months.
