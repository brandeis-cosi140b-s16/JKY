Chipotle-like. Here are the differences: fresh tortillas, fresh jalapenos (the bright green kind; not the pickled kind); they mix the ingredients for you which makes a difference when you bite into a burrito. Also, I paid $7 for a huge huge burrito. I cant speak about their other food, but their burrito is very delicious. Quality of the food is same as Chipotle.
