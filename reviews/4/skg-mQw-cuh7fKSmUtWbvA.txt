Friendly staff. Good location. Line moves a little slow but it's because they get super busy. Outdoor patio has good shade, cool vines, and a good view of Gilbert St. The cut portions of fajitas, lettuce, onions, cilantro and taste of all ingredients remain consistent with what the Chipotle recipe card suggests.
