This place rocks! A dark, ambivience atmosphere- perfect for a romantic dinner or a group of friends. I reserved  a table for a party of 8  for New Years Eve dinner. And they were very accommodating for us. They offer a good selection of seafood, steak and  if you are looking for smaller, try the small plates. You can get one, two or even three for a reasonable price. I had seared ah-tuna and mushroom-brie mini bruschetta toasts for my small plates and they were perfect! They also have great salads. They place is usually crowded and especially on a holiday evening even more so and noisy so if you are looking for quietness, not here! But if you are like me and enjoy the patrons as a part of the dining establishment, shouldn`t bother you! I get a kick out of people watching as well. I`m waiting for Richardson`s to come back but in the meantime will be back here for more!
