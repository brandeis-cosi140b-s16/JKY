The better of the two mexican restaurants during my stay in Charlotte.
Plan on a long lunch if you go. They were very busy and we had a tale of 6. So, it took them awhile to serve us all. As I watched I never saw an employee on the floor that was not doing something. Nobody was hiding in a corner ignoring customers. 
Food was good and arrived hot.
Their table-side guacamole service was a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty.
Hot chips.
Ordered a combo plate with chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada. 
Did not expect the rellano to be stuffed with beef, but it was.
I was not impressed with the meat in the relleno and taco. It was seasoned ground beef which reminds me of fast food tacos. Does that ring a "bell"?
They had an interesting hot sauce. I think it was the juice from canned green chilies and some chopped onions and other seasoning. Was not bad.
Everyone else at the table was happy with their selections. They frequent this place and were familiar with the menu. 
I will be back if in the area again.
