Rather than go to Zaba's for the second time in one week, which my son wanted to do, we hit up Tacos El Compita for some authentic Mexican eats.  It's been a while, so since we've been gone, they have expanded the place.  The night we went, though, it was deserted, but that just meant that we got quicker service.  Three carnitas tacos for me and four chicken tacos for mi hijo to go came to a whopping $9 plus change--much cheaper than Zaba's and muy delicioso.  We need to remember to come here more often.  Muchisimas gracias!
