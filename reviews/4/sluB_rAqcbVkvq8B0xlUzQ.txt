My second favorite thing about Arizona is the abundance of tasty, affordable Mexican food literally right around the corner from your house. El Taco de Chandler is, indeed, right around the corner from my house, and is a small but noticeable step up from just about every one of its peers around the area.

What impresses me most is the consistency: the food is quite good, and I have yet to be served a meal that has disappointed me in any way (other than when I ate the Works Breakfast Burrito, which was my own fault in every way--did I really need one burrito that had ham, bacon, sausage, AND chorizo? yeesh).

I haven't been blown away by any of the food there, but then this isn't a place to go to be surprised. It's cheap, tasty, and has better hot sauce than its competitors, so there's really nowhere else I'll go when I crave this sort of thing.
