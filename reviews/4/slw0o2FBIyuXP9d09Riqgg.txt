Love the bean dip with the chips and salsa. No one does that and I think it is devine.  The margaritas are great, if you get them on the rocks. I wasn't a fan of the frozen banana margarita.  It did not have a lot of flavor.

The food is always good, always extremely hot, and always full of flavor.  

I recommend you don't sit in the bar area.  It is noisy and you can hear every conversation going on in the kitchen (it would help if the staff were a tad more professional when they are in ear shot...I learned a few things about a few people there I didn't want to know).
