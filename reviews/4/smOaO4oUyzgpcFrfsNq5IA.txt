So glad this location opened. The Baum one is always packed to the gills and service has gone waaaay down. 
This location is having expected we just opened issues- ie they will ask you 4 times at the register if you want a drink and there may not be any chicken when you go but everyone is nice and they pulled a few of my favorite employees from Baum to this one so that's cool. I should add any time there is a meat that is freshly cooked I wait for it if I have time. It's always extra delicious. 
Bummed they only have the uncomfortable tables and no booths but you can't win them all.
