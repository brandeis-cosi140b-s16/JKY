I was looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat while waiting for my husband to arrive from the airport. I was alone and there was a bit of a wait so I just ate at the bar. 

I was disappointed that there were no draft beers so I just had a club soda which the bartender kept full. I ordered the shrimp quesadilla which was perfect for a light meal. It had black beans and didn't skimp on the shrimp. The crema fresca was a nice touch. 

The service was quick and courteous. Nice big screen tv right in front of me so I could watch football. 

I was able to charge the amount to my room at the Bellagio and that was wonderful.
