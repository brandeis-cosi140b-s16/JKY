The last two Mexican places in this spot failed bad. Third time was a charm. I tried the carne Asada and they actually let me try it before I ordered (which could in itself be a problem since that shows that the Carne is already made and in a warming dish). Either way, they cut all the fat off and it literally is just the meat involved in whatever you choose to put it in. Originally, I ordered the bowl, but they were out of bowls, and I declined the offer to throw everything into a styrofoam container instead. So I regrouped and ordered my first Torta. Ok, there was too much going on in there with guac (pretty good), lettuce, beans on the Torta and the meat is still pretty tasty, so I would stick to the tacos or maybe a regular burrito without anything but meat and rice on my next visit. As long as the carne remains void of fat (a huge rarity in my life) this is the go to place for worry-free Carne Asada now. Oh, I used the walk-up window and the cashier was muy bueno.
