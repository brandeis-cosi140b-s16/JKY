Stopped here to fulfill a mid-afternoon snack craving.

Based on my experience at Tacos El Compita, I expected tiny lil things.  I ordered a carne asada taco and a lengua taco.  I did not realize the asada taco came with guac, so I ordered a side of guac for 75 cents.

While waiting for the chef to cook em fresh, I grabbed salsa, limes, and some radishes and cucumbers from the salsa bar.  What I noticed is the cleanliness of this place (the dining area, the bathroom and the kitchen), and the interesting decor.  There is a green theme for sure (green painted wood, green tiled tables).

The food came out fast and the tacos were huge!  Each served on a corn tortilla that wasn't all soaking wet, and my side of guac was the same size or slightly bigger than Chipotle's and costs less!

I had the asada first - it came with guac and pico, but I added a squeeze of lime and tomatillo salsa.  It was yummy.  Then, the lengua.  It came with chopped onions and cilantro.  I added the extra guac and the tomatillo and lime, then dug in.  The flavors were great, and the tongue was so good!  Such comfort food.  To be honest, I could probably have had just one taco and be full, at least for snack needs.

They have lots of specials.  This week there was a special listed for 2 tongue tacos, rice, beans and a drink for just $6.25.  If I had been in the mood for that, that is a great deal.  They also serve tortas, tostadas, menudo, and other tasty treats.  The staff is bilingual and they take cards for small amounts.  I would definitely go back and it is 24 hours!!
