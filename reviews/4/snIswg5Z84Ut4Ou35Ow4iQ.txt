Found out about this business through Yelp and I decided to give it a shop. I was very satisfied! It wasn't too busy, but the food was good and the service was friendly. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were delicious. One of my co-workers had the steak tacos and said they were even better. The owner took special interest to come and talk with us (since they weren't too busy), and I would most definitely go there again.
