Wow, I was really surprised and impressed!  We noticed that the restaurant had changes hands, but had not thought to try it until we saw it on Yelp.  This is definitely not the usual generic, anglicized Mexican fare, but seems more like a family restaurant in Sonora.  The food was great and the portions were generous.  Our server was attentive and prompt, but to our surprise, we were the only patrons on a Sunday evening.  I agree with the other reviews about the decor... Kind of  campy with a fake jungle theme going, but it was fun and not over the top.
