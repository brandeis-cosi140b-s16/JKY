Went to Nando's to meet family for lunch, and although we had a large party, we all enjoyed the food and service. It did take a while for us to get our food but our waiter kept checking in on us often. I had the tacos al carbon and a Cabo margarita on the rocks, YUMMY! We'll definitely be going back.
