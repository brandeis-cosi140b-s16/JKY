This is a hidden Las Vegas Gem. I heat here several times a month for their 2 item combo that will fill you up. I like a wet burrito and the Chile Relleno that comes with soup or salad. I also like the Capala's chicken which is a rotisserie chicken that is flas fried to make it crisp on the outside. In the summer I really like the Ensalada Grampa which is fresh greens with a mayonnaise sauce and pulled pork which is chilled to perfection. Tasty and cool in a hot Las Vegas Summer. The Ice tea is rich ans strong and these people know how to make a delicious Flan. The parking is ample and the ambiance ios good. for the price of the meals you can't beat it. It is worth the drive.
