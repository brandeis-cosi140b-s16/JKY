Verde is an upscale Mexican/South American restaurant with a slightly edgy vibe in the Glass Lofts along the Penn Ave corridor between Garfield and Friendship/Bloomfield. 

The food, drinks, and service were very good, even though we visited during the soft opening. We went on a weeknight (the Tuesday before Thanksgiving), so it wasn't crowded and we didn't have any seating/service issues. Food-wise, everyone at our table was surprised by the novel options available on the menu. The food is not the traditional heavy rice and beans Mexican fare found in the Northeast. It is substantially more sophisticated in its preparation and is much lighter on the stomach. The chicken mole, for example, is not drowning in sauce or swimming in rice. It's still hearty though. Everything we ordered was good or very good. The guacamole, made freshly at the table, even impressed all the Californians in our party. The cocktails were tasty  and creative; definitely try the Tequila Old Fashioned if you enjoy the traditional version. 

The atmosphere in the dining area is more cheerful and social than romantic. If you like eating at a bar or having drinks and watching the game, it seems fun as well; there are a few HDTV's and an entire wall of Tequilas. Some cocktail tables separate the dining area from the bar, and there is a patio with a few chairs and tables. My impression is that it's less focused on having a legitimate bar than on having a place for people to have drinks while they wait for a table, but this might change in the summer when the garage doors can be left open. Ali the bartender is very, very good. If you want try something new, just give her a general idea of what you are looking for.

I would come here with friends or a spouse to begin/or during a night out. It's a nice complement to the other options along the rapidly developing Penn corridor from East Liberty/Friendship/Bloomfield/Garfield/to Lawrenceville.
