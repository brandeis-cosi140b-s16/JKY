Location: Awesome.

Downscale, intentionally shitty and cheesy, decent food, excellent happy hour, set up like a giant courtyard,  the perfect place to get sloshed outside in the AZ summer. Or winter. Or whenever.

Plus, think about it. It has the words Gringo and Trailer Park in it's name. 

What could possibly go wrong?
