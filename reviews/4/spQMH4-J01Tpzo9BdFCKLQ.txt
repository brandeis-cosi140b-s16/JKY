I discovered Riva's when I was attending a high school just up the street. It's in the same plaza as Roberto's,so there's a competition. However, Riva's isn't just another chain restaurant. It features authentic mexican food. My absolute favorite is the 2 burritos for $6 deal, and I always get chicken and guac. I'm assuming it's a family owned business because I always see the same workers and cooks.The service is great and once I made a mistake on my order and they fixed it free of charge. I think it's a great place to eat in the neighborhood. :) My favorite mexican place.
