Delicious homemade ice cream! My favorites are the rose, cheese, and pistachio flavors. Their service is always great and they'll let you sample as many flavors as you'd like. I was very impressed by how nice they are!

Their aguas frescas are also very, very good. I tried their pupusas and they were just OK, not my favorite. I will definitely be back for some sweets though!
