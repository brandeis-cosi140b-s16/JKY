Probably my favorite of the breakout of "fresh-mex" type places.   This place is very similar in layout to a Baja Fresh, except they haven't sold their soul to Wendy's like Baja Fresh did.  

The quality of food here is really good.   I especially enjoy the carne asade tacos with a little salsa verde on it.   Thinking about it makes me want to go get some right now, except that it's about 930, and they're likely closed.  I never get the guac, but I've been told it's very fresh and very good.
