You'd never know that La Comida was an old laundromat or that it just opened last summer. It looks like it's been there far longer with its antique tiles, reclaimed wood and stained glass salvaged from an old church, and let's not forget its day of the dead charm. This quaint cantina serves up elevated Mexican cuisine from all over the map. Think, Mundo with less fuss and more character. 

Walking down the narrow entry, I felt like I was whisked off to Play del Carmen or some other Mexican coastal town. Suddenly, Fremont Street was a distant memory. I was taken with the striking bar that serves up more than 100 tequilas and an extensive list of margaritas made with fresh fruit puree. I was unable to resist the prickly pear ($9). 

While seated I loved how sunlight filled the space from the patio doors being perched open, and I enjoyed the warm breeze wafting in. It was a pleasant way to enjoy my refreshing prickly pear margarita served on the rocks; the perfect blend of sweet and tart. It was a great choice to wash down the house chips and salsa. The salsa had a smoky flavor with a slight hint of heat. 

Next, came the carnitas ($11). Three tacos topped with pickled onions and cilantro, served with a side of rice and beans. The carnitas were flavorful and tender. I had no complaints. Everything was tasty and well executed.

Overall, the restaurant lends itself to meals shared with friends and family. It's a great place to get an evening started or relaxing place to enjoy a leisurely lunch or weekend brunch.
