Stopped by here for a quick bite before a game at Wells Fargo & was pleasantly surprised. I got a grilled fish taco & a tempura shrimp taco. The fish taco was average, but the tempura shrimp taco blew me away. For sides I got the tex-mex fried rice & black beans, nothing impressive. But definitely try the tempura shrimp taco, you wont regret it!
