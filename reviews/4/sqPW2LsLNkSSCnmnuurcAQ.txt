Came here last Saturday as this was my first time I got to say the food was delicious a little greasy but what do you expect from a taco place. The only negative I can say about this place is that it is pricey so be expected to pay a little more then what you intended to pay because that's what happened to me and the was a meal for two people that wasn't that much food anyhow the customer service is good you get alot of bigger portions to choose from compared to other taco places overall I will be back.
