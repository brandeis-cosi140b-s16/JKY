My husband and I found this place last week while on a run. Excited for good authentic mexican food we thought we give it a try. Glad we did. I was not a fan of the rice or chile relleno BUT the beans. OH the beans and my husbands tostada, beef taco and enchilada with red sauce (which I got a bite of all :-) ) were delicious. Only being a mile away from home we will definitely come back. I love small family owned businesses and this is exactly that.
