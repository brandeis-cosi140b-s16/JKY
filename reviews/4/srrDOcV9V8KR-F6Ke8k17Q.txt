Staying in this area has had its benefits. One of those is rio mirage!  Great food decent service but the most addictive thing on the planet is the reason to come here!!!  Flaming Toritos!!  Jalapeños stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and grilled. Served with a jalapeño ranch type dressing and pico de gallo!!  Deliciosa!!  If they ever take these off the menu we might have to start a revolutión!
