San Carlos Bay exceeded my expectations and I can't wait to go back next time I have a hankering for some Mexican seafood. The fish is fresh and they don't skimp on anything here. The complimentary chips and salsa and aresome and even better when served with a Corona Chelada. On the recommendation of some other yelpers I ordered the shrimp diabolitos (I think that is how it is spelled) and it was amazing and as spicy as expected (warning- I love super spicy food and this was definitely on the higher end of spicy- heat akin to the level of the slow burn of an indian vindaloo). I will definitely be back for more!
