I've been meaning to write this for a while, but it's felt like such a chore! 

This location is great. Clean everything, friendly staff, never crowded. The wait for food is never more than 5-10 minutes.

Now, the food. These are arguably some of the best fish tacos to be had. I really like that they've expanded their side offerings (pick 2: black or pinto beans, chips, rice). Not a fan of the rice, but the beans are always tasty. The salsas are all delish. I get a burrito every once in a while, which have all been great. 

I just wish there was more food. The two taco plate just doesn't fill me up! A third taco would fix that problem, but adding more items to your order makes it go up in price exponentially. If I'm already paying $7 for my combo, I'm disinclined to buy another taco/burrito/some other food item for $3+

Great food, great service, portions leave something to be desired.
