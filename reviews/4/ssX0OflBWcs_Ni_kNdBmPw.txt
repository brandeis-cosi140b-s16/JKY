1st visit and utilized a 15% off total bill. No liqueur license yet but coming in a few weeks.  Menu was are and had lots of choices.  Prices were fair and service was good. Standard chips and salsa with unlimited refills. Both of us enjoyed our meal and would definitely recommend this new las vegas restaurant.  We will be going back.
