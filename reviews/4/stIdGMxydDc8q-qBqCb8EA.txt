Love this place.  First went for lunch.  The place is SPOTLESS, bright, cheerful.  Had the Flautas and they were very good and as mentioned in previous reviews, fairly priced.  Service was very nice - prompt, friendly, unobtrusive.   Took the family for dinner last night, arrived late and were greeted as if they had been staying just in case we came.  Great selection of Mexican beers and tequilas.  Food was delicious - you can get fajitas everywhere but these are really good.  Service again was excellent.
