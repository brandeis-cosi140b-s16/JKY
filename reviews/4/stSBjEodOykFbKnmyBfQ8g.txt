Look, this is not gourmet Mexican. However, for fast food Mexican, this place is great. The food is always hot, not too greasy, and tasty. 

Their breakfast burritos are HUGE. 2 can easily share and are less than $5 bucks each! They do not skimp on the meat either. The egg & bacon burrito was practically loaded with a full pig.

Also,if you are into hard shell tacos, they can make any taco into hardshell. The carnitas hardshell taco is my favorite
