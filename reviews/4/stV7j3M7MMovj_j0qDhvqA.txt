I've been here before (they're conveniently across the street from the Mezona Inn we always stay at for a thing in Mesa), and I've always been pretty happy with the food (and I live in the greater LA area, the home of 20 million great hole in the wall Mexican places). Service is nonexistent, as you might expect, as is the decor, but you don't go to a place like this to be impressed with anything other than the food, and the price of said food. 

So this time I ordered two things: a breakfast burrito, and some taquitos with what I would have assumed would be fresh guacamole. The breakfast burrito was just *crazy* delicious, crazy huge, and crazy cheap. I 100% recommend that you get one. The taquitos were ok, nothing special, and I paid a dollar fifty for a tiny dollop of guacamole that I'm pretty sure just came out of a giant Costco vat or equivalent. So that was kind of a ripoff. (Though I suppose I can't complain too much, given that if I'd paid a dollar fifty more than I did for the burrito, I still would have been impressed at the price.)

So basically, next time I'll know. And there will certainly be a next time.
