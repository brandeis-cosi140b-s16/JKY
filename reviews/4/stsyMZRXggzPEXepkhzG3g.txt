Went for taco Tuesday. Buy 2 get one free. I tried the Barbacoa, full, and macacha. The macacha was my favorite. It's a little spicy but has great flavor. The babacoa is really good as well. I did not like the battered fish as well in the full, it was a little too salty. They have a great selection on toppings to compliment your tacos as well. I would go back but would wouldn't get the battered fish again.
