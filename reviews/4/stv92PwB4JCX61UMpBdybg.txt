GImme generous goops of glorious green guacomole, oh greedy gitchy guac gal!

So, I have passed this place often enough to recognize the commotion from outside the venue, and wonder what all the hub bub was about.  Clearly popular judging by the always seemingly crowded entryway ( not to mention the small sized venue that you might not get a seat at if you arent lucky), I finally left early enough for lunch with Marnie to try this place out.  On and on about the potato taco and even you would give in to Marnie's suggestion!

Glad I did.  But here is the warning.  Get the guy to give you the guacomole.  The older gal there is a bit stingy and barely drapes the tacos with this green gravy.  Loosen up lady!  Your stuff is a bit expensive and the guac is good enough for me to complain about not getting enough!  So let it flow!

I got the carnitas as well and all was groovy.  
A Chipotle Grill alternative, I feel.  

I will return.  When I do, guac-gal better be generous.  :-)
