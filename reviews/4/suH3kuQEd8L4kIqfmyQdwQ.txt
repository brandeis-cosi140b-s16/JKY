Highly recommend this place. I have told many of my co-workers about this place because it's so good. The Mexican food is great with amazing ambiance and a gorgeous building. The service was a bit slow and inattentive but we went fairly late so there is that. 

If you go, you must try the Sopapillas! They are to die for! Great for a date night place too!
