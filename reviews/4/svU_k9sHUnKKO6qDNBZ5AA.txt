Edit: This place is NOT closed, I just went there for tacos, it is alive and well. The tacos aren't as good as I remember, probably because I've had amazing ones since, but at least you can get them pretty authentic. They don't compare to Las Palmas in South Pittsburgh but they're still good and the service very friendly.

It's several thousand miles north of where it should be (D.F.), but it's absolutely delicious Mexican fare. However, what's not fare is, I heard it has closed down :(

Excellent taco, a little different from what I am used to, but delicious nonetheless, makes me long for my homeland, El Mexico! Oh wait. I have never even been there. And am not Mexican. But hey! Who's counting! 

I'll have to try it again when I go back to Pitt, but please, PA, keep this place open... we are starved of authentic Mexican food in these parts and it is your duty as good citizens. 5/5

Dustin, five years ago, said this, and it bears repeating, so I will copy and paste from the review below me:

"You know, with the recent rash of wannabe Mexican restuarants out there (i.e. Qudoba, Baja Fresh, and the rest of the horrid pack...yes Taco Bell, this means you), it's great to walk into a place that feels truly authentic. A place where 3 generations of people from, you guessed it, Mexico(!) working to keep this place running. There is something warm and fuzzy about everyone screaming at each other in Spanish."

Wise words, Dustin. Wise words.
