Went to Restaurant Sinaloa with my wife today.  Usually this is the kind of place we would drive right past and not pay attention to.  We did this many times for this restaurant.  Well today we went to this place for dinner.

My wife ordered the arroz marinero (seafood rice).  I ordered the coconut shell cocktail of shrimp, oysters, and octopus.  Both were very good.  My wife and I were impressed.  We will definitely return here.  

Do not let the outside of the building or the neighborhood put you off.  This is a place that we want to do well and stay in business.
