Love their Breakfast Bacon egg cheese Burritos, they are thicker then a snicker.
The ladies up front are always cheery and ask how you are doing. 

Fresh salsa bar with all the fixings.  I've not had lunch or dinner there. I suspect it's about the same quality, GOOD!

BAD:  
While their breakfast burrito is off the chain. DO NOT get their Carne Asada Burrito from the lunch / dinner menu.  Only thing edible in it is the Pico!  I've lived in Korea and have ate dog meat. The meat in their burrito reminded me of dog meat. First the meat cut was crap, hard over cooked garbage. Most of the meat was grissel and fat, huge hunks of fat.  I was so disgusted I didnt even let the hobo that went from table to table begging for money. He hit up every table in the restaurant. "Got two dollars?" Not only did he ask every table, he systematically asked every person personally at each table. Management didn't even blink an eye, they allowed this smelly hobo to harrass everyone in the place. But I digress, when he asked me for money, I told him to fuck off and I felt like his punishment should be to eat this shit stuffed burrito. But he knew I meant business and quickly hobbled off.

I would rather go back to Korea and eat dog meat again, then to go back to this place. 

This review doesn't mean a thing because this place is in the heart of business district, and working people will grab a bite to eat without checking reviews.
But I feel better knowing I will never go back there again, and hopefully will prevent people from being disappointed and harrassed by smelly bums during their lunch break. Fuck this place, they cater to hobos and serve over cooked rat meat.
