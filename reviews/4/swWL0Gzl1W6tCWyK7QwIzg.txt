This is a nice little joint that fills in the gap that Southside desperately needed...non garbage Mexican food.

It's quite tasty, sometimes a little pricey, but generally it's worth your time. I've been here more than a few times at this point and I'd gladly go back. The lunch special is very economical.

I worry that their menu may need a tiny bit of trimming down, but perhaps I'm wrong. I just wish they gave out free salsa still :(

The dude behind the register has always been quite friendly as well.

GL dudes!
