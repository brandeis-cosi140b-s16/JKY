Service and Food were very good.  We had Pork Carnitas and Three Amigos platter (chicken, shrimp, beef) for dinner along with small size guacamole appetizer.  We were seated immediately, attentive service by waiter and another person, saw all servers doing their jobs (meaning no one was on their phones texting, etc.), food arrived in timely fashion.  Quacamole was AWESOME.  Chips were warm and fresh and so good.  Would be nice to have the option of mild or hot salsa--mild was served with the chips.  It was good, but we do like our salsa a little hot.  We will definitely go back.  The  choices on the menu are a little more creative than other Mexican restaurants.
