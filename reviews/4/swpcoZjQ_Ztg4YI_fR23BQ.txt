If you want a family night out to Mexican food...this is the place!

Pros: Not too pricey, great amount food for the price, great drink specials (21+), outside quick to-go order window.

Cons: Be prepared for long wait times Thursday-Saturday, small waiting area, no parking, small water cups (you have to keep waiving a waiter down to get a refill) 

Overall great spot to take the kids and family
