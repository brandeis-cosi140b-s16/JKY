This place is one of if not the best in las vegas . Even though ive only tried their carne asada burrito . It lays over a bed of  carmelized onions mushrooms n bacon it is so bomb only down side is maybe more steak or slice it thinner . But overall this is 1 of my go to places n lv for quality mexican
