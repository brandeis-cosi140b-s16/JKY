I love this place.  Whenever I'm loafing around and realize I forgot to plan for dinner, this is my go-to place.

The veggie burrito is awesome, and they really load it up.  Anything with the habanero salsa is a hit for me, too.  It's fantastic.

I really like sitting on the outside patio and watching the foot traffic go by on Scottsdale.  Surprisingly good music, to my taste, too.
