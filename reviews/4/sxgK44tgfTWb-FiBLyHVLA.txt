I was waiting for the opening of this place! This is their second location and I am happy it is so close to home. This is the first time I've tried Tortilla Fish and now I am hooked  
Our order included battered fish tacos, a Barbacoa beef taco, shrimp quesadilla, steak quesadilla, rice and beans. Everything comes undressed so you can wild out at the salsa bar. Everything you could ever want on your taco or quesadilla! The fish by itself is melt in your mouth. The shrimp tastes fresh and not like salad shrimps. The Barbacoa is tender and juicy like a pot roast. 
Only thing is the tables are tight if the place is busy which it was and I assume it will always be. They do have patio seating so that's a plus!!
