this is a decent little Mexican joint with a dash of American. Good burritos, chicken and fajitas. The free chip and salsa bar is nice and they have plenty of booze to choose from. 
I enjoy coming here on the weekends for breakfast as there is hardly anyone there and you can get a nice, filling burrito.
This location inparticular has it's regulars and the people that work here are always friendly and accomodating. 
I always feel comfortable eating here.
