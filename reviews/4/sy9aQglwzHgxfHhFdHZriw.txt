Anyone who has grown up in North Central Phoenix in the past thirty years knows about Jordan's. Of that group, I would say around 25% take it a step further: they worship this place. 

I'm part of the 25%. I have memories of eating at Jordan's and ordering cheese crisps off of the Kids' Menu, and then promptly engaging in bitter fights with my sister about who got more pieces, invariably ending in one of us throwing ice cubes and/or utensils at the other. Good times. 

However, it isn't a place I take out-of-towners all that often because, frankly, it isn't the best Mexican food around. Or the most authentic, for that matter. (No offense to Jordan's, PHX has some ridiculously tasty comida mexicana.) 

My favorite way to describe why I still go here is the salsa. I remember trying it as a kid thinking it was the spiciest salsa known in western civilization and I was among only a handful of reckless Arizonans that even had the chance or the guts to taste it (I had never had salsa before and, well, those are the sorts of things I thought about when I was four). Needless to say, it's not spicy at all, but going back I feel like an official badass grown-up now that I can heap it on my chips without flinching. 

Entering the dark restaurant's seating area stirs up stories and memories and smells from my early childhood. And it isn't uncommon to run into someone I went to grammar school with, who is undoubtedly there for the same reasons that I am. 

I rounded it to 4/5 stars but my more specific rating must be broken up by demographic: For Phoenix Natives: 5 stars. For Visitors and Snow Birds: 3 Stars.
