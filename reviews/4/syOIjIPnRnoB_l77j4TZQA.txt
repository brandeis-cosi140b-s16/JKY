If you are looking for great tacos de pastor (comparable to what you can find in Mexico border cities), then look no further.  They are muy, pero muy DELICIOSOS!  The menudo offered on the weekends is great as well (perfect hangover or cold remedy)!  This is one of the best grab & go spots in town or you could eat inside if you are not planning on staying very long as it is small and sometimes tends to get very crowded.  

Warning to those who are scared of sketchy neighborhoods.  You will probably be asked for change in the parking lot and you might run into a gangster or two.  :)  Just beware, the tacos are soo worth it!  

If you want a great burrito, a simple bean, cheese and carne asada will satisfy your craving.  

Would have given the place 5 stars but there is no inside bathroom and their horchata is not ALWAYS up to par (try the Jamaica drink, though).  Also, bring cash - there is a fee for paying with debit/credit card.
