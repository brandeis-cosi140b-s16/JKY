Ok I do admit they are not traditional Mexican food.  That being said they are a very good fast food place.  I have eaten here numerous times and I have never been disappointed.  They use fresh ingredients which is evident in the tastes of their food.  
   I have had their salad, burritos, quesadilla, tortilla soup and enchiladas.  They are all very good and their cost is quite reasonable.    Their competition would be Chipotle and Moe's.  I have been to all 3 and Cafe Rio is much better due to better ingredients and freshly made tortillas.  
   It doesn't matter the time of day there is always a line but it moves fast.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  Great for lunch and dinner.
