So I bet your thinking "What is different about Pink Taco from all of the other great Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas you have to choose from"? EVERYTHING! The margaritas, ceviche, nachos, dessert and the amazing service all play a role in what sets it apart from everyone else! 

Located inside The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Pink Taco offers some of the best margaritas! My favorite is called the Kinky Bitch Margarita. It's Patron Silver, Kinky Liqueur, with hints of lime juice and sweet and sour. The first sip I took I thought to myself "Pitcher Please"! 

Make sure to start with an appetizer called the Ceviche Duo. You get two different types of ceviche: One with shrimp and one with fresh red snapper. I liked the red snapper ceviche a little more than the shrimp ceviche because it was different and had a little bit of a different taste than the shrimp. Both were delicious and you got big portions of each. 

For dinner I mean you really can't go wrong with their Steak Nachos! They I include chipotle queso, frijoles roasted peppers, and are topped with a cilantro & avocado cr√©ma! Hello party on your mouth! Super tasty and you get enough to feed any army! 

Not if but WHEN you order dessert (because who really questions if they should get dessert or not) you have to order the Molcajete (Mega Sampler). It's made of warm molten chocolate cake with fried ice cream, chocolate or caramel filled churros, sopapillas honey and ancho raspberry sauces. You got the best of all dessert worlds rolled into one dish! And again they were more than generous with their dessert portion as well! 

One thing I can't forget to mention is the quality of  service! Our drinks were never empty and the food was delivered quick! If you get a chance to visit the bar make sure to ask for my favorite bartender Jessica! She will take good care of you! She makes the best Margarita's in town!
