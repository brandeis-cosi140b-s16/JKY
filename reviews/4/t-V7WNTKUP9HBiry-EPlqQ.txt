If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular. It was 4 p.m. and we hadn't had lunch after a day at IKEA - and we all know how IKEA wipes you out! So, we needed to find something asap that accommodated four different tastes - this fit the bill. 

I ordered the  asada, pollo, and pastor street tacos. The asada was my favorite. The beans and rice were tasty too. 

The food was flavorful and affordable and the wall art was great; the floor could have been a bit cleaner, but overall, a great find!
