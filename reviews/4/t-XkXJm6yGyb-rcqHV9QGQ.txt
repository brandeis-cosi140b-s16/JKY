I've eaten here a handful of times and the food has been tasty and authentic each time. But it never fails to irritate my acid reflux (which is a rare thing for me, especially with Mexican food) so be prepared and take your meds! The place is clean, well decorated and has a good selection. If you are in this part of town looking for Mexican this is a pretty safe bet. It is not the closest place to my work, but I'm willing to make the drive because the places closer do not compare! Plus, they've got a decent lunch menu with some meals under $10 including a drink.
