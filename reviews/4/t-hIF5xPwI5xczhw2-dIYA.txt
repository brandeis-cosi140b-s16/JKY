This was one of the very first places that I was introduced to upon moving to Charlotte, and it quickly became a staple in my life. There are so many great memories tied to this place and gotta love mariachi night! Yeah, the parking lot stinks, but why does it matter where you park once you get inside and get filled with delicious chips, salsa, queso, and, my personal favorite, pollo fundido. So much food for your money, and great, personable service too.
