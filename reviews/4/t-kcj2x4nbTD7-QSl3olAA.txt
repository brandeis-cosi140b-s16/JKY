Great location for comfort food for wearied folks from the hospital. Cheese crisp was incredible and beans were also quite good.  Grill chef provided chopped fresh jalape√±o upon request.

There are a few tweaks that would make this a regular stop for me: fix ice machine for soda fountain and liven up salsa bar.

Restaurant and restrooms were very clean.
