This is a pretty good Qdoba location. I'm not the biggest fan of Qdoba, but the service is really friendly and the restaurant is very clean. 

When deciding on my order they offered samples of any of the ingredients. It's a great way to get a little taste before committing to anything.

Food was solid and all their produce was fresh, which is key for a salad bowl on the go.
