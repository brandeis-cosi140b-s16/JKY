This is one of our favorite Mexican spots which is pretty consistent. Their chips are hot and salsa is pretty good,  I really like the fact that the queso ( white cheese dip) comes in a bowl size fit for sharing. For ex, Cabo's comes in an ittybitty  small as a finger bowl. It  is $5, plus it too runny for me. Anyway, Azteca's servers have always been attentive and quick for our needs. The food is reasonably priced and portions are nice.  He loves the chicken and shrimp fajitas and I really like the Pollo Poblano. Here, it is just right &  not too sweet like some other spots.
