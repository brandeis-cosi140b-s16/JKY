I need to update this review based on some changes La Paz has recently made to their recipes and their service (my highest weighted criteria).  

Our recent waiter, Ryan, was great and on top of everything. So that alone really improved my thoughts of this place.  They also updated drink recipes (some margaritas) to make them more delicious, and also food recipes (the jalapeno coleslaw was incredible!).

This place is more of a restaurant/bar that has a Mexican theme, rather than a Mexican restaurant.  The drinks and appetizers are great and there are plenty of TVs in the bar area to watch games.
