Delta Bravo 1: Remember that woman Leslie (not real name)? The one who was having an affair.

Delta Bravo 2: Oh yeah, the one married to the cop. Why was she even married to him? 

Delta Bravo 1: I don't know. Everyone knows you never marry a cop. They don't make any money, they're always getting shot at and they're never home.

That's just part of the enlightening conversation I overheard from a table of 3 DoucheBags at Blanco Taco & Tequila in the Sky Harbor airport. Other than that, this place was solid for airport fare.

I ordered the Machaca and egg breakfast burrito. Tender short rib, scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and Mexican cheese served with potatoes. 

It was really good and it came out from the kitchen really fast. Due to the speed, it's obviously all pre-made then thrown together upon order. In an airport, where time can be of the essence this is understandable. 

After a little bit of research, I learned that Blanco Taco and Tequila is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts family. I've become fairly acquainted with these Fox restaurants since moving to Phoenix and I have to say I'm a fan.
