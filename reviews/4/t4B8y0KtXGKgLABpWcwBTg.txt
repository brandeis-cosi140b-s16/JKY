So far, so good. Enjoyed my first and second visits to Se√±or Taco. The staff was friendly. There was a little communication issue during ordering, but that's not a bad thing. It wouldn't be a true Mexican taco shop if there wasn't a little initial confusion.

Service was a bit slow on the first visit, but much faster on the second. The food was great, the salsa bar was solid and there was plenty of seating, indoor and out. There were even some easily accessible electrical outlets on the wall left over from a previous tenant. My only true objection was the late afternoon sun that blinds west facing diners.

I noted another reviewer complained about the cost. Didn't seem that unreasonable to me. In fact, use of the $5 specials and Tuesday deals could make it downright cheap.

There are plenty of traditional style taco shops in other parts of the Valley. But not here. A nice addition to the neighborhood.
