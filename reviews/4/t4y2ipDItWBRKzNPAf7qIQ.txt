This review is for one of the friendliest bartenders, Guillermo (aka Diego).  He was very informative and welcoming. I dined alone at the bar waiting for my bf to finish up work and Guillermo was so helpful and kind.  He was accommodating of all my dietary food restrictions.  Thanks again, Guillermo.  Great job!
