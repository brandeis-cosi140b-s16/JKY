Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!

This is my "go-to" place for those rough Saturday or Sunday brunches.  You know what I mean.

SuperMex is a reliable standard of good food quality.  If you're hunting for really authentic wonderful Mexican cuisine, this might not be the spot, but for a great guacamole and Mexican pizza, they always deliver.  And several other menu items are just good 'ol SW Mexican dishes.

Great lunch specials too.  Can eat well for $7.

Thanks SuperMex for all the times you've saved my weekend!
