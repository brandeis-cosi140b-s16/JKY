I was visiting the area over the weekend and was looking for my favorite hot wings.  Luckily Chevy's is owned by the same company that owns Acapulco's and El Torito Restaurants which are my favorite in California.  

This place was just as great!  The hot wngs were delish...the margaritas were also.  They have happy hour from 2p-8p 7 days a week!  I went on Saturday afternoon for lunch and went back for dinner...awesome!
