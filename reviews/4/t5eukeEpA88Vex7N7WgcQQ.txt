Due diligence pays off as a continued exploration of the menu uncovers many flavors indigenous to Central Mexico that we typically don't encounter here. Most items won't have the heavy cheeses and sauces that cover up inferior dishes from other spots.  The more I eat here the more I miss the time I spent in Queretero, Mexico.
