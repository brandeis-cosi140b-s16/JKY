How can you go wrong?  Its a Robertos, inside a gas station.....first I ordered my delicious breakfast burrito with bacon and extra cheese... and then I go and get my favorite beverage - Gatorade G2....     Perfect combination.      The breakfast burrito was as expected... Tasty for the midnight craving that it was and always at the right price.... definitely had to get on my bike the next day to work that one off !!
