We were here around 8 on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of seating. The service was a little slow, but the food was totally bomb. The chips were delicious and the salsa was flavorful bur not crazy spicy. I had the vegetarian #3 and had to take my burrito home. So. Much. Food. If we ever find ourselves hungry and in the area, we'll stop again.
