I have only been here once;  it was the friday after thanksgiving at like 3pm.  It was really dead, but I did notice some good happy hour prices!  

I really enjoyed the atmosphere;  they have music playing that just leaves you happy.  

There are some other reviews on bad service... but the my server was way on top of things!  It was really dead inside, so maybe that had something to do with it.  

I ordered a cheese crisp with guac for an app, and the mini meal (i forget the name of it).  The crisp was good.  I loved the meal though!  You get 2 mini tacos, tamales, flautas, chimichangas, and tastadas.  I loved the variety and you got a little of everything (which i love).   The food itself was really good and fresh!  

I got a margarita and it was a bit stiff, and delicious.  :)  

I would definitely come back here again if I am in the area.  I would like to try some of the other food and see if it is just as good as the mini's.   The only complaint i have (for my one time), is that it is a tad pricey for what you get.  I guess that's what you get for having a restaurant in Scottsdale.
