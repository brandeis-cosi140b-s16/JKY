My husband surprised my today by stopping in, I was a little reluctant, not having been here before and it looked like so many fast food taco stands in town, (my only experience was not so pleasant).  

The place was bright and sunny, packed, very clean and there was a busy buz in the air.  He ordered, and I found a table, as they were going fast.  He brought our food back to our table on a tray, there were taco's, a couple of sopes and some french fries.  

The tacos were carne asada and we got the adobada sopes.  They were freshly made, and spicy, good flavors, I love the fresh cilantro.  Now for the fries, it was smothered the carne asada and some creamy avocado sauce, onions, and cheese.  It was a good quick and fresh snack, very clean and I would go back to this place for sure.
