I used to live very close to Padres and try to get back their whenever I am in the neighborhood. 

Probably the best $5 margarita in town. There, I said it, let it be known.

Good happy hour spot with a different take on your classic mexican dishes. The staff are all young, helpful and energetic. There is a bartender there known as "super-bartender", he is the one encouraging patrons to take shots. Which never makes for a bad time.

They have a salmon enchilada dish that is lights out. I am usually there for happy hour but the rest of the entree menu looks and sounds very good.
