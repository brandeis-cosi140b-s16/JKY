This is not so much about the food as it is about the accommodations we received. Our 15 year old son has sensory issues & the restaurant was too loud to eat dinner there. There were no tables available outside. The manager asked about our situation & when my husband explained, he was able to offer us a private room to eat our dinner. My son was happy, so we were happy. When my mother-in-law asked him what he liked about Pittsburgh, he said "The Mexican restaurant!"
