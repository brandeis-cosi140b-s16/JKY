After a long day of work, the Burrito Fairies had come to me and sprinkled their magic dust on my nose.  I needed a burrito.  

My usual burrito place is Burrachos in Sun Prairie, but that was a 30 minute drive.  Where could I hook up a burrito in the vicinity of my place of employment?  Pancheros.

I had never been to a Pancheros, but I'm going back.  They make the tortilla fresh--point to them.  The fillings weren't quite as voluminous as Burrachos, but they take this magic spatula and mix the ingredients together so you get a burrito the way it was intended:  A bite of everything in every bite.  

I got home that night and I told my wife, "You know...I just ate a burrito like an hour ago, but if there was a Pancheros in Sun Prairie, I'd go get another one."  

And I would have. I'm definitely going back as soon as I can.  Perhaps today for lunch.
