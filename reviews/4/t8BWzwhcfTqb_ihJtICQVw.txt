I only come to this place when I'm on my diet. I do sometimes wonder what that huge burrito tastes like but then think of the crazy amounts of calories. For me, when I'm on my special diet...it's a treat to go out and not have to cook. I get the salad...it's simple. Lettuce, chicken, pico (a little more please!) and that's all. Kinda silly to pay $6 for it but Its nice to not have to worry about cooking. The meal comes out to 260 calories. Can't beat that! :)
