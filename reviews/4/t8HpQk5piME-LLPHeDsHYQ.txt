Ordered the Carne Asada Burrito this past Friday evening. It was divine!! Especially liked the fact they didn't skimp on the protein. Way to go! 

I did utilize their drive-thru services and so I can't comment on the inside d√©cor, etc.

Neighborhood, however, is less than desirable being located on VanBuren. VanBuren Street in the Valley of the Sun does pride itself w/being the "pay for play" street. ;)

This is yet another dangerous temptation I face on my route home now. *sigh*. Can't wait to try another menu item! :)
