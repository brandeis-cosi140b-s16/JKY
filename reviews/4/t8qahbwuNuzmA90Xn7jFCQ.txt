Yum yum yum, I love pupusas!

I came here with my mom and sister. We all ordered pupusas revueltas (cheese,beans,pork) and I also got a side of plantains, beans, and cream. They gave us a bowl of curtido (cabbage slaw w/ chiles and vinegar) and a bottle of tomato salsa to share. The pupusas came out very nice and hot. They were so hot that I had to wait a few minutes to dig in (that's how you know they're fresh). I always tend to drown my pupusas in the tomato salsa because it's soo good, but I noticed that no one else really does that. The waitress kept on checking on us to make sure we were always well stocked. We ended up getting 2 bowls of the curtido because we were all eating big forkfuls of it (so fresh and tasty). I actually got 3 pupusas which was two too many. They're very filling, so I suggest you just get one or two, especially if you're going to get beans or whatever else on the side. The fried plantains were just how my parents make them at home. Perfectly cooked, soft, not overly sweet, and delicious with the cream and beans. 

Pros:
*Very fresh pupusas
*Yummy curtido and tomato salsa
*Fast, friendly service
*Large menu (they also have tacos, burritos, burgers, fries, etc)
*Authentic food
*Cheap prices (we spent less than $25 for 3 people)

Cons:
*The location is kind of in the middle of nowhere, but that makes this more of a "locals" joint, which is a good thing!

Tips
*Don't order revueltas if you're not big on cheese. I gave my boyfriend one and he said it was too cheesy. Stick to just pork or beans
*Try the fried plantains with the cream and beans!
*Ask the waitress for more time to look at the menu. She tends to come by kind of fast and you want to make sure you go through the whole menu before ordering.
