We don't find ourselves in the likes of Central Phoenix very often, so when we ended up in the area around dinner time, the obvious question was where we should eat that we've been thinking about trying.  Mejico was fresh on the brain after a recent recommendation so off we went!  

Outside is unassuming, with a small (kinda awkward) parking lot and great view of a pawn shop.  Inside looks like another world.. it's classy, subtly Mexican-inspired and intimate.  We were greeted with a friendly welcome and asked to seat ourselves wherever we were comfortable.  Unfortunately, we had just missed happy hour (ends at 6!) which was a bummer, because there look like there are good deals then.  The dinner menu is a little pricier than I'm used to for Mexican food, but it was also high quality.

The chips and salsa for the table were surprisingly good.  After reading that Jennifer O found the salsa too mild, I took a big bite.  Well people, it is not mild.  I may be a spice-wimp, but it had some kick.  Smaller bites from there on out.  The chips were fresh, salty and thicker than usual.  I'm accustomed to complimentary chips and salsa before the entrees, but I'm glad we tried this appetizer anyway.  

A split order of the enchiladas (the server recommended one chicken, one beef, rather than being faced with the decision between the two) sufficed for two people.  The pinto beans were a lot more flavorful than the black, which is another choice offered.  

Service was attentive, and our waiter showed us the happy hour and lunch menus so we could get a feel for them.  The prices were almost half, and some of the menu items looked really good.  I'd love to return for lunch some time, or for happy hour to try one of their house-made (actually made in house, from fresh ingredients each time) margaritas.  Until then!
