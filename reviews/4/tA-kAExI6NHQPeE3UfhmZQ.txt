I found Yolo's to be a relatively decent restaurant offering pretty traditional mexican fare in the middle of a huge casino. The prices are very reasonable for strip food (about $15-$20) a person, and the portion sizes are just the right amount. Top that with chips & salsa as well as hand made (in front of you) guac, fantastic drinks, and snappy service, and you've got the makings of a sleeper.

I found the chips and salsa to be very good for snacking - they offer a very good house made salsa with warm chips that really offer a sweet and salty mix.

We also ordered two blended drinks, of which the name eludes me because we were faded as hell - but one tasted like starburst, and the other tasted like a lighter less sweet pina colada (which is damn good).

Ordered the chicken nachos, which I found to be a little weird because the chips were soggy, not crispy (which probably meant microwave cheese melting action as opposed to tossing it in a oven). The chicken was shredded and plentiful, and the cheese covered the spice covered chips very well. I only wish we had some extra sour cream, some house salsa, guac, and some sweet chilis.

Everything else on the table looked very good, and everyone left very satisfied and full.
