This is a food stall in the desoto market, so if you are lost trying to find the place, find the desoto market first.

The salmon bento box was well prepared, I really liked the glaze on the salmon, however the term bento box should not apply to a plastic segmented container. I wish the BAO were a bit cheaper as they along with a bento would make for a quality filling meal.
