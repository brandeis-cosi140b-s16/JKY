Taco Bell what??!!! Those two words aren't even in my vocab when it comes to this place!! Great authentic Mexican food at good prices and open 24hrs!! Love the rolled tacos and the California Burrito is too good for words!! Tamales are the best you can get if you can't wait til your best friends Latin feast at their house during Christmas:-)
