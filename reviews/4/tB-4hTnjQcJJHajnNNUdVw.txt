Love this place!   

I'm always tempted by the weekly special burger.  Sometimes they are so tempting I have to order two burgers:  one special and the brûlée burger.

Try to French toast fries, too.   They are just as tasty as you would imagine them to be.  

My husband tried the tacos are they were pretty good too - but only go that route if you really aren't feeling a burger.   

Only complaint is that it sometimes feels dirty inside.   Not really in health hazard way, but more in a "please clean your table tops after messy guests don't bother to clean after themselves" kind of way.   I don't like having to throw away other patrons' trash.
