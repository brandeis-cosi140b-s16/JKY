Come eat some "muy bueno" food. The chips are tasty. We had fish tacos and a shrimp cocktail it was good. I'm mexican and I put the seal of approval on it. Also enjoy a refreshing Mexican bottle of Coca- Cola to wash down the grub. Not a fancy spot more like a nice hole in the wall spot. So don't rate on looks please just taste. Adi√≥s.
