I am fan because this was the first real feel Mexican joint I have found here in town that had a wide menu and deli that I felt like I could trust.  Great menu options, had my pozole when I wanted it (which is a plus)  the wife had tripa tacos (fried tripe) that was very good.  there is plenty of dining space and a real Mexico fell to the place.  As I understand it they have been in town for many, many years.  

While we did not see it, it appears that they offer items cooked al carbon in their parking lot on busier days.  

We will be back.
