When I think of authentic mariscos (mexican seafood), I think about this place. Its not fancy, but its definitely the place to go for ceviche, whole fried fish, shrimp cocktails, 7 mares, and shrimp prepared about a dozen different ways, as well as margaritas & micheladas.  I took my parents here while they were in town & they wanted to come back the very next evening.
