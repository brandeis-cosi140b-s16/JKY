To start, our service was phenomenal. We are from out of town and he took us through the whole menu, gave recommendations on what to do around town, and always had our drinks filled. 
The enchilada was very good with shredded chicken and Christmas style sauces. The Spanish rice was decent, not terrible. The smashed pinto beans however were insanely good. 
I did not like the seasoning on the chips and didn't like that you only got one refill on chips even though we had 7 people in our party. Also didn't like that the salsa wasn't refillable at all-cost per bowl after the initial serving.
