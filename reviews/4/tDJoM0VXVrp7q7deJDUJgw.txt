How can you beat $2 sangria?  And it's good too!  I like the chicken or shredded beef tacos although the beef is a little greasy.  The table-side guacamole is overkill at $10 but great for a group to share.

The chips are made in house and always warm when they hit the table.  I've never had any problems with customer service but I have to admit I usually wait a month or two before trying a brand new place to give them time to work out the kinks.

But the real winner is the ambience.  The interior is comfortably between swanky and casual.  Family and first dates alike can enjoy great times.
