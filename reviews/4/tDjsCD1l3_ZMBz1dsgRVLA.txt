Despite being located in a busy area, this location never gets too packed. I like that they're 24 hrs so I can stop by any time I'm hungry. I usually just get their crunchy tacos, chicken soft tacos, or burritos because everything else is kind of mehh, especially breakfast! Their breakfast is no bueno. Their food is already dirt cheap, but come on Tuesday nights for crunchy taco night or Thursday nights for chicken soft taco night for a real steal.
