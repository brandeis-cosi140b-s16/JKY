Barbacoa. Amazing Pork Barbacoa.

The Good: The salads turn into giant glorious burritos. Everything is made in front of you so you can adjust what and how much of it is put into your food. Tortillas made right in front of your face. Every 10th meal free! Free Food for kids. The Tomatillo ranch is exquisite! The first time my brain ever said "Google this shit and see if we can make it home.". So yes, it's good for it's "just above fast food" demographic. 

Caveat: I don't know what anything else tastes like because I keep just ordering the Barbacoa Salad with extra Barbacoa. I have no plans to change my order. If you had said salad you wouldn't either.

The bad: This one is stingy with the meat compared to the one on eastern. Also the whole restaurant doesn't need to know I want extra meat. Whoever thought it was a good idea to yell these things is a moron.
