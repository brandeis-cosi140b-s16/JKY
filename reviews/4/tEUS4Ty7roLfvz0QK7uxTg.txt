I was in the mood for Mexican last night, but was not interested Taco Bell, and my local Filibertos has not been up to par with how good their food usually is, so I decided to finally try Los Favs. First impression was that the resturaunt was extremely clean and inviting, and the staff at the counter was very friendly and offered suggestions on what I might like. I ended up getting the rolled chicken tacos and a bean and cheese burrito. The rolled tacos, topped with guacamole and cheese, was good, but the chicken was a bit too dry for my taste and the tortilla were fried a bit too much and while good, was kinda hard to bite through. The beans and rice that came with it were excellent, and the bean and cheese burrito was huge and filled with warm and melted cheese. What I was most impressed with, was that nothing was greasy. Will definitely come back and try more items off their menu!
