One of my favorite Mexican food places here in Gilbert. I was introduced to this place a few years back after they had reopened by a close friend of mine, and I've been coming here ever since! There staff isn't always on point but for the decently priced menu items and the monthly coupons they actually send out, it's a great place to eat. I love there bean dip and salsa they give you and their chips are delicious as well! One thing I always get here is their seafood burrito,  oh my it's delicious! I highly recommend it, and if you don't finish it, it's tasty the next day too! If you haven't tried this place and want to,  check out the monthly coupon book that gets sent out in the Gilbert area!
