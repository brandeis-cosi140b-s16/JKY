Better then you might think.

I really enjoy Tortas Paquime and have dined at both locations. Tortas Paquin is clean, busy and has great food. The entr√©e's at Torta Paquime are reasonably priced, made fresh to order, and absolutely delicious. 

The carnitas  and ribeye tacos are some of the best I've had anywhere and the tortas are not only delicious but very large as well. So be prepared to go hungry and have leftovers. Make sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions, jalapenos and carrots (they're free).  

You never walk away from Tortas Paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth.

Great service and excellent food, if your in the area you should stop by, you will not be disappointed.
