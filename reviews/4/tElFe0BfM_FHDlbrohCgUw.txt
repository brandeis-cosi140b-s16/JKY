This place is legit. Chorizo tacos were spicy and perfect. Even the rice was amazing. 

I will definitely come back. Next time I'll be hungrier as only having 2 tacos simply did not allow me to eat as much as I would have liked. 

They take credit cards but we tipped in cash. 

Like others have said, I wish I would have found this sooner, even though from outside it doesn't seem like it's for real. It is REAL.
