Really enjoyed this place. We were staying at Tuscany, and decided to try this place out. They give you chips, salsa, and bean dip. Refills will cost you a buck. Wife and I shared a two items combination dinner. Comes with rice and beans. I had a chicken burrito, very good. Comes wet with red sauce. Wife had the beef taco, looked like she enjoyed it. The beans are very good, great taste. Overall we had a great time, service was awesome and very courteous. This place is a must visit.
