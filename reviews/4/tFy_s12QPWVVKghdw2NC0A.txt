Came in on a Friday night to go to the Baby Doll Lounge in Eli's Roth's Goretorium. Since this place was literally across from the entrance,  Came here for a quick bite.

One of the cheapest and nicest places to get some quick grub that wont bog u down. Pretty good menu, prices are pretty inexpensive (for the strip) and the quality of the food was pretty good. Decent selection of beers and  probably one of the cheapest Grain Alcohol-slushie prices on the strip. I didn't try any of them because grain alcohol gives me a headache. 

Anyway, I ordered two Carne' Asada tacos from the menu, go to choose my beans, good choices of meat and vegetables, and all my toppings. The Place reminded me of Chipotle's. I also took note of a few impersonator's that came in to eat while I was there-Jack Sparrow and One of the two Bumblebee's on the strip-further confirming that this was probably a good price point place to eat. 

Sat a table facing the walkway so I could people watch, and enjoyed two good sized soft-tacos for about $5! Beware, the spicy red & green sauces were a little hotter and spicier than I expected.  A great place to eat because I don't believe there was any food served in the Baby Doll Lounge I was going back to in a few minutes.

Hope this helps!

Cheers!
