Party of Five please...two kids and three hungry adults.  The salsa was good and fresh. The chips had just the right amount of saltiness. The cheese dip my friend ordered was a large bowl of blah.  We ate it, but it didn't even begin to wake-up these taste buds.  I had the pork burrito. It was tender, tasty and flavorful.  The best part of the experience was asking for a spicy jalape√±o margarita and they made a delightful concoction that became the featured drink of the day "the firecracker". 

All in all, a nice experience.  The place is designed and decorated nicely with large garage doors letting in Fresh air but no bugs because of the screens.  We did comment on the dance/techno music blaring at Noon that didn't seem to fit the lunch holiday family crowd.
