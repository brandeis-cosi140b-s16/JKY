What a great place to enjoy some upscale Mexican food on the patio!  We stopped in when my mother-in-law was in town and arrived right when it opened to be seated immediately on the patio.  The place is really cute, the service was good and the food was fantastic.  I highly recommend the enchiladas - you won't be disappointed.
