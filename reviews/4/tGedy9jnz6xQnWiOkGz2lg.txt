My kids and I eat here all the time the food is great the drinks are tasty. Usually our service is good.
Tonight we had the worst server Gladys. I don't know if she was new or just doesn't know the menu. She brought my daughter the wrong sauce then tried to lie that is was the correct one. We have been dinning there for 3years always order the same thing I guess it changed over night. I guess over night drinks are no longer included in the kids meal. Normally a kids cup of fideo is .50 but today Gladys charged us $3. She forgot to even order my other daughters food.  Initially took 10minutes just to acknowledge we where even sitting there. I know helping a mom with three kids is every servers worst nightmare, but my kids go there often and are well behaved. I hope our next visit will be with a better server.
