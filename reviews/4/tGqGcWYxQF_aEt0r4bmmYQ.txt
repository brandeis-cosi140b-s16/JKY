This place is right next to the Platinum Hotel...which is non-gaming and non-smoking...the only downside to this restaurant is that it is in the heart of the casino...read: you'll come out stinking like smoke AND Mexican fod. 

The chips were okay, the bean dip was great and the salsa was just alright. We also ordered the table-side guacamole...not sure why they do it table-side...the guy who made it didn't even converse with us or show us what he was doing or even ask how spicy we wanted it, etc. The guac was mediocre. 

Service was fast and friendly. 

You could see the people cooking in the kitchen.

Our kids had a meltdown and waitstaff worked quickly to get us out of there (thanks!). 

Moving on...I had the flaming combo fajitas and they were so tasty. I often stray away from steak fajitas because I get the really gristly pieces every.single.time...but not this time. The beef, chicken and large prawns were perfect. The only thing that could have made the fajitas better would have been homemade corn tortillas. My order came with yummy rice and refried beans and large dollops of sour cream, guacamole and salsa. 

With the meltdown, we decided to get dessert to go. I love flan and their flan would have been SO good if it didn't come out overcooked. There was a thick layer on the top (or the bottom once it has been removed from its mold) and the bottom (now the top) was overcooked, black and burnt tasting. Don't get me wrong, I love a little burnt caramel flavor...but this was a bit overwhelming.

I would definitely go back...It was really good!
