Experience:  Went with friends about 1:00 on a Thursday. I had never been here and the name alone intrigues me. 

Facility: It is a very small place located in a strip mall. There are tables and chairs for about 20 folks. I was pretty impressed with the fork, spoon, and knife dispensers. Such a sanitary way to get your plastic ware!  It's a fast food type feel, but they bring the food to your table. 

Service:  I went to the counter and a very personable, nice guy greeted me. Even though there was a few people behind me, he took the time to talk to me. At the end of my order, he asked my name, and introduced himself...turns out it was Frank, the owner. What a nice guy!!!!!  The rest of the staff were friendly and attentive too. Although you order at the counter, they bring the food to you, and even bring your drink out first. Also, they will refill your drink too. I just realized I didn't leave a tip on the table!!!  Man!  Well, I did drop some in the tip bucket up front when I ordered, so I hope they all share that. Sorry guys, next time I will tip for the great table service too!!!!

Food:  I ordered the Carnitas plate with a side of hot sauce and fried jalape単os. The Carnitas (3.5/5) were good. I liked the beans and rice with a touch of salad on my plate too. The homemade flour tortillas (5/5) were so good! The fried jalape単os (2.5/5) were actually grilled (or fried) and marinated. It's not that I didn't like them, but I just prefer the natural flavor of either a fresh or plain grilled jalape単o. Frank came by and I mentioned my preference, and he immediately exchanged them for fresh jalape単os. Yum! This topped my meal off perfectly. 

Overall:  I'm a fan. I like the food, I liked the service, and Frank was a real gem. Too bad it's not close to my house, but I will be back.
