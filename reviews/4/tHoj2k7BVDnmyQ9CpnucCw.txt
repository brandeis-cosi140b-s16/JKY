The staff are friendly, the food is great, the atmosphere is pleasant, and the outdoor seating area is perfect for a cool evening. There's not much else to say - one knows what a Chipotle is, what it should offer, and how it holds up to those standards. Every time I've been here, the food and staff has been consistent. Probably not the healthiest food in the world, but I'll let that one slide for now!
