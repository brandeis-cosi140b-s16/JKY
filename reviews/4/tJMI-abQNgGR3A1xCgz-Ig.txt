Finally...a real Mexican restaurant in Madison. Order ahead and take out. This is as authentic as it gets in Madison. The key......no yellow cheddar cheese. A good friend from Mexico taught me they only use white cheese in Mexico....The menu is varied with items I've never heard of before. Definitely worth a try!
