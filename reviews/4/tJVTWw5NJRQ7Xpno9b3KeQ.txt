My boyfriend and I stopped by for an earlier dinner tonight.  We are big fans of Bombay Spice.  Conveniently located within walking distance from our home at Shea/Tatum.

We heard about Bombay Spice changing to a Mexican Cafe BECAUSE the local market was not supporting the Indian concept.  From what I understand from Randy, manager they have been receiving great feedback of the concept and the food.  so lighten up william.

We have eaten at Los Sombreos and Frank and Lupes and we are quite happy that this is a closer journey for us.

We enjoyed a couple rounds of very tasty margaritas.  Made from fresh squeezed lime juice.  I am the "Princess and the Pea" when it comes to margarita mix and I thought they were delicious.  We each ordered tortilla soup.  Ben added the chicken.  Very flavorful and I especially enjoyed the dried chilies added as a garnish.  We also ordered the Customized Guacamole.  You recieve a little check list for all the ingredients you have to choose from.  We opted for the onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lime and pomegrante seeds.  Fresh, tasty, delicious! 

For our entree we ordered the Chile Relleno with Chorizo.  I inquired about an a la carte Enchilada with Chicken because I was curious to taste their Mole Sauce.  We were pleasantly surprised when it came to the table with the relleno. Some places are not really keen on guests ordering a la carte.  But we were happily served.  Also, we added the Salsa Entree that came along with 3 different sauces.  The Habanero sauce was quite intimidating.  Randy warned us that "it will rip your face off". But I was up for the challenge.  I tasted little bits like I thought I was eating caviar.  Better safe than sorry.  

Overall, we had a great dining experience and it is now added to our favorite places to go for Mexican food!  Thank you Randy and Seth for a great time.

I am going to plan a UYE to come back to San Gabriel.  Stay tuned!
