One thing that is very difficult to find is a Mexican restaurant that does not cook their beans with lard. La Fonda's beans are veggie which is great because they are delicious. Great customer service, prices are ok and delicious food. I usually get the bean and cheese burrito-fundido style. Now that I'm moving closer to this area I will be eating here much more often!
