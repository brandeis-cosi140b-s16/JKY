As a vegetarian, I'm always on the look out for new delicious options. Also, as a huge fan of Mexican food, I've been dying for a California-style meal that didn't disappoint. 

As a result, El Burro is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh and the epic poems I would write in honor of their rice, bean, and cheese burrito would feature whole stanzas about how delicious their rice is or how the only thing that comes close to comparing is their nachos with soyrizo. It may end with a battle between the nachos and burritos where everyone wins and celebrates with delicious and fresh Mexican food.

Also, El Burro needs to deliver to the East End so I can eat it all of the time and attain my wish of always having easy access to delicious burritos.
