I saw this driving by and being that I'm always on the look out for different food  had to stop in. The waitress brought us two mini tostodas when we were seated at no charge. I don't know if this is standard or they had extras but it was the first time I enjoyed beans on a tostada. They had some green chili's and white cheese, very good. My wife and I split a torta especial. No complaints, my wife loved it and we left full and happy. I would say the sandwich was 4 stars she said 5. The overall feel of this place is similar to Los Reyes in decoration and cleanliness if that helps readers. I have only been here once so far but Tortotota is now on my cheap good Mexican food list.
