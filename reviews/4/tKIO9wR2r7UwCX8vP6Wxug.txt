The restaurant was really quiet when I went in yesterday--I thought it was strange that there wasn't any music playing, but it's not necessary.

The guys working there were attentive and friendly. I loved the menu with pictures on it! I wish all restaurants had those. The food came out VERY quickly. I had cheese enchiladas, refried beans and rice for $6. Not bad at all!

I would kill for some Tex-Mex and will continue hunting for the best Mexican food in this city, but for now, this place is pretty good.
