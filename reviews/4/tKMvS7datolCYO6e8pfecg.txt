I've driven by this place a thousand time. Finally tonight flipped a U-Turn and drove in.  From the rear parking lot I could see stacks of applewood that is used in their cooking. Good sign.  Once inside I sat at the bar and had some really good street tacos.  Hint:  When the Lamb tacos are recommended go with it. I ordered 2 chicken and 1 lamb.  Wished I would have switched that around.  

They have a small but decent selection of craft beers.  The specialty drink menu looks good and I am looking forward to going back. 

I sat at the bar and had excellent sever from Stacy.
