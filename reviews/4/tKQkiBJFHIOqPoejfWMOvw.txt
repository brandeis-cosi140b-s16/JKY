With my deep love of Mexican food, I'm surprised I hadn't made it here yet.  Glad I finally made the trip because it was well worth it!

The menu is huge with lots of your favorites peppered in with some very Americanized accents (burrito's with fries inside, holy American batman!).  I choose the shrimp burrito.  Here's the key to a fantastic shrimp burrito, and it's a simple one.  Don't scrimp on the shrimp!

Good thing they know me (they don't) because it was PACKED with big juicy shrimp!  Not even those puny frozen kind, the real deal!  I was pleasantly surprised and delighted with the shrimp, plus rice, beans and cheese.  Delicious!  

But I must admit the star of the show for me was the guacamole.  Gauc seems like it would be so simple to make yet it's so easy to mess up.  Too mushy, no taste, etc.  This gauc was the real deal!  It was probably the best gauc I've sampled at a Mexi restaurant in the city!  There, I said it!  I'd come here just to sample some chips and gauc if I was craving it (or not craving it and just loving it!).  

I'm also currently in love with the Jarritos Pineapple Mexican soda drink, which they carry.  So I'll be grabbing me a soda and gauc here in the near future, don't you worry!!
