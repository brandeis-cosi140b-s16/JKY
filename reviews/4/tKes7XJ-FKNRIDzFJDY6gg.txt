Margaritas are sweet and potent. The interior has Mexican written all over it. Very authentic. Service was excellent.  The red salsa didn't have any bite but I enjoyed it. It tasted roasted and had a fruity flavor (pineapple or mango, I suppose). The green salsa looked like tomatillo salsa to me. I loved it. Flavorful and hearty, although it was a tad sweeter than I am used to.

My steak fajitas came out on fire - awesome. The meat was flavorful and so tender! I asked for another type of sauce. A mild sauce. So the waiter got me the perfect dark red sauce with just the right kick.  Poured the sauce all over my fajitas and was on my way to grubbin'.

The margaritas were $2.99 - can't beat that.  I had three.  I jogged back to the hotel in case anyone was wondering...sike.
