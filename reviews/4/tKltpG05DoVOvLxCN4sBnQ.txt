99 cent Taco Tuesdays! Yep this is why I come to this place. That and their super nachos should be illegal. I do find that their breakfast burritos are more expensive than other places which is weird because they all taste the same, so why almost a $1+ more? At any rate, Tuesday nights, me and Filberto's usually have a date :)
