First time here. Really liked it. I got the torta ahogada. I think the bread was a little too toasted hard. That's why not five starts. But it was awesome. If you live in Phoenix metro, you've got to try one of these.

My wife had the carne asada tacos. Wow, the meat was so tender, the rice was truly authentic, and the beans had great flavor.

I highly recommend this place.
