This is a good solid addition to the 16th street corridor, though it enjoys a less than fortunate location in the strip mall where the infamously ghetto-fabulous 16th street sports bar used to be. 

it has a fun cheerful atmosphere and the bar is a great place to park, have a few drinks and some food. Their Happy Hour goes 'til 7 which is awesome and you can enjoy $5 beers and $1 off chips and salsa. I started out with chips and guac which did not disappoint-fresh and delicious.

I took the two taco plate which consisted of a short rib taco, and octopus taco and a side of rice and beans. The tacos were flavorful and good sized. The short rib was good but I expected a little more from the octopus taco-perhaps more meat or less marinating and other ingredients because I really couldn't taste it. It was not bad, don't get me wrong but I love octopus and was REALLY looking forward to this and it didn't quite deliver.

Their salsas are great. The chipotle salsa is really good but the kick sneaks up on you. My taste buds were toasty even when I was driving home.This was only my first visit so I'm eager to come back and try more tacos.

They have a small but solid selection of wine, your requisite Corona and Dos Equis and some tasty looking hand-crafted cocktails.The service is friendly and the crowd that was in were all lively and fun. My underwhelming octopus taco not withstanding, I still recommend stopping in and giving them a try.
