Husband and I really enjoy this restaurant.  They recently opened up a new one on Litchfield, but we prefer this one.  I love the hominess of it, and the history of the building, at least it looks that way.

I'm not a big salsa person, but my husband loves it here.  I prefer the guacamole, which is probably the best I've ever had.  I'll be honest, I slather it on everything I can.  I also love their enchiladas, I get the ground beef.  My husband prefers the cheese enchiladas, along with their beans and rice.

We always leave satisfied, and that's saying a lot.  In our history with this restaurant, I've had one imperfect meal.  We went back a few weeks later, and it must've been just one bad night, because it's been wonderful ever since.

The staff has always been friendly, and we love that when we order our ice teas, they bring us a pitcher.  I'm a big fan of that, so I don't keep having to ask for more.

When I moved out here over 8 1/2 years ago, I wasn't too big on Mexican food.  This is one of the first places my husband brought me to, and I've loved it ever since.
