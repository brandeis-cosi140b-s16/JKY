Wow, love the tacos and the homemade beans and the homemade lemonade. I can hear for early lunch for the first time. Very casual/trendy spot in 7 avenue, I loved the way that the lettuce is chopped very fine and the meat very flavorful.  I did not care to much for the red salsa (I think it was a little smokey for my taste) but the beans were fantastic and super creamy (I need to come back for a bean burro).  There is outdoor patio seating and inside seating with a flat screen.  They have happy hour taco specials, very cool place.
