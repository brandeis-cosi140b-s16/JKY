We wanted to eat dinner at a classy Mexican place in Vegas, what can possibly go wrong? Food was great, we both had fajitas and the portion sizes were huge (we couldn't finish even though we did not eat much for lunch) and the complimentary chips were tasty as well (we liked the occasional pink chips ;) ). The restaurant was nicely decorated and we enjoyed our visit.

The food itself was very tasty. Having lived in California for two years I would not call it authentic Mexican but still super tasty American Mexican (still more authentic than Chipotle) ;)

If you can, sit inside (outside seating is just next to the pool and music can get very loud)
