This place is great, the people work hard, its a small operation, but the food is good and the prices are great.  They always seem to be just busy enough for you to wait a little bit which is a very healthy sign.  The Breakfast burritos are packed with eggs, beacon, cheese, and photos.  I also love their beef tacos, cant be beat for the price and taste.
