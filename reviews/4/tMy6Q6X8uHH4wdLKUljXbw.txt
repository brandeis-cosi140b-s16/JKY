Tacos in Chinatown?? No way!!!! Well, may be. I went here with couple of my very good friends and fellow yelpers. The tacos are pretty good and the sauces are also flavorful and spicy. I went for their 6 el pastor tacos, 3 the first time, then 3 more later. The meat was juicy and the toppings on the tacos were fresh. 

The only negative thing I can say is that the parking lot is very odd. People are total a-holes when they park their cars behind yours and leave. It took me 5 minutes to get my little car out. So, just be careful when parking.
