I have eaten here many times, at all past/present locations, and i've always had good experiences.  My family has even chosen this place for special occasions over all the other restaurants in southside (and yes, we've tried 80% of them).

I usually go for the enchiladas verdes, but have tried a good portion of the menu.  and i love the homemade salsas.

I will admit the new location isn't as fun, and the merging with the divebar is a little offputting; however, i believe food quality is the most important part, and in my opinion, it's delicious.  I find it odd that Taco Loco's yelp ratings are so low considering how much i really do enjoy it.
