Nice place. Very new. But it is the only Mexican food near here without having to go all the way to South Blvd. Not officially opened as of 11/29/2012 but serving food. Waiting for his liquor license to come in before he has the grand opening. Had the lunch special of 3 tacos with a side of refried beans. Has many choices of tacos. Ground beef, steak, chicken, marinated shredded chicken and a couple more I can't remember. The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was very good, Very tomatoey, lots of onion and cilantro and just enough heat. Not runny and watery. The tacos were quite good. I had the ground beef with lettuce, tomato and cheese. They were very tasty. They are also offered with cilantro and onion as well. The man running the place served me and was extremely friendly and made sure everything was OK or if I needed anything like more chips or anything else. The best part was my bill was only $6.41 and I wasn't still hungry when I left. I think I'll be going back there again.
