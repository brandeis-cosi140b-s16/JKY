The place inside is spacious, comfortable. Margaritas are good. Chips and salsa when you are in the bar are quite good, the mild salsa is quite hot though...
The food is a little bit bland, i ordered the express burrito... the mexican flavor is a little bit deluded...i could not feel the mexican spices in it. Portions again where acceptable. I definetly will give a second chance
