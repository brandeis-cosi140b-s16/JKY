Mexican street food at its best (makes you wonder why anyone would eat at Taco Bell, Laredo's, or any of those horrid other places where everything is slathered in grease and cheese...)  Just like many good Chinese restaurants are full of Chinese people and has servers that may or may not speak English, this place is the same way (just with Mexicans speaking Spanish).  This place has put me on a mission to try the other "real" Mexican places around town.  As others have noted, couple of oddities:

(1) Get your drink from the cooler on the way back (though one time the waitress told us about a special drink they had that day that was not on the menu-- I forget what it was, but it was good!)
(2) You can (now) pay with credit card at the restaurant (you used to have to go to the front counter) but you can't put a tip on the credit card (so, tips are cash only!)
(3) Last couple of times I was there I'm not even sure they bring you your bill to the table-- so, when you're done, just go up and pay.

One of my kids is a picky eater (to put it kindly) and they have "chicken nuggets" with fries that fits the bill for him (the nuggets were horrendous when I tried one, but my kid likes them, and also likes picking his drink out of the cooler....)  Both kids like the goofy Mexican sitcoms that are often playing (in Spanish) on the TVs.
