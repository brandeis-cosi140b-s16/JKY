What can I say, it's Chipotle.  Fast food, but done really well.  Their burritos are large, and their prices reasonable.  You tell them what you want in it, and they make it right in front of you.  I'm not normally a fast-food fan (in fact, I hate it).  But this is the exception to the rule.

Don't expect authentic Mexican food here.  It's not.  It's Mex-American burritos.  But if you're hungry, want something fast and inexpensive, and can't stand the usual greasy fast-food crap, Chipotle is a good alternative.  For what they are, they are very good.  If you're wondering how they compare to Qdoba, frankly I find them interchangeable.  They both do the same thing, and they both do it well.
