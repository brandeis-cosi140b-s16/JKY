I had always heard that Jordan's is the best Mexican restaurant in town and I can see why people think so.  It's got a lot of tasty dishes on its menu.  My vegetarian dining companion did not find too many options but was able to put together a nice dinner.

Ambiance and location are good.  This restaurant obviously has a lot of happy regulars.

Would I come here again.  Yes!
