I've been wanting to try this place for a few months. Finally made it and glad I did.  Place was somewhat empty then again a little hard to find.  Ordered the Mole Enchiladas which by far the Mole is very authentic and super tasty. A must have if you are a Mole fan which is an acquired taste. Defiantly a must have !!  Order the frijoles charros which needed a little salt to bring out the flavor of all the amazing ingredients.  Very good Minus the missing dash of salt. Easy quick fix !   Order torta de pierna which was a little bit of a let down. The bollilo (bread) was amazing and could have been a better torata but the pierna needs a little more flavor and the sandwich overall was dry.   The mollotes with some fresh salsa amazing!! Have them as part of your meal or always a good appetizer make sure to add the salsa.  They sell Jarritos which always helps wash it all down. Overall this place is a must when on the area especially for the mole enchiladas.
