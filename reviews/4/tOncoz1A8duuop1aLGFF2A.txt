I LOVE LOVE LOVE this shop and have never had anything there that wasn't delicious. They have tacos, burritos, quesas, and tortas. I've had tacos, burritos, and quesas (think thicker, deep fried quesadilla) and have never been disappointed.  I really love the tacos because you can get two tacos with rice and beans for about 10 bucks and be completely filled. Their horchata is really delicious and soaked in nuts and fruit for an interesting take on typical horchata. They make an AMAZING spicy margarita and a magnificent michelada---I can't even tell you how great they are. Of course, their salsa bar is my favorite part of this restaurant: 15 salsas that are unique and flavorful. The only reason I give this a 4 instead of 5 is because the last few times I have come (at varying times/days), they have been swamped and they only have 2 waiters. I recognize the space is really tiny (only about 8 or 9 tables and the bar counter) but there's also no real waiting area, which can get annoying in the summer.
