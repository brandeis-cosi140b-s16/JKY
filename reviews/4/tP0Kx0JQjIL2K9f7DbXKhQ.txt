I stopped by here this week. I'm glad I did.  I first ordered Al Pastor Torta.  Took me just a minute to woof it down.  I had to order Carne Asada Costra. Both dishes we're great, but the portions were small. Before I thought of ordering another dish, I just took my cheesecake flan to go.  I would definitely come here again, but when I'm not as hungry
