We went on a groupon and were also surprised how this groupon worked.. see all previous comments below.(it sucked)   Anyway we loved the salsa, bean dip and ordered a side of guacamole.. omg it was so tasty.  Food ordered was a Chimmi and Burrito.  Service was very good.  We certainly will try Casa Don Juan again.. although we have been by this place so many times before.
