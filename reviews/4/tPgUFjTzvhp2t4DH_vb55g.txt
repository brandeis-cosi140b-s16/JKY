The last time I ate at a Salsarita's I absolutely hated it because it seemed like they had a ton of cilantro to get rid of, and it ended up on my plate. Since then, I have boycotted Salsarita's in fear of getting more cilantro. I have been proven wrong (thankfully) and found a new lunch time haunt. 

Like Moe's, and other assembly line American type Mexican food, Salsarita's has more options that most in my opinion. I've been to this location twice and both times I got nachos, with different meats. The 1st trip was grilled chicken. I liked how even though it was grilled, it didn't taste burnt. The chicken was fresh and hot and didn't taste like it was sitting under warming lamps for hours. The 2nd trip I got their shredded pork, which I found that I like better than the chicken. I will probably stay away from the ground meat, it looks like taco bells meat and I think dog food every time I see it. I will suggest, if you get the nachos, get both refried and black beans with their "pink" sour cream, those 3 things really bring out the flavor in the meat you put on your plate (not sure how that is, but who cares as long as it tastes good right?). Their drinks are fountain Coke products (I know I know, it sucks being a Pepsi fan in Charlotte...)
