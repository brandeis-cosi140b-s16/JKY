Had a very good dinner tonight!! The service of Cesar, our waiter made it great! If we weren't sure on a flavor of something, he would bring a taste to make sure we liked.  The fish tacos were very good, cilantro/lime rice was the Bomb!  Wednesday is half price wine night, they have a great rose on the menu. Would come back in a heart beat as long as Cesar was our waiter!!!
