This location is easy to forget about because it's tucked away in Cotswold behind the new Panara and in front of a Yoga studio. I've never been at this location while it's been busy and that's probably because of how tucked away it is and probably because I don't go over there during lunch breaks. While I can't rate the food here because I can't eat it, I can remark on the experiences my companions have had. Anyone I've gone with has always enjoyed their food and had decent service. On tonight's visit, we discovered that they have one of the Coke flavor machines where you can select from a ridiculous amount of Coke flavors. Our only complaint from tonight was that there was water dripping from the ceiling, possibly from the exposed duct work. At any time, four people would be splattered by falling water drops. If you enjoy Salsarita's this appears to be a decent location.
