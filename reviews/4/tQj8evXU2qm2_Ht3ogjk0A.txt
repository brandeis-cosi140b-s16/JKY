Casa Noble Silver Margaritas for $6.25, buck more for Reposado, and another dollar for Anejo.  This is not the happy hour price.  Amazing drinks, good prices, wow.

Tortilla chips are thin, served hot & fresh, and accompanied by a salsa and hot sauce.  I had the Sonoran Masa enchiladas (comes with eggs on top) and it was quite good, reasonable portion size, and priced consistent with other casual dining places.  Service was above average.

Cute, casual Mexican place with good drinks.  Hard to beat.
