I picked 4 stars, which means, according to Yelp, "yay! I'm a fan."  And I am, because this is one of my go-to restaurants. It doesn't close at 7:30 pm, like every other place in town, so I think it gets a lot of business because it can cater to the crowd that doesn't eat dinner at 5 and then get all tuckered out around 8.

I considered writing a long review, but it really boils down to this: this place will stuff you with food, mostly chips and salsa if you're at my table, and they won't stop refilling everything until you tell them you can't eat any more.  Which you will do in a kind of thick, goopy voice because you're actually so full of food your body is storing it in your chest and throat.  I secretly think that the staff likes the spectacle of gluttony, but I don't care. When I go there, it's because I want to get fat and happy and that's what happens.
