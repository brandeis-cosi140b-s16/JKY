Have lived around the corner from this place for almost 4 yrs and finally ate here 3 months ago. Guess what? Been in here almost every week since. Especially for the CAT FISH fillet EVERY FRIDAY it's amazing!!! I can't say everything has been perfect every time but it's pretty darn great!! Chile relleno so good, carnitas good, carne asada good, beans, rice, green chile, love the homemade tortillas!! I'm hekka picky with the Mexican food and this place is nice, the food has tons of flavor. If you want that bland no flavor Mexican food is probably pass. Employees are friendly even when your kid spills an entire soda all over the table!! Just call us regulars here.
