I can't believe I'm going to say this but I was very impressed with this Taco Bell! 

To be fair my expectations were very low based on past experiences at other locations where I was barely helped, the food was cold and more often than not wrong. However, this location really changed my mind. 

Stopped in during Happy Hour...where all medium drinks are $1 and decided to get a Mountain Dew Baja Blast, nachos and chicken burrito. 

Now, I can only speak for the drive thru but on my visit service was fast and very helpful. In previous reviews many said that the drive thru was pretty slow and inefficient. But, the young man that helped me was very pleasant, he greeted me confirmed my order and said thank you! When I got to the window, he was smiling and waiting, we swapped money for my bag of goodies and drink and I was on my merry way! Literally five minutes tops...perhaps it was just a good day?!?! Whatever the case I'm not complaining! 

The Mountain Dew Baja Blast was a little different than what I was expecting...it's like a Slurpee ( 7-11...YUM) but lacked the flavor I was looking for, literally after three sips all the syrup and flavor was gone and I was stuck with shaved ice...not great but I will give it another chance. 

As for the food, my order was prepared correctly and was hot! I really enjoyed it.

Totally will be back to this location!
