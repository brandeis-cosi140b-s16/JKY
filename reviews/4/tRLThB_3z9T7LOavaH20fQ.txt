I cannot believe I haven't left a review yet! This was one of the first restaurants that my husband and I visited when we moved to Vegas. 

It's a total hole in the wall that can get super busy during peak lunch & dinner times but they are really good at bringing food out quickly. 

The bulgogi fries or nachos are a must and they are so easy to share. 

Bulgogi and pork tacos are incredible! The prices are great. We came here and ordered a nacho, burrito and three tacos for $13.  

I wish it wasn't so far.
