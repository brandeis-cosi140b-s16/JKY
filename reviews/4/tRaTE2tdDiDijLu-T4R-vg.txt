We have had Manuel's cater our office lunch twice in the last month and both times it was a hit. After years of falling back on pizzas we needed something new and Manuel's has been a great change.

First time we ordered the chicken fajitas and the second we ordered tamales and both were very well received. Sides were great and the salad was fresh. Both times the food served more than stated in the menu.

To top it off from the hostess to the managers they were nothing but helpful and everything was packed well and very professional!

Manny's will defiantly be a "go to" for us going forward.
