I worked all day with nothing to eat. I passed by this Taco Bell and decided to stop in for a quick bite. 
I ordered a "Doritos Los Tacos Supreme". This has to be the best invention at Taco Bell ever! It was delicious. 
The store was clean and the cashier friendly. I didn't visit the bathroom.
I see they have a "Big Box Deal" that the cashier says changes each month.  This month it included the Doritos Taco and other goodies. I wasn't able to eat a big meal knowing I was going out to dinner in a couple hours or I would have tried that.
Hey, it is fast food and not "real" Mexican food but every now and then it really hits the spot!
