I'm only writing this review as a favor for budget eaters looking for a somewhat healthy solution.  I think this place has one of the best deals for two things:  the fish taco (about $2), and the veggie burrito (about $4).   This is my place when I'm rushed, starving, and don't want to give in to garbage.  The real bonus is the tremendous amount of pico de gallo, jalps, and salsa you can load up on for free.
