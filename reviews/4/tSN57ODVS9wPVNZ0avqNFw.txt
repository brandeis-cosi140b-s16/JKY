Don't let the look of the place fool you. The food here is awesome!!!!! Bring cash because it's all they accept. The Chile Releno, and Mexican Pizza are my two favorite things. This place is perfect for someone looking to experience a true hole in the wall no frills place where they will get great food with a smile. You can order from inside the small cashier area or just walk up to the window on the side. Dining area is outdoors with a screen door, but once again don't let this bother you. The food is amazing!!!
