We chose this place based on high Yelp reviews for dinner before our girls night out. Looks like a hole in the wall place in a sorta sketchy area but I felt safe in a group. 
This was a two man show on Saturday night. The hostess/waitress/bartender/cashier was awesome and the cook has serious skills! 
The margaritas were $7 and made from fresh fruits and great quality tequila...best margaritas I've had in a long time...and not the sugary syrupy kind!
Everyone's dinners were perfect and the homemade chips and salsa were delish. I highly recommend this place...I will be back!
