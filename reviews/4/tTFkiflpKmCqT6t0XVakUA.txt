Definitely tasty.
Stuck in Phoenix for business and this place came recommended.
The mole is a little sweet but the salsa is flavorful and has a little heat.
I ordered the slow cooked pork with beans and rice and it was delicious.  Actually the beans had a little different flavor than what i'm used to but I chalk that up to local flavor. The rice to was a little spiced had a couple pieces of corn an carrot and actually had flavor.  I ordered a side of chopped jalapenos for spice and mole because it's my favorite sauce and I like to sample it everywhere I go.  As I mentioned it was a little on the sweet side but very tasty.
