Stopped by the Fedex Kinko's Store next door around lunchtime and was hungry for some Mexican Food.  Luckily, this Chipotle is only steps away.

I went for the Steak Burrito had them put Rice, Pinto Beans, Hot Sauce, Sour Cream, and Guacamole in the Burrito.  The Burrito was solid as usual for a Chipotle.  The Guacamole & Sour Cream makes the Burrito for me.  The Rice has just the right amount of Lemon juice on it to give it that slight tart flavor.....and the Hot Sauce has a nice kick to it.

I think they do a really good job because they have such a small menu and focus on providing consistent product.

Will I return?  You bet.
