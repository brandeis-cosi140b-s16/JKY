I'm the kind of gal that needs greasy, cheesy, spicy, yummy goodness after a rough night out.
Los betos has been my go to spot for the right kind of cure.
My favorite burrito is the California burrito, no pico de gallo, add beans. I order this every time and it does it's trick.
I recommend you get this burrito and you'll never go back to a different kind of burrito.
