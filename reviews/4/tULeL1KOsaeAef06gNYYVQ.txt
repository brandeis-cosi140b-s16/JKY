Like so many others have said, the view of Las Vegas is fantastic from this restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and the service was polite and quick.

I thought the food, although good, had room for improvement. I had a steak dish that was a little over sauced which made it difficult to taste the natural flavours.

Prices where fair and nobody left the restaurant hungry. I will be returning to Lindo Michoacan in the future.
