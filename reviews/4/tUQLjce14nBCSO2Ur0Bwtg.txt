When we walked in the manager (white man) and the hostess (black girl) seemed to be in an argument and carried on with their conversation right in front of my boyfriend and I. Very unprofessional and rude. Once we were seated our waitress asked if we wanted drinks. Our waitress Eileen was awesome. She carried a great conversation, was very sweet, and consistently asked us if we needed anything. We showed up at happy hour. $2 tacos and $20 margarita pitcher. Great price. The food was great...the salsa was bland though...But I am from Southern California where the salsa is amazing! Overall, the food was great & so was our waitress.
