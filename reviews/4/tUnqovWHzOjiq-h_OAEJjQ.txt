1. It was very busy due to big group dinners but they set us pretty quick. 
2. Asked to bring me a bowl of salsa instead of little cup. He did without question. Later on found out they serve salsa in a plastic saki bottle. 
3. They took forever to bring our food. Ended up eating 3 full basket of chips and salsa.  I have to say they have pretty good chips.  
4. My food was HUGH!  It will be my lunch & dinner on 26th. Save my belly for better Christmas meal! 
5. Overall, great first experience. It is American + Mexican style and for that I will say this chain American + Mexican restaurant is pretty darn good. I didn't expect authentic Mexican from a chain store and you shouldn't expect that either. If u happened to find one than great but leave that expectation for small hole on the wall or mom and pop Mexican restaurant.
