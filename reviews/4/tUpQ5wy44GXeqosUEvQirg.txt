We love the fresh food here or at any Chipotle restaurant. 

Had my usual, Carnitas Burrito and my wife had the burrito bowl. This time we selected our condiments and especially added the guacamole which made my burrito cold. Wish there was a microwave to heat the burro. But, all in all, the meal was filling and good. 

This place reminds me of El Faro in San Francisco where I experienced a gastronomical burrito delight. This place is almost on par with them.  Maybe, Chipotle should look around for larger tortillas, so you can fit all the "goodies" without them bulging at the seams.
