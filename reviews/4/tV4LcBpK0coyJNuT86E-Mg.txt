Stayed at the Luxor, and ate here several times.  Excellent service - for example, when I was deciding between a quesadilla and something nice and spicy, the waiter offered my a bowl of chopped up serranoes to go with the quesadilla.

Tip here is to go for lunch - the burger, the asada sandwich, are excellent.  The bread is super fresh from some local bakery, and these items are NOT on the menu after lunch.  There are plenty of great places to go for dinner, but looking for something around lunchtime (you probably just woke up), this is the place.

Tip #2, ask which margaritas are made with fresh fruit.  When we were there, it was the raspberry, and it makes a difference!
