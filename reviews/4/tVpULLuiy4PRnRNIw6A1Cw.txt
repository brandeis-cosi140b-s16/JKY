I have been frequenting Zapata's for years and I love it! My favorite is the street tacos which are always fresh and delicious. I have never been disappointed with my food at Zapata's and I know many people who are patrons as well. It is a really large restaurant so there is always seating available. The service is always great. I can't say enough good things about it. I am a big fan of Mexican food and I have tried a lot, let me tell you this place won't disappoint.
