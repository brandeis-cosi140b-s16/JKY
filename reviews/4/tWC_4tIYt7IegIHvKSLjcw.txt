Keep in mind this establishment is a walk-up order. Chips were not warm enough for me hence not fresh, salsa is nothing to rave about. Tried their red tamale & shredded beef enchilada dinner & they were exceptionally good. The shredded beef is not dry its infused with gravy & very tasty. I give this establishment 4 stars, definitely be back to try their other entrees.
