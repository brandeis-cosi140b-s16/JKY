Came on a Sunday afternoon - very few people in the restaurant so we had our choice of seating. From the start, excellent and attentive service without being smothered which was nice. Ordered guacamole and a side of beans; both came out quickly and were tasty. Not amazing, but tasty nonetheless. Entrees came out next and were HUGE - got the Fiesta Grande and the Carne Asada Burrito. Again both were very tasty but not amazing. 
The entire place is very clean - even the restrooms were very well maintained which is a very good sign in my book. The decoration of the restaurant is colorful and fun but not too much - just right. 
Recommended for a fun night out for tasty Mexican food with great service and a fun, clean atmosphere.
