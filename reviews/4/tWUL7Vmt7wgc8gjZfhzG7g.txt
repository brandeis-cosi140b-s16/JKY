My friend found this place on Yelp and dragged me here after I picked her up from the airport. We got fish tacos and potato tacos. 

The fish tacos were awesome! At most places, the fish tacos consist of fried fish and you would judge them on how much they don't taste like fish sticks. Here, the fish tacos are made with GRILLED TILAPIA. It's a nice change and it tastes fantastic!

The potato tacos are also awesome! The shell reminds you of a soft bird nest that holds the flavorful potato together. 

We went on Friday and there was no one there (apparently UNLV doesn't have classes on Fridays?). The owners were very friendly and even threw in some fried oreos for us. They're pretty good. Not too different from the county fair staple, but who can hate county fair fried food :)

Definitely coming back here on my next Vegas trip!

My recommendations:
- Potato taco
- Fish taco
