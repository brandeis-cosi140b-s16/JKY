My husband and I were a bit concerned after reading about the lengthy waits for meals but did not encounter any service delays at all - in fact, we were served so promptly we were even surprised with how quickly our main courses were placed before us - piping hot and delicious!  We skipped appetizers and went immediately for ribs (for my husband) and pasta selection for me - with just the right amount of spicy kick. The salsa was pleasantly warm, no overly so, and the chips were crisp and tasty - again, perfect to munch on during the not-very-long wait for our main course. We found the wait staff to be adequate for the volume of diners on a Friday evening and quite attentive.  Perhaps it helped that I'd phoned ahead for reservations, which truly did not seem necessary as there was sufficient seating availability at 6:30. For a local dining establishment with a unique flair, we'll be heading back again.
