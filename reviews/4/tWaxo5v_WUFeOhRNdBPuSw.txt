I was so happy when this place opened up a couple years ago because it meant I had another option that is within walking distance of the office where I can eat lunch for less than $10.  There aren't many in this part of town, let me tell you.  I haven't been in a while since I have been watching my calorie intake.  I know, I know I can get the "bowl" (salad) option.  But I really don't have enough willpower to go in there and not get a burrito or crunchy tacos.  Plus, I have to walk right past Sprinkles cupcakes and that is just torture.
