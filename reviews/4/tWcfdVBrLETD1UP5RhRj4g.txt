Great, casual place, especially 3-6pm Happy Hour when most of the tacos, appetizers are a dollar off.

The elote (with cheese, butter) is highly rated but I thought it was meh...  At $4 it's a LOT of corn - enough for 2 people to share.  

We had the cheese fondue - the corn tortillas are fantastic.  The cheese which arrives in a cast iron pan does not stay melted long enough and soon you are stuck with a hunk of congealed cheese

The tacos are very good and a dollar off about $1.50-$1.75 each.

The guacamole is good.

The salad is very good.

Definitely a star in Phoenix and worth the visit. Plus outdoor seating is great.
