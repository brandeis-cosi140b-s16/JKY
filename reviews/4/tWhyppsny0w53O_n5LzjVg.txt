Best salsa ever! I love that they give you two kinds, tastes great to mix them. *Awesome* crispy cheese crisps--I highly suggest getting one with green chilis & green onions on top, delicious beans, etc. If I were rating on food alone, they'd get 5 stars, hands down. 
However, although the service is typically good, tonight my experience with that was initially very poor. I asked to sit on the patio, which was recently remodeled (pretty nice albeit too brightly lit & really loud being right on Indian School). One of the two hostesses sat me at a table of my choice, and brought silverware, a plate, and placemat right away. Chips & salsa arrived shortly thereafter, which are SO GOOD. Hot chips, best salsa (I drove 10 miles from my house just for it)! Here's where my experience drastically went south: I sat for ten solid minutes with no acknowledgment. I *finished* my chips & salsa (quite voraciously & happily), and still had not been greeted, still had *no water,* etc. I was one of three tables outside. Servers/bussers/food runners went to the other 2 tables multiple times, and still I was ignored. Do not misunderstand: I do not believe anyone was doing this intentionally; rather it was that "someone else probably went there already" type situation. Bottom line, it was all due to a break down in communication. Neither hostess had told any servers that I was a new table. But the boy who brought my chips could have been proactive & alerted someone, just as the food runner could have, and the server. I finally had to go to the bar inside and ask politely if someone could come outside & bring me water, etc. Right away a server nearby offered to help & followed me outside. He was very kind and apologetic, wrote down my order, & brought my water right after that. **Melvin** is his name, and he turned my experience around! Thank you, Melvin. 
Now, for margaritas: *worst* mix I have ever tasted. It made me think of the smell of a diaper pail or sewage, no joke. So I ordered the same marg, with Corralejo Blanco, & asked for just agave/simple syrup and straight line juice (basically coin style). DRASTICALLY better. Only way to drink them here!!
