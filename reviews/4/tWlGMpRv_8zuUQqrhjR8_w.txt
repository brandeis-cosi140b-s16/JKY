Tia's is reliably good. Not super authentic  but I have yet to have a disappointing experience. I like to bring out of town guests here. 

Chips and salsa and water are always on the table almost immediately. I will say, if I could improve one thing with Tia's it would be the salsa. It's just not that good. There is a red and a green, neither are spicy. The green is actually rather sweet. It is served in strangely small containers and I usually don't eat very much of it even though I love chips and salsa. It's just bland.

The entrees however, are really good. I recommend the chimichanga, but on occasion I have ordered the nachos (off of the appetizer menu) as an entree. The margaritas are excellent as well.

Service is prompt and friendly.
