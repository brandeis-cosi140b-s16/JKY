This is my "cost and splurge" place. I go when I have 12.00 bucks to spare for lunch and when I want to eat "whatever I want day." I have been a fan of Mattas for years. I would go weekly. I have my favorites (ala carte Roberts ground beef taco and bean tostada) or an order of mini chili cheese burros. I love Mattas! However, sometimes it takes a bit to get an employee to fill your chip bowl. I love the chips almost more than the meal, so its frustrating to try to get their attention. Like I said, this is a splurge for me, so two small bowls of chips isn't ridiculous. (at one point I boycotted them for months because when I asked for more chips, the gal took a bowl from the tray of chips and sprinkled a few extra chips into my bowl. Gee, thanks for watching my diet. I paid 9 bucks for this food-(and 3 dollar tip) at least give me a full bowl! Quit being the chip police. It costs you pennies!!)
Lately I have been happy with therr crew and I don't go as much as I would like. Is it traditional mexican? Probably not, but the hot salsa is heaven in my mouth. Love this place. One word of advice- my husband has never been much of a fan and I figured out why. I always go at lunch and he comes with me at night. Lunch is way better- and I am not sure why. I also realized that my lunch orders were a lot better,
