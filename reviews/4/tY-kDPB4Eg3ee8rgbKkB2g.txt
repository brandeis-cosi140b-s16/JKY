I am traveling from the east coast and growing up in LA, I really miss authentic Mexican food when I am there! The closest I can get to Mexican food on the east coast is chipotle.

I asked the person working there for recommendations and he suggested the all thai'd up quesadilla but I was craving tacos so I ordered the lengua (beef tongue), carnitas (shredded pork), and carne arrachera (skirt steak). My favorite was the skirt steak! I liked my tacos with chunks of meat. It was very flavorful! I also like the beef tongue :P That is one of my favorite cut of meat! But because this is stewed, it loses some of the texture that I like in the beef tongue. But the avocado slice in the taco was a nice touch. 3 tacos came out to be $9.50 and comes with side of chips and salsa. 

I love the art inside this restaurant and I am happy to say my Mexican craving was satisfied!
