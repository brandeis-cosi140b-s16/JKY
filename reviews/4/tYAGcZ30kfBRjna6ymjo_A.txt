I went to On the Border last week wanting to try something different than my usual order. I noticed the new Mahi Mahi tacos and thought I would give them a try. They were great! The fish is grilled and tender and the chipotle sauce has just enough kick. I finished my meal with the Apple Crisp dessert which was also terrific. I have been and will always be a huge fan of On the Border and my recent visit definitely confirmed that.
