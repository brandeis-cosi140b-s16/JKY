One of the better Mexican places around this side of town. 

Location: It's located near starbucks and lee's alcohol, and gas station plaza on windmill and Maryland.

Vibe & layout: I go here almost ritually for my breakfast and late night snack and it's ALWAYS clean. The place is small, but it's never really packed.

Customer service & food: Always greeted by a smile which is nice, and my food gets out in a very quickly time. Their bacon breakfast burrito is dankkk 15/10. Super cheesy, super eggy, super stuffed. 
Chimichanga: Huge and on point.
Carnitas: Can be a little small at times, but it still taste good.
All in all I've never had a bad experience here.

Protip: They take orders ahead of time!
