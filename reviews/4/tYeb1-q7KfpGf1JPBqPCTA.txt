Scary when I considered eating at El Pollo Loco as eating healthy.  But it's healthier than most of the restaurants that I will frequent throughout the week.  I don't go to this particular Loco often, only when I'm getting my cut at Xpress Cuts.  

Cleanliness is hit or miss here.  Sometimes it's super clean and sometimes it's just missing some housekeeping.  But I put that blame on the guest that don't clean up after themselves.  

I really don't go outside the box when I visit El Pollo Loco. It's usually 5 Chicken Legs or their 3 piece combo.  Regardless what choose, I'm shredding the chicken meat and eating it burrito style.  

TIP:  This drive thru is crazy busy and at all times of the day. One reason this drive thru gets busy is because it wraps around Wells Fargo Bank.  There has to be at least 2 times I've been here where someone thought they were in line for the ATM.  My suggestion, dine in or get your meal inside.
