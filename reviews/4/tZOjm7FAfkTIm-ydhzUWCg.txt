Expect a long wait, especially during peak hours (.. in Vegas, I'm not sure what times that would be but we were in it).

The flavors were unique, the staff were authentic, and the juices were amazing.
The carne asada fries, or any fries, were gigantic and they do not skimp out on any ingredients.  The tacos, while definitely tasty, are small.  My brother, who doesn't eat too much, ordered 4 and even then I question his satiety.

They hand make the corn tortillas in front of you, carve the meat from huge skewers for each taco, and you can customize it however you like.  They offer unique ingredients like shoulder and others.  A side dish of grilled peppers and onions are provided for every order as well.  I only wish they offered salsas because I absolutely love salsas.

Definitely an excellent stop for a Vegas trip, especially if you're tired of buffets and McDonald's.  The quality for the price is unbeatable.
