The food was good, not fantastic, but good.  The chile rellenos were amazing!!! My husband couldn't even eat them all, they were that big.  The house margaritas were good - it was $2 Tuesday so hard to complain there.  

The atmosphere is worth the trip all by itself.  Although it was very busy, they got our party of 5 (with two toddlers) seated within 10 minutes.  The chips and salsa kept on coming and kept the kiddos happy.  My 4 yr old is a connoisseur of flavorful but not too spicy salsa, and Tee Pee's salsa fit the bill.  The chips were fresh, warm and crispy.

All in all a nice, reasonable dinner, great atmosphere and family friendly.  We'll be back again and again.
