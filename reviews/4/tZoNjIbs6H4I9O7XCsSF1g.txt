We ate here twice during a three day stay at the Encore.  The food was very good, though a little expensive if you did not go at happy hour or have a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  If you go for happy hour make sure to get the sangria, which is a great deal at $15 a pitcher.  The fish tacos were excellent, and the chicken fajitas were even better.  The chips were only ok, and I only really liked one of the three salsas, but the atmosphere is very nice and the server we had was very attentive and friendly.
