CASH ONLY! 

Good food and good service. You will leave happy as long as you don't pay attention to a few things...this place is kind of a dive. The food is good, so I keep coming back. My friends, family and I have tried several things on the menu. We like the birria, caldos, sopes and desayunos (breakfast) This may or may not be the place for you, but give is a chance.
