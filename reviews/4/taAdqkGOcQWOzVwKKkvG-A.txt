When I go to Vegas with the fam this is out go to go place to have a nice family dinner. And by nice I mean us all getting drunk lol 

The food is good here. Service is good. But the problem here is the wait to get seated but after being seated you can look forward to a nice cool experience here. 

And the waitress are cute. Drinks are strong. Everything seems to at reasonable prices.
