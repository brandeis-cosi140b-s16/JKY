Went there a few days ago after reading the reviews. .. it was good. .. I wouldn't say it's the best. .. for carne asada I had better. .. The ceviche Tostadas were pretty good. .  The salsa it's not the best for chips. . It's too hot hard to enjoy. ...  This is not a place were 2 eat for $20... more like $35 + tip.  I will go back if I'm on the area,  but I won't drive that far just for that.
