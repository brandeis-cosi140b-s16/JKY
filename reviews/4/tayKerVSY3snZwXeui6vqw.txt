This place was not packed on Sunday morning for brunch. It was very low key with a good menu--
Lots of choices but not too overwhelming. They had $2 mimosas which were very generous. The huevos rancheros were yummy and my fianc√© got some delicious apple cinnamon pancakes. I would definitely recommend this for someone who wants to switch up the normal breakfast on the weekends!
