I tried Taxco for dinner a few days after it opened.  The decor was comfortable Mexican but not too tacky.  Plenty of tables to handle the dinner rush.  I ordered the large combination of tex mex fare.  The food came quickly and was hot.  Unfortunately the flavor was bland.  I was hoping it would be spicy with some heat.  The meat in each dish lacked spices, almost to the point of being plain hamburger in the burrito and tostada.  Even the chile poblano had no heat whatsoever.  The margaritas were excellent and reasonably priced.  The service was also excellent.  I will be going back and trying some of the more traditional Mexican fare.
