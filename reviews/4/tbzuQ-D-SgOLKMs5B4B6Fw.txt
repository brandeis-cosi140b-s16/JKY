I really like their food here!
It's a tad pricey, but you get a whole lotta stuff in that burrito!  :)

PROS:
LARGE burritios
The babacoa has enough kick (spice) in it for you AND me!
delicious--always delicious

CONS:
pricey
they have cilantro in everything (blech!)
the burrito shell will quit on you @ some point during the meal, so grab a fork too.


My FAVE:
Barbacoa bowl (no rice), double black beans with corn salsa, cheese, and a bit of sour cream
