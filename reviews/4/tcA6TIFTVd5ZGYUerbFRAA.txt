I had fried burritos covered in cheese with beans and rice. This. Meal was delicious. The staff was very courteous and nice. My daughter had a kids queseadea and I had a couple of bites best quesedea I've had in a long time. The chips  were a little bland but they are bottomless. The salsa was yummy. I definitely will be coming back.
