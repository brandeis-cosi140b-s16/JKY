DEL RAT since 2003 as we called it in High School.

I used to eat del taco 5x a week for lunch for couple years in my teen years because it was affordable & tasted delicious plus chicken soft taco Thursdays which used to be 1.09 back then 

Anyways went through the drive-thru as it was one of our stops & our cashier was nice & helpful especially when I couldn't get the name of the salad right as I couldn't remeber the name & couldn't find it fast enough on the menu being on the passage side.

DELUXE CHICKEN SALAD BOWL $4.89 - the bowl itself is made with some crispy fluff I assume to be flour & filled w/ thinly sliced lettuce w/ grilled chicken chunks, tomatos, cheese, guacamole, & sour cream(also comes w/beans but i opt. out). They were pretty heavy on the amount of lettuce & way too little amount of chicken to go w/ the pile lettuce. Still good just need to even out the portions...

CHURROS $1 - made to order so it's deliciously hot & fresh

SM. CARAMEL CHEESECAKE BITES $2.39 - oozing out soft cream cheese & caramel wrapped in a small tortilla like a chimichanga & deep fried! xP *DROOL* just thinking about its simplicity.
