I love their CC Sizzle everything.  There's really something unique about it.  Been there twice in one week and I'm considering it again today.  Aside from the CC Sizzle, everything is fresh (salsa, tortillas, and chips).  You can really taste the quality in the food they prepare.  The company of their staff is very inviting.  I believe they are just starting out in business and I hope they are successful because I would be truly disappointed to not be able to eat there.
