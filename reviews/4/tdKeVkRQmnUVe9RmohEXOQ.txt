I was taken here while visiting from Chicago and had one of the best margaritas of my life.  I tried the house (on ice with salt) and it was fantastic, but what I couldn't get enough of was the strawberry-lime one.  I couldn't taste a drop of alcohol...and that's when you know you have a good mixed drink on your hands. I honestly could have had three more it was so tasty, but my childlike tolerance for boozin did not allow it.  

The bartender was super nice and friendly, we had many refills of the chips and salsa (damn you, I can never resist), and it was all in a southwestern chill environment.  Supposedly the tacos are top-notch, I will have to give them a whirl next time I'm in town.  

I highly suggest going here for a happy hour or dinner.
