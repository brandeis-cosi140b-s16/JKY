Wanted to try this place for a while now and finally went tonight for dinner I had the Crane asada burrito my wife had the carne asada tacos the food was good steak could have been a little more medium but good.  The wife had a Margarita that was pretty good not over kill, however our waitress was very cute but young, she seemed to be new or not very with it but she was very slow. So it did ruin it a bit but the food was tasty...will go back
