My family and I come here all the time. We have tried a variety of things on the menu and have always been satisfied. 

I am not Mexican so I do not claim to know what authentic Mexican food taste like but I do know what good food tastes like we are always happy when we come here. The staff is always friendly and there is plenty of seating. The drinks are good and the food is always prepared well with large portions.

Overall this place will not blow you away but it is a good place for family lunch or dinner.
