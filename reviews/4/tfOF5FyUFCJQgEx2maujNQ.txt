Pleasantly surprised with this one.   We just wandered in trying to find a quick but tasty lunch that wasn't a burger or sandwich and were pretty impressed with the quality of food here.  

I had the carnitas street tacos, which come three to a plate.  There are also shrimp, chicken and fish options.  

The big hunks of shredded pork were plentiful but they were a little bland on their own.  With the addition of some great fire roasted salsa and guacamole though they were delicious and very filling.  I definitely couldn't finish all three.    The double white corn tortillas were very lightly fried just to give them some tooth so they were sturdy enough to hold up.   That was great.  I hate when the tortilla tears and falls apart and you end up with a mess. 

My companion had the beef enchiladas, which were topped with a green chili sauce.   They too were moist and the beef was shredded and plentiful.. but they were a bit too salty for me.  

Each plate comes with rice and beans.   We tried each type of rice and the cilantro rice was the clear winner for me. The other option was "Mexican rice" and it was your standard tomato-based concoction, just not super flavorful.   We didn't bother trying the black beans, we were both just too full. 

Plenty of beer and tequilas to go with... all in all a good bet (ha.. no pun intended)... and quite a substantial amount of food for your money.  I would go back.
