This is a great place to go if you happen to be at the MGM Grand. Service was attentive and friendly. We got the guacamole, which was a treat since it's prepared tableside. It tasted great even without the jalape√±o. (We had to leave it out to fit our young child's palate.) 

I had portobello fajitas. It was a good, filling amount of food, and the wood-fired portobello pieces were flavorful. The corn tortillas were piping hot and made the perfect wrap for the mushroom pieces, beans, pico de gallo and rice. 

My son ordered a plain cheese quesadilla, which is off-menu, but they gladly made this kid-friendly dish. He liked it -- but how can you ruin tortillas and cheese, really?

We were all pleased with our dining experience! If you want a casual dinner at the MGM Grand, this is a great choice. 

Note: they don't serve lunch, and they're closed Mondays and Tuesdays.
