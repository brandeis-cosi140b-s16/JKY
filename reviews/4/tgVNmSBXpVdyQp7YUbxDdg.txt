Last night was my second experience with Burrito Drive and I'm officially a fan. I ordered the steak quesadilla (with a side of guacamole) and my husband got the adobo chicken burrito. He really enjoyed his burrito (it was plenty good, I snuck a bite), but once he tried my steak quesadilla, that was it. He said: Oh man, I'm ordering that next time. And I totally get why. Because, um yeah............it was awesome!

The tortilla was crispy & warm & a little buttery. And the steak was SO tender and flavorful and delicious. Then there's the Asadero cheese, which is perfection - just the right combination of creamy and salty. Their red salsa is great, with just the right amount of smokiness & spice. And the guac - you guys! The guacamole is definitely worth the extra $$$. Definitely. The only aside were the tater tots which were underwhelming. They were lukewarm and no longer crispy by the time I got our order home, but I can't allow that to tarnish our positive experiences. Tots just don't hold/travel well, even when it's just a short distance.

Their portions are exceptionally sized and we have yet to be disappointed. We will be back. And we'll both get the steak quesadilla and you'll be sad you don't have one. It's just that good. Go on...... Give it a try.  :o)
