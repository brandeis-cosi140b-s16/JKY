I'm addicted to the Street Tacos! They are really yummy. I am sad I hadn't tried this place before but will now be back for sure. I got  the 3-plate combo so I got to pick from 3 tacos (chicken, steak or carnitas) and it came with rice and beans. I was able to mix-n-match the tacos so I picked one of each to try them all. They were all good but the carnitas was my favorite. 

Inside is clean and the staff is super friendly. If you sign up on their e-mail list (beach club) you get a nice coupon to go towards the cost of your purchase on your birthday! They also send other promotions. Rubio's also offers catering and fundraising services.
