I've had their food here before many years ago but forgot what it tasted like!  Decided it was time for a refresher!

Started off with the Carne Asada Fries...eat your heart out Robertos! This was damn good actually...lots of melted cheese and plenty of Cotija on top...delicious!  One of the best versions I've had of this dish.

Also had the Al Pastor Torta. Very good! Lots of flavor in the al pastor, and it was tender considering it's not rotisserie style. Portion was also large considering the cheap entry price! 

The Chorizo con Huevo Torta would be a good choice if you are craving breakfast food. Good flavor in the chorizo and the egg.

Give em a shot if you are in the area :)
