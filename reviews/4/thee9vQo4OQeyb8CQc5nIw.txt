Went on Tuesday night was waiting for a friend to fly in from Tampa. Her plane was late and  had some time to kill so went here since it was close to the hotel. I had the chicken burrito with pinto beans and rice. For a little extra I had the guacamole and it was worth it. A bag of chips, salsa, and a beer and I had the makings of a great dinner. I usually have the carnitas but the chicken tasted like it was fresh off the BBQ grill.  These burritos are huge! The service was great and the tables are clean. Check out this place when you are in the Metroplex area.
