Awesome and delicious food, and very reasonably priced. The decor on the inside is colorful and fun, great for families. My only concern is that after we were served our food, it was difficult to get the waitress's attention. We had to ask for a drink refill and was not told until waiting for quite awhile that our check had been waiting for us at the counter. Kind of a weird experience, but I guess now we know. We will be going back since the food was spot on. :)
