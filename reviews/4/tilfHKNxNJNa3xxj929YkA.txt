Okay, I admit I wanted to try Border Grill because I have a girl-crush on Mary-Sue Milliken.  Now it's our go-to Mexican place when we're craving South of the Border flavors in Vegas.

After a long-ish trek past all the other restaurants and convention areas in the Mandalay Bay is the colorful and tasteful Border Grill.  The margaritas are great and a pitcher goes quickly.  The chips and three salsas are quite tasty...  And now on to the real stuff!

My sister swears the steak she ordered at Border Grill was one of the best she's ever had.  And she's had a lot of steak.   My mom's half chicken?  Moist and flavorful.  My kobe beef tacos were delicious.  The carnitas were a bit dry, but the flavor was good.

We were too full for dessert.

The staff - from the host to the servers to the busboy - were a delight.
