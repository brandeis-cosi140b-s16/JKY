The food here was really good, but the restaurant is waaaayyy too loud. If we had known, we would have reserved an outside table. The noise from the bar permeates the entire inside. I think they need to decide if they are a singles bar or a romantic, "intimate" restaurant... Our server was friendly and attentive,our meal took a little too long to come. Also had to send back the chicken skewers because they were almost cold (meaning our food sat around, right?). But, once again, the food was delicious: table-side guacamole, delicious salads and really interesting tacos. Be warned, the tacos are three tiny tacos to a plate.
