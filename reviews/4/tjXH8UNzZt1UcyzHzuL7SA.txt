Seriously if your Jones' n for anything remotely healthy..or to take on your flight , because no airline caters coach 100%.. & even if that pre 9-11 perk does come back.. Just say eh eh., no... The B B is open early & crew members love this place. You can get vegetarian Mexican fare, and they will foil it for you for the trip.. I always get a vegetarian breakfast burrito..& after I'm done being fly sky godess.. I have it & usually warm.. So for airport cuisine.. This is pretty 'fly'.. 

Ps.. Located in T4 , near high A gates.. :-)
