It's been a couple weeks since I ate here, but not a day has passed that I havent stopped craving those Pineapple Al Pastor Tacos. So spicy, sweet, & savory. I can't wait to have a few of these again with some of their beautiful crispy carnitas tacos. 

I also tried the torta since that seems to be the focus of this place, but it was very underwhelming. Just because it's big that doesnt make it good.  The carne asada is definitely not their best meat in the building and the bun could have been greatly improved.  Don't waste your time and appetite on it.  Stick with the tacos.  

The pricing is fair, the service awfully slow, the average horchata comes from a machine, but omg those tacos be hittin'.
