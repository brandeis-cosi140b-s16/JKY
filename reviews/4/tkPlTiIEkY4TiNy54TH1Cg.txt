Updated Review: 

Oh what a difference some familiarity makes! 

3 visits in I'm finding myself craving this place. It starts with Al Pastor burritos. This Midwestern guy moved to Vegas a couple of years ago and hadn't heard of things like fish tacos and had no clue what Al Pastor was. But I do now thanks to Taco Taco and I'm hooked on the stuff. And while the Al Pastor tacos were good, it was the burrito that made me have an OMG moment and fall head over heels for some Al Pastor burritos! 

Tack on fresh chips, Mexican Coke (when the cooler is working it's great, when it's not...ugh), and a seriously good salsa bar. When I say seriously good...I'm a salsaholic / salsa snob. I've met a lot of salsa that sucked...but not here. I found 8 different kinds of salsa goodness and for once it's nice to have to choose between the flavors and not because a salsa sucked. 

My first experience was rough but each visit keeps getting better and better. It's pushing the limits of being able to make it over here for lunch and get back to work on time but the food is good enough to make it worth pushing the clock to do it. 

Bump to 4 Stars...this place is going to be on my lunch rotation for awhile. Yum!
