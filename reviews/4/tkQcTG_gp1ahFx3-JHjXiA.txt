I still hit this place any time I can.  It is probably my favorite mexican place and definitely my favorite burrito place in town.  I hadn't seen one of the owners in quite a while and she still remembered me by name.  Great food and great people.  Chilero's is owned by the same family and if you live in the area is also great.
