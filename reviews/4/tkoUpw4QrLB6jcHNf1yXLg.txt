The place is small and tables are close together so be prepared to hear the conversation going on at the table beside you...other than that, and the lack of parking due to it being in a strip mall...the place is great!

The food was amazing.  Complimentary chips and guacamole (small portions size, but enough to hold you over until your food arrives). Of course the begogi fries are a must have and the fusion chimi is delicious.   The service was good, there is a board informing you that KoMex is NoT fast food so be prepared to wait a little while.  The wait is worth it!
