This is a very unique restaurant and something I wasn't used to. When I think of Mexican food I think of Robertos or Don Tortaco. I didn't think I"d be too crazy about this place but it was surprisingly really good. I got the stacked carne asada enchilada and it was delicious! At first I thought i wasn't going to enjoy it because of how unexpectedly spicy it was for me but after I added a bunch of sour cream I was able to eat it no problem and it was so good! I didn't think I would finish it all but I did. I also loved the free fried ice cream my family and I got because of the special offer when you check in on Yelp. Will definetly be coming back! :)
