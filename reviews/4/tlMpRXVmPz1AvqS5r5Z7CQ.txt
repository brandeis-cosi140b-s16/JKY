Tacos. Tequila. Whiskey. 

I knew this would be my kind of place! I met some girlfriends here for dinner and was instantly a fan of this place. Sure, parking sucks....but they do offer valet so that's a huge plus!

Based on the previous reviews I knew I had to start with a Bakersfield Margarita....and it was totally worth it. I loved that they come in mini mason jars and come with a good amount of tasty liquor. We also ordered some queso with chorizo.....holy cheesy goodness. It's delish. This is exactly how cheese dip should be done. Get it. 

For dinner I tried the short rib taco which comes with queso fresco, onions and cilatro then gets topped with a radish. It was really tasty. My friends tried the fish and pastor tacos and agreed that they were all really good!  I also tried the Chicken Chorizo Tostado which was my favorite of the event and comes with black beans, chicken chorizo, salsa, queso on a tortilla over romaine lettuce. It was a small dish really packed with some amazing flavors. Make sure not to miss out on adding a pinch of lime juice! 

There's plenty more tacos I want to try and I plan to enjoy that queso again, so I'm already looking forward to my next visit.
