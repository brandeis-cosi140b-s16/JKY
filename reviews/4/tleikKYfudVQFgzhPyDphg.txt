I don't know.... maybe I get too hungry and would eat a shoe, or maybe I am just easy to please, but I have eaten Az mexican food all my life.  I have read some of the other reviews and really believe this place deserves a better review. Lots of grumpy folks out there.

So I will say, if you are in Gilbert and you are hungry for a good plate of Mexican food I think you should try this restaurant.  It is located on Val Vista Dr. between Baseline and Guadalupe, on the east side of the road. 
I normally order cheese and onion enchiladas with rice and beans, kind of a typical combination plate, but wow is it ever good. My wife ordered a dish with two sides... she got garlic shrimp and mexican styled vegetables. She loved her dish too. The shrimp were spicy and fresh and the veggies were great.

While you are waiting for your order to come they serve chips and salsa. If you are into that you won't be disappointed. They are very good. They also go a little further than most places and serve a bowl of warm bean dip that is hard to stop eating... careful you can easily fill up before your dinner comes. When ever we stop in, I ask for their salsa that is extra spicy. It is orangish colored and has habanero peppers in it. Get ready for some great, blazing hot salsa. 

Our servers were wonderful, but if a critique were in order, I would say they were just a bit slow in food preparation, but it is usually worth every minute.

Thank you Serrano family. You guys serve wonderful food out in the Gilbert and Chandler area.
