We wanted to watch the Charger game so we wandered in the Sonrisa Grill. We were greeted by the bartender with a big smile. We told him we wanted to watch  the game and he made sure it was on the right channel. He took our drink order and brought us chips and salsa which were delicious. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla and a dinner salad. My friend ordered breakfast. We had our food within 15 minutes.  It was very good. The presentation was beautiful. The quesadilla was full of prawns which were perfectly cooked. The salad was delicious, full of several different types of lettuce and vegetables. The service was quick and very friendly. We will definitely be back soon!
