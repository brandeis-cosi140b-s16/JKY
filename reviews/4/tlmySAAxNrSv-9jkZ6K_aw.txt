I've never actually dined on property or even step foot in the place for that matter, but I've had the food numerous times and it is phenomenal. I'm craving it as I type this so it felt like a good time for a review.

Some bussers I use to work with at my old job would go pick up food from here on Friday nights and we'd have our weekly feast. I pretty much always got the same thing...two carne asada tacos and a cheese quesadilla. 

I can't remember the name of the cheese they use, but apparently it's used in real Mexican cooking and it is amazing. Seriously...it's amazing. The sour cream is amazing. It doesn't taste like any other sour cream I've ever had. The green sauce that comes with it is delicious. I don't know if it was avocado/guacamole based or green chile or what, but it's perfect.

The carne asada steak was always made to perfection on the tacos. Add some of the fresh diced onions and some of their hot sauce (which is, yes, amazing) and it is a perfect little Mexican meal.

And I don't exactly have what you would call an "iron stomach." However, I never once got any sort of upset stomach from this place. For me to say that about any restaurant, much less one that serves authentic Mexican food, is really saying something.

I would probably give it five stars but I've never actually dined at the place so I guess I can't give the establishment a complete review.
