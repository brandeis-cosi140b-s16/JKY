After reading all the reviews I was excited about trying this place.  We had a work event here the other night and I think it was the perfect spot for it.  They closed off the upstairs area and it was the perfect space for a small group to get together the bartender was awesome as well as the other waitstaff and I know my managers were very pleased with the whole experience.  They served light appetizers nothing that really made me go wow this is awesome but I really can't judge the food till I get a chance to sit down and check out the menu.  Margaritas were spot on  - looking forward to coming back soon.
