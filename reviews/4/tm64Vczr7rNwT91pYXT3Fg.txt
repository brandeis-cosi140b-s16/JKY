Walk up to the counter to order... be prepared to want everything on the menu... we got the Carne Asada taco (extra spicey for a nominal cost), the softest corn tortilla , guac, chopped lettuce, carmamelized onions, and fire-roasted tomoto salsa, and the Al Pastor, (marinated pork), chopped cabbage, etc, JUST go there.. you can eat outside (weather permitting) or stay chilled inside. Not many tables. who cares. get take out. will go again..yummmm.
