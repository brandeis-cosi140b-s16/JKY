Another Delicious Lunch! 

This time I went all out and ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga Enchilada Style (see pics) 
Wow! The Pork was so juicy, tender and flavorful it wasn't greasy at all this was such an indulgent thing to eat with all the cheese and sour cream and sauce etc. The only thing I didn't like was the guacamole because it was too spicy for me other than that it perfect to the last bite, Yes I ate it all! OINK!! 

The Hubs got his usual Stacked Enchiladas with a fried egg on top.(see pics) 
This time the enchiladas were served in a little crock which made the edge of the tortilla crisp but other than that he loved them once again. 

Rositas will be the perfect place to pick up some food for a "potluck" 
I'm going to take advantage of their catering menu since I've got a party to attend next month.

If you're ever in the area don't be scared, just go in and enjoy yourself!
