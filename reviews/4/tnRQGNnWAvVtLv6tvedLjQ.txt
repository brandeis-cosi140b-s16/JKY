Yay! Another place that provides us with free chips/salsa/hot sauce stuff when you sit down! Sweet. And that salsa is VERY good. We had to request more two times by the time we were finished chowing.

Lunch is terribly busy, but they take it in stride; the service is fast and courteous.

Every time I go there, even if I order a la carte, the food fills up the plate. It is pricey for lunch IMO, but I am kind of a cheapskate so take it with a grain of salt if you want. 

My only problem with this place is as follows: The staff does not know whether lard or animal broth is used as ingredients. So I had to gamble. I lost. The server told me to get green sauce for my burrito because the red sauce had animal broth, but the green sauce tasted like chicken. So next time I will have my burrito without chicken sauce and hopefully I won't taste it in the beans. 

Anyway, I will be back. Even the lardiest mexican restaurant has bona fide vegetarian food, and I have to have some more of those fabulous chips and salsa!
