Stopped in when they opened for lunch on a Friday as the first customers.  If you haven't read previous reviews it should known their salsa is served hot out of a crock pot.  I personally prefer cold salsa with chips fresh out of the oven, not the other way around but the wife really like them both.  I ordered the Carne Deshebrada Torta which was nice and flavorful, served with tomato/lettuce/red onion on the side with quartered red potatoes.  Wife ordered the half kale salad and enjoyed it. Dressing was quite spicy but good.
