I really like the concept of a quick drive through place like the Dutch Bros next door. 

I wasn't sure what to try when I pulled up to the window so this isn't going to be a full review on the whole menu. Only on what I had and my girlfriend had. 

I ordered a chicken taco, pork taco, 2 shrimp tacos, and the croquetas. 

The chicken taco was so-so... They forgot my salsa which would've helped but the taco itself didn't have much flavor and the chicken was slightly on the dry side. I was glad I ordered a pork taco because that one was more tasty. Im not a huge fan of pineapple but it definitely made the pork taco unique and pretty tasty. Didn't even need salsa. The croquetas were the best part!! they were nice and warm, very cheesy with a good tangy chipotle type sauce on top. 

My girlfriend's two shrimp tacos were pretty tasty and had a yummy sauce on it. She ordered it without the slaw which I think would've made it better. 

Portions were small but I wasn't too hungry so it wasn't going to kill me. I'll go again to try more things because I find myself at Dutch Bros a lot. I'll post an update on more menu items as i try them.
