At the recommendation of a co-worker, a group of us from work visited Tortas Paquime.  I'm not a Tortas aficionado, but I'm willing to try something new, especially something that I would likely not try or stop at on my own.

We park and go inside- there is a wait and it appears that the counter service is a little slow.  The place is new looking and very clean.  It is an open kitchen and you can watch the prep cooks prepare your food.  Everything looks great, it's hard to choose.  Fresh avocados abound, and we marvel as the cooks deftly remove the bright green flesh from their skins, adorning our food with these delicious fruits.

The counter help is friendly and helpful.  Our orders are taken and drinks provided.  They make REAL lemonade and fresh fruit drinks.  Bottled Mexican sodas, fresh brewed tea.  

Our party orders a variety of food- Tortas, tostadas, flautas, churros.

I ordered 2 tostadas and likely could have been fine with one.  My pork tostada is loaded sky high with beans, delicious pork, shredded lettuce, fresh avocado, and more.  My vegetarian (bean) tostada is equally delicious.  It was a crisp fresh salad on a tortilla.  My friends who ordered tortas were very pleased, and they know their tortas.

One problem we had was that they had TVs on and the volume was very high.  We asked if they could adjust and they said they could not.  It was loud enough that you had to raise your voice to talk.  Spanish speaking comedy, music, and gorgeous tourism video played.  

I would definitely bring my kids here, as I think they would enjoy the adventure. I'll definitely go again.  I also recommend this to folks who want to try something more authentic and varied, but also want familiar ingredients as an option.
