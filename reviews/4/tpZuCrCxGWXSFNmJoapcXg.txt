I moved to Scottsdale in October from Illinois where there aren't any Rubio's. I happened upon it by chance. I ordered a lobster burrito (a special) and my daughter nachos. The ingredients were really fresh. The only thing I would change next time I order the burrito is the sauce. I would ask for it on the side or not at all. There was way too much and took over the taste of the lobster. 

The location is relatively convenient. Prices are competitive to other fast food places with similar foods. I would go back.
