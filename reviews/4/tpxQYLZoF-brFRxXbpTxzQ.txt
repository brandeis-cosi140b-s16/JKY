Good, but not great food. The Caldo de Pollo could have been excellent with 20% less salt and more lemon juice. Even so... I found it satisfyingly meaty with a fair amount of veggies--a good healthy choice. My chicken taco was lightly fried and above average. My husband's Nopalitos were tasty, but I think the verde sauce would have been a better choice. He was surprised to find meat included (pork or chicken?). 
We got great service late on New Year's Day.  Maybe it wasn't too crowded. Our waitress seemed to care if we enjoyed our food. That's always nice.
