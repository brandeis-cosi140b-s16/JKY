This place is a typical whole in the wall. You would easily pass it without a second thought if you didn't know what it was. It is not to be missed though because the food is amazing. The best octopus I have ever had and, fresh tortillas with a great bean dip, and the bacon wrapped shrimp was quite a taste of its own. As other reviews have stated this place puts the music on excessively loud. The prices are very low for the quality and quantity of food. Deffinetly  a must try if your in the area.
