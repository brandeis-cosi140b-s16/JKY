A little history on this place.
If I remember right, the owner of Tia Rosa's was the original owner of Rosa's Mexican grill on Univ & Mesa Dr. He sold that (still exists there.. don't know if it tastes the same) to make a more "elegant"? mexican food experience. 
I think something was lost in the translation between the move because I don't care so much for the Tia Rosa's as much as the old school Rosa's.
The good thing is that he also made a small shop with an identical menu to the old school joint on Univ & Mesa so that I can get my favs there. 
So I'm not so much a fan of the fancy joint as I am the old style menu which sits in the same parking lot.
I love their Hot salsa. My wife loves their Green salsa.
