Last night, after deciding Four Peaks was too busy for after hike beers, we headed to Dos Gringos which was much less busy...

Not sure why it was not more busy, the layout of this place is great (as Amber W. notes half inside/half outside).    The bartenders were extremely attentive and kept filling out water glasses  without asking as well as our cheap ($2) coronas (thirsty from the hike :)).

The clientele was diverse even though right by ASU (not just college kids).

Definitely a fan!

Very impressed!
