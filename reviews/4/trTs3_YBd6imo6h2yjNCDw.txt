Well, I've gone back to Federico's several times since my last review and they seem to have improved.  Thank God that RUDE lady doesn't appear to be working there anymore, that's a plus!  Service is much better and even though the Monday-thru-Wednesday price of the tacos has gone up from $0.99 to $1.25, I still gotta have 'em, they're too good!  The flavor of their red sauce has changed for the better, and I like it more than the green sauce now.

If I could knock 'em on anything, I'd say that the restaurant needs to invest in a good salad spinner because the lettuce is way too freakin wet.  I like that fresh lettuce on my tacos, but I've had to start ordering it on the side or forgoing it altogether.  I'd prefer that they just make it right.  I absolutely can't stand opening my box to find my once-crispy tacos swimming in water and sauce, and after reading these comments about their refusal to admit their mistakes, I just might have to take another break from them if the situation doesn't improve.
