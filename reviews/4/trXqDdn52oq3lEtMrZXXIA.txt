I felt like some authentic Mexican tidbits, and Taco Los Toritos isn't far from my nest, so I decided to give them and try for el dinner on Friday.  Located in a strip mall at Twain and Swenson, this little place struck me as very clean and service was prompt and friendly.  

I ordered the burrito/taco combination which comes with rice and beans, chips, and a pile of shredded lettuce with a creamy guac dressing and a sliced tomato. 

For $7, it was a lot of food, and all of it tasted mucho yummy and was served nice 'n hot. I took mine home, and it was still steaming when I settled down to nosh.  The carnitas in my burrito was flavorful, although could have been more tender for my taste, and the machaca in my taco was a tad on the dry side.   

Still, the food here is fresh and flavorful and I will definitely visit again to try their ceviche tostada, quesadillas, and various huevos dishes.  They also offer a salsa/relish bar with various potions and jalapenos, radishes, etc.

I have posted photos of their full-color menu, which will give you a better idea of their many offerings.  Anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican fast food, will find a satisfying experience at TLT. Ole baby!
