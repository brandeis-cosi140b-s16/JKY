I have to give this a 4 star for the breakfast burrito   I just had the 'Amado' breakfast burrito and it one of the best I've had in AZ.  Made with hash browns nice and soft to mold the bacon egg and cheese into a gushy goodness! Fast. Hot and great taste if breakfast burritos are your passion as they are mine dont miss this hot spot!
Looking forward to a revisit!
