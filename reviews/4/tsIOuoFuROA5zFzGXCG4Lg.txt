Okay! Pepes tacos! I used to go to Rigos Tacos in N.town (Las Vegas) but this place is so much closer to my house.. I tried it and was hooked! The meat is like the street vendors deliciously marinated and cooked on a meat rotary!.. The size of the tacos are perfect! Not too big not too small! 2 tortillas w/perfect amount of meat to make 2 tacos out of 1. The salsa bar is the best! The green sauce is a must try. All u can have limes! (Not stingy) goes perfect w/the tacos!

Authentic tacos is all I can say!! Can't go anywhere else for them!
