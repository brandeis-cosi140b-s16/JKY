I loved can I say I loved the Tamales.  I make tamales with my family and havent been able to find tamales even close to as good as our tamales.  This place past my expectation in taste.  I loved every bite.  It was a little pricey but well worth it.  

I would have given this place five stars but the waiters weren't very friendly and they were a little slow
