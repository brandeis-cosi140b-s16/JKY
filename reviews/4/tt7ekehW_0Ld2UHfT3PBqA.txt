Grand opening is today! I'm happy there is one on this side of town. The true test will be to order chicken breasts and see if they have them. The other locations would strangely run out of breasts. They did forget my soda at the drive thru but when I went inside to tell them they gave me free flan! The drive thru went quick for a long line. Looking forward to seeing if they keep up the good job.
