Never met a Burrito I didn't like.  Especially when they are as big as your head.  At least that is how they usually make them for me.   I always get extra everything like cheese, sour cream, salsas, and lettuce. When this thing is done it looks like a "Bob Marley" Spliff, big and fat.  I do hate when they rip the tortilla and have to roll it up in a 2nd one.  No Bueno. It will still do the trick.  I am not sure why but I see lots of people getting burrito bowls. Not my preference but to each is own.
