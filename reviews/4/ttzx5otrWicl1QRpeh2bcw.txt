In town for Spring Training, a friend and I stumbled in here after checking into our nearby hotel. It is a spacious restaurant with a nice front patio. The only thing that struck me as odd was it was dead at 9pm on a Friday night. Is this just a Scottsdale thing? Do people eat at 5 and go to bed? Weird. Anyhoo, the food! We each ordered a chicken wrap sandwich. It was delicious. Chicken, creamy chipotle mayo, bacon and lettuce. Absolutely scrumptious. Another plus was their happy hour... the margaritas were $5! Awesome deal and quite tasty. Our wrap came with sweet potato fries that were perfection. I would definitely go back here again when in town.
