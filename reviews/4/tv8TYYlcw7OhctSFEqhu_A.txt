Wait a min...Ok,  here is a place for some good late night grub! 
This is your standard Mexican joint attached to a bar! Which really helps while sitting there trying to debate if Jack in the Box or Del Taco is in order after a few brews.  
For all the frugal drunks out there, they have grave-yard special! 
For $6.00 you get.... 2 pints of beer...STELLA!!! next door, @ Money Play's and a item off the limited special menu. 
But on with the real deal....the food! It's not really too bad, I've had the opportunity to try a variety of items.. But the true standout is.... the Carne Asada Torta! It's not to say the standard  variety of nachos, taco, burritos, and etc. is not good, in fact it is pretty good.  
Go back for the prices, quality of the food, & enjoy the ride!
