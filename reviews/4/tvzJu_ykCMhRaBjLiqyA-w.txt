I liked the ambiance, bar and service here better than the food.  My short rib dish with mashed cauliflower could not match what I could get at the coffee shop.  Fortunately I did sample some of my guests' dishes, and I loved the lobster tacos, carne asada plate and  cerviches.   I am not sure why this place is so pricey.  All I can say is that I'll be back more for the drinks than for the food.  Bathroom location is far off in case you need it quickly. LOL
