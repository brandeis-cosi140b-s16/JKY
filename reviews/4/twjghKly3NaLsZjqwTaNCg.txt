i'm honestly surprised how few stars this place is getting. i loved everything about it and the only thing that held me back from 5 stars was the chile relleno. let me explain.
so, chile relleno's are my favorite mexican dish, but every restaurant does them differently, as try as i might, i can't help but judge a place by this dish. i do have this say, this was probably the worst one i've had. not inedible or anything, just not at all how i like the dish to be made. BUT the quesadilla i had as well was delicious and i gobbled up the whole thing. 
i also had a yummy mango frozen margarita. the amount of different kinds of margaritas (different tequillas, different flavors, different styles) was surprising.
i also love the atmosphere. when we first walked in, my friend said how her work friends like to go there when they're having a bad day because it's so cheerful. lots of colorful mexican art all over the tables, booths, chairs, everything.
the bill was also relatively reasonable. on the high side of reasonable perhaps, but wouldn't stop me from coming back.
