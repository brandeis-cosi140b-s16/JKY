This place was amazing. I have to say that their salsa was delicious with a spicy kick and their chile relleno was some of the best I've ever had due to its light fluffy batter and delicious melted cheese. Although, I didn't like that their horchata was clearly made from powder and wasn't thoroughly mixed! I definitely will be coming back here.
