I have gone to this location probably 5 times now and this last time was by far the best service I have had ever! I ordered the Pollo Fundido and it was the bomb! I was stuffed for sure. The free chips and salsa were delicious! To top it off I ordered a sangria margarita and I was blown away but how delicious it was. To end the amazing meal we had fried ice cream that was a trip to heaven! I wish it was not so far away from my house so I could come back again. My only concern was that the food came out so fast that we did not get to eat a ton of chips and salsa or have another round of drinks!
