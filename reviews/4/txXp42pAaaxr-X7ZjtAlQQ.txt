Not sure if it was luck or the norm, but if you're hungry and want it fast, then this is the place to eat.  Hot, fresh and tasty sums it up pretty well.  Even my kid ate all his food, and that rarely happens.  The place is clean and modern looking, with a throw back to the past with their candy section.  The only thing that wasn't to my preference was the salsa, the heat was there but a little too tangy for me.   Had the red chili open face Navajo taco, and it was the bomb diggity!  Finished off the meal with their sopapilla, covered it with powdered sugar and honey, and it hit the spot.  We will be back for sure, might be the place to go on a Sunday after church.  It wasn't too busy on a Friday evening, which was good for us, but not for them.  They do have other things on the menu, so if you're not a fan of fry bread fan, try something else.  Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy!
