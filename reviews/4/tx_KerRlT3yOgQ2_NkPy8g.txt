If someone hadn't told us exactly where to find Dick's, we would have never known it was there.
We were actually in Northern AZ when some tourists mentioned Dick's hideaway.
The exterior doesn't even have a sign!
Very dimly lit, so at first, I was hesitant. Tiny, tiny eatery. maybe 3 tables, and seating along there bar (we sat at the bar).
It was in the middle of a downpour, so our wait was no more than 5 minutes, but every table was full. I can imagine on a regular weekend, the line is probably out the door...the breakfast was fresh, made right in front of you, and I watched as they sprinkled fresh blueberries on my pancakes. Soooo good.
The coffee was great and the bacon was out of this world. 
My husband has the carne adovada which he LOVED.
Charming and eclectic-definitely going back.
