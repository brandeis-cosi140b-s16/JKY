The -1 star is only for the atmosphere, bad lighting and sound system (with loud music). Their veggie tacos were tasty, with fresh tortillas and yummy salsa. Tasted like Abuelita was in the kitchen. Our server looked like he wasn't a day over 18, but seemed like he had years of experience, and very nice. Almost hope they don't spruce up the place, it would be difficult to get their delicious food!
