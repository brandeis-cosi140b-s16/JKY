Really nice, small restaurant with a great menu. Chips and salsa are nice too spicy in my opinion but pack a lot of flavor. Enchiladas de rez are delicious - the beef is so tender and the sauce is wonderful. Backyard carne asada steak is super tender - cooked a perfect medium rare, and again, so flavorful and delicious.

The rice and beans are all done nicely and compliment the main food items wonderfully. Happy hour menu is a bit different, so I am looking forward to going back and giving it a try.
