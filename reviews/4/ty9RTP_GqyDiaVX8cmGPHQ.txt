Stopped in here today because my local taco shop wasn't ready to go @ 6am this morning. I haven't been to a Roberto's in awhile, no reason why. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito, lucky me it was the special of the day.....$2.99 plus tax on Tuesdays. It was good, not great but hit the spot. Tortilla was grilled perfect and portion size was perfect, I like my bacon pretty crunchy but will ask them for extra crispy bacon next time. This Roberto's replaced the old taco place that used to be there called peppers.
