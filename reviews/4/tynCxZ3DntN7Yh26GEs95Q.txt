Ah, the work lunch: something kinda cheap, but not something that'll end up strangling my arteries on a daily basis.

Thus, sprouts Chipotle, a relatively healthy option for eating; granted, you choose your ingredients wisely.

Since this particular location is located right by UNLV, lines can get pretty long during lunch hours. They seem to handle themselves pretty well when the lunch rush comes. For Summer time, it's not too bad. During regular semester periods, lunch lines can go out the door.

Food is what you'd expect - Familiar, safe, flavors that are almost carbon copies of the thousands of other Chipotle locations out there. The only problem that I occasionally encounter is the rice, which can be a little dry at times. But hey, I'm not really eating here to impress my palette tenfold. It's simple good food that gets the job done. 

Sure, I feel like a total sheep-brain by drudging through the long lines, reciting my order by memory (chicken bowl to-go, with black beans, pico de gallo, corn salsa, a sprinkle of cheese, and lettuce). I've been here so many times, I could order this stuff with my eyes closed. 

I call this workday eating. This is something I eat as part of the mindless work week. Service is quick and food is good.  Plus, it can be healthy enough to eat on the daily. All of which, contributes to a thumbs up from me.
