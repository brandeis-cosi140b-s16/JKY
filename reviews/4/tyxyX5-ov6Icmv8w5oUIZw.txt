Visited this place for the first time today. As others have already noted, it's modeled very closely after Chipotle. This doesn't bother me though. As long as the food is good and our business is appreciated (meaning great service) they can emulate whoever they like.  

The service is quick, the staff is friendly and the burrito I ordered was great. Wheat tortilla, brown rice, fajita veggies, black beans, chicken with a small splash of sour cream and a dash of lettuce. The burrito was pretty big. I'd say it was about the size of a small Nerf football - seriously. 

However, and I'm not trying to be a wiener here, the place could be a little cleaner. A thorough sweep and scrub of the floors would go a long way.   

Floors aside, I'm going back. Next time I'm going to try the shrimp and most likely the tacos.
