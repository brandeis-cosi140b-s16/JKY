Very clean and well decorated. Food is nicely presented and you can tell that the chef cares about the quality of the food. The carnitas tacos were the best out of the several we tried. Our server, Jesse made excellent tableside guacamole. he was cute and friendly and attentive. they also serve watermelon juice with free refills. I will certainly repeat when in the mood for Mexican fare.
