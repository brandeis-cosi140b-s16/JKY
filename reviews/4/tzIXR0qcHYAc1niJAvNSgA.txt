Went to El Pollo Loco with some friends for lunch and saw they have new burritos on the menu, so I decided to try the Poblano,  it was a good size burrito, don't really need a combo meal with it cuz it's a meal in its self, it has chicken, avocado, rice, beans, corn, cilantro, onions and cheese with salsa wrapped in a gold wrapping (um kinda like Chipotle). The flavor was good and I would have it again but looking forward to trying the other new ones in their line up! Good lunch choice!
