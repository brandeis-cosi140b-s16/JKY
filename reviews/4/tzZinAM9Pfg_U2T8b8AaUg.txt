I am really glad I found this place by searching beef chimichanga on Yelp.  They have a huge selection of fast food Mexican here and everything is fairly cheap.  I had the beef chimichanga and thought it was pretty good; I mean I have had way better.  But for a fast food chain, I was pretty impressed by the quality.  The refried beans and spanish rice were right on the dot; not too salty like most places.  I have yet to try everything else on their menu.  I wish they sold beer here though; that would top it off real good!  But they do have churros!  Yaye! and they're not even stale.  They are crunch and freshly made to order!  I'll be back to try their tacos, enchiladas,and a quick chimichanga! It's real clean up in there too!  You will definitely be satisfied here! Go now if you are craving fast Mexican food!
