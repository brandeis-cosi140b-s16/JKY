Popo's has been around forever and it certainly looks the part. The neighborhood ain't great and the strip mall it's located in looks awfully scary at certain times of night, but it's definitely worth the risk.

The best days to visit are definitely Tuesdays and Saturdays, when they serve $.99 margaritas. While not the greatest margaritas in the world, you can actually taste the tequila and for $.99, you don't have much to lose. Generally, I get a chicken chimichanga or red chili burrito, both of which are solid and filling choices. If I'm heading over on a Saturday, I'll get a bowl of their red menudo, which is by far the best red menudo I've ever had. The chili has a nice kick, but overall it's a more subtle flavor than is generally found in a bowl of red. Works great as a late-night accompaniment to a margarita.

The staff are all pretty friendly and in the decade I've been going here, there hasn't really been a whole lot of employee turnover. It can be kind of a chore to get a seat on certain days, due to the customer traffic, and the parking lot is a pain in the butt, but if you're a west-sider with an appetite for Mexican food, Popo's should be in your itinerary.
