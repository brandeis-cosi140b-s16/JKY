Finally a fast food Mexican joint by my house!  This place is just like the others.  The food is just as expected so if you like it dirty Mexican style then you won't be disappointed at all. I ordered a California burrito and a kids bean and cheese burrito.  Both were excellent.  It's even open until midnight!  Late night Mexican food cravings are in my future now.
