I am a huge rubios fan and prefer them over Chipotle. However rubios prices have been getting a bit too high.  They are over priced now just by a little bit.  However their food is fantastic and I love their chips and all their fresh made salsas to pick from.  Their restaurant is always very clean and comfortable to sit inside or outside.  I love their fish tacos too.  Their beans are never refried and I love their black beans too.  I wish they had a location a little closer to where I moved to but that's ok it's still worth the drive.
