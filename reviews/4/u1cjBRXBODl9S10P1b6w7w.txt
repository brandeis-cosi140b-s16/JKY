One thing about reading overly enthusiastic Yelp reviews before going to a place is the risk of having unrealistic expectations. I think this is what happened to us at täkō.

It was a Monday night, we were able to reserve a table for three at 7 pm for 8:30 pm so the reservation was smooth. 

I love the ambiance, the kitchen being open in the front. The seating area, the menu, the service they were all stylish and nice. 

We ordered the classic guacamole, the chips were salty and delicious, the hot sauce we asked for was almost as good as the guac. Then we ordered the tacos and I went for the chorizo. It was really good and delicious but didn't really blow my mind. My friends ordered cocktails and they weren't thrilled about their drinks. Overall was a pleasant experience though, will definitely go back to try more of the starters and different guacamole. Just keep the expectations realistic.
