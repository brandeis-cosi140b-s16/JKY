Last night was the fourth time for us to go to Haciendas. This time we felt good enough to bring some good friends in from Seattle. We took advantage of their Happy Hour and sat on the patio. Good beer prices,  the only down side was they didn't have oranges for our Blue Moons.......by the second round they came through with them. Nice touch! We tried almost every app on the menus and loved them all and you can't beat the HH prices @ $4 each. The nachos were a hit with all of us and the chicken street tacos were the favorite. Love this place because the HH is great and you cant beat the prices.......and its so close we could walk if we wanted. Happy to see this new place open and hope it stays for years to come. Oh and the service was good as well. Would have given 5 stars but on the first few visits we had a hard time getting quick service on the patio. 

One of our new favorite places in Scottsdale
