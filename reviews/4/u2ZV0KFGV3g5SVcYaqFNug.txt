Late night delight here. It will clearly help if you have had at least three beers. You can find the folks that have had more than that - they are sitting on the curb eating and those are usually girls. I snagged dos carne asada or beef (can't recall) tacos to go and after I downed them there were no issues with fatty pieces of meat etc. They were not serving quesadilla's, but the tacos were 3 bucks each.  Good addition to the land of late night pizza.
