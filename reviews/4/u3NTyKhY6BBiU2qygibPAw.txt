This was a tough one.  I'd give the food four or maybe even five stars, but the loud music makes it a horrible experience.

They make great food, or at least they used to, but their stupid, loud DJ is killing their business.  Because of the loud music, we despise eating there, no matter how great the food is.  Too bad. Otherwise the Mrs. and I would probably eat there every week -- Or we would if the food is still as good as it was the last time we went, which was was last spring.  As it is, we just won't go there anymore  We went a couple times last spring, but we won't be back.

Ambience is kind of like a Wendy's, but with really loud music.

Really bad management decision.  They had good food and could have been a success, but ruined their business with that loud DJ.  Must be an investor's nephew or something.

UPDATE MAY 2015: 

I went again last week.  The food was as good as ever.  The al pastor tacos are amazing.  The atmosphere is still awful.  But the food is amazing.  Changing review to four stars.  Four stars is generous considering how awful the atmosphere is, but the food, the food . . . it's so GOOD!
