I tried Verde on a Tuesday night after reading a review in the paper. Chef recommends! I ordered the green chile pork which I was advised was the spiciest dish on the menu. I love spicy food but don't let that fool you. Just the right amount of heat. Very reasonably priced at about $8 it was served with two homemade tortillas and rice and beans. Perfect size portion too. Hopefully in the next month or so they'll have their liquor license to serve beer. Casual dining...order at the counter and then grab and open table. Plenty of on street parking available, though you have to plug the meter until 8 pm during the week.
