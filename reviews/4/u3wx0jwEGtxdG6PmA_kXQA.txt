Love their chips and salsa here.  And they keep bringing you more if you run out.

Seems like a Mom & Pops place.  So the flavor is different compared to the big chains.  Love their food here, and feel relieved that I have the endorsement from my fellow Mexican friends.  Come early.  The parking is not very large, unless you wanna park near the self-serve carwash. And not a lot of seating capacity.

So thank you, Dora Maria.  You have my patronage.
