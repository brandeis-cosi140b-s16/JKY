Have had their carne asada plate, their quesadillas, camarones a la diabla & their breaded shrimp & I have to say its probably one of the best Mexican seafood restaurants in town(not to mention I can walk there from where I live). It's also across the street from Freedom Park so you can always take a walk after you're done eating.
