When I think street tacos, I think Moreno's! I've tried several places, but I always come back to my first love. 

The chicken is the best, all though the carne asada is really good as well. Meat Is never dry, and always tastes fresh. I also love that they have a little bar where you can load up on limes, guacamole and salsa's. And they have whole Jalapeno's. the best!
