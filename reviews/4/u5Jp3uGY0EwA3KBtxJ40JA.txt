The food is pretty good here and the prices are very reasonable.  It's my boyfriends favorite new Mexican spot.  Me, I'm a burrito girl and they have several different types on the menu but not exactly what I was looking so they have always made special accommodations for me and that's worth coming for.  The cheese sauce on my burrito makes it out of this world but their salsa is rather bland and I love cilantro in mine.  I always ask for pico and they happily bring it so I can add to my salsa for extra flavor.  The staff is very cheerful and personable.
