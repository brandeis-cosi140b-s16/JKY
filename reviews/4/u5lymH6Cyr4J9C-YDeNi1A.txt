I have been here several times, and never disappointed.

I like to judge a taco shop by their tacos, I am funny that way!

First time I got 3 tacos...
1 Fish Taco -Delicious! and huge! two fish tacos, and I could be done!
1 Lengua Taco -If you don't know what that is, you might not want to order. OK it is beef tongue.  I love them, when done right! At Apache it was tender and flavorful!
1 Carnitas Taco - Perfect classic!

The ONLY thing that could have made the tacos better would be homemade tortillas.
And yes, I know it is a lot of work! (But one of the things I adore about Pinches Tacos in container park!) So I can hope!

I have also ordered Carnitas Torta - Also really amazing! tender meat, super fresh bread. 

Great little place! Happy to have it in the hood!
