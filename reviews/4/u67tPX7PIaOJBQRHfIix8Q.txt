My family and I LOVE Baja Fresh! We went to this one for the first time, and it was the cleanest BF I've ever been to. The service was also excellent, the girl was smiling when she brought our food to our table. Yes, I didn't have to go get it. =-) We were very happy.
The only thing I have to add though, is that we thought the salsa tasted much different than we were used to at other locations. Very different. The molcajete (sp?) tasted bland and not at all like what we were used to.
