Winner, winner chicken dinner! I saw this place featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I decided to give it a shot. A huge plus is that they let you sample their food. So you basically get to taste the whole menu before you even order, which was fantastic! They make you feel like a valued customer. And they'll help you order and explain everything if you're a newbie.

My favorites were the jade red chicken and the jerk chicken. I could eat the jade red chicken all day, yeah it's that good! It has the right amount of sweet and sour without just being drenched in some indescribable sauce. The jerk chicken was good but it was too peppery like I was forewarned. When I ate it later it was perfect. 

It is a dive so don't expect anything fancy but they have great food to make up for it. Don't miss out your taste buds are waiting!
