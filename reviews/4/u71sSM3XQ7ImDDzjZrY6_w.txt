Hands down the BEST chips and salsa in Arizona. The flour chips and the salsa are soooooo good. Seriously - SO good. Its fresh and chunky and to die for it. Its almost worth going JUST for the chips and salsa and a margarita. I'm shocked that Aunt Chilads only has three stars - its one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Valley for many reasons. 

If you want an ambiance that makes you feel like you're in Mexico - this is the spot for you. Sit outside and you're surrounded by a cute bar, plenty of seating, music and lush greenery that just makes you feel like you're in a Mexican Cantina. I think they even had bocce ball. The margaritas are great and the food is good too. No complaints here.
