My husband and I went here for dinner last night - it was a must since the chef came from House of Tricks.
Started off with the pork belly appetizer - the celestial nugget melted in my mouth - salty, sweet and tangy from the vinegary potatoes that lay underneath.
Next we had the sweet potato croquettes - crunchy on the outside - moist on the inside. I really liked the citrus infused sauce drizzled on top.
The gypsy salad with slices of seared halloumi cheese on top was to die for - it also had blue cheese mixed throughout which didn't hurt.
Husband got the ribs - tender with a chili infused rub and let's not forget, the cheese/ale soup with popcorn topping. Brilliant concept and healthy ( I tell myself) because it contained sliced apples.
The star of the show, however, was the bread pudding - maple, bacon, bourbon, apples ............oh, my.
I will be back.
