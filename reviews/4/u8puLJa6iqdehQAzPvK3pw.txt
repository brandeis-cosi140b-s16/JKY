This place has great food - and a pretty impressive selection of salsas.  I'll warn you though - if you're a tourist like me, you'll end up paying a $30-40 surcharge on your meal if you have to take a cab there.  It's not very close to the strip so it may be more worth it for you to go somewhere closer if you just want a Mexican fix... This place came highly recommended by a friend who's from Vegas so I thought it would be worth venturing out - but for the price of the cab we probably could have rented a car for a day. 

Anyway, great food, friendly staff and for the vegetarians out there (like me), they do have some options for you....
