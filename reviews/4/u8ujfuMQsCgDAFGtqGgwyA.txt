HUSSONG'S CANTINA
This place is home to some of the largest burritos known to man. At a whopping $15 per burrito, it sure comes packing! We ordered our burrito with steak, chicken, and carnitas, and topped it off with red/spicy and green sauce. In addition, we ordered a large carnitas-topped nachos supreme for half-off, due to Happy Hour. For our first meal in Las Vegas, it was enough for the two of us, as each entree was gargantuan! Not a bad start to Vegas!
