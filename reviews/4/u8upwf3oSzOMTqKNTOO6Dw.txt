Yum, yum...and yum. I have been meaning to write a review for a while and forget each time I go. Pretty much nothing but good things to say. The food is cooked fresh and right in front of you. I usually order a torta, but my friend and I opted to split a torta and quesadilla last time...delish! Lots of cheese and lots of carne. Went there the other week for a quesadilla and fries w/ cheese. Filled up on the huge portion of fries and only had a bite or 2 of the quesadilla. Brought home the leftovers for dinner, only to find out at dinner that my fianc√© ate the ENTIRE thing, and NEVER eats anything with beef. I guess that says it right there. Again...yum.
