I have been coming here for about three years now since it is right next to the movie theater. I have eaten there twice and each time I was pleased with the meal. I actually don't really remember what I had there since it's been a while but I know I had no complaints. When I come here it is mainly for the mojitos. I enjoy them tremendously, however I am not some mojito connoisseur or snob.... they are just delicious, refreshing drinks and this place offered the best and reasonably priced. The staff is nice and it isn't unheard of to get a free drink or two if you're ordering drinks and having a good time. I will continue to frequent Havana Grill.
