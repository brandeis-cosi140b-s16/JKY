UPDATE Oct. 2013: I went there again this weekend and it was just like the good old days.  The service was great and the food was absolutely the best food I have ever eaten there.  I got the Nachos with chicken and beef and the flavors of both are amongst some of the best flavored meats I have had anywhere.  They have also remodeled in the past few months and it looks really great.  They added new booths that look nice and are comfortable.


This used to be my favorite mexican restaurant.  However, over the last few years it has really been a disappointment.  My most recent visit a week ago was horrible.  They got both orders at my table wrong.  I sent mine back and it came back wrong a second time.  I was so annoyed I ended up just picking it apart and eating the chicken.  My friends just ate hers the way it came. The server offered no apology and I just couldn't wait to pay the check and leave.
