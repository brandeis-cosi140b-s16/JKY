I tend to like more traditional Mexican food and the first couple times I went here I wasn't that impressed, but I have so many friends that love Cafe Rio I gave it one more chance.  It was that day that I discovered the Pork Barbacoa, and when I did the clouds parted as rays of sunshine poured down on me while harps lightly played.  Really, it's THAT GOOD!  Since then I've had the pork in a salad, in a burrito, and my favorite, in the enchiladas.  As far as the other meats, they're good but not outstanding, and the service is just average, nothing stellar but not bad either.  It also can get very crowded, but the pork is worth it all!
