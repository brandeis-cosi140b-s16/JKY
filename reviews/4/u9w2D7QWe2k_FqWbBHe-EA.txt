Well, I have learned a basic rule about Mexican restaurants, if it's crowded its good (Or it's happy hour). I got nervous right off the bat, I chose this place the parking lot was almost empty and it was about 12:30 or right in the middle of what should be the lunch rush. We were seated right away in a nearly empty restaurant. From there I can say good chips though they say award winning chips and salsa, but the salsa tasted like El Paso out of the jar. The rest of the meal was outstanding. I had the Green Chili con Carne burrito enchilada style lunch special with green chili sauce on top. It was an amazing taste sensation. The beef was not shredded but more like tender stew meat seasoned to perfection and the beans and rice were pretty good too. My wife had the shredded beef taco lunch combo, She said it was good but about average for her. She really liked the chips but was not impressed with the salsa either.  I liked the novelty of the shirts they sell there, but in my circles I couldn't think of a time it would be right to wear it they say "Excuse me, It's the frijoles"
