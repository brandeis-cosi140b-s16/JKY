Street tacos!!! My favorite thing of all time and they are amazing here!!! The corn quesadilla is unique and delicious. The fish tacos, pastor tacos and asada tacos were nothing short of amazing. Also, it's cheap, $2.25 for fish and $1.50 for asada and pastor. The service was very friendly. This place will be in my taco shop repertoire for sure .
