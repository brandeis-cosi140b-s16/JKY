Took friends that were passing through town and wanted something quick and fresh for dinner and we all loved it! The service was outstanding and the food was great! Prices are affordable and the concept of the place is well executed. It relates to other places like Chipotle and Qdoba but has a way larger menu and takes longer to get your food. It's more of a On the Border menu. We were really impressed and will be back again! Thanks for a quick, healthy, cheap and fresh dinner!
