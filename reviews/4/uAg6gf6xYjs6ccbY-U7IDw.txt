The service here often leaves something to be desired, and if you do take out from ANY of the Serrano's locations, you HAVE to check your order before you leave (different locations have screwed up our to-go orders twice now), but we've found the food to be consistently good.  I love the salsa and the fajitas camerones (shrimp fajitas).  They use Anaheim chiles in their fajitas instead of bell peppers -yum!
