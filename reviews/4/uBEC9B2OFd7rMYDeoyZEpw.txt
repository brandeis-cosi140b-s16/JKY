I give the pupusas revueltas 5 stars but the restaurants decor has got. to. go. I was also confused at what the name of this place was because the have like 3 different names on the menu. 

This is a hole in the wall place so naturally I wouldn't expect the decor to be lavish but this place sure could use some decluttering. 

The food, on the otherhand, was DELICIOUS!!!
