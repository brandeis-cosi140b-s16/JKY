I was in this area starving and found this place on Yelp. The place and its complex look really sketchy but if you can ignore that, you're in for a big surprise! I ordered the 5-taco plate with half beef and half pork. It was so delicious I ate all 5!!! Their salsa bar has hot and mild salsas, all very fresh even near closing time. 

This place is very far from me but if you're nearby, come here for some delicious tacos!
