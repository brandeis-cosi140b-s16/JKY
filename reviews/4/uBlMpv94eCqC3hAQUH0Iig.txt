Finding reliable, consistent Mexican cuisine is not easy to do, but we've found Azteca to be completely consistent across all meals and all locations.

Most recently, we ate at the location on Independence. We've tried everything from the chicken tortilla soup (huge portion and very delicious) to the taco salad (meh, it's a taco salad). What we generally order, however, is the pork carnitas. Always very tasty and not over cooked.

Atmosphere is typical of Mexican restaurants in the area, but we have found the consistency to be the key. And, if you're into drinks, they seem to have a ton of mixed adult beverages that practically glow in the dark. The margaritas are very good, so we hear.
