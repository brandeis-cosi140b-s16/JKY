Very happy to have this close to home. We went Friday night had great service and great food. Chile Colorado is the best I have had. They give you lots of food at a decent price and everything we had at table was very good to excellent. 

Went back for lunch Sunday and food was just as good at a decent price. 

If you like Mexican food come here. 

Also we noticed how nice the interior was decorated. Place looked good and was clean and open.
