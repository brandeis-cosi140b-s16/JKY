Super size nachos for family-groups are huge!  My husband loves the burritos and carnitas. The chips & salsa are great. Very surprised at how accommodating the seating arrangements are for large groups. Entire staff was spot on. Quick, clean, great quality and didn't miss a beat. Only complain was noise factor and parking...
