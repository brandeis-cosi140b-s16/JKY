The carne asada burrito has a perfect mix of carne asada, delicious beans, onions and cilantro.  I usually get one red salsa to add a bit to a couple of bites but the flavor of the burrito by itself is very tastey. The burrito is not huge, about 2/3's the size of a chipotle or filibertos burrito but it is filling. 

The Shrimp burrito is also very delicious. Same size as the carne asada burrito. No beans.

Definitely worth a visit.
