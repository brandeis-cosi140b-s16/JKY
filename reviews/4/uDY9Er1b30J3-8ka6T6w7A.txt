After enjoying homemade Tortilla Chips with a very nice complimentary mild Bean Dip, salsa, and very good smooth and fresh stone-ground Guac prepared tableside, a sweet Pork Burrito prepared Ranchero style at no extra charge was large, cheesy, and delicious.  Flour tortillas were filled with warm Refritos, accompanied by small grain Fried Rice.  And, by the time I finished my burrito, an a la carte Shredded Beef Taco filled with fixings in a hard and wavy Corn Tortilla was unneeded but very good.  

Except for having to ask for a water refill once, service was very good.  And, seating was comfortable in a casual setting.
