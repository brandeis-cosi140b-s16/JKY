I was staying inside Ballys and realized I needed some food before going out to endure a night of drinking. I checked out the menu at the entrance and it looked like a pretty good deal. Grabbed a seat at the bar as it was just me and they had some MLP playoff games going so it was a no brainer. Josh was working behind the bar and he gave me tips on what I should select from the menu. I got the Mahi tacos (an order of 3 for $11) which were a delight as he said it would be. Nice flavor and a slight kick of spice going on with it...not bad. I was hoping I could mix and match with the 3 for $11 deal, but unfortunately I was told you could only get one flavor with the deal. 
Since I was in a Mexican establishment, it was only right to partake in some tequila. It was hard for me not to as I was sitting right in front of a shelf that is fully dedicated to all different types of tequila. I went with the Don Julio Silver for smooth purposes. 

God spot to grab a quick bite and get on with a night of awesomeness.
