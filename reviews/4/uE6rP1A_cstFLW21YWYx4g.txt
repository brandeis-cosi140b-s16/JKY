Kirill's an awesome bartender and his drinks are amazing. Also, their Cevice is the thing to order we couldn't get enough of it. Their happy hour Margaritas and Bloody Maries are the way to go for sure.  Very good Bloody Maries. The restaurant staff, on the other hand, are rude and pushy (especially to make you pay your bill the second you get your food). There's no Happy Hour during Superbowl at the restaurant and bar, they cancelled it. The way we were treated by the restaurant staff is why they get 4 stars, the bartender being great and the good food saving them from 3.
