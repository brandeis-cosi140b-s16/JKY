Great experience.  I ordered mini tamales for a party with a short (2 day) turn around.  The service was perfect and the tamales were delicious.  $12/dozen for the minis.  I picked them up hot.  They stayed hot for about 2 hours (I wrapped the tray in towels to keep before serving.) Everyone loved them.  The masa was had a nice corn taste, and did not have lard so my vegetarian guests were able to eat them.   The mini tamales are a great size for a party as you can eat a couple and try different versions.  

Thanks, Tamale Store!
