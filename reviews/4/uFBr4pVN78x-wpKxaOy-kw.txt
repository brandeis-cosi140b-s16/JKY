Ok, this is a little premature from me, but I know that Brandon is waiting for this review. I made the mistake of mentioning Yelp when I sat down, so he was on top of his game. It reminded me of an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun...

Anyway, I say this is premature because, although I have been to Blanco twice now, I have only had drinks and apps, and I don't feel I know enough to write a full review.

That being said, Brandon rocks. The Blood Orange marg that he suggested was tasty. A second one may have knocked me on my butt, but the alcohol was well hidden. I ordered the guacamole and is was creamy and chunky and delicious (also full of monounsaturated fats- hooray!). My friend ordered the Three Cheese Quesadilla with chicken. She liked that too.

I would like to go back for more margaritas and maybe an order of the fish tacos. And the flan.

Shout out to Brandon.
