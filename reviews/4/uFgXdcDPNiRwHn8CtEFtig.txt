After a late night out on Halloween Eve, hubby and I were craving some tasty, cheesy Mexican goodness, and we luckily found this new Filiberto's. 

My standby is the shredded chicken burrito, and it was actually a bit dry at this location (usually it's very "saucy" and delicious). But thank goodness for their hot sauce. It's not like the typical fast food Mexican restaurant hot sauces - it's actually got FLAVOR. I go through like 4-5 of the little cups of it. That will make even the driest burrito "saucy" and it certainly did the trick that night. Yum. 

I'll be back I'm sure.
