This place is awesome! Its in the middle of no where but they have fresh, amazing tortillas and great carne asada. Love the fresh salsa bar and the toppings they offer. The only downside is that unless you speak Spanish, the staff doesn't really acknowledge you.
Good thing once my bf noticed this he started speaking in Spanish and they perked right up. ;)
