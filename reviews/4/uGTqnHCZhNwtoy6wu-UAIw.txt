Poli is a little different than some of the other ~bertos places, with a bit of variety in the menu and a bunch of quality in the food.
The place is clean and the booths are quite cushy and comfortable.
It was good, but fuhDANGah i can't be loose enough to give 'em more than a 4.0

The Carnitas taco was great.  (that's pork for the gringos and recent transplants) It came in full size, not tiny, soft corn tortillas, with roasted pork chunks covered in a drizzle of "guac-like sauce / saucy guac" and some pico de gallo.  The pork was standout - tasty and tender and not dry at all.

The Pollo (chicken, Guero!) taco was good, as well, but not the best I've had.  Shredded chicken was moist, sure, but this stuff is always precooked and waiting in a watery broth to be tong'd out into a waiting shell, so not too hard to be decent.  Poli's was average to good in the meat, generous with lettuce and cheese, but the hard corn shell was not the right consistency and crumbled into my hand as i ate.

There was a Carne Asade Nacho (grilled meat and chips, Pan Blanco!) plate that was about a foot in diameter and about a third as high.  It looked impressive, but the meaty bit I sampled had a wierd taste -- good at first, but then almost 'fishy' later.  Who knows. 8^ |

NQI Napkin Quality Index : poor, not the worst i've encountered, but only a 2 star napkin experience, as best.

I will be making more return visits, but this does not earn the title of the best hole in the wall mexican joint from me.  (A title a Somethingberto's near you is wishing hard that they had!)
