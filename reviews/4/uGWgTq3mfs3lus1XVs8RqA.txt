As chains go, I have to give this location a solid 4 stars. They'll get the other star if/when they finally get their liquor license! (When i visited last year they still didn't have it!) For 4 years, I had been coming here and still no liquor license...what gives?! It's not like there aren't bars or other establishments nearby that don't serve this stuff already (FF, C&A, Stephano's, Cheers next to Roberto's etc...). Oh, Chipotle, you McDonald-owned chain....you taunt me with that "pending" sign to no avail. So, not one cerveza with my vegetarian burrito while i was there. I never once was able to partake of a nice Pacifico while chowing down on those huge-ass burritos of yours.

That's okay, i forgive you. Deep down, I know you were just being a good friend. Feeding me burritos big enough to feed me twice..or split with another friend. And when I got tired of burritos, you gave me tacos, quesadillas all with chips and salsa if I wanted (for a price). And you were good for UNLV types - you gave them a good discount too. I saw you many times on campus giving out free samples at UNLV events. Never mind that I wasn't a student there. You never cared. It's b/c you really liked me and I was your BFF, huh?

Yeah, I like you too, Chipotle.
