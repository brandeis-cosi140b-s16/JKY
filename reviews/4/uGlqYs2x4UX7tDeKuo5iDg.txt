This is the nicest, most courteous, most efficient Taco Bell I have ever encountered. The food even tastes better, as if the fryer is adjusted a little more precisely and the line made a tad more effort to put things together just right.

If I give it five stars, unwary readers will expect that the menu has somehow changed to be authentic, and of course, Taco Bell food does not aspire to authenticity in any way. Taco Bell aspires to ranch dip with taquitos, The difference is that when it's done badly, it's depressing; and when it's done well, it has a certain cheerful vulgarity that's easy on the wallet.
