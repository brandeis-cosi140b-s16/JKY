We were in town for the weekend, and I had a hankering for Mexican food, so I whipped out my handy dandy cell phone and utilized the Yelp app to locate the closest place to fulfill my hunger. This place was close by and the menu looked appealing.

My husband ran out and grabbed us take-out to eat back in our hotel room. I had the chicken enchiladas verde, and he had some sort of burrito.  My enchiladas were tasty and were gone in no time.

Very good food and fulfilled my craving.
