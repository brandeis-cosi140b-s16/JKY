Im not gonna lie, I freakin love this place. Lolz Their chip and salsas is amazing, andddd rhey have different kind of salsas for you to choose as well.

My vegetarian chimhunga was perfect. The texture to it was heaven in my mouth. But they slapped on wayyyy too much sour cream.  Orher than that, I like this place.
