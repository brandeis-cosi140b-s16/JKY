Stopped here on the way to visit my Dad in Utah, and was pleasantly surprised by how good this place was. The chips were fresh, and the salsa was on the spicy side. I got the lunch special chili colorado with fresh-made corn tortillas, and it was really tasty, as well as reasonably priced. Since this is way out in the boonies, I doubt the typical Vegas weekend warrior would ever find their way into this place (although who knows, it is Vegas after all), I'd recommend it if you happen to be passing through on I-15 and want something better than your typical Chevy's/Mexican chain.
