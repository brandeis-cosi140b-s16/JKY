The most bomb ass rolled tacos and guacamole on the I-10 corridor...my first stop when I'm back in town on my monthly trips to Goodyear to visit family and friends. 

As a matter of fact, guess where my current profile pic was taken...what's that I'm stuffing into my fat face? 

I say hello to Filiberto's before my own family...how sad. =(
