The food tasted really fresh and flavorful. I liked the chips and salsa a lot too! The iced tea was really weak/watery, but I admit I'm picky with iced tea. I had the carne asada tacos which came with the carne asada inside one corn torilla. I wish it was the double tortilla style like at other places because they ripped open when picked up. The service was great as well!

Only issue I had was the slightly oddly worded menu section that said, "Para los Gringos" which basically means, "For the White People" or you could take it as  simply "For the Americans/Non-Hispanics or Latinos" and it lists things such as burgers and fries/stereotypical food from the United States, etc. Just a heads up if that bothers you. A decent little sit-down Mexican restaurant overall though.
