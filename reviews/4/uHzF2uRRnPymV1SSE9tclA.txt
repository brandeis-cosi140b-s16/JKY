We bought a groupon for this restaurant believing it to be for Barrio Cafe.  Needless to say, when the time came to use the groupon, we were disappointed to realize our mistake. Even more so when I looked the restaurant up on yelp and read all the numerous negative reviews and complaints. But the money had already been spent and a week ago we found ourselves in the area. So we stopped in.

Well, I'm happy to say that for once, Yelp was wrong. My expectations were low and when we first stepped through the doors, there was no hostess at the stand. I had enough time to think "Yup, here we go" when the hostess walked over from the main room to politely seat us.  She sat us and Amanda, our server, came over almost immediately to greet us and take our drink orders which were promptly served a few minutes later. We took our time to order and the food, once delivered in a timely fashion, was tasty and flavorful.  Everyone was polite including the busboy who helped keep our table clean and our drinks full.

Of course, the place isn't perfect. The audio from the TV was far too loud (a football game with commercials competed with our conversation). The prices were a bit steep too.  I also think it's ridiculous when a Mexican restaurant wants to charge for chips and salsa.  Even Baja Fresh gives them for free.

I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here again but if I found myself in the area, I would definitely consider stopping in.
