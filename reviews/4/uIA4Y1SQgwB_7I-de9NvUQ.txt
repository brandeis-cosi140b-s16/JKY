i don't really crave mexican food, but sweet chihuahua their tacos are frickin good! i thought $2 a taco was a bit high, but they were stuffed, and worth it.   why not 5 stars? every Robertos i've ever gone into, smells like floor cleaner.......wth? you know, that bleachy smell. so i drive thru. or get to go. ole
