Sometimes I get really drunk and want the Filiberto's Super Nachos.  Filly B's Super Nachos consist of tortilla chips with some salsa, cheese, beans and then A SHIT LOAD, like, seriously, at least three full cups, more than you'll ever eat, of low quality, delicious beef.  Most times I've eaten them I am black out drunk and did something more stupid than eating Filiberto's Super Nachos, like punching my boyfriend in the face.  These nachos are literally the only reason I do those two or seven extra shots sometimes.  When I leave Phoenix, Filiberto's Super Nachos (I order them with no sour cream so they're totally healthy) are going to be in the top three things I miss; right after racist sheriffs and your mom.
