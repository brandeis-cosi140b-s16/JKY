Go to Mexico, Baja Coast, even further south - and these are the types of Taquerias you will find.  Order at the counter, enjoy chips and salsa while you wait, then enjoy street tacos the likes of which you think you can only get south of the border.

(The building is yellow on the outside, still bearing its former name - so don't be confused.)

The price of a  street tacos here? $1.25.  For that price, try all of them, especially the Al Pastor.  This type of taco is unique in its preparation.  Typically pork meat, it is marinated - giving the meat an orange color - and then roasted on a spit.  Similar to the way gyro meat is carved off a spit.  The result is an incredibly flavorful meat taco.  They add cilantro and a little pico de gallo, a squirt of lime and a dash of picante sauce, and it's pure heaven.

On Tuesdays its Taco Tuesday - $.99, with coke only $1.25.

If you are not a taco fan, the menu features Tortas ($3.75-4.25), burritos enchilada style ($4.50), Beam burritos ($2.50) Carnitas burritos ($3.75), Fried fish ($12), Shrimp Cocktail ($9.95), Camarones Ahogados (shrimp $9.95), Tamales combo ($5.95), and Huevos con chorizo ($4.95).

Live music on weekends, as Taqueria has a separate bar area for dancing the night away.
