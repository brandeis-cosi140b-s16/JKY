We ate at this place a few times during their buy one get one free promotion.  This place is just like Costa Vida down the street. 

I am surprised at the lack of enthusiasm from the staff here. I see them slowly move around while tidying up the restaurant and even texting.  It reminded me of teenagers workers from Six Flags. 

The food is pretty good and worth a shot. What I really appreciate is that they offer free quesadillas for kids under 6. When you try one of these you can really taste the freshness of the tortillas.
