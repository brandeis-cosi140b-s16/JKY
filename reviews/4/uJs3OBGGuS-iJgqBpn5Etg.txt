This place is a quick, simple and easy place for lunch or dinner. It isn't comparable to a true Mexican sit down restaurant, as it's just a quick place to have a taco, burrito, or salad so you have to go in with those expectations. The food is pretty good for the type of place it is. I love the queso dip and chips, and typically get a chicken burrito which is always ridiculously big and full of great toppings. The employees are always very friendly also, which makes the place even more enjoyable.
