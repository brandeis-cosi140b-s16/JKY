I havent been to this place in years, but when I lived down there we used to go all the time. I remember it being the best mexican food I'd ever had. The best part was you got two kinds of salsa, one that was mild, and one that was super hot. They had really good tamales, and taco salad. I hope it is still just as good. If I ever get  back to Wickenburg that will be one of my first stops.
