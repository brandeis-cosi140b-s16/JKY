Quite surprised there are no reviews of this Chipotle yet.  Its been open for a month or two.  My lovely Wifey and I stopped in on the way back from Cali on Monday at around 8.  

It was my first time inside and I was a little surprised that it is not quite the "standard" Chipotle set up.  There is no wall dividing where the line backs up with the rest of the restaurant.  There wasn't much of a line when I was there but imagine it could get annoying if you were at one of the tables in the areas with someone literally standing right next to you while you are eating.  On top of this the tables "next to the line" are high tops, so I imagine the folks in line are that much more in your space.

When I went they were out of barbacoa so that was a bummer.  Other than that its your standard Chipotle.
