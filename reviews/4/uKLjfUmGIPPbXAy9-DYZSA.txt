This place has grown to be my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley. It is close to my house, the prices are good, service is always friendly, and the food is tasty. My favorite is their fajita salad. I know, a salad at a Mexican restaurant. But I just love them! I always eat my husbands side of rice and beans on his plate, and stuff myself on the chips beforehand, but I'm not the only one, right? Anyway, they've been around a long time, so Valle Luna is tried and true. Try it out.
