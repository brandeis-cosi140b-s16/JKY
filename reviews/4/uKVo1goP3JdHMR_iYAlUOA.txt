I have to give Kudos to the Chile Relleano and the Cabo Grand Margaritas.....so good...just order those 2 things and you'll probably come back.  I have had their tuna...it's okay...the mac n' cheese chicken thing is pretty awesome and usually don't get too many apps so I can't comment.....next time I want to hit up the Achiote stuffed pork tenderloin...and if any yelper has had them and wants to send me their thoughts I'm open.  I love Z-tejas because it's really pretty solid and margaritas are stiff
