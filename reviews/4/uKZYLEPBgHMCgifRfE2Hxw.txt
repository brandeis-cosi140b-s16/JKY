I lived in New Mexico for a few years, so I was happy to hear about this place. I love Hatch green chilli and that is the type of chillis they use. They serve an awesome chip/salsa platter for free!!!! The bean dip rocks. The wait staff was very nice and on top of things.  Don't forget to order a rita.
