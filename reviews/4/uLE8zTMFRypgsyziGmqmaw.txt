I was pleasantly surprised by the food at the cantina. I read reviews and they made it seem just average but since I had a coupon and it was so close to our hotel we decided to check it out. The food was actually really good. They gave 2 dips with the ginormous basket of chips. One dip was a cheese and bean dip and they had really good salsa. Actually we got 2 kinds of salsa cause we asked if they had any spicy salsa and they brought us a bowl that as well and it was really good. There were 6 of us eating together and we all ordered different meals and nobody was dissatisfied. The beans and rice were good but not great but all of the main dishes were actually very good. The wait staff was pretty inconsistent. The girl who got our drinks was on top of her game but the waiter was a little slow but not slow enough to effect the rating. Oh and the prices were really low. I was surprised cause I read a few complaints about them raising their prices here on yelp. I must say if they were cheaper before then they must have been extremely cheap cause this restaurant was fairly inexpensive.
