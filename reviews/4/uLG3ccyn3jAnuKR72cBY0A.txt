Very nice place and deserves more stars that what it currently has. The place gets 4 stars because it's layout is a little confusing, and the shakes are just blended gelato. I thought they'd be a bit more adult and add toppings and booze. No such luck though. Cuban sandwich was great. 

Give it a shot. The food is really good and at a great price.
