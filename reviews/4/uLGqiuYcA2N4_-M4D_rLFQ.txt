We've eaten here once or twice before and this time didn't disappoint. Despite being noon on Sunday, there wasn't a huge football crowd and we were seated right away. The salsa here is delicious and fresh. I ordered the fish tacos which were excellent - fresh and light. One thing I appreciate about Manuel's: when you ask for a side of something, you get plenty. My husband ordered a side of sour cream and got almost a cup's worth and I got three nicely-sized slices of lime with my tacos. They don't scrimp!
