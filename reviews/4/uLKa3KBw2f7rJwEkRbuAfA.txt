We typically dine here a few times a month and after today I know why, when you wake up craving some greasy Mexican food after a night of drinking some beers. This place is the first that pops into my mind and is the best to indulge that craving for some greasy, yummy, so not good for you Mexican food. 

My youngest son finally tried something new today and went with the rolled tacos with no guacamole. The tacos were generously filled with shredded meat like I make at home. Fried to perfection and loaded with melted dripping greasy cheese.  

My oldest son and I had the ham breakfast burritos and although I am usually a fan of this, it came out very runny with grease and water from the pico de gallo. The pico de gallo was unevenly cut, my 8 year old knows how to dice better than that. The onions tasted like they were days old and just a second thought. Who knows maybe the pico was a few days old. I make plenty of pico and always use the freshest of ingredients but always make sure I never have left overs because it is always best made the same day. 

Husband ate the fish taco as he always does and no complaints as usual except for the pico de gallo tasting like it was old. He always gets it without tartar sauce but he loves the freshness and the crisp ones of the fish mixed with the cabbage and about 2 small cups of red sauce. 

Spanish rice was ok today. They used a little too much oil and the rice was soggy and very oily. 

All in all might not have been the best meal but I know that I will continue to return. The customer service is always friendly and the restaurant is always clean.
