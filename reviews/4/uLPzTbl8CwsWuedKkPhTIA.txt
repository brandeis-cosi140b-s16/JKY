Came here on a Tuesday night. Margarita was stong, redeemed my coupon for guacamole and it was good.  They have daily specials and today happened to be the carnade abdola it was so tender and spiced just right! Atmosphere casual but a little nicer then most Mexican restaurant. I would come here again
