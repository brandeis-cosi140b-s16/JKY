Second time here last night and they didn't disappoint. Very colorful local place and there always seems to be something interesting happening here. Last time it was an impromptu Mexican duo singing and playing guitar. Last night it was a beautiful pair of horses outside that a couple rode in on. As for the food, I'm a fan of the bistec chipotle although you must be careful as it's one of the hotter Mexican dishes I've ever had. The shrimp and octupus cocktail comes highly recommended as well. Good prices, neighborhood atmosphere and pleasant service make this definitely above the average place in town.
