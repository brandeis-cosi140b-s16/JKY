First off, I like the Strat and I like little hole-in-the wall kind of places that surprise me with good food.  If you prefer higher end accomodations or dining, you may well disagree with me.  

We found El Nopal while wandering the upper mall level on a trip to Vegas in August 2011.   I love Mexican food and had to try it.   We split the nachos and I had a burrito.  The burrito was good, the meat was tender and everything was fresh and made to order.  The nachos were freakin' incredible!!!  There was so much on the platter it was hard to find a place to start.  What made everything better was the salsa bar.  Again, the little things impress me, and while the selection was a bit limited, the tomatillo salso and the pico de gallo were fabulous.  A couple days later, we went back for more nachos after a night of drinking.  They were perfect again.  We had lunch one more time before leaving.  I stuck with the burrito, this time shredded chicken, and it didn't disappoint.  The last time, there was a bit of a wait, but worth it and the staff brought our order to the table when it was ready.  We went back again in October with friends and again the nachos were a hit.  Clearly the best thing they serve, in my opinion.  We went for the breakfast one morning and it was just ok.  

If you want some awesome nachos, and good salsa, check this place out.  It is quick, cheap, with generous portions and I found the staff to be super friendly every time.  There are probably better Mexican restaurants and it is important to note that they advertise as Mexican-American food.  All I know is that my next trip to Vegas is already planned and I know I'll be going back.
