Review based on drive thru experience and Green Chili Burrito only.  
Good service in drive thru albiet occasionally slow and a delay acknowledging you even pulled up to order.  
Delicious Green Chili Burrito.  Not too hot (spicy) and not so bland (BORING).
The drive thru is sorta wonky cuz  1) it brings you alongside the front of a plaza where you would enter business(es) and 2) you could have a head in collision with someone entering the parking lot if you're not paying attention to where you're supposed to exit.

And I must say again, delicious Green Chili Burrito. (°  °)
And the Chorizo Burrito is not greasy gross like the ones they give you at the Guadalupe & McClintock (Tempe) location.
