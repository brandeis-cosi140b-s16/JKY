Great place for an excellent lunch! After spending a little too long on the lazy river at Mandalay Beach and floating by the sign one too many times we decided that the Border Grill would be the perfect place for lunch!

To start the fresh chips and salsa were great although the salsa verde had a strange after taste that we couldn't place and made for a weird lingering on the palate. This salsa bad enough to take away a star!

We started with the Border Classics on suggestion from a fellow yelper that the Plantain Empanadas were a must. The Border Classic is a sampler platter consisting of 2 Plantain Empanadas, 2 Green Corn Tamales, and 2 Chicken Panuchos. The Plantain Empanadas were amazing both sweet and savory all at once and a hint of Queso Fresco in every bite. The Green Corn Tamales almost brought tears to my eyes because they were the first sweet corn tamale that has ever come close to the ones my Great Aunt used to make me when I was a kid! As for the Chicken Panuchos my wife Bogarted those because she hated the other two choices, but her loss was definitely my gain!

For a main dish we went with the Albacore Avocado Ceviche which did not disappoint! It was half an avocado pilled high with sushi-grade albacore and a decadent lime-salsa mixture! The only thing that was missing was a spicy kick to top of the flavor combinations.

To top it off the waitress we had was super attentive, knew the menu by heart, and even warned us not to over order when we tried to add another entree to our order before we had even seen the appetizers. We will definitely be back to the Border Grill!
