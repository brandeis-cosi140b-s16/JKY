I'd like to update my previous review: 

I was just at Pepe's the other day (late June 2011) with some work people. They have increased their prices on the entire menu. They have a little paper notifying you of that near the cashier that says it is due to the economic climate that we're in. 

Before, a big reason for their appeal was their value. It was a great deal, specially when compared to Los Tacos on Sahara or Charleston. That is still the case now, but less so. 

In regards to their food? It's still pretty good. It's not going to wow you, but you should be pretty full off a super burrito with carne asada (my fav). Now that the prices are slightly higher (taco special was 6.50 and now it's 7.19, I think) I kinda wanna expect more, but it's still the same quality that it was before.
