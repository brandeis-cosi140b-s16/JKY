Stopped in for week night dinner and was seated right away. From the beginning I liked our waiter. He was attentive, knew the menu and drinks, but didn't pester us. He was just right in my book. We started with a couple of margaritas that were quite tasty but not overly boozy along with chips and salsa. Had the crab cake gordita appetizer that I really liked. Then the carnitas street tacos which were very good. My wife had the Shrimp and cheese stuffed chili relleno which was quite tasty too. She really liked it. I'd go back here again for sure.
