Really good American Style Mexican food at a reasonable price.

Went on Sunday for dinner. Had the #39 (Green Chile Beef Chimichanga with Rice and Beans), it was tremendous! Even my finicky son enjoyed his Bean & Cheese Burro. We all enjoyed the complimentary, fresh tasting chips & salsa / bean dip.

Decent selection of draught & bottled beers too.

Drinks were refilled fast and often, service was really friendly.
