This is a BYOB restaurant and its great, there is a little liquor store right next door to go pick out your drinks while they make your great meal. 
The chips and guacamole are a must, very flavorful. 
The salsa bar is the best so many great options
I had the chile relleno which were very good. The flavor and heat were great.  
My friend had the Shrimp burrito and burn jalapeno. Both looked amazing and tasted the same. 
I really enjoyed this place, the food was great, the people were amazing and the atmosphere was like you were getting a home made meal.
