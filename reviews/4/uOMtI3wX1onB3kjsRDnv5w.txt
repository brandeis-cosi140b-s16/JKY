If you're looking for GREAT tasting authentic Mexican food, Fausto's is the place for you. I've never been a fan of the "football sized burrito" because I've always felt it was unnecessary and gimmicky. Fausto's portion size is perfect and they will make your food exactly how you want it. It's a reliable, delicious, reasonably priced, and fast source to comfort food. Also, I know most people roll their eyes at the idea of an authentic Mexican restaurant serving french fries, but I've always been in agreement with the philosophy of giving the customer whatever they want. I LOVE fries with my burritos... if one place has them and another does not; then guess where I'll be going! Kudos Amigos! Keep up the good work!
