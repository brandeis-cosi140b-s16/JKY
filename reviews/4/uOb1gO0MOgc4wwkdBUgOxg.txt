Legitimate real deal Mexican. The place is no frills. The service is not always the most friendly and sometimes the language barrier leaves me uncertain of what I actually will be eating.  The chilaquiles are phenomenal & better than any I've had including in Playa del Carmen! Add the chicken to them. I always get the chicken tacos, rice and beans and I'm NEVER let down. I love the fresh radish & cilantro. 
They usually take your appetizer order with your main course. Everything comes out at once or you get your meal then your chilaquiles. I would advise ordering the appetizer and when it comes out order your main course. I'm always stuffed when I leave. The food is really delicious. 

Oh! Did I mention its BYOB?!
