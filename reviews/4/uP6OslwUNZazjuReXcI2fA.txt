My brother and I stopped here in the half an hour interim between his soccer practice and my school's musical. I had heard good things, but was a little wary about it. I was wrong to have avoided it!
We walked in, and the menu was large and obvious right in front of us. My brother looked and looked for something he wanted, and finally settled on an option, but had originally had his heart set on a breakfast burrito. We got up to the register (no line, yay!) and I saw that they had breakfast burritos, but was unsure if they were still offering them at 6:30 PM. My brother asked (and he is very shy about asking people things, so he speaks quietly and a bit unsteadily) and the woman behind the register was incredibly patient and kind. 
He got his breakfast burrito (eggs and bacon and nothing else in a tortilla, and he absolutely loved it) and I got a BLT burrito (which sounds odd, but is fantastic. Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo) and everything was great.
Their seating area was cute, and had the patio not been under reconstruction, it would have been perfect to sit outside.
Go to the Original Burrito Company, because the food is amazing and the staff are sweet. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had!
