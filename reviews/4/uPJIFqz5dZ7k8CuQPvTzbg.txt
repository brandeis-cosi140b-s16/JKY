Nothing better than Los Dos Springerville after chasing Elk in the White Mountains!  Mesa location is always consistently good.  From the moment you munch those little red and green salsa bombs of spicey awesomeness piled on your gratis chips, until you slide that last bit of flauta heaven down your piehole.  Additionally, excellent Maggies and a host of south of the border beers on tap.  Seek this casa out!
