Cervantes has a free mariachi show on Friday nights from 8pm to closing (about 1am).  The Cervantes family has been a mariachi music tradition in the valley for decades.  Chris, his father, brother and niece are the core of the group with rotating pick-up musicians completing a compliment of, generally, five.

The food is good, reasonably priced and with a complete bar.  Available for private parties and even catering.  I love this place.  SW corner of Mill and Southern.  A wonderfully friendly staff and loyal customer base.
