Best meal I had in Vegas. 

Come for brunch, please: ALL YOU CAN EAT TAPAS ($30) with UNLIMITED MIMOSAS ($5 -- TOTAL, NOT EACH). I couldn't believe what a great deal it was. And on top of that, my friend had a Restaurant.com giftcard to make the deal even sweeter. 

I'm trying to remember which tapas I had (Oh, the tapas are larger than any tapas I've ever had, so don't think they were pussy little blobs of food on a plate. No way, miss). Hmmm... Yeah, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, even your food memories, apparently. But trust me, all of the savory dishes were amazing, as were the chocolate chip pancakes (which I do mysteriously remember). 

I intend to visit Vegas again (when I'm not a student and have time and money to spend excessively), and if this place is still around, I'm so there again.
