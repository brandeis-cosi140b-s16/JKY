I was in Scottsdale again for work and having tried everything in this shopping area and the wait at another place was 45 minutes (on a Tuesday!) we found SOL and tried it!  The tacos were really good - our waiter suggested the sweet potato and black bean - it sounds odd, but it was YUMMY - I wished I had ordered two of those!  I also got the three meat one and it was good, just too big to be a street taco, I had to use my fork.  The skinny margarita was really good as well.  The only down side was how LOUD the place was - it was just me and a friend and we could barely hear each other, the overall atmosphere was really cool and it was a fun place, but the live music at 7:30 on Tuesday wasn't necessary :)  I will definitely try it again and order other tacos that looked good (but the sweet potato one will be hard to beat) :). Our waiter was attentive but not pushy and did a good job, we were seated quickly, so I can't complain at all about the service.
