Great store. Great find in my area.

I needed to pick up some pan dulce for a "Seis de Mayo" party (guess everyone was busy on the fifth) and I checked good ol' Yelp for some advice. 
I only picked up some pan dulce (which was very tasty and fresh). I look forward to checking out their meat market a little more since there are no large Mexican Grocers in my area. The prices were cheap too, I was very impressed and I'll definitely be back.
