I have been wanting to try this place out ever since it opened. I finally made it over there on a Monday night and met my dad for dinner. They have Happy Hour every weekday until 7pm, which includes half priced select appetizers, cheese crisps, and of course a variety of drinks. We started off with a shrimp and corn cheese crisp, which was only $5.25 during happy hour.  The cheese crisp came out quickly and was very fresh. We moved on to dinner and split a shredded beef chimy and some fish tacos.  The tacos were great and not fried, which I really prefer. The shredded beef chimy was very flavorful.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of everything.  The portions are a little small (two tacos per plate) but come with amazing rice and beans.  We finished off the evening with some fried ice cream and were very pleased. I would compare this place to Blanco's Tequila and Tacos only way better.  Black Chile offers a much better menu that caters to all audiences (you can even get chile glazed ribs).  The service was great, the waitress was very attentive which is getting harder and harder to find.  Overall, great spot to go if you're in the mood for Mexican and want to try something new.
