Finally, I got to see what table-side guac was!  And it was so cool!  The lady comes out and asked if we wanted one or two (two is gigantic!) and then has all the spices (onions, tomato, jalapeno, etc.) and you tell them exactly how much or how little you want and you taste it until it's exactly how you want it.  Awesome experience!  The food is true to Mexican form, which is hard to find, I'm always finding Tex-Mex around here and you get HUGE portions for the price.  The plate is almost 2 feet wide.  I've never seen such a large portion.  We had the jumbo tableside guac, extra chips and salsa (which unfortunately it's not bottomless chips there :( ), 2 combo platters with 2 tacos and an enchilada, rice, beans, and cole slaw, and a complimentary dessert which they throw in like Chinese restaurants throw in fortune cookies (which was yummy) all for less than $30, plus the servings were so big I had a lot to take home.  I definitely recommend it to anyone that likes real Mexican.  I've only been able to find On the Border around here for tolerable Mexican, but I think this may beat it.  They gave us different types of salsas too.  Even the cole slaw style was good.  I wasn't really a fan of the bland one, too watery, but the second one they gave was great.  They have outside seating which was relaxing.  I wish it wasn't next to a Days Inn, but I didn't see any shady characters running around.  The bathrooms could be a little cleaner tho.
