I have been to many Mexican restaurants but have never had Carne Asada that I liked as much as Los Taquitos. I've been eating there for years. Their Carne street tacos with fresh cilantro and finely chopped red onion is really tasty and something I really must have a couple times a month. Huge breakfast burritos too. The dining room has just been made larger, so there is more eat in seating available. Great place, great food, a real neighbourhood treat!
