Valle Luna was a good experience with family friends in town.  There was large group of us and they seated us in a private type room, it was fantastic!  Especially since we were visiting with family friends that we have not seen in a long time and we could hear each other.  There were kiddies too with us and they had a nice kid's menu.  

The food was good, nothing out of this world, but good.  Service was like the food, good.  

The parking was a pain though, not a very big lot for such a big crowded restaurant.
