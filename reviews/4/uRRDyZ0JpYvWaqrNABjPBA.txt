This very simple eatery is a great place for tasty Mexican food. The prices are low and the service is fast. I tried their taco and enchilada platter and was very satisfied with what I got. The crispy taco had juicy carnitas as the default filling, and the cheese enchilada, rice, and beans were good - especially the beans which tasted like they used lard, which is the way it should be. The salsa bar offers the standard red and green salsas, plus radish slices, hot (really!) pickled carrots and jalapenos. The drive-though is open 24 hours, which means I now have a good place to go when I get my late-night cravings for Mexican food.
