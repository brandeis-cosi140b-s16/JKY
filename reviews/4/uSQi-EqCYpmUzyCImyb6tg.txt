This is one of those bits of Las Vegas that seems to have somehow been spared by the cultural tornado we create by imploding any establishment with more than 2 coats of paint on it. When you walk in, you are transported to a neighborhood spot somewhere in north Mexico. The service is always friendly, if not fast & the jukebox hasn't changed much since my first visit here, in 1991. This has been the spot since before I was born & will still be killing it with their cheese enchiladas well after I go. This is a fun alternative to Ricardo's. Go on! Get your history on!
