What a pleasant surprise. I can't say I was expecting much based on the outside appearance. In fact, if you're coming up 7th Avenue from the south, you'd think this place is called Aztec. The "A" at the end of the name has been missing for a real long time.

The inside is pleasant and tidy (but not too tidy), with an array of pastries that would rival any supermarket bakery section. 

The combos are a superb deal -- most under $7 -- and you get a lot of food quickly. The refried beans and rice are nothing to sneeze at (a subtle necessity to any Mexican cuisine in my book), and the slow-cooked machaca is deliciously tender and flavor-packed.

I really like the covered patio out front. There are some nice skyline views from the west, but it feels less stuffy than the indoor seating.
