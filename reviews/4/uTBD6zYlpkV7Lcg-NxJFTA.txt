I've been going to the restaurant formerly known as Tacos Atoyac for a few years (a couple months after it opened) and have seen it go from strength to strength.

Needless to say I was a little apprehensive about returning knowing Dan is gone. As some people have mentioned he did a great job of making you feel welcomed.

Fortunately, the food is still fantastic. I had my usual; a fish taco, a carne asada memelita and an all pastor burro. It was perfect.

Yes it's a bummer that Dan is gone but don't be afraid to go back. It's as good as ever!
