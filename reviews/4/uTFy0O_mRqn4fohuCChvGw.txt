After a day of antique browsing in Downtown Glendale, La Perla Cafe is the perfect stop-off for bite to eat and a refreshing drink. This Mexican caf has been here for practically forever (60+ years if I remember correctly). Some folks I know like it so much they will drive all the way from Gilbert to East LA -- oops, I mean Glendale -- just to eat the enchiladas here. I didn't find it quite THAT impressive, but if you live on this side of town or are in the area, it's definitely a first choice for Mexican food. 

La Perla is set up with two different dining areas, one the cantina and one the sit-down restaurant. Diners in the cantina seem to get a bit more, well, enthusiastic. OK, I'll just say it-- drunk. But since there is a brick wall between the two rooms, the ambiance was pretty sedate on our side and we could speak in our normal voices and be heard. There was also a Mariachi band playing (live music is on Th., Fri. and Sat. nights), which added to the south-of-the-border flavor and was a pleasant background acoustic.
