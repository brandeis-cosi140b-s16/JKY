Cantina Laredo has become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. It isn't super authentic like the Michoacan chain, but more of something you would see opened by a celebrity chef on the strip. The quality and portion size is excellent, and the margaritas are great! They have a good happy hour, but I really wish they would extend it out to the beautiful patio area they have, and maybe stay open a bit later during the summer (see Kona Grill handbook). Looking forward to my next visit already!
