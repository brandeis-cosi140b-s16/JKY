Great tacos and especially salsas in a somewhat crowded small shop on 16th st. Maybe the best part of the experience is loading up on the salsas from the salsa bar and going to town on warm chips. (My favorite is the peanut salsa). 

They are also really are proud of the chocolate mole which is very unique and something I have not seen at other shops. They mole is great, very flavorful, but also very intense, so make sure you want a hardy meal before ordering a dish with it! Parking can be tight, especially if you come during the lunch hour as there are only a handful of spots outside the building.
