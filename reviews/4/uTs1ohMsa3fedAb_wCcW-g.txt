I've been coming here since I heard of $1.25 fish taco Tuesdays and every Tuesday has been the same routine: get out of work, call Rubio's, order 3 flour fish tacos, and pick em up on my way to choir practice.  Every time I call and tell them my name, Jesus always recognizes me when I come to pick them up. Jesus brings back the comfort of being a regular at your favorite place and he always make that exception of ringing me as soon as I wall through those doors. Thumbs up for Jesus and the staff at Rubio's on Lake Mead! Happy eating! :)
