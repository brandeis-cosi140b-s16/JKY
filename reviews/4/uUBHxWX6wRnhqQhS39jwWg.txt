There's only one reason I truly love Cafe Rio, it's their most amazing - Salad with meat Sweet Barbacoa paired with creamy tomatillo dressing. There's nothing like freshly cooked flour tortilla, fresh crisp greens, and all the fixings that comes with it!

The Sweet Pork Barbacoa is perfectly balanced with sweetness and spices. The generous amount of meat on the salad is well portioned. I always omit beans and rice, but request for more greens is surely an accommodation that's greatly appreciated!

The service at the Centennial location is always a plus for me. The staff works hard to speed up the line and I always get my order right. The price I pay for my salad (no extras) under $9 with free refill on drinks, is surely a bargain  for me!  And their weekly specials is another added bonus!
