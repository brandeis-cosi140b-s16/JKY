We met a customer here for dinner and it was excellent.  Very authentic since it was in the Mexican neighborhood, not to mention very affordable.  We truly enjoyed our meal and ordered family style.  Not sure what it was called but it had a huge mix of grilled seafood ranging from squid, octopus, snails, shrimp and fish filets.  We also had the peppers and they were excellent.  Very filling but also lite.
