We read awesome reviews about this place and the great food didn't disappoint. We ordered the steak nachos, taco Salad, corn, and chicken quesadillia. My one negative is the cleanliness of this one location. There were literally flies on the walls.  The condiments that set on ice were not properly covered. The tables weren't cleaned. The rating was a 91. However the food was bar none the elote loco was so Good as well as the guacamole  and the nachos had an amazing flavor they are really big too, two or three people could definitely get full off of them
