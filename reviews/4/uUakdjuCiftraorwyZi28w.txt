Came here today for a business lunch. It was more New Mexico style Mexican food versus Sonoran, but I really liked the flavors. They bring out two salsas; one red and one green. I tend to prefer the reds, but the green wasn't a tomatillo salsa, instead it was more of a green chili salsa (delicious and spicy).

I ordered the number 2 combo, which came with a beef taco and a red chili tamale. The flavors of the meats were excellent and the red sauce they used on the tamale was perfect.

The service was very slow, as it seemed there was only one server doing most of the work. 

The prices were reasonable, most being in the $10-15 range.
