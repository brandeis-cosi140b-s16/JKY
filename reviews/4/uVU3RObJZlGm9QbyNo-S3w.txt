OK, The last time I went in there were a couple of big differences:
- The store hours have shifted much earlier than before, some nights closing as early as 5 PM (although this is to accommodate opening early for breakfast now)
- All the regular staff behind the counter are gone...the replacements are friendly and efficient enough, but so far it's just not the same.
- Taco Tuesday is still a deal, but the prices of each taco if you buy 3 or more have spiked from $.99 to $1.29.

Having said all this, the tacos were fantastic, as were the chips/salsa. I coincidentally happened to run into one of the old staff at another business a few days ago, and she advised me that this McDowell location is under new ownership and that the owners are changing things to make it more like another location that they own in Ahwatukee. As long as the food stays tasty I will continue to come back, but I just hope that they don't move the closing time any earlier during the week!
