I love that there is some authentic mexican food close to  downtown!  I just found this place and decided to give it a try. It was a little chilly that day and was really craving my grandmother's homemade soups. I ordered the albondigas soup. It was really good! Now, it was not identical to what I'm used to but it definitely had good flavor and they didn't skimp out on the meat! The broth had a very strong taste of spices which was not overpowering. The tortillas de harina (flour) were pretty good. They could work on their salsa but it wasn't bad. I'd definitely come back and try their other soups!
