worth going to.  i'm from nogales.  i'm so darn picky, but this place is great.  at least as good as it gets in phoenix for sure.  it's worth the drive when time permits.  i always order the quesadilla with carne asada and add guacamole and beans.  yum.  they have yummy horchata too.  honestly this place and america's taco shop are the only two places i really like in town.
