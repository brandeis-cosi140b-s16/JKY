This place is always packed at lunch time, but the line moves fast!  The food is fresh, the staff courteous and the restaurant is always clean.
I had the shrimp bowl this time around and was pleased with the portions and the selections for toppings, especially the chunky guacamole.

This a a quick and affordable option for lunch!
