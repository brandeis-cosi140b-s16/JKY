So I found New Mexico grill via Yelp. You know I has to be good when you get there and there is a line out the door. Ordered the Green Chile stew w/fried bread and found a nice seat outside. It came pretty quickly, it look and smelled excellent. 
My first bite caught me off guard because of the spice. But once I embraced it, I have to say it is extraordinary.
The chunks of pork, soaking up the broth and potatoes and chile is excellent. I look forward to coming back and trying  something else!
