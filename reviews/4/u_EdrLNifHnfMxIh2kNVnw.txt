I visited with my husband and son. We all really liked the bean dip and the chips were good too. My son loved the fajitas. My chile Rellano was ok. Not the best one I have had in town but it was acceptable especially since the margaritas were only $3.99 for happy hour. Overall everything was pretty good. I am sure we will be back.
