Went here for lunch today and got a California burrito and it was great! Carne asada, fries, cheese, onions and cilantro. That's all I want from my Cali b and that's what I got! I had there red salsa with it and it was pretty good, not amazing. I actually dont think that they have a salsa bar, I had to ask for what I wanted. Overall pretty pleased, will go again when I want another California burrito. My favorite taco shop is still Se√±or Taco in Mesa, the best salsa bar and carnitas *drools*. But Tosinos is closer.
