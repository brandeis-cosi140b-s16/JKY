I come to Henderson about once a year if not more to visit my mom, but  because eating mom's cooking is one of the highlights of coming to visiting, the need to go out and eat was limited and since those I visited with are wimps when it comes to spicy, my places of choice were not as often as I would wish. 

However, my mom went into assisted living recently with great sadness her days of cooking are no more, but God provides good food nonetheless and He does so with El Torito Cafe. 

I've only eaten here probably only three time total prior to today but each time I do, I wish El Torito was in DeKalb. Today was no exception as I had the burrito w/chicken and I think it's described as smothered and hot, meaning it is covered in some hot sauce. 

As you know if you've read my other reviews I like hot and spicy and El Torito delivers the "Spice is Nice"

I've had enchiladas and tacos in the past was satisfied. I'm looking to make one more visit before I go home to try a chimichanga and with mom no longer cooking and El Torito being a reasonable drive from my mom's new home El Torito will become one of my must visits when visiting mom
