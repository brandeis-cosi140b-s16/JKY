Excellent guacamole and chips.  Thin sliced jalapeanos top the guacamole off and give the dip a nice zing.  This is such a great spot inside or out...come here for a good Mexican snack, a Mexican beer or margharita and a kicked back atmosphere.  This spot reinforces how Lawrenceville has some of the greatest spots in the city.
