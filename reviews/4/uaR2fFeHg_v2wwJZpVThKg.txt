I have eaten here a few times and I was only slightly disappointed once. We ate here last night. I had the shrimp fajitas and they were excellent. My husband had tacos but thought they could use more flavor.   The live band was OK but too loud. They turned down the amp after we mentioned it. The Cadillac margarita es MUY EXCELLENTE!
