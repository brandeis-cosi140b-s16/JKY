The chips and salsa are the best I've had in Las Vegas.  The salsa is obviously homemade, very spicy and lots of fresh cilantro floating around in it.  I could have done without the bean dip.  

I had a wet chicken burrito (I feel pervy just typing that).  The burrito was pretty huge and the green sauce had a very spicy kick.  Well worth the $7.99 price tag.  I had so much chips and salsa that the burrito had to go back to the office with me. 

Service was great.  Everyone is very friendly and a couple of different servers checked in on us.  Parking was crazy because apparently everyone downtown eats lunch here at noon.  Thankfully, there is plenty of street parking.  Just bring a couple of quarters in case you have to use a meter.
