If you are gluten free like me you have a hard time finding places to eat and your go to choice will always be Mexican.  So here I am looking forward to atone good food when I find out the tamales have trace amounts of wheat flower in them and their streak in marinated in soy sauce.  I was very disappointed yup heart this but I had a backup meal thought out, the spinach and goat cheese enchiladas, which we're good if not a little spicy, but I like some spice every once in a while.  

Over all, I would say their lunch menu is normal for any gf person with tacos and other corn tortilla options available, but their dinner menu has a better range of choices for me so from now on I will be a night owl visitor!
