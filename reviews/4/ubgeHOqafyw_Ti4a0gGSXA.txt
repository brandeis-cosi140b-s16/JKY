I'm not sure if the deal's still going, but La Paz used to have a half off margarita night. Since their margaritas are awesome, this makes going a priority. You have to. 

It's a little bit off the beaten path, which I like.

I'd say the signature dish here is the fish tacos, which is all anyone I've gone with has ordered. Definitely try them--lightly-battered white fish with all the fixings, served authentic Baja-style, which is delicious. 

Great intimate environment, so good for dates or even some just cervezas with friends.
