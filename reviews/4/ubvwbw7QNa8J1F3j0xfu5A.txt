One fateful day after I moved to AZ, I "stumbled" upon this gem (we were specifically in search of Mexican, so I supposed it's not much of a stumble). 

With delicious soft tacos, salsa, beans, amazing prices (3 carne asada tacos, rice, beans for around $6 with penny beers- say what!) and a familial feel, Suzie's soon became my go-to for Mexican. Their margaritas are from a mix, the beers on tap are nothing special and the meat does not follow my "know where your meat comes from" philosophy, but Suzie's definitely has a soft spot in my heart and stomach!
