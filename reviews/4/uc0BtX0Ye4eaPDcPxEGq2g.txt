Food is always fantastic. The pork stew is my favorite thing on the menu. The legumbres are light and fresh and a nice healthy choice. This place gives you huge portions and everything is super fresh! The dining room is tight and always full, sometimes is hard to get a seat. I heard they are moving so hopefully it's a bigger place. I love Carlitto's!
