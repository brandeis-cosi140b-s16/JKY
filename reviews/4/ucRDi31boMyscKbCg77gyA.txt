READ THIS FIRST! Review from one who disliked cabo fish taco. 

Entires ordered: 
- blackened chicken quesadilla; 
- epic tuna burrito; 
- blackened mahi mahi tacos; 
- blackened grilled amberjack tacos (on special)

This is my second visit to this restaurant, previously I would haven given this -1/2 star. 

Chips and salsa:  the other 3 in the party loved the salsa, it is a corn/tomato salsa. Personally, I am not a fan of this type of salsa, I like the traditional kind so I'm not able to provide an unbiased review. The chips have a stale texture, this is consistent from both visits, this may be just how the chips are supposed to be. Not a fan personally here either. 

Entrees: 
Blackened chicken quesadilla (mine) - not your standard quesadilla, not overloaded with cheese. Good balance of chicken-to-cheese ratio. The blackening is second to none, this was an pleasant surprise and delivered a very nice kick. Onions and peppers were good, not too much, just the right amount. I don't eat seafood, that's why I didn't get a "fish taco." 

Epic tuna burrito- very good, comparable in quality/flavor of fresh California fish (according to the diner)

Blackened mahi tacos- delicious. 

Blackened amberjack - the diner went on and on about these, refused to try anything else because she didn't want to "ruin her palate." (Tad dramatic if you ask me, but what do I know). 

My review rating is based upon my entr√©e and the opinions voiced by my cohorts. They truly loved everything (although they did share my feelings on the "stale chips"). 

My original experience was terrible, I don't remember what I had exactly but it was bad enough that I successfully boycotted this place 3 years. However, after the blackened chicken quesadilla, I will be willing to return. 

Also, one had a Bloody Mary (on special) and said it was "delicious." 

Note: parking is a real pain, just be prepared for that.
