The salsas are amazing!  Fresh and bright with just a hint of kick.   I was here with my husband and only had drinks, no entree.  The service and margaritas were great.   The ladies bathroom may have a slight drainage issue, as it smelled sour.  The soap seems really watered down which was a cause for concern, but after 7 or 8 pumps I was able to work a lather. With that in consideration, I question if not eating here was the right choice.  Again, the salsas and bean dip were great but the watered down soap is questionable at the least.
