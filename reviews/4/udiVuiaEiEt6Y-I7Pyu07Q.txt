I really enjoy the food at Los Favoritos. They do make authentic street tacos that are some of the biggest ones that I have ever seen. For a light lunch 1 taco would be great. 2 tacos and you will have a substantial meal.  I will really have to try to steer my fellow foodies to the Carne Asada tacos, hmm hmm good ! 

The only drawback to Los Favoritos is a small one and is due to the fact that I like my salsa really hot. Their salsa is good but not strong enough to make my hair stand up. 

If you are ever in Mesa, stop in for some great tacos.
