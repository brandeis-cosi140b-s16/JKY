Got my standard meal and was surprised how decent it was at this chain. The five rolled tacos meal with double rice was $6.99. The tacos were very thin and crispy and had enough guac to last the entire meal. Even saw real chunks of avocado in the guacamole. The rice was cooked perfect and free carrots and onions were included on request. I also splurged and got the $3.99 cheese quesadllia which again was excellent as far as those things go. They also now give you coupons for your next visit, which is a new twist for these kinds of joints. Good meal after five beers, but might even be good anytime.
