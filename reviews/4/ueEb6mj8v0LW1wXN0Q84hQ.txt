I'm originally from NE Ohio and I'd never seen a Chipotle that didn't have a line of people going out the door. But this one on S. Eastern is often empty when I go there. That made me nervous, but maybe it's because there are so many Mexican and Mexican-style restaurants in the area already.  The food here is just as good as any other Chipotle, and the place looks clean.  The staff are friendly and service is pretty quick.  I've never eaten there- I always get takeout. Parking is a problem because there are other restaurants in the area, so unless you like waiting for a place to park or don't mind having to walk a bit, I'd suggest going during the times that most people aren't headed out to restaurants.
