I wish this place was closer to our condo. For 1.25 tacos and their Carne Asada tacos aren't like ground beef with no extra weird stuff on it I'm almost in love. Definitely not my favorite place for Carne Asada tacos but definitely not my least favorite.  We will see you again soon my friend. 
Oh a word of caution. 
My boyfriend ordered a pollo asado burrito with beans cheese sour cream and rice and asked for the enchilada sauce to be put in the inside of the burrito and its always the same result....outside as usual. We need to Learn how to speak Spanish so we can get it right everytime :(
