Filly-B's is an addiction, once you start craving them you have to have them or you'll go crazy. The thing that my mouth waters over the most are the super nachos (a ton of chips with cheese, carne asada, and more all waiting to be devoured! It's probably best to eat these with a fork). My backups are their Arizona burrito (I never remember what's in it besides potatoes, but I love it) and the rolled tacos (but to be honest I've never had rolled tacos at countless Mexican places and I've never been disappointed and I can't say they are anything extra ordinary here).

This location has some added bonuses: hot chips while you wait and you can walk "next door" to get a Jamba Juice!
