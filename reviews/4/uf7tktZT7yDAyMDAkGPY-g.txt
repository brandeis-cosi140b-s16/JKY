Saw the reviews and we were nearby, so we stopped in for a late lunch. Never a bad time for some quality Mexico City Mexican food. It was mid afternoon on a Saturday, so we just bellied up to the little bar and ordered a couple beers. Family owned and run, and they are proud of that. They should be. I sampled several of the tacos and my wife had the special that I can't remember. Tacos were very good, but the pork carnitas were among the best I have had. Pork was crazy tender and juicy. 

Mom came out from the kitchen to say hello and to make sure we liked our meals. She talked us into some homemade pumpkin desert tamales. How could we say no? Not a big pumpkin desert fan, but it was great.

Rumor has it that her burger is awesome. Next time. There will definitely be a next time.
