You'd never know it from the restaurant's exterior, but Mexico City is a great spot for authentic Mexican food in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh. Bustling at lunch, but service is speedy and prices are cheap. The flavors of the food, particularly the guacamole, spice up even the most boring routine.
