There is something about this Roberto that I like more than the others. I think its the service. The guys working drive thru are always friendly and they ALWAYS hook it up. I feel that take the time to cook my food cause its always delish! The menudos on Sundays are always good. The breakfast burritos are always huge and GREATTTT! The carne asada tortas are always made to perfection. PLUS if yo are out late and want to make a quick run so that you are not hungover the next day (PS hopefully you have a taxi or designated driver) this place is open 24 hours.
