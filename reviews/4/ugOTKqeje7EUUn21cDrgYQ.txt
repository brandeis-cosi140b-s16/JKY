Another Mexican Joint serving the usual affair.. Came here for lunch a few times and realized that there was something unusual about this place in regards to their direct competition such as: Roberto's, Fausto's, Alberto's, Amigos.... 

What makes this place different? Their Carne Asada! It may look like everybody elses but I think their seasoning/marinade has much more flavor and really gets the time for it to penetrate properly. I've tried the Burrito, Tacos and Plate (included rice and beans). All were equally Great!

* I usually add 'green sauce' (from the condiment bar), their version here is even better (not watered down and again much tastier) Also, a little squeeze of lime over the meat, wasn't a bad idea at all! 

On the Go and gotta Mexifood Crave? This place should handle it!
