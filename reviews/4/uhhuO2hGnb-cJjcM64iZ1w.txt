Takes a bit long @ the drive through,
but what the hell, food comes out warm and tasty.

I got a taco salad (crunch tortilla bowl) and flan today.
Mmmm yummy!
Taco salad was very saucy (lots of sour cream and stuff..) and seasoned.
Sizable portions (which means I have enough food for one and half meals-- I'm 5 ft 1 and 90 lbs)

I'd go again.
