This place seriously has the most authentic tasting tacos outside of Mexico. In case you don't know (which I'm assuming you don't), a real mexican taco comes in a floppy yet thick delicious corn tortilla shell with meat, cilantro, and onions. They do it PERFECT.

The bean burritos are great but I wouldn't say they're the best. Their salsa is extraordinary. My Poppy is really picky with his salsa because he was raised by a mexican indian mother who made it fresh homemade every morning and he swears that this is the only place he'll buy salsa from. But still, the stars of this show are definitely the tacos, meat, and rice. 

Be prepared for service from people who don't speak very much English. They know about enough to take your order politely but don't try to ask too many questions or make conversation. Oh and the menus are totally in Spanish. I promise you the confusion and frustration will be worth it. Learn a couple words. That's the price you pay for authentic Mexican food. 

Last time I came here the cashier had her baby with her in a stroller. He was screaming and crying the entire time throwing toys and begging for attention from his busy mother. I probably wouldn't ever want to dine in here. I always do take-out.
