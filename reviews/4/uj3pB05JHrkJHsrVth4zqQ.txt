Keep in mind that this is fast food.  I'm rating it as such.  I'm not comparing it to a place like La Tolteca, or Firebirds, or Top of the Rock.  That would be silly, IMO.

I like Chipotle.  They give you a lot for your money, and it's very tasty.  I can't really say it is authentic, but it's very good.  This time I had a barbacoa, and it was very good.  My wife and I shared it, and we were both full when we were finished.

This is perhaps the best fast food out there.  I don't know (but should probably look up) the "label" to see how much fat and such there is, but their ingredients do appear to be fresh, and the food doesn't sit like a rock in my stomach for hours like a lot of fast food does.  In a hurry and want some good food?  You could do a lot worse than Chipotle.
