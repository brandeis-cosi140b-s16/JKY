Every once in awhile I'd see this place and think...looks like some of the taco shops I go to in Southern California.  But I would never try it. Coming from San Diego (15 minutes from TJ), I became a snob when it came to taco shops out here.  I had this attitude that no taco shop in Vegas can come close. 

After reading some of these reviews, I thought I give this place a try.  I was starving and been to plenty taco shops that can mess up a carne asada burrito and carne asada chips.  You know how it goes??  You're hungry, but at the same time in no mood to experiment.  So, I naturally played it safe and went with the rolled tacos.  I'm not going to say it was the best rolled tacos that I've ever had, but it was good enough for me to come back. 

I didn't give this place 3 stars or 5 stars because I didn't really try anything special.  

I still need to try their
-Carne Asada Fries
-Carne Asada Chips
-Carne Asada Burrito

If this place can deliver on any one of these, I will change my rate to a 5.  One wish regarding the rolled tacos...I wish they had the mixed white cheese with the red tips.  If you're from California, you know what I'm talking about. 

Overall, this places has me curious on how good it really is.  I will be back to find out.  This place reminds me a lot of the taco shops in San Diego, compares to Alberto's and Sombrero's.  One positive for sure is the service, cleanliness, and it's open 24hrs.
