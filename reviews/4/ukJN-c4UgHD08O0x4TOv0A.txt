My friends joke that my idea of 'Mexican' food is Taco Bell but a coworker Insisted that I Had to give Carlito's Burritos a try and brought me a trifold menu.  His recommendation was a 5 star, thumbs up version so I passed the menu to my friends 'in the know' and we went last night.  It was amazing!! The business is clean, the staff friendly, the food fast, fresh and delicious.
The Navajo Taco is big enough for two people to share, the carne adovada was spicy hot in a good way.  I tried sopapilla with calavasitas & posole.  I never noticed the business tucked away in the stripmall but by the amount of people there 6pm on a Wednesday night, they do fine with word of mouth advertising.  Definitely YUM!
