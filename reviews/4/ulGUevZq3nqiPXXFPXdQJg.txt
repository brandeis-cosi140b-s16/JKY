We love the tacos at Blanco.  I agree the prices are high for what you get but they have such great choices and the ability to order a mix of tacos is nice.   And the street corn!!!!   It is fantastic!    If the prices are a turn off, go during happy hour.  The last time we went, we  got there right at the end of Happy Hour and the prices and choices were surprisingly good.    The restaurant is a little loud but it is bright,  airy and has a fun vibe.
