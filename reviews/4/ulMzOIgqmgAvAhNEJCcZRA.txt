I can confirm the rumors.  As a long-standing fan of Mundo Haute Cuisine in the Las Vegas Design Center for the high end and Taco Y Taco for the low end but high quality, I have to admit that foodies should gather up outside a strip club to get Las Vegas's most reliable top quality mexican.  Wow, there.  I said it.  24 hour opening is great.  

Only one star deduction for one reason.  Service can be a bit spotty here.

I have been there when 5 different people asked me how things are going in 5 minutes - interrupting conversation and chewing each time (annoyed).  I have also waited to get my order taken way too long on other occasions.  They need to get the staffing right.  

Once they do, this place is a rocket ship.  Also - note to management (and I hate to say this as a consumer): we want you to stay in business for a long long time.  Charge $1-2 more for every entree.  With reviews as top quality as this on yelp and everywhere, we are more concerned about your financial stability in the future than your pricing.
