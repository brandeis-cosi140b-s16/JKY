I am not an expert when it comes to Mexican food, and I am definitely not the expert on the authenticity of a Mexican dish. But I absolutely loved my experience here, and I can say that the Mexican food and the drinks I've had here makes me want to return again and again.

I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with a few girlfriends. We were seated right away and immediately greeted. The restaurant is small and seating is pretty limited (absolutely not recommended for a party larger than 4). However, the smells are inviting and savory, and we felt welcome and comfortable.

I ordered the traditional margarita and had the mojito after. Mojito, hands down, best mojito I've ever had. Fresh, minty, sweet perfection, and if I had the choice, I would've had seven. For dinner, I had the enchiladas pollos verdes. Chicken was shredded and moist. And the sauce was delicious. Rice was forgettable, but the entree and drinks made up for it.

Service after receiving our meals was spotty, and it took some time and effort to receive our check. However, I plan on returning again very very soon!
