A solid spot for Mexican that's a cut above many other restaurants. When you walk in, you see an open, modest kitchen and a plain seating area. You're not here for the scenery, you're here to shove some tacos in your face!

Here's what I tried: 

Horchata: Not often I see little cubes of cantaloupe and pecans in this beverage. Very sweet and enjoyable, but I'm accustomed to a bit more of a kick in mine...like nutmeg or something. I was also disappointed that while the menu said "aguas", this is the only one they have. No melon, pineapple, tamarind, or hibiscus tea. Bummer. At least it was only $1.80

Fish tacos: batter was pretty bland, and the smidgen chipotle mayo didn't help much. My dining companion actually added salt to this! Definitely needed to get bailed out by the grilled onions to taste complete.

Burro al pastor: A tad bit on the sweet side for me, but the grilled serranos sure did make this good. It was a solid, heavy burrito that was more filling than it looked. 

Overall, this is a very inexpensive place with tons of options. I'll be back to try something new like the carne asada and chorizo burrito, or maybe see what their quesadillas are all about. I like my Mexican to have a little more of a kick, but the sides and salsa can remedy that. I'd definitely go here over the --bertos in the area.
