You cannot compare Pedro's to the other big Mexican food presence, Laredo's.  Pedro's has home made tortillas, Laredo's does not.  Pedro's gives you a much bigger bowl of salsa that Laredo's.  I never have to look around for a refill.  But the salsa tastes vary different between the two restaurants.  The Mexican rice at Pedro's is very tomatoey (?)  Service at Pedro's is not as good as Laredo's.  Overall, Pedro's deserves a look.
