This place was so much fun! We went for my friend's birthday and had a lot of fun. They had a band playing who was really good! I thought the prices were very reasonable too! When we sat down, they gave us chips and salsa AND beans. I've never had beans served at the beginning with the chips like that, but I thought it was very cool. 

I loved everything. I guess the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the veggies were kind of funny. The veggies in our burritos were peas, green beans, etc. Kind of seems like maybe it came from a can of mixed veggies you would buy at the store instead of like grilled onions and peppers and stuff that I'm used to. And my friend ordered a chicken burrito, and there was seriously only chicken in it. No veggies or sour cream or cheese. Just chicken. Still tasted great! Just kinda funny :)
