Breakfast burritos made the way you want it. I opted to try an egg white, bacon, and avocado burrito. All breakfast burritos come with beans,  cheese,  and hash browns.  ( hold the beans plz) My meal was made fresh without the long wait. The burritos were prepared well and had all flavors hitting the taste buds with a since of urgency. That green sauce tjat comes with it is the best.
