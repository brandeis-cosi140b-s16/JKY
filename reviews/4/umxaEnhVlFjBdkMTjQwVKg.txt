After living in Vegas for 5 months and giving up on the idea of decent Mexican food, I was luckily introduced to the wonderful world of Amigos!

Awesome Carne Asada, and a California Burrito done right, Amigos was my home away from home when I lived in Vegas.  Still not quite the pinnacle of burritos you might find littering the streets of San Diego, the 24 hour taco joint hit the spot when I needed a taste of home!
