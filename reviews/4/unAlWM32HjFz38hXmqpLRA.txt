My husband and I had dinner last night at Casa Rasta and it was extremely flavorful and a delightful experience all around. We started with an order of chips and green salsa which was perfect. The chips were fresh and the salsa had powerful but not overwhelming flavor. 

For my main course I had the Jamaican Jerk Tofu that had a nice kick to it and was served with coconut rice, pineapple, and plantains. The rice was great because it helped to balance out the jerk-ness of the tofu. My husband had the Chicken Flautas which looked great and he was able to confirm their greatness. They take care to present their plates nicely. Well done.

Keep in mind this is not traditional Mexican food - if you want that, you probably are better off elsewhere. This is a fusion restaurant with great flavors. If you're in the mood for something different, go here.
