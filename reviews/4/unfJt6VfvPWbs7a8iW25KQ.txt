Took the mother-in-law out for a little thank-you dinner here.  This was our first time here.

The menu was very extensive.  There's pretty much something for every taste if you enjoy Mexican food.  The service was excellent.  The obligatory chips and salsa were warm and fresh.  We all got combination entrees and enjoyed them very much.  Everything was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The prices were very reasonable.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this little gem and will be going there again.
