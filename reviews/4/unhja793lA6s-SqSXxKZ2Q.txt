This small family-owned restaurant, situated in a working class neighborhood, serves authentic Mexican fare.  We were served warm tortilla chips and a watery, but spicy salsa.  Based on my extensive pre trip research we started off by sharing a very good burrito with pork in a green chili sauce.  

We also shared a unique creation served in and named after the 3-legged stone tool, molcajete, used in Mexico to grind chilies and spices.  This artfully presented dish included, in our case, a combination of beef, chicken, shrimp, nopales (cactus), scallions and slices of avocado in a rich red sauce and served with flour tortillas.  You grab a forkful of anything or everything, place on a warm tortilla, fold and enjoy.  It proved be very tasty, but more than we could finish.
