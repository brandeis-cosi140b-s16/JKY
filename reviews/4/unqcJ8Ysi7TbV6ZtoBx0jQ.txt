Carolina's is known for their tortillas and now I know why. I decided to check this spot out while apartment hunting in Central Phoenix. The place is a total dive and I love it!

I got to try the machaca and I have to say that it was the best I've had so far in Phoenix (there is an overwhelming abundance of Mexican food out here so if anyone knows of any better, let me know). To top that off, all the fuss about their tortillas is true. They were extremely good. I liked that they were super thin and humongous. I even ended up buying a dozen of them (only $4).

I'm looking forward to introducing some of my friends to this place. It's cheap, delicious and very satisfying.
