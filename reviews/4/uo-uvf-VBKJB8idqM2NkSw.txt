I am not a great judge of this restaurant, as I only had the pork bao; however, I will say it was quite tasty. I had one pork bao at happy hour (3$), a tasty and juicy pork/veg filled light and sweet bun. It was varied in flavors, temperature, and texture. It was overall tasty. My issue is when it is not happy hour, 2 of these suckers cost about 10$.... pretty steep for what you get. Anyway, check them out for HH!
