Let me start by stating that I rarely eat fast food and only tried this place due to a coupon and co-workers recommendation.  Was absolutely amazed at how great the food is here, and LOVE the salsa bar (especially the green salsa!!)  

Everything is GREAT on the menu, and the service is awesome.  We actually became regulars at one point so the staff got to know us!

The only negative is that the prices can get to be steep, almost as much as a regular restaurant after ordering an entire meal.  So at times I wondered why I didn't just go to a regular restaurant and have nicer atmosphere, better service, etc.  Guess this is why I haven't been back in a while, but still haven't forgotten how great the food is and would definitely go back.
