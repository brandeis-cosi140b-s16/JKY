Chico's is delicious and in a convenient location! It's by no means gourmet. But hey, if you're in the area and looking for some decent food at a reasonable price, Chico's is the place.

I come here every Tuesday during my class breaks at ASU's downtown campus. I recommend the chicken taco salad :) The shell is crispy and light, filled with creamy refried beans, grilled chicken (sometimes a little too blackened for my taste), lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream. They also have a wide variety of fresh salsas at their salsa bar!
