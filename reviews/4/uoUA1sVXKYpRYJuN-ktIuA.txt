So I came here as part of a birthday celebration for my two coworkers and me. We came on a Friday night so it was Latin night . We got there at 10. and Latin night started at 11. We got a pitcher of Sangria , which was strong with plenty of fruit . We ordered the Fajita platter that feeds 2-4 and it was delicious . It had chicken , beef, and shrimp . Now , I don't like spicy food, but my two other friends do and they said that the shrimp were WAY TOO SPICY . Th fajitas did not come with sour cream or guacamole , that was extra and it defiantly did not have enough tortillas . My date ordered the tostadas with chicken and he said they were delicious . The customer service was not great . More often than not we were looking for our waitress . She would disappear for a while , The Latin night was great . It had a great vibe and everyone was dancing . They played bachata, salsa, Cumbia and merengu√©.  They also have a bull! Everyone must ride the bull . It's so much fun!  I would defiantly come here again . We had a Blast.
