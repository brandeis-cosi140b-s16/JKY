I am very familiar with la frontera Sonora and the dudes down there that came up with this unbelievably simple delicacy known to all those lucky enough to have enjoyed what we call the hot dog estilo Sonora. I'll put down 4 of these darn things in one sitting runny green avocado sauce, lime, hot sauce, beens and bacon covering about 40 % of my body before I am done taking my last bite.  They make em good down south and almost as good at one of the 3 Morenos locations. The fresh baked rolls they use are to morir for. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they are expensive as hell in relation to their equal south of the border.
