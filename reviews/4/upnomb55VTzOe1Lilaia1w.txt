Could've been 5 stars. but for a few small problems.  The restaurant is tiny but they do have a cute patio space to sit in.  I think it would be a great date place, BYOB so plan ahead.  (there is a gas station in the same parking lot if you don't plan ahead!)

The food was good.  They fry their own chips, which are slightly thicker than most chips and really good.  Except this time they were a bit over done.  I honestly wouldn't have served them that brown, but half of the people in my group liked them that way.  

I had a taco salad with pork carnitas, the pork was really really good.  I've eaten several things from here, I would recommend going with chicken or the pork instead of the beef.  My husband really liked the carne asada in his enchilada but I have had the ground beef tacos which i thought were salty and greasy.  Beans and rice are ok, they are definitely not the stars.  

There is only one guy cooking back there (Gil, obviously, right?) and one server.  So don't expect it to be a super fast meal.  

Prices are pretty good and although the menu is limited, I would think there are enough options to keep everyone happy.  They make milkshakes too!
