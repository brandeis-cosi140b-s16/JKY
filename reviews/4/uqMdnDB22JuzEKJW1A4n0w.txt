Overall great atmosphere with decent food though the waitress was horrible! It seemed like we were annoying her more than anything just asking for a glass of water. We barely saw her the entire meal and had to ask random people walking by for items we needed. Had the chicken fajitas which were pretty good, nice size portion. Probably wouldn't return based on the poor service!
