I first stumbled onto this charming basement-based restaurant in last July when I was browsing through the Strip District late one Saturday afternoon.  My friend and I noticed their sidewalk stand because our eyes caught the sign that stated they were selling mexican chocolate gelato - which my cousin and I both absolutely LOVE - chocolate with a hint of cinnamon and the kick of chiles at the finish, what's NOT to love?  However when we realized that there was actually a restaurant in the basement below the shop so we decided to have an early dinner before indulging in a sweet treat.  

The decor is fun and warm even though it's a little dark, overall it's very inviting an enjoyable place to relax with friends and have a drink and some great Mexican food. I have been back several times and have tried a wide variety of items from the menu.  I'm a sucker for guac made tableside and theirs did not disappoint - it was perfectly made and the avocados were just the right texture and the homemade chips made a single bite a taste explosion on your tongue!  So delish!!  On my first visit I had the Shrimp Azteca soup and the veggie enchiladas.  On other occasions I've had the shrimp tacos and the potato and chorizo tacos, the chiles rellenos, and the gorditas.  You really cannot go wrong - the food has always been fresh and the service friendly and fast.  Oh, and if you have room, absolutely try their homemade gelatos!  If you love ice cream then their gelatos will be sure to please!
