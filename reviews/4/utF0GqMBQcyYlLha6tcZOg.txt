Santa Rosa is literally right across the street from my office building, so close that I could throw a rock and hit it.  Having said that, I don't go very often at all because I try to make healthier choices, at least during the work week.  I ventured over there this past week and had the beef tamale combo with rice and beans.  The food was delicious and filling, as usual; I ate one and a half of the two tamales, the rice, and the beans before I had to stop.  The staff is always very friendly and the place is clean.  Nice little spot for some Mexican food if you're ever in the area and tiene hambre.
