I LOVE their carne asada taco plate!  I'm not sure how other reviewers compare the food to Filiberto's as it's nowhere near as greasy and the rice and beans are so much better.  They do however have the same menu and atmosphere.  This is a take-out place, where I order my food, run to Walgreens, and pick it up 5-10 minutes later.  If you're going to worry about a Mexican joint being super clean and well-decorated, go to Abuelos.
