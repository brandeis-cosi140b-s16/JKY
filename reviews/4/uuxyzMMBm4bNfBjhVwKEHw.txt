I like the cheesy mexican hut decor lots of seating. 

Chips and salsa alone is why I make the 30 min drive to NLV.  

I enjoyed the following: Nachos, chimichangas, tacos, burritos. And yes, their chicken wings were good, too.  I especially liked their mess of cheese, fundido. 

Gabriel the manager and his staff are always friendly.
