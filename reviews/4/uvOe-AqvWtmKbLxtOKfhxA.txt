I stopped here for a take out during my busy lunch hour.   This is a real mom and pop place, being opened and run by the family since 1984.   This is a down to business, I'm not wasting my money on fancy furniture but will concentrate on serving good Mexican food.

I had the tamale.   It was served with enchilada sauce on top with a small salad amount of lettuce and chopped tomatoes on the side.   In addition they added a paper lunch bag filled with fried in the restaurant chips (not packaged) and two 6 oz cups of two types of salsa.   All this for $4 plus tax.   The combo meal, lunch and dinner the same price, with choice of 2 items with rice and beans is $9.   Three items with rice and beans is $9.75   The other dinners like carne asada or carnitas or others is $13

The tamale was good, not the best I have had but better than most Mexican restaurants.  The filling was beef in an red chile sauce.   The salsas were both red...one with chuncky tomatoes and the other more blended but hotter.   Chips tasted like they were freshly deep fried.

I looked at other patorns food.....the rice looked average, but the tacos were made with real tortillas, not the premade curved taco shells

Overall, 4 stars.  Only locals at this place, no tourist like myself.   It's away from the Las Vegas madness areas.  I would be a repeat customer here if I lived near here.
