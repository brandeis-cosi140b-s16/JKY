This is one fast food place that I go and eat and don't feel guilty.  Not because what I eat is really low calorie and I am going to suddenly get skinny, but because it is good hearty food that fills you up without a lot of other junk.  These burritos are huge, and are mainly stuffed with rice and beans, with some other tasty treats as you desire.  I think I've found a favorite with the Veggie Fajita Burrito - which includes the guac that is normally extra $, and also peppers and onions.   The parking lot is a bit cramped, and the place is pretty busy around lunchtime, but the lines go very quickly.  I would still walk the extra minute to the Qdoba (literally right next to the Chipotle) if I wanted a Quesadilla, or a little variation on the burrito.  Most of the time my burrito is bursting out of its shell before they wrap it in foil, so I have to go at it with a fork, so make sure you get some napkins too!
