Their bean dip is not to be missed, and it's free with your meal!  I had to resist the urge to ask for a second portion with my chips and salsa.  So, so, so delicious.  I had their chicken tortilla soup which was delicious, filling, and came quickly.  The service at this spot is great too.  The people were friendly and were really nice when I accidentally spilled my water all over the floor.  Whoops!
