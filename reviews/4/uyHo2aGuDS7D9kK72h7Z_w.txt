Mexican fast food.

Everything I've tried is always good and big portions.  They do have  JR menu which is actually just as much food, but a little bit cheaper.  

I haven't had any issues with their food.  Everything is always tasty and warm and prepared as fresh possible.

Have tried the carne asada quesadilla/burrito/tostada, super nachos, chicken tostada, rolled tacos, breakfast burritos....I haven't had problem with service either.
