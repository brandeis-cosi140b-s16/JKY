Always on the hunt for good Mexican food (sorry NYC has very little) brought me to this spot. 

Service: Great. They were actually packed so we sat at the bar. Bartender was friendly, service was very fast.  Only complaint is the trashy guy next to us at the bar. The poor chick with him, at one point he says I bet not one woman in this place doesn't want to sleep w/m.  Me and his date both raised our hands.  Hahaa NC trash.  

Apps: Great chips and salsa,  Spicy! Chicken tortilla soup -was fantastic! 

Main: I had some kind of pulled pork plate, it was OK nothing I would ever order again -the pork was overcooked/burnt.  I asked the bartender what he liked and he said he had been working there so long he no longer ate there...? Not sure if that was a good or bad comment. He told me my dish was one of the most popular on the menu -but didn't directly say it was good. Being a former server/bartender I'm a little sad that this guy couldn't ball up and tell me if was the most popular dish but it sucked. 
Other Main: Chicken fajitas -they looked awesome, huge portion, his only complaint was that he was not given enough tortillas 

Drinks: Top Shelf Margs! Awesome. Great quality tequilla 
Location: Near Uptown NC 

All in all I was extremely full and felt weighted down when I left. But maybe that's the way you always feel after you stuff your face with chips, salsa, rice, beans, pork and margs.  Good spot if you are in the mood for Mexican.  Also 4-7pm they have a drink special at the bar!! Great deals.
