This is my second visit to an Azteca, but first to this location. The service was spectacular. They had us covered on everything before we even had a chance to tell them we needed it. Drink refills, salsa, chips. Was great. Food was great as usual. Both our meals were right, no issues. Just like the other location, would not hesitate to come back.
