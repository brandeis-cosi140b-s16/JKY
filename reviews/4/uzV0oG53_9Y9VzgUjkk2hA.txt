Absolutely the best salsa and carne asada around, we like to have them cook it medium rare:) We also like their tacos and Enchiladas De Camaron. They also sale the salsa so you can take a big container of it home with you. Love the decor and service has always been good. The only reason  it didn't get 5 stars from me is because their chili renos are horrible, they taste like they were popped out of the freezer and have tons of soggy thick egg batter, and I have tried them several times hoping they would get better:/
