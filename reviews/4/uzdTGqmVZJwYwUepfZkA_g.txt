Such a cool place to eat. Stopped here while walking around and wanted to get a drink and some food. We got a huge booth in the back which was so nice to have room. Our server was awesome! He was so helpful and just on point the whole time. The food was amazing! I had the chicken tostada salad which was to die for! My boyfriend had the fajitas which were really good as well. The drinks were strong but still really tasty. 

Highly recommend this place!
