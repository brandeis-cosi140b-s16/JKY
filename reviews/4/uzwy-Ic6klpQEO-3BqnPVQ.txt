This restaurant replaced Loco Lime....but dont go in expecting to compare the two because they are not nearly the same.  Not that one is better or one is worse.  

Went on a Monday night....very few diners present.

The decor has changed some.  Its casual and comfortable....but the lighting is a bit bright.  Tolerable, but bright.

They serve 2 types of salsa with their chips.  I liked the spicy one best.  It was quite tasty.  The chips weren't bad....but they weren't hot and fresh like at some other places.

My friend had the Nachos.  They looked pretty good and he had no trouble polishing off his plate.

I had the Shrimp Diabla.  It was Shrimp, Onions and mushrooms (which i added) in a spicy red sauce.  I couldnt believe how many shrimp they have me in this dish.  For $11....they had to lose $.   Either that or ive been getting ripped off at every other restaurant i eat shrimp at.  Anyway, it was loaded with shrimp.  The res saice was really really spicy....but not over done.  I really enjoyed my dish.  

Be very clear when you decide to do separate checks.  Otherwise, they will split the bill down the middle and run your card.  When we tried to have them correct it, it was explained to us that it would take a few days for the bank to adjust it on our accounts.

My friend got pissed over this, so i doubt we will be back...due to that fact only.

I liked the food....i would dine there again.

Not quite sure why other Yelpers have been giving it such bad press.
