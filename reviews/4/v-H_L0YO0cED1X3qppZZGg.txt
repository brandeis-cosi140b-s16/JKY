The best aspect of Panchero's was the tortilla. It is in dough form and grilled right before your eyes on the tortilla press. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was among the best I have had anywhere. Fresh off the grill, they asked what salsa I wanted - I went with the medium and the corn - but unfortunately for a quesadilla, it is already grilled shut - so you either have to reopen it or eat it separately like a side dish. 

The owner was not only there when I visited, but he was working the grill, busing the tables and checking customer satisfaction. Big props for that! 

The only other thing I didn't like was the size of the tables. There were two of us for lunch and the tables were really small. It felt crowded and I didn't like that - but the food and the service was excellent. I will definitely return.
