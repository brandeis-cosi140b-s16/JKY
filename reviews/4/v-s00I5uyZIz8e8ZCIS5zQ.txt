SO easy to miss....actually I did...twice!!! 

I was headed there for an impromptu birthday dinner for a friend and walked by twice.....do they have a sign on the front??? Because I didn't see anything!! Finally one of those dry erase boards out front caught my eye and I saw there written in green marker "Diego's". 

Really though?

Anyways, made it in and it has a casual atmosphere. There's a long bar and high tables in the front and towards the back are the actual tables and chairs. That's where we sat for our meal. It seems like people in my group enjoyed their food thought I heard that the enchiladas weren't spectacular. I had the ceviche appetizer which was pretty filling!!! 

Unfortunately for us we were there the friday before halloween and I'm not sure if this is normal but a DJ set up in the corner across from us and started pumping out some songs.....then the waiters stacked up all of the chairs and tables as people finished and left. Soon enough our table was the last one left on that entire half side of the restaurant. It was awkward for us because some of us were still finishing up our drinks...a friend had just bought a pitcher when we broke away from our conversation long enough to realize that were the only table left.

No one bothered us to finish faster and when we finally did get up the manager (i think) came over and apologized for rushing us and brought over a round of drinks for our group of 6!

Very smooth Manager ;) 

But next time we'll be heading here for dinner a little bit earlier just in case that's a regular friday night event.
