First time there and I got the sweet pork salad with their tomatillo ranch! It was amazing! Sweet and spicy all in one dish! The fresh tortilla topped the whole thing off! Very generous portions, I was not able to finish the salad! I will definitely be going back to try more things on the menu, or to get the sweet pork again!
