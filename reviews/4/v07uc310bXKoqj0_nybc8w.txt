I can seriously enjoy a place that is decorated in tequila. It's a place to go for good quality Mexican food and drink (if you don't mind the prices) and to people-watch. I felt their Cadillac margarita was made well and reasonably priced (I was suspicious of the cheaper house margarita because it did not include the words "lime juice" in the description, so I guessed it may have been a mix). The nachos were some of the best I've had in a while, particularly because of the cheese, though I was a bit disappointed that the jalapenos were a mix of fresh and canned. The fish tacos were pretty good too. Service can be a bit slow when they're busy, so be prepared to nurse your drink while waiting for your food or that next drink.
