As a resident of Avondale, I take pride in Raul and Theresa's.  The food is amazing and the prices are very reasonable.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is the lackluster service.  The salsa is awesome and they have by far the BEST fajitas in Phoenix - I order the shrimp and beef.
