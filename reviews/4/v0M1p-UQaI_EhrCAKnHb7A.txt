I have been coming to Susie's since I was about 5. I used to live around the corner, so we would walk here... and every time, except for maybe a few, I order the same thing... bean and cheese burrito with beans and rice on the side and an horchata. I have had other stuff and I like it a lot, but this brings back great memories for me. I was there when they did renovations. I love when they have a mariachi band. It is definitely a hole in the wall and service is so bad... but it gives it character. PLUS there beans and cheese are like crack... so damn good. Come here with friends when you have the time to sit and chat for awhile...
