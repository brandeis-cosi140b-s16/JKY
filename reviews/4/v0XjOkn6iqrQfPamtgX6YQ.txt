Stopped in last night for some take out.  I was very impressed with how nice and knowledgeable everyone was.  I asked if the tortillas were vegan (they were!!) so I asked for two veggie burritos and as they were making them for me, the manager told me that she'd give me a sample of their soup, as it was vegan also.  No need for a sample, sign me up for the full cup!  I love tortilla soup, and theirs is tomato based, weeeeeee!  My burrito came with amazing cilantro lime rice (way more limey than Chipotle), black beans, guac, fajita veggies, pico and medium salsa.  It was divine!  My woman was equally pleased with the outcome of her burrito (rice, beans,fajita veggies, and pico).  When I was a cheese eater, I would order their chips and queso dip, which is totally yumsky.
