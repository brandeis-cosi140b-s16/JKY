This was the perfect groupon purchase. Thirty dollars worth of food for 17 dollars. The food was really good. We had the Fondito and Steak fajitas. The serving sizes were super good for the price. The chips were corn and flour tortillas.  We also had two different types of salsa. What a great experience nestled in a little strip mall on Scottsdale Rd and Pinnacle Peak.  Try it if you haven't.
