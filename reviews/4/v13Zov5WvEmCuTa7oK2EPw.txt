You know what, for what it is, it was pretty good. Recognize that it's a fast food Mexican restaurant, but compare to a Taco Bell, this is gold! 
We went because we had a coupon for free nachos and salsa. We ordered burritos with pulled pork. They were pretty alright, although the salsa really added to them. 
Basically, for the price, I think it was alright. Considering we ate at Mexican restaurants on this trip that were three times the price but no better, I would say, for a quick meal, go for it!
