Didn't know they had a Tacos El Gordo in Vegas!!!

Being the ONLY one on the strip, this place is chaotic after a night of clubbing. Bigger than the locations in San Diego, but essentially the same menu. I always get the adobada tacos so I stuck with that, but the line is pretty ridiculous. The only thing that keeps this from a 5 star review was that the meat was a little dry compared to what I'm used to in SD. Other than that, bombdotcom!
