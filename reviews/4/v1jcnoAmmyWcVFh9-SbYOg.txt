Finally got to this place tonight, after it being recommended to us from a number of people, and we have to say it was a fun night.  Nice looking place, very roomy, and the waiter John made a positive impression from the beginning, when we asked him what was popular on the menu and what was his favorite.  We ended up getting their deal --- two of their entrees for $20 - me, the tacos, and my hubby the Carnitas.  The Carnitas was the biggest hit at our table.  We both had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow.  Then, John surprised us with a sopapillo on the house for being at this restaurant for  our very first time.   The bill was cheaper than our breakfast the other day, and we were more full (with another meal to boot).  So we recommend the place, and we  hope john is your waiter, too.
