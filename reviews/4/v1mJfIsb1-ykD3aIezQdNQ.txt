Went to this place yesterday for dinner....  

When I arrived the place was practically empty.  I thought uh-oh....  However, I have to admit that the food was pretty good and at a great price.

First, I got the complimentary bowl of chips and dipping sauces.  The chips were still a little warm and crispy which I thought proved they were fresh.  Then, I ordered three small tacos.  One of carnitas, another of carne asada and one al pastor.  All three meats were flavorful and delicious.  The tortillas were very soft and fresh.  Honestly, the tortillas were some of the best I've had.  I added a pepsi to top it all off.

The bill was $8 and change....... Can't beat that.
