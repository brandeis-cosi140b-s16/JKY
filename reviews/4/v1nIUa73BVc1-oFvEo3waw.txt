I hadn't been here since the yelp event last year. The chips and salsa are to die for and it it took everything in me not to eat all of the, since I call myself being "good". I did order the shrimp tacos (sans the tortilla) which were delicious and the service was great. I will definitely come back again to see how things are during happy hour and heck just for the chips and salsa.
