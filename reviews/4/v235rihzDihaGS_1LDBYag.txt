Had the chimichanga from here. Wasn't bad at all. Was actually the best one I had at a fast food mex shop. When you order anything with chicken you can tell them you don't want it with onions and peppers. By doing this they won't serve you the chicken that's been sitting in the pot all day with the onions and peppers (like Roberto's does). Instead they grill all white meat chicken and stuff that bad boy in your chicken burrito or chimichanga. Its def way better and cleaner
