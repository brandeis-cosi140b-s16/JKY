Dear Fellow Taco Fanatics (and representatives of Rubio's):

I am a long-time vegetarian and have spent a lot of time and money going to Rubio's over the years. I'm also the girl that rants and raves about Rubio's and their perfect chips, amazing mango habanera sauce, and juicy limes. I absolutely adore that you responsibly source your fish, and that's just the best thing about you guys. Thank you. Here's where I have my beef (vegetarian pun included).

The Portobello Pablano taco (a.k.a. tastiest vegetarian treat ever) is GONE!  I went to visit the Rubio's in Scottsdale, Arizona. This particular Rubio's has the best people, wonderful management, and as I've mentioned already, very juicy limes. They literally sold me the last Portobello Pablano taco that they could make, since it was coming off of the menu. Talk about heart breaking.

I was wondering if we could maybe delve into why such a decision was made, as there are seemingly very little options for vegetarian food in the "Taco" sector of the food industry. Don't break my heart, Rubio's!

Sincerely, 

A Vegetarian Taco Lover 
(Don't read into that...)
