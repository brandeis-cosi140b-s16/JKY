We just checked in today and got in just in time for their killer happy hour! We got several margaritas on the rocks, beef nachos, ahi tuna tacos, carnitas street tacos, and carnitas quesadillas. All came to the table in a timely manner and everything tasted great and fresh! I only gave 4 stars because I personally hate sports and grown men screaming in my ear! But other than that this place is a definite win, especially if you're staying at the GN!
