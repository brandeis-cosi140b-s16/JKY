People are friendly here and the salsa bar is just awesome! The have complimentary chip for your salsa! Just make sure to not sit near the door because u will end up with cigarette smoke coming at you.  Service depends on who you get basically, today I had a waitress who was a bit slow and tends to get sidetrack but she's nice enough . The food portion was good enough :-) and adding the chips and salsa and u will be full for the rest of the day lmao. Beach party platter was good it has a sample of almost all their appetizers. Chimichanga was big enough and super filling so all and all a happy tummy and a very full customer
