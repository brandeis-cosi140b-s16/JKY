FINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.

This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.

They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.  

The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.  

Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.

Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.

I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.

The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.  

And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....

And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.
