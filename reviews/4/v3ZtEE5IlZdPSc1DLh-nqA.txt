I had a very pleasant experience here yesterday. I had a large order that I placed and I explained to the employee that we would be traveling with the food for an hour before we would be eating it. The staff did a great job packing everything up almost catering style. We had plenty of sauces and limes. Nothing was soggy because everything was packed separately. We really appreciated their efforts. Our dessert was forgotten which we stopped in for on the way home. My son said as soon as the staff member saw him she said "I know what you're here for " and apologized very sincerely and threw in an extra cake for us. I don't expect perfection. I expect 100% effort and when a mistake is made, own it, and make it better. I'm very happy with the food and the service I received.
