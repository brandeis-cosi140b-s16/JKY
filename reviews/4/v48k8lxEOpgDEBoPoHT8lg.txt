I am not a fan of fast food however my co-workers and I eat at this location ALL THE TIME! The service is great and we're warmly welcomed every time we come in (like 4x/week). I usually order the chipotle bowl with chicken or the skinny bowl with chicken. Both are fantastic. I love the pronto guacamole and it's a pretty affordable addition to my lunch order. The food is fresh, staff is great and the prices are low which is why I don't mind eating there on a regular basis.

The bathrooms could be cleaner (lost a star) and the parking is pretty awful. That said, I can get over a terrible parking lot for the service and quality of fast food.
