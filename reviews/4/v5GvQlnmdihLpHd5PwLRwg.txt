A vendor brought us lunch at work today from Cafe Rio at the South Eastern location. 

I had the rice and black bean burrito. The portion was huge and it was really really good! I planned on eating half of it, which all of the burrito ended up in my tummy. Everyone also said that their food was really good which was all types of salads, cheese quesadilla, sweet roasted pork burritos and etc....

I can't wait to try their catering service and actually going to the venue.
