For the price, you can't beat it.  The food is Incredibly cheap and super good. There's also more than one item on the menu that can be eaten by a vegetarian, a plus for me! A bar called Money Plays is next door and that's plus because of the alcohol opps but it sucks to smell cigs while eating or hearing bad karaoke if you are there on the wrong night.
