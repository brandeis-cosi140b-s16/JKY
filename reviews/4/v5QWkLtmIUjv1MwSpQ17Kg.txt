An easy stop for us when we are out and about (right turns).  We also love their chips and while a little salty they also have some other spices which keep me eating.  My fav dish is their grilled shrip quesidilla and my friend usually gets a combo that includes enchiladas.  If we are thinking a left over meal, we just add an app (flautas usually) and have plenty to take home for another meal.
