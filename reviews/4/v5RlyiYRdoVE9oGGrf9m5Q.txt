Always on the lookout for New Mexican food in north Scottsdale. Welcome senior taco. Visited last week with my family. Overall, we enjoyed the meal.
It's a clean little Mexican joint tucked in next to dunkin. 

We started with chips and guac. The chips were good, the salsas were great, but the guac was subpar.

I had the chicken fajita burrito. It was good, but not great. A little greasy for my taste. The tortillas are super good.

The wifey had a taco salad which she though was good but had only small amounts of beans and guac. 

My little dude had a ham and cheese quesadilla, which he loved. 

It may be too early to judge after 1 visit, and I will be back for sure, but 4 stars seems right. If they step up their guac game this would be a 5 start joint for sure.
