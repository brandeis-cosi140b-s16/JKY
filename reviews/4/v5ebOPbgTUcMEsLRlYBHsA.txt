good place for takeout, not the greatest place to eat-in. we ordered tacos, rolled tacos/taquitos, and had the agua fresca. food was good for the price, you can eat for about 5 bucks. as a girl i wouldn't go there alone at night, but i'm a wimp. 
there's a bunch of taquerias within a mile, and this is one of the better ones.
