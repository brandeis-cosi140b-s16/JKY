Clean and veggie-safe (no lard, broth or animal products in the tortillas, rice or beans), delicious, filling and in a fun environment! 

The burrito is huge. I cut mine in half and save it for 2 meals. After eating half a burrito for lunch, I don't even want to eat dinner, I am that full! At less than $6 for a veggie burrito, that's insanely cheap. Tacos are good too.

The owner is a mom who loves to cook, so everything tastes fresh and homemade. I love that I can choose from different types of tortillas (tomato, spinach, whole wheat) and beans (black or pinto). If you like meat they have many different varieties with different seasonings and you can sample them all before you order. They have horchata and Mexican sodas. If they had aguas frescas I'd give them five stars!

Loud music, bright colors and fun Lucha Libre wrestling theme with masked costumes mannequins and photos of wrestlers everywhere.

I also like the hand-washing station outside the bathrooms for easy clean-up, and salsa bar. Mmm, love the green salsas!
