Great Cod Tacos!!! Took my wife and son here for the first time and we were not disappointed. I never had fish tacos but was glad I had them. You get two tacos with a small side of rice and pinto beans. Not a fan of the beans, rice was good. I would rather have three tacos and skip the sides. If you want to sit indoors, then come early. Only a few tables inside. Lots of very nice out door seating. My wife and son had the clam chowder. My son liked it but my wife loves a thicker chowder. {Best chowder is at Pismo beach Calif at Brads fish and chips at the pier} Still she finished it. Overall we will be back to scarf down some more tacos, Woo Hoo!
