Finally got a chance to check this place out. For you people like me that like saving money, go to google and type in Padre's Phoenix Coupon. Valpak has a buy one get one free entree, no max. Umm super cool? Great decor in the restaurant, nice patio. I started with a mojito, which was perfect!!!! Wifey had a margarita, which she also enjoyed. Today was Saturday, Tequila tasting night. We each got to taste three tequilas that were very good. We started with the guacamole and chips. I liked it, but wifamus doesn' t like tomatoes in her guac. If you don't either, they'd prob make it without? I went for the ribeye steak, and wifey had the salmon and spinach enchiladas. Her enchiladas were suuuper great. I ordered my steak mid rare, and it came out well. I had to send it back so sad to say I didn't get to eat until she was done. My meal was good, but it's hard to enjoy when everybody else is done. They were quick to fix my meal, I'll def be back. They'll prob get 5 stars from me next time, I really dig this spot.
