Delicious sampling of several different flavors, and probably one of the freshest places on the strip.  Portion sizes varied, and prices were a little on the steep side, but expected given the location.  Service was excellent, and our waiter took his time describing a number of favorite dishes.  I'll definitely return when I'm in town again.
