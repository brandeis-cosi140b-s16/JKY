First time here and it was Really yummy! I got the classic chicken taco plate. I don't like beans so I didn't taste them, but the tacos and the chips were really good. The size was the chips was nice as well, small and bite size! The salsa bar was interesting... The mild salsa tasted like BBQ sauce and the tomatillo, the green one, was really good! The staff was very friendly and brought the food to you. On my way out I got a key line cake pop...OMG SO GOOOOOOD!
