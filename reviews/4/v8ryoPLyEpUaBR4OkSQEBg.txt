The lengua  burrito was good, though it wasn't big like robertos or taco y taco, it did taste good though. The fresca  wasn't bad either, the lady at the counter is the main reason this place gets a 4 instead of 5, she was rude and rolled her eyes when I changed my order. But the place was clean and had a nice layout. Oh the frozen ice cream was good too.
