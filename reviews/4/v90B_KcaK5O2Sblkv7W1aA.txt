This place is much like any place you'll walk in all through Mexico and Central America - I need places like this whenever I get sick with wanderlust.

Order the whole chicken and some carne asada tacos.  The food is amazing, their salsa is top notch, and they REALLY know how to cook up some carne asada.  You'll be coming back for more!
