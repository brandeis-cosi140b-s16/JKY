Stopped in here while visiting family in Phoenix. 

Food was really good..it was like Robertos but with a step up in quality and freshness. I had the tamales and enchiladas and it was pretty good. Usual slew of salsas that were mostly pretty good.

Best thing about the visit other than the service? Definately the Margaritas....goddamn great and wouldnt exepct em to serve those let alone be that good and cheap too...think they were 3.75!

Will definately come back here any time I am passin thru as its super close to the highway.
