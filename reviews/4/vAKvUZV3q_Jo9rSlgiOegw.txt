A different restaurant.... not foods from Mexico, but foods from New Mexico! Grab your taste buds and napkins to eat the Blue Adobe Burger. Great flavor. Would order again, but dont like the large chunks of chilies. Fries are crispy. Didn't order the other NM cuisine and would recommend this restaurant for groups or couples. Enjoyed... but remember.... everyone is a critic. Try for yourself and be surprised. Buen provecho!
