I have been to this Taco Bell a few times since moving out to the southwest side of town. I L-O-V-E me some Taco Bell. 

I love that they are open late for when I get off work, the guy that works the overnight shift is pretty funny. I ordered a Mexican pizza meal last night and he asked if I would be upset that they did not have any? I told him no it was fine, I love everything on the menu. He said your supposed to get anger and yell "oh I am so mad, gurrr" "ok I am so mad(with a smile)" he said no we have them. 
I think the overnight shift needs to have some fun, it's a boring shift. Way to make it fun taco man!
