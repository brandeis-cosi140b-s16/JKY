I didn't like On The Border the first few times I tried it a few years ago.  I tried it recently in Charlotte and it was delicious.  I think they changed something about their salsa, it's extra hot and so good now.  Their chicken enchiladas are great with the cilantro lime rice.  But the shrimp fajitas are where it's at!
