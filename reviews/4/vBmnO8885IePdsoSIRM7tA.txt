I dig Taco del Mar. 

It reminds me of a few of the burrito places I used to frequent in the Bay Area when I lived out there. They even have the option for Mojado Style (i favorito) which takes the finished burrito and soaks it in enchilada sauce and melts cheese on top. It's just as tasty as it sounds. 

If you're on the run. it's easy to pick up a burrito to-go in foil and eat it while you drive. (Though, it might be a good idea to sport a napkin over any sensitive clothing items. I'm not good about this.)

Cheap burritos . . .  ain't nothin wrong with that!
