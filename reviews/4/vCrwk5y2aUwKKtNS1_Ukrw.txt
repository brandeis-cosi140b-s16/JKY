We hit El Torito on our way out of Vegas and, being Sunday morning, it was almost a relief to see the unassuming exterior as we could be assured that there would be no wait. We were correct and found ourselves promptly seated in a dated mexican food restaurant. Food was good, service was good, and prices were fair -- only ding is that they messed up Jenny's order (I suspect the server didn't ask for clarification when she was confused).

Definitely a worthwhile stop if you have a half-day drive back to Arizona or California ahead of you.
