First visit - did take out. I ordered the red chili beef entree plate.
Such interesting flavors in the red chili. It wasn't spicy, but it was very tasty and light. Beans were good too. It wasn't the typical Mexican restaurant style of food that you find all around AZ.  Think..... new Mexican style....meets urban architect foodie lover.( And they got married and had a baby.) 
My next visit, I plan to dine in and try the green chili pork and their chips and salsa.
