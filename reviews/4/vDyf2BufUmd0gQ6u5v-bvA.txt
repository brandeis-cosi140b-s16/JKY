It's a tex-mex sort of place with lots of noise, lights, and a giant devil woman on top of the restaurant...what else could you ask for?

I had a couple beers and snack there one afternoon and had a great time.  Service was good, atmosphere was casual so a nice break from some of the other restaurants and bars I hit while in Vegas.

I ordered the deep fried sample platter which was...deep fried...so no surprise, but hit the spot as a snack with beers.
