I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this location with a group of friends.  The location was able to very quickly accommodate our group (~10) during lunchtime and the server for our table was friendly and attentive.  Since that first visit, I've been back with the family.  This review will include the experience for both visits.

I've struggled to find what I consider good Mexican fare here in the valley - probably not because of a lack of good places but because I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food and long for good ol' Tex Mex (can someone here please have carne GUISADA on their menu already?!).  The salsa was nice, but was a bit awkward with the carafe... Salsa is best eaten from a bowl type of vessel so you can get that chip and really get it in there.  It's just not the same scraping it off a plate, trying to get the last yummy bite.  

I had the shrimp salad on my first visit, and the second time around, I went for the pollo con queso.  The shrimp was flavorful, but overcooked so it was tough.  They were friendly when accommodating my request for half an avocado on the salad instead of just one slice.  The dressing was delicious - reminiscent of Chuy's creamy jalapeno.  The pollo con queso was a delightful dish and a very large portion (enough for next day's lunch).  I requested a little side of that yummy dressing I remembered from the first visit and went a little crazy dipping bites of the chicken in it.  

We'll definitely be going back to try more of the menu items and some of the house cocktails.
