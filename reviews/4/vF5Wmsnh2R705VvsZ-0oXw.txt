My favorite Mexican place in town. Great food & house margaritas for a great price. You can't beat their margarita happy hour and their taco night. Try the Carne Asada Taco w/ guacamole and the Taco El Pastor (marinated pork w/ pineapple). Guacamole is delicious! If you are in the mood for an extra treat, try the pomegranite infused tequilla.
