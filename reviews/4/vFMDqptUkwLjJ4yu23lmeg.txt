Loves the street corn and the salsa choices. Fish taco and chicken authentic taco were fresh and good, but a bit dry and overstuffed, not as flavorful or juicy as possible. But the great salsa helped a lot! Very nice beer and drink selection, but a bit slow service wise for Mexican. Would go again though!
