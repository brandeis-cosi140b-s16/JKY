Chipotle is one of my favorite places to eat thats fast and cheap.

The menu is pretty straight-forward.  Tacos, burritos, bowls... pick your ingredients, move along.  Your meal will be assembled at light-speed so stay sharp!  If you really only want a LITTLE BIT of sour cream or salsa or whatever, say so LOUDLY and CLEARLY or else it will get slopped on there like everything else.

It can get really crowded during weekday lunch, go at 11:00 or 1:00 to avoid the rush - or if you are going to pick up, fax your order in ahead of time.
