Their lunch specials are nuts portion wise. From somewhere between $5-7 you can get pretty much a double portion of a lot of mexican standards. I opted for chilaquiles which were pretty solid and tasted damn near as good the next dar when I microwaved them at the office. So that's like $3 per lunch?! Insane.
