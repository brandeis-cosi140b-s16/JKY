If you're staying at the MGM Grand, this is a great place for a quick bite to eat.  My boyfriend and I grabbed our last meal in Vegas here before heading to the airport and really enjoyed it.  We had just left the pool and picked a table where we could people watch.  The tableside guacmole was delicious and we scarfed it down in about three minutes.  We both ordered rather large meals and were able to have them packed up so we could eat them at the airport.  Both our burrito and enchiladas were good and if I stay at MGM again, I will definitely stop by for a meal and drink.
