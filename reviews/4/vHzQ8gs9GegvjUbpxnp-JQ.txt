I really dig this place.  It's in a good location, my fianc√© is a fan, and they have a fresh salsa bar.  Nomz.

If you like spicy, give the Diablo Burrito a try.  I was weeping tears of spicy joy halfway through.  It's pretty intense.  If you like cheese, definitely try the Nacho Burrito.  Too cheesy for me, but I'm sure it will appeal to the cheese-friendly!

By far the steak is my favorite meat to pick here.  Their steak tacos, while simple, are very full of flavor and I often get these when I can't figure out what I want.  I hate being that guy that stares at the menu for 10 minutes.

For making food to order they are pretty fast to get it out!  I've never been here when it's really busy, usually just one or two people ahead of me, so I'm not sure if that rings true during other times.

They also have coupons in the local ads from your mailbox, so that's a nice bonus.  =)
