Looking forward to coming back again and again.  My husband and I shared two carne asada tacos and two carnitas tacos.  They were both really really good, very fresh.  The salsa bar had a great variety of salsas that we couldn't decide on, so we sampled all of them!  By far tho, I loved the salsa that came with the chips.
