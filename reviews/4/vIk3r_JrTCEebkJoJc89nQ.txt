I am typically not a fan of this establishment but the servers, especially Erin, have been great. They create meals from scratch the way I want it. I am on a low-carb diet and got the fajitas on a bed of salad. This is a combination of two different meals and they didnt hesitate. The food came out perfect and now I order it at least once a week for lunch. I love a place that'll cater to what I want and still deliver quality food.
