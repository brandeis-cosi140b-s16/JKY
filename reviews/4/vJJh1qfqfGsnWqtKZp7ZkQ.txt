This is my second Chef Jose Garces restaurant. It was very good but not the same as his Tinto restaurant in Philadelphia. 

The restaurant is in a hotel very south beach decor with all local art. The service was excellent. 

Food is a Mexican fusion. Best dish is the tuna tartare with a coconut sherbet. The guacamole was also fantastic. I tried their chicken mole dish which was on the spicy side. We tried to types of tacos the pork carnitas which were very tasty and the fried fish tacos which had pickled onions. Great place to share food with friends.
