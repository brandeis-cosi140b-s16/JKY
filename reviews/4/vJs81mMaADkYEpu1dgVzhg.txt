Ummm... gorditas.... I approve :)
Salsas - are an OK. Shredded cabbage was a nice compliment to a meal.


P.S. People... I know it's America but after so many years living in LV I have no trouble ordering food in Spanish. Just accept the fact that not everyone does speak English and get a couple of Spanish food ordering lessons. Don't diss the place just because of that.
