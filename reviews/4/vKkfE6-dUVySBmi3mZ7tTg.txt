Expect to wait a minimum of 15 minutes before your order is taken. The lines are always very long.  I suppose that means they are doing well.  I go here fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot.  Perhaps this is just typical of a fast food joint. 

The food is delicious every time.  It's really really flavorful so I hope you like spice!  The food is quality and taste is always consistent and the staff is always nice.  

One thing that bothers me is the inconsistency among my orders.  I usually get the kids taco meal. Sometimes they give me 2 tacos and sometimes they give me one.  Sometimes the meat is on the side sometimes not.  I honestly don't know which one is right so I never correct them.  It just seems odd to me that there is so much confusion on how to prepare one of very few menu options.
