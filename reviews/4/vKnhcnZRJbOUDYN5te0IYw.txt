Went for lunch with my mom one day this week. Was excellent! Had chicken and fish tacos. Mom had the salmon salad which she also loved! 
Wonderful environment and zack was our waiter. He was so nice and sweet. Helped due with recommendations and we were very happy. Margarita was also great! Can't wait to come back!
