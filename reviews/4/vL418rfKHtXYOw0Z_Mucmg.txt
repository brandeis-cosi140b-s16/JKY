Hungry- need authentic?  Check this place out.

1.  Portions - Nice and big for the hungry beast in you.

2.  Quality - Authentic and good. I really enjoyed the Nachos with beef and the Carne Asada Burrito. Ok, these are not authentic choices, I know, but I love lengua, and taquitos and they have the real stuff. Their little salsa bar with the two salsa's, green onions and pickled veges are great!

3.  Prices - A bit on the pricey side, comparing to a Del Taco or Taco Bell, but this is the real deal.

4.  Service- More or less self service, but good overall.

5.  Room - Plenty of room to sit, clean and relaxing.
