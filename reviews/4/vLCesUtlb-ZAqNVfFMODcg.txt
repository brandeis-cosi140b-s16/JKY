It is insanely hard to find good New Mexican food outside of New Mexico.  Actually it's hard to find any New Mexican food outside of New Mexico.  Having lived in Phoenix for 6 years and frequently traveling to New Mexico, I am sad it took me so long to finally try Los Dos.  

It was excellent.  Be prepared, New Mexican food is quite a bit spicier than traditional Mexican food.

Don't forget to finish your meal with a little sopapilla with honey for dessert!
