I have not been to Roberto's in a very long time. This is pretty close to my house and the workers wanted this for their lunch so I decided to hit it up.

I love that you can call ahead and place your order. It is so much faster than waiting around at the gas station. I had a very large order and they got everything right. No screw ups, I was shocked.

You can't go wrong with the #1 ( shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada w/ beans and rice) or the carne asada burritos. Those burritos are huge and oh so good.

Don't forget the salsa and bag of carrots and peppers before you leave. You can't eat a Roberto's meal without those.
