Nice place- we went for happy hour and sat at the bar. Not crowded when we were there (a Thurs evening)

Bartenders suggested the tacos and they were very very good (we had barbacoa). Also had the grilled chicken nachos and the tableside guacamole. All tasted really fresh and good.

Loved the HUGE 5.00 house marg-- noticed the other specialty drinks were very expensive, like 11.00-12.00!! I THINK the house marg was the only happy hour special (at 5.00 like I said) but you'll have to check me on that.

Choices can be very limited in Scottsdale proper- it is either super casual (think: Rubio's!) or super exclusive/expensive (read:snobby)  We usually end up on the patio at Carlos O'Brien's (also off Bell Rd) but this was a nice change pf place. Classier.
