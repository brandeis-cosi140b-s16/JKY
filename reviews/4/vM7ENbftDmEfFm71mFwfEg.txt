Found this place via Yelp to grab some nosh before heading home to LA. It's definitely a solid little spot to try out. Their menu is a little confusing with a lot of items sounding very similar to each other so the yelp photos helped.

 We ordered half orders of the Fushion Bulgogi fries &Chicken Teriyaki but their portions were very substainly sized. I ordered three tacos for myself - Shrimp, fried Calamari, and Pork Belly. I really liked the shrimp and the pork belly tacos... the Calamari taco tasted like a fish taco. Not bad, just not chewy and squidy like I'd expected.

The Bulgogi fries were deliucious! Perfect hang over food - wish I'd paid attention and requested no jalapenos but just ended up picking them off.

I really liked the guacamole that comes with their chips - if I wasn't heading out of town, I would have ordered the 1lb to-go side they offer of it.
