The tortilla chips are delicious here- we got a basket that were still hot from the fryer.  The salsa was equally delicious, as was the mysterious green sauce our waiter brought to our table.  I have no idea what's in it, but it's flavorful and spicy.  I actually preferred the green sauce to the salsa for my chips.

I chose the fajita quesadilla for my entree- full of grilled vegetables, grilled chicken, and just the right amount of cheese.  My friend ordered the fajitas barbeque, which is chicken and veggies covered in a BBQ-like sauce.  The combination was surprisingly tasty, and I would definitely order that dish again.

The service was excellent and our waiter was very friendly.  However, the margaritas were not very good.  Whatever tequila and mixer combo they use just doesn't work for me- skip these for sure.
