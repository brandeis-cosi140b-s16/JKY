As previous reviews have stated it is the most authentic mexican food you can get in az, I've lived in nyc and that still does not compare to the award winning delicious taco trucks that city is famous for!! Highly recomend the lengua super tasty and flavorful, my girlfriend had the carne asado she loved it, she was hopeing to get a margarita but they do not serve alcohol.. that is quite alright, because the food made up for it and we ended up going down the street for drinks. This is a great place to have some authentic mexican food!
