Great food, good memories... Must pay in cash is the only issue. However, it's family owned and you can appreciate the passion of a small business owner through the quality of the food.

I've asked several times, they swear there's not secrets in making their ice tea. But, for whatever reason it's very very refreshing! 

Chips are made fresh and the salsa has a nice surprise heat. "Just" spicy enough, you could eat a couple gallons of the stuff and not get tired of the flavor.
