This location used to be a Starbucks, so this is a brand new Rubio's. The decor inside was pretty amazing, and the salsa bar was fresh and fully stocked!! The roasted chipotle salsa was pretty bad ass!

I got the grilled salmon taco and salad for $4.99. It was light, but filling, and healthy!!!

The salmon was cooked excellent and all the food was fresh!!

Great deal, good service, and nice clean place!!
