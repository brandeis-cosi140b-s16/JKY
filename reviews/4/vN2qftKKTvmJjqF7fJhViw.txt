I went here for lunch. We were the only table there on Thursday at 1:30pm. We got there just in time for lunch specials. Every time I come here, it just seems so quiet. 

My girlfriend really loves this place. She loves the shrimp tacos with the mango salsa. It was really good. I had the white fish taco and that was good as well. My only complaint is that it's 1 taco, rice, and beans for $6. For Mexican food, that seems expensive. Rubios have good seafood tacos and much cheaper. But it is a sit-down full service restaurant. But the 1 taco I had was good. 

The chips and salsa was really fresh and yummy. The chips were served hot. Not sure if it was made here. The red salsa has nice flavor but I thought the green salsa was a bit sweet.

I won't come here all the time. But I hope to try other dishes.
