And with that, another Three Amigos - perhaps the last, if you believe Dalton - is now open, this one in Noda.

It is almost impossible to capture the essence of something and recreate it elsewhere. Nothing else can ever equate to that hole-in-the-wall charm, or make you feel the way when you first had your meal there. This location is also different from the much more sanitized version in Highland Creek.

Instead we have a converted Arby's (you can tell by the sign that remains on the door, inviting you to return on your next visit), but what is inside is like an improved version of the Central Avenue location - larger and still intimate. A most excellent bar and even a private room for parties that need it, without the suburban feel of Highland Creek. Nicely done.

The food is like that of the Central Avenue location, with only a couple noticeable differences - a monstrous bottle of Mexican Coke (presumably because you can find them everywhere, 3A needs to stay a step ahead by offering the larger size) and the same great chips seem to be just a tad thinner than they normally are, breaking more easily.

Other than that, if you know Three Amigos, you'll be comfortable here with some of the best Mexican food in Charlotte. Even the menus are the same, and all-you-can eat enchiladas are on Thursday. Hurry in to get your name on the wall before the target is out of reach.

What's more, the staff is as friendly as ever - perhaps even more so - making it well worth a visit.
