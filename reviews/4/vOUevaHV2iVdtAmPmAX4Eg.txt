I ate here a few weekends ago. That night I think we were drugged at a bar by a 6'5" tall bartender in hotpants short shorts and a cutoff half-shirt because we blacked out nearly everything from that evening. I do remember a few things from that night though... 

Specifically, I remember peeing in the bathroom here. Couldn't tell you what it looked like, so I suppose that means it was relatively clean. I also remember standing in the restaurant waiting for our order to come. I don't remember how we got to the destination, but I do sort of remember opening my white Styrofoam takeout container and seeing the beefy cheesy thing I ordered... or at least I think I ordered. 

I'm pretty sure I ate it, but I couldn't tell you anything beyond that. I'm sure I liked it okay because I want to go back and eat again. Everyone else I was with seemed to like it as well - those who can remember the evening anyway. 

It's possible we were drugged and had disgusting sex acts performed on us - we would have no idea... I don't think we were drugged at Amados, and that's always a plus when a restaurant doesn't drug you. 

I woke up in my own bed and didn't have any sort of gut rot from eating the food. We went swimming right after eating apparently, and nobody reported that I threw up or crapped in the pool, so that's another good sign. Good Mexican food is hard to find, so I hope this place lives up to the hype on my second visit.
