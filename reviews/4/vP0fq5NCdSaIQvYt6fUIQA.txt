Arribas is a locally owned and operated Mexican-American food restaurant; no illegals here, so stay away Sheriff Joe.

Seriously, food is good, drinks are strong and reasonably priced, and usually they have a scary ass clown lady that will paint the mexican faces white, and the white faces Mexican! 

It's a great place, and doesn't make me want to go all SB-1070. I thoroughly enjoy their enchiladas and burritos. It's a great place with a date or with a group. The staff is very diligent and polite and speak english as their first language.
