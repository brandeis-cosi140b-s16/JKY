If you like chain restaurants that have ridiculous Mexican chilis dressed with a sombrero on their head then you'll hate this place.

If you like great service, authentic Mexican food, free chips and salsa that are homemade (plenty of cilantro and peppers), then it's tough to beat La Fonda del Sol.  It's not fancy, but the service was fantastic and food dynamite.  

The service was fantastic, they were busy, but both our waiter and person serving water was around twice as much as you'd find in most Mexican restaurants that charge twice as much.

A previous poster said the salsa was good.  I agree.  It comes out with hot and mild, or mix it for a good combination of both.

The dishes were well proportioned and authentic - I didn't get the usual velveeta cheese taste like you will at chain Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the #1 combo which came out with great beans and rice.  Throw in some of that hot salsa on there and you can't miss!

The bonus for the night was listening to the staff cheer during the Mexico/US soccer game.  I take it Mexico won as there was a lot of cheering.

Order a margarita or tecate and enjoy yourself here!
