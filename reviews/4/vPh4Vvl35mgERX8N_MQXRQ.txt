I was overly impressed with G's!  My brother and I have travelled many miles throughout California and Nevada looking for the perfect hot dog combinations and quality.  Who has ever heard of a hot dog buffet?  I had red hot Chicago style along with a bacon, chili, cheese dog topped with jalape√±os.  Both make Joey's taste like they just arrived.  Plus where else can you get double fried Tatar tots, old fashioned ice cream, and a soda for under $10.  I definitely recommend this place as a must try.  (Plus Victor was more than polite and helped us understand the history of this golden gem.)
