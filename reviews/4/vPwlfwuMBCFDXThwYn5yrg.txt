friendly greeting when entering, no line.  went because we got a coupon mailer.  my wife took about 5 minutes to decide, server was patient & friendly and answered 3 or 5 questions my wife had.  when paying, unprompted, the server said we could use up to 3 coupons.  very cool, got one more taco.  the free taco was huge & all food was very good.  left full & with a box of chicken for tomorrow.  price was fantastic with coupons.  only complaint was the dining area could have been cleaner.  very nice.
