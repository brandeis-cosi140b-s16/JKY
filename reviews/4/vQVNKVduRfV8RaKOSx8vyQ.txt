From the other reviews, we were expecting poor service and average food. We were delighted that everything was above average. The owner/manager was friendly and professional. The place looks fantastic -- they've obviously put a lot of money into the remodel, from the patio to interior seating. The bar looked great from a distance. Our server was great. And the food was very good, and certainly not the old school mexican food from the past. The pulled pork special was huge! Like a big BBQ, and plenty of quality*quantity for the price. We also got a wet burrito, which was great, altho maybe a little underseasoned. So no complaints... we can think of only 1-2 mexican restaurants in N Scottsdale that are better.
