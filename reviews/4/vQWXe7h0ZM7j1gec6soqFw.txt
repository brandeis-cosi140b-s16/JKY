My husband and I ate here tonight.  We wanted some place local and he was in the mood for Mexican.  We used to come here fairly regularly but it has been several years since the last time we came.  It looks beautiful outside, they added a covering t the patio and it looks like they painted and spruced up the place.  The inside is nothing special but definitely good enough.  We waited less than 5 minutes to be seated.  We had a good server.  The chips and bean dip are really good.  The food was good too.  It was good enough for my taste.. I am not a gourmet restaurant reviewer so it was fine by my standards.  Since we were out without our kids tonight we were really enjoying just sitting and chatting.  However, we didn't want to linger so after we paid the check we sat outside in the courtyard area under the trees on a bench swing.  It was beautiful and quiet.  Overall, I like this place and would go back again.
