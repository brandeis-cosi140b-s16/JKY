Love the quality ingredients that make up a Chipotle meal.  This particular location is closest to where I work so I frequent it a lot.  Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is due to the limited parking spaces available.  There are a lot of other businesses near by and the spots nearest to the restaurant seem to always be full or almost full.
