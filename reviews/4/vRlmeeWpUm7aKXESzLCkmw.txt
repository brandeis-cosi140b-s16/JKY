An update to an update? Is that possible??? 

Well, Maria Maria deserves it. Again, great service. But what I'm most impressed and happy with is what I ordered: the spinach, shrimp and mango salad. YUM! Just be careful if spicy isn't your thing, since the 4 large shrimp seem to be smothered in spicy powder. Next time, i'll ask for "naked shrimp," since the other ingredients of the sald, including cojita cheese and raisins, add such an array of flavor, you really don't need the spicy element. 

It's a $13 salad (yeah, I cringed at this, but I've been wanting to try this forever), but totally worth it. It was so hearty, I took 1/2 home. Double yum!
