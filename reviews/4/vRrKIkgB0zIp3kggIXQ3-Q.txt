Really good beef tacos! The fajita mix tacos were pretty good, and the chicken tacos were ok. The hot sauces are VERY goddamn hot so watch yourself, gringo. This little block in Oakland reminds me of a neighborhood in Queens... kinda dirty, filled with little international shops, people aren't super nice, and parking is hard to find. The tortillas they use are really good and they do themselves a favor by heating them up on the grill. This place is packed at lunch time.
