Snaps!!! A hop, skip, and a jump away from the jobby job!!! Thank you Mikey elite for bringing me here.

This taco stand is on the south east corner of Bonanza and Las Vegas blvd. Grimey.

Cheap eats at this taco stand. $1.50 tacos has me coming back for more every time I hit the spaghetti bowl. Cuatros tacos is enough to scratch my itch. 

So far the asada and pastor tacos are the business.  They only give you the meat & tortillas. You can stack all the makings of cilantro, onions, and hot sauce on your tacos. Their "hot sauce" sets this place on fiyah! It's not too hot, but the after taste lingers in your grill for a good minute.  EYE LIKA!!!

If you're in the spaghetti bowl/downtown area and got that taco itch, Tacos El Pastorcito is the way to go.
