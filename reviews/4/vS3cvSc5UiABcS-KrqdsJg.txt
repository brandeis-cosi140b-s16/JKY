I came here after I found a coupon in the paper. While I was looking through the articles I also read that they are closing this location down! The past couple of years I would just pass by now I wanted to cry in my Albondigas soup for not stopping by earlier.

 The soup was delicious it wasn't overly salty. They also serve chips and salsa while you wait for your meal. The salsa was sooo good! It is sweet and spicy and I couldn't stop eating it.  I ordered the garlic shrimp with rice. It was delightful and could taste the garlic and buttery goodness bursting from the shrimp. I will have to visit there east side location when I'm in the area.
