Moreno's is known for their Sonoran Hot Dogs and because they're good I'm recommending the place.  I got some for 2 guys who are from Sonora and they said they're pretty authentic and yummy.  To get the full experience it is better when the guy is outside with the hot dog cart, but if he's not it's still good.  You purchase the Sonoran dog inside, they'll give you a ticket stub, then you give it to the guy outside and he makes the hot dog.  It's a good place to go if you want to try something different and have a craving for Mexican food.  Warning: the hot dog is a little too spicy for little kids because of the pepper that is included.

On my trips I also have their green chile burro.  My only problem with that is I'm not used to having beans in a green chile burro, however, it is tasty and it has good green chile flavor.  

I've also tried their asada caramelo (beef stuffed cheese crisp) and it was slightly greasy.  The ones in Tucson are better. 

The other reviews touched on other items on the menu.  The place is kid friendly and it's a great place to have a Manzanita (Apple Soda) or Aqua Fresca with your food.
