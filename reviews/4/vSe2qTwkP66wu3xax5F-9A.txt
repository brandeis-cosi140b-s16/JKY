I really wanted to check out this place! I heard excellent things about the atmosphere! The old church did Not disappoint, it was so beautiful, I really enjoyed the setting. The happy hour deals were really awesome! My $5 margarita was nice, crisp and strong. The chips and salsa were sooooo yummy! The chips appear to be fresh and housemade. I tried the povado- pork- avocado taco, pretty yummy as well!! All in all pretty cute, yummy food. Be prepared to spend some cash, prices can get high. Our tall male server was not my fave however, kind of Abrupt and seemed to dislike us a lot. Took chips and salsa away when we were still eating them. Kind of a get out moment.. 
Oh well, all the ladies that worked there seemed nice, lots of hello, goodbye and thank you greetings. I would try again and maybe sit at the bar according to other reviews :)
