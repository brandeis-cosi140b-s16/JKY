This is reliable Mexican/American style food that is always tasty and has yet to disappoint.  The salsa is good, the chips are hot and the margaritas are always great.  I have never had anything less than great service here also.  They were even very patient and helpful when I went there with my nephews and niece who had never tried Mexican food before.  This is a safe place to take visitors from out of town who want to try Mexican.
