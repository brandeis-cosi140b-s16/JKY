Ordered swordfish.  Free appetizers all you can eat chips and salsa.  Drink- 3 amigo. 

Pros- swordfish is delish and well balanced with rice and asperrigous.  Chips are unlimited.  3 amigo is my favorite drink now.  5 stars.  

Cons- salsa was too spicy. Portion was less than expected.  Service was acceptable, but slightly higher in price.  3 stars.
