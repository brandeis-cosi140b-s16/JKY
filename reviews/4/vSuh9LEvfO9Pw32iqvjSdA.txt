Why anyone would go to Pasqual's while this place exists is beyond me. This typical Mexican place is priced affordably. The food is not anything that will blow your mind, but it's good. Really good. I had the burrito suizo, and found it to hit about every Mexican craving I get twice a week. Meat, beans and rice? Check. A rich and gooey cheese sauce layered over everything? Check. I ordered a side of pico de gallo and layered that on every bite to have as delicious of am Mexican experience as I've had anywhere in Madison.

If you're in the downtown area, it's hard to find better Mexican than this.
