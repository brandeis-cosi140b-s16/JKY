This review is long overdue! After many drunk nights and cheat days, I've resorted to this delicious place for comfort. 

Laurita's is comparable to Roberto's, but just so much better. The menu is pretty much the same as well with tacos, burritos, enchiladas and all that delicious fatty goodness. They load their burritos with more meat. Their taco shells are crunchy and not break-your-teeth-hard like Roberto's. My food isn't dripping in grease either. I already know that this food isn't good for you, so I don't need to see the big oil puddle. And besides the typical red and green salsa, Laurita's also has this avocado/cilantro salsa that is freaking delicious!! I always get 4 or 5 little containers of just that salsa and drench all my food in it. Food always comes out quickly. 

I'm a huge fan of this place and I'll definitely be back.
