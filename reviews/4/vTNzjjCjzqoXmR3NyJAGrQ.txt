Delicious food, chips and salsa were good, margarita solid but not very strong. Combination tacos were freshly made, tender meat, with very good flavors. Flan creamy and delicious. Waiter Neal was very helpful and friendly. Chef/owner Paco came over to visit and explained everything is made fresh, they don't reheat the meat over and over like a lot of other places. Will definitely make this a regular visit when I'm in town. Little strange that it shares a building with a huge strip club but it's a separate space with its own entrance and this is Vegas so expect the unexpected! If margarita was stronger it would have been 5 stars.
