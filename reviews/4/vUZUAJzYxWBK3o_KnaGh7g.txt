I have been going to this Chipotle for about two year now. Love Chipotle!! Most of the time to get the food to go. The quality and quantity of the food has not changed at all. Everything is fresh and delicious every time. I get my usual, burrito with chicken, black bean, rice, cheese, and a little sour cream. Add a bag a chips (whatever fall out of the burrito is scooped up by the chips. YUM! We just went tonight.
