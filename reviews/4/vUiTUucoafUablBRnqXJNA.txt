Went here for dinner and left very full and satisfied.  The family that runs the restaurant is originally from Globe so the Mexican food here is similar to what you'd find in the Globe/Miami area.  Stepping into this restaurant, it feels similar to how other restaurants such as Serrano's and Rosita's feels: Comfy atmosphere serving homestyle, no frills cuisine.  I had the special tonight: 2 chicken enchiladas with green sauce with rice and beans ($8.50).  While the enchiladas looked a bit mangled since chicken pieces were sticking out of the tortilla and the tortilla itself looked prodded and broken, the enchiladas themselves were quite tasty with the green sauce and the rice and beans.  I'm usually a lightweight when it comes to finishing meals, but in this case, I cleaned my plate!  The salsa tastes good, but is very watery which makes it hard to eat with chips.  We ordered iced teas and they were refilled promptly as needed.  I'd definitely be interested in going here again for some tasty and filling meals.
