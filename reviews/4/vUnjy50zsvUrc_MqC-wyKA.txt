Terrific experience. This was a great lunch experience for me at Top Shelf. I had the Pollo Fundido chicken burrito and it was deeeeelish!

I chose to sit on the patio outside and was the only one there so my service and attentiveness was lack luster, but the food was worth the wait.

I'll remember this place!
