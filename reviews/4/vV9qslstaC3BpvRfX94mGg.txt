Love the flautas from here! They are so moist inside. The lunch specials are a great price at about $5! They have canned soda which I prefer! I hate paying 2.50 or 2.75 for a fountain drink when I usually only have one glass. Service is always good. The only thing I didn't like were the enchiladas. I was really disappointed. It seems like they took a soft corn tortilla put white cheese in it and put it in the microwave. They sprinkle a bit of white cheese on top that isn't melted. I prefer the usual enchilada with cheddar cheese baked and melted cheese.
