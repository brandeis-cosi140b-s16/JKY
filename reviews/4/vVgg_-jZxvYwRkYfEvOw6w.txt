Sinaloa does not look like much from the outside. Well, lets be honest, it doesn't look like much from the inside either.  That is okay, in this town, that is usually a good sign that you are about to have a killer meal.  That thinking did not fail to prove true, Sinaloa is fantastic.

When I ask my friends which Mexican seafood restaurants they like around town, I usually get this return glare that says "are you being serious?"  Yes folks, the Hispanic community can cook(or crudo) seafood the same as the rest of the world and it is good.  

I usually get the cold squid appetizer.  It is a salad of squid, lettuce, spices and it just delicious. I have never ordered this and left any on the plate. This dish has converted more than a few people to the treasure of Mexican seafood.  My dad loves the filete de chef, which is a large fillet of fish cooked with the chefs special sauce on a bed of rice.  I love the seafood stew which is always filled with goodies like fish, shrimp and squid.  

Do not expect the bill to be cheap if you eat like I do, but certainly reasonable for the quality and quantity you are offered.  Four stars for this restaurant, I will be back soon!
