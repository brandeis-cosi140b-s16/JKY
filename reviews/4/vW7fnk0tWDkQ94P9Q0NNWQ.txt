Solid legit Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  We stumbled upon this place accidentally.  When we walked inside, we noticed that the Taqueria was cooking up literal street tacos outside next to the building, and the smell was great.  We probably could have stopped there and been satisfied, but instead we headed inside, where I ordered my usual enchiladas and my husband got his usual encebollada (or whatever equivalent steak is offered on the menu).  Steak was delicious, enchiladas were about average (a little more offerings on the veggie toppings would be helpful).  It looks like the restaurant offers a lot more home-cooked specialties as well, like sopa de pollo, which I remember fondly from Honduras.  I would definitely return to grab some cheap street tacos or some other authentic Mexican dish, but I probably wouldn't order the enchiladas again, just because the Taqueria has so many other tasty-sounding options.
