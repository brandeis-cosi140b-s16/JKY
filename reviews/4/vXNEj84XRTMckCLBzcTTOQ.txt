Candyce B was right again - Monterrey was awesome!

Tucked away in a strip shopping center off of Park Rd (near Black Lion, behind Wendy's), this is the typical small Mexican restaurant that delivers good, cheap eats.  I think this Monterrey has been around for a LONG time (since I was in high school and that was back when Hwy 51 was only 2 lanes...).  I was immediately seated when I walked in, but it took a while for my waiter to get to me.  Though once he did, he was attentive and expedient.  As soon as I was seated, a basket of warm, tasty chips; a small saucer of their salsa, which was a deep red, maybe roasted ingredients?, and not loaded down with cilantro, so I was in love; and a little bowl of heaven, which has been described in the other reviews as white dip, which tasted a little like a thin sour cream with taco seasoning in it - YUM!  It was all I could do to not fill myself up on these 3 delicious starters.

My order:
Queso with jalapeno dip ($5) - I have to order queso whenever I go to a Mexican resturant - it's an addiction.  A delicious, dairy addiction.  Served in a large dish, it was very good - perfect thickness without being too thick.  The warm chips held up well.
Beef burrito + beef taco + rice lunch special (less than $6) - the taco was in a shell that held up to my crunching, filled with mostly beef, with a sprinkling of lettuce and a healthy dose of shredded white cheese on top.  The beef burrito was a medium size, filled with the same beef as the taco, covered with red sauce and a sprinkling of cheese.  Served with spanish rice that was on the better side of the rice that I have been served at Mexican restaurants - quite good.
They serve Pepsi products, so I had a Mountain Dew, which for some reason was the most delicious Mountain Dew I have ever had.  

The dip, lunch entree and drink were right around $13 - I was completely stuffed, but not miserable.  I will DEFINITELY be returning, delicious!
