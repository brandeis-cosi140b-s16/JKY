El Cancun is no more. Closed. Fini. Terminado. Yesterday was their last day. According to the staff (who took great care of us even though they were starting to run out of stuff), there are some needed repairs that the landlord isn't interested in making. So they're closing and moving to a spot not yet determined. I didn't get a lot of confidence that it's going to happen or that they can keep the vibe that they have here.

It's a bummer because I like Corona with a lime. And I like chips and salsa. And their chicken chorizo with rice and beans is pretty darned good as they cover it with white queso. Yummy. What's "heart attack" in Spanish?

Adios, El Cancun. It's been great.
