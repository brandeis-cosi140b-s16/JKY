I've been about a half dozen times for the food, which is pretty good.  Not superb, but pretty good... with your standard mariscos fare -- I seem to always get their campachana, but the fried tilapia is good, too.  

I discovered it about four years ago when I first came to Vegas as a tourist and didn't want to eat on the strip.

What is a treat are the mariachis who are here in abundance, especially on the weekend.  Reminds me of the affairs I used to see in East LA -- all locals all the time and families in abundance.

I was here once where I think they had no less than four FULL mariachi bands going one after another and typically they have at least one group playing, walking about.

It doesn't look like much on the outside, next to a small strip mall, and with nothing significant about it; but trust me... it's worth going to at least once.
