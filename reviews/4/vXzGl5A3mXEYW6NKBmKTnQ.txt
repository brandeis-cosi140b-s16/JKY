The Tamale Store makes some of the best tamales around!  Finally got a chance to try them at the local farmers market and have been hooked since.  With guests coming for Christmas, I decided to purchase some tamales for some holiday snacking.  We got a variety of flavors and all were marvelous.  We particularly enjoyed the pork red chili and the chicken green chili.  I love how much meat they pack into these babies as well as the soft masa, which is full of flavor.

The Tamale Store is surely my go-to place for a fabulously convenient and tasty tamale!
