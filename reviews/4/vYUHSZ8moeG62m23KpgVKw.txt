The shredded beef nachos were incredible. We ordered the fish tacos & they were way too salty. I told the waiter in a respectful way that I wouldn't recommend that dish. He saw that we didn't eat them & came back with the tacos off of our bill, no questions asked. Great service, I would come back again.
