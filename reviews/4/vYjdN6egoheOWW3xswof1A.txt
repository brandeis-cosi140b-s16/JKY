Ooooh, more of a 4.5 rating.

So many wonderful things to say about this place. Thank goodness for living social deals that introduce me to new favorites!

Unassuming from outside. It is located in a run down strip mall with limited parking. But once you go through those doors you are transported to a dia de los muertos paradise. Really cool decor with awesome art on the walls. Love the bathroom doors!

Service was warm, informative, and attentive. 

Salsa bar. Wow, what can I say? I consider myself an expert on Mexican food, as a Mexican-American myself and a native of Arizona. But I have never seen these sort of salsas in my life! Peanut salsa? Strawberry salsa? Yum. 

My husband had the dogfish shark taco dinner and I had the veggie taco dinner. Yummmmm. Hubby loved his tacos and I had the BEST veggie tacos of my life. The cheese in the tacos is delicious. The beans and rice were great too. 

I had their house margarita which was so different and refreshing. It had a hint of grapefruit juice which I loved.

My only (very minor) complaints? They charge for chips. Only a couple bucks but I wish I was warned before I saw it on the receipt. 

Also, I saw a tiny bit of unidentifiable meat in my taco. It must have gotten mixed in accidentally on the grill. Hey, it happens, but it can really unnerve a vegetarian.

Love this place. We will definitely be back, preferably during happy hour when I can knock back a couple of their margaritas at a discounted price. :)
