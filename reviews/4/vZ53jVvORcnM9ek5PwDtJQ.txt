This place doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside it has a cute diner feel to it. The staff is pleasant. They have 2 TVs on opposite sides of the room tuned to the same Spanish show. They also have a jukebox and occasionally play music. They have a nice variety of meals to choose from including meals designed for 2.
  They have horchatas (no refills- waitress gave me a look when I asked for no ice- I hate paying for a glass half full of ice), which in my opinion every Mexican restaurant should offer- I love cinnamon  :)  They also have some really big margaritas. Bf loves the different types of salted rims they have- he gets Modelo with a spicy rimmed glass.
  This was our second time. Both times he ordered green chilaquiles, and he says they're good, score 8/10. Last time I ordered the chicken burrito- very good. This time I tried to order chicken tamales, but all they had was pork. So I got the chicken enchiladas plate. I usually like enchiladas, but I don't usually rhapsodize about them. However, these were so good that I actually cleaned my plate! I can't remember the last time I ate the entire portion a restaurant gave me, and I wasn't starving, but these were really good 
  Looking forward to our next trip. Thanks El Ausente  :)
