Loved our dinner at Mejico! We had exceptional service from Cody and the food and drinks were delicious. Another review mentioned the quality ingredients behind their drinks - that's spot-on! No pre mixes here. Fresh lime juice and fine tequila make them a lovely accompaniment to your meal. I had the Ahi Tuna tacos - delicious! Thick chunks of Ahi tuna with fresh avocado and red onion. Quality ingredients to be sure. Can you get heartier plates elsewhere? I'm sure you can but for atmosphere, service and quality food/drinks - Mejico is hard to beat and that's saying something in an ocean of Mexican food possibilities.
