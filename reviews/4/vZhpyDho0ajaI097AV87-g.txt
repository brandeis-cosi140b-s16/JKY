I like this spot. I liked the staff, atmosphere and food. 
We were in a big hurry and explained this to the waiter, and they brought our food out super quick! 
They staff was extremely attentive and friendly. 

We ordered the guacamole, which they make fresh right at your table.  It was very good. 
Then I orders the steak fajitas.  They were decent, but I've had better. They did however put grilled tomatoes in with the meat, peppers and onions, which I liked. They also have amazing fresh flour tortillas that really helped bring up the flavor in the fajita. 

If only I wasn't driving, I would have been able to rate the margaritas for you too. 

Overall, I really did like the place. I would definitely come back here again.
