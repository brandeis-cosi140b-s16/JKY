I usually don't write a review on fast food, but I really like Qdoba and their chips.  I really, really like them.  Everything is fresh and quick.  The best part is we got a free lunch (won by my co-worker) for 10 of us yesterday.  How cool.  I will continue to go there and use the rewards card, too.
