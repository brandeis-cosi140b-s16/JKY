I'll get this out of the way first - I do see the comparison to Chipotle, but I personally don't even like Chipotle but really enjoy this place! 

The menu is much larger than Chipotle's and has some yummy things I haven't seen other places. I'm a sucker for their pesto sauce - it's incredible. They also offer sweet potatos and regular potatos for your bowls or burritos. Their queso is pretty awesome too, we always have to get a side of it! Prices are on the high side, but the quality is great. When I'm low carbing I get a bowl with a smidgen of black beans, white meat chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, cheese, and pesto sauce and I'm a happy camper indeed!
