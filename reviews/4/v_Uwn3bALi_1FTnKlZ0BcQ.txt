I went here a couple of weeks ago for breakfast. 

The free chips and salsa we got were sooo good! The chips were so light and crispy and the salsa was perfect with it! I couldn't get enough of them.

Our waiter was pretty attentive as well. He kept filling up our glasses of water when they were only halfway. The only problem with drinks that I had was that I ordered an orange juice and it came in such a small little glass and it was like 3 bucks!

I ordered the huevos a la mexicana and he ordered the Machaca con huevo. I really enjoyed my food, it was so authentic and ooh soo good!  Our plates both came with tortillas on the side. We got the flour tortillas instead of the corn and they were so fresh and so yummy! I could eat them as a snack!  

I would definitely recommend their Mexican breakfast, just beware of the pricey OJ!
