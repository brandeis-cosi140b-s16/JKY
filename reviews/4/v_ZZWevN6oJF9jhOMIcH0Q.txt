Me and my girlfriends always come to Diablo's when we are in Vegas. Mainly for two reasons:
1. The delicious food
2. The pitchers of delicious alcohol they have available

I usually tend to get the chicken soft tacos, which are delicious. And I love their chips and the three flavors of salsa they serve them with. Also, you can't wrong with a pitcher of Margarita! 

The only thing that makes me deduct a start off this place is the service from the hostess'- they were super catty to me and my girlfriends when we were there and tried sitting us at a small bar table when we had previously asked for a more secluded table, which was available and which we ended up getting upon request. 

Overall, if you are willing to wait the usual 45 minutes, this place is worth it. A good place and environment to start off your Vegas experience on the right foot!
