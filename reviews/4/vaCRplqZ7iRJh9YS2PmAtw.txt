Little slow to get to me sitting at the bar, but was greeted from a far! The bartender was busy but very good! Had the Mexican chopped w/ chicken just as well had something more exciting! It was good but no calories saved on the salad. I would encourage the business not to cut the chicken so small you barely know you have any. SLICE THE MEAT!! That's what really made this a four star vs five star. Michalata yeah!  NO CLAM JUICE yeahhhh!!!! So glad to find a good michalata one made without the clam juice clams ruin the beer! In the old days a bloody beer, but the michalata has flare and great taste sort of a Bloody Mary with a beer but drank together (make sure no clams involved) !
