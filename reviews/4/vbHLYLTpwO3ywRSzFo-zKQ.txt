We visited this place on Cinco de Mayo. We came a bit later after their events and music must have taken place, and were seated almost right away. Our server was nice and energetic and made some great recommendations for food and beverage options. I ordered one of the specialty margaritas, the Gypsy Rose, that had Patron Silver, prickly pear and lime. It was just the perfect amount of sweet and sour. I also ordered a second marg at happy hour, a strawberry marg on the rocks. Also delicious.

We ordered the chimi bites and the $2 tacos on Tuesday. The chimi bites were amazing. The $2 tacos....not so much. I was almost full when I got them, but I thought they lacked flavor. I want to try some of the regular plate tacos next time because those sounded really great. The "new" shredded beef or chicken tacos look delicious.

For the price and the variety of specials, this place is a good find!
