- Great salsa, especially if you mix the red and green together; however, the chips are only mediocre
- Very tasty refried beans
- Amazing chicken mole enchiladas.  That little kick they throw in is outstanding
- The enchiladas suisa were amazing.  Great green chili sauce

I'll be back to sample more of menu.
