Ok, now granted, it's been two years, but the reason I'm doing this review is more for myself than anything...  I'm trying to organize all my favorite eating places, and by reviewing them, I have a place where I can log-in to remember them.

What I can offer, although it HAS been a while, is that the Tortas were always VERY good.

My ex-girlfriend turned me onto them, and I discovered how hard it is to find good tortas (Mexican sandwich - basically pita bread, asada, rice, onions...).

The tortas here are very good, even for a low rent food joint like Robertos. 

It's cheap eating at it's best.

Even though in Vegas you have a multitude of options, this is a place where you can get good mexican tortas, for quite cheap.

It was always our place to go, when we wanted to eat off the strip (get in and get out).

Hope this helps.
