I like coming here for a big, cheap mexican meal. Order the breakfast burrito. Comes with ham or bacon. Ingredients: scrambled eggs, hash browns, tortilla. Its pretty sizable, at least a pound of food. The salsa bar has a choice between the green and the red sauce. 
At 6 am, theres maybe one or two other patrons so I get to enjoy my meal in silence. The service was friendly too.
