We love, love, love Macayo's.  The margaritas are fantastic!  I prefer the strawberry ones but the regular mags are smooth too!  Bring your Senor Bob or Cha Cha mugg and they are even cheaper.  Yum!  Try their mini chimichangas.  Stay away from the free food during happy hour...looks a little sketchy.
