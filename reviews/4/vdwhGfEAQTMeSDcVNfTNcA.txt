Probably my favorite place to get drinks when it's warm in Pittsburgh. Mexican, too, though the competition is practically nonexistent. 

The good: nice outdoor seating area; guacamole; tacos are good (better than Mexico City; a little behind Yo Rita), my favorites being carnitas and al pastor; Sweet Tea and Basil Juleps; cheap sangria pitcher specials (see below)

The bad: service is really hit or miss, with numerous food and drink orders seemingly disappearing into the void; chip baskets are laughably tiny, forcing you to track down a waitress and order another ($1) basket to finish your guacamole; inside is cramped and especially crowded when patio is closed

The ugly: seating is all "honor system". I went here a lot when I lived in Pittsburgh, and rarely had issues with claims of seat stealing (thrust upon me or by me upon others) but it's ridiculous to have to sit and hawk and hover about tables waiting for something to clear up at a place as crowded as this can get. You sit, waiting with your group, trying to have a conversation, but have to be constantly vigilant to see if a party's leaving and keep track of who's in front of you in the imaginary queue waiting for tables (and who should be behind you, but maybe didn't get that memo). 

I haven't been here since I moved from Pittsburgh a few months ago, so it's possible some of these service qualms have been resolved. If so, I'd happily give this place 5 stars.

Oh, and they have daily specials (updated on their Facebook, these might be outdated):

MONDAY - $3 Michelada
TUESDAY - $3 La Cantina Margarita
WEDNESDAY - $3 Dos Equis Draft
THURSDAY - $4 Sangria
