I typically drive past this place every day coming and going from work. I decided to stop in and give it a try. The restaurant was not very busy when I arrived, which was nice because the menu was large. I decided to try the chimichunga - and am I glad I did!  I went with the carne asada and it comes topped with lettuce and a bit of guacamole, a side of beans with cheese, and rice.

The rice was moist and flavorful. I was impressed. The beans were fairly standard beans. When I made it to the chimichunga, woah Nellie. I think it was the best tortilla I have ever had. It almost tasted like a waffle fry at the fair (but no powdered sugar). It was not huge, but it was very filling. It was so tasty I ate the entire thing. I will definitely be back for more!
