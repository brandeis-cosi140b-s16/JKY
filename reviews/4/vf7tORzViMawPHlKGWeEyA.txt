This place needs better signage.  The only reason I found out about it is because my neighbor told me about it and I'm in this little strip mall at least twice a week.  To think that I could have been eating here, but haven't because I didn't know about it, for the past year makes me a little sad.

The food so far has been very good.  No skimping on flavor going on. The green chili pork stew is wonderful.  The carne asada tacos pop with flavor.  The salsa bar is a great touch.  I can't wait to try the pozole this weekend.
