I discovered this place a few weeks ago (always love Mexican food!) and I have been there three times since!  Food is amazing!  I had two enchiladas, rice and beans for their $5 special and it was amazing!  It is family-owned and I have had the pleasure of speaking with the owner and each of his two children who work there  throughout the course of my 3 visits there.  I live almost across the street from it and didn't know it was there.  It adjoins the Doc Holiday's that is in the Target Shopping Center.  Service is great, food excellent and the family who runs it, has great pride in their restaurant and it shows!
I highly recommend it!
