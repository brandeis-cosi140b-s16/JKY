The place is casual and a bit trendy.  I think the staff could be more modernized and with a better touch of vogue, but with effects of the economy, I completely understand.  The food is great,  i recommend the burritos.  Also, the best guacamole i've ever had resides here along with their chips.  Salsa is great too, but the guac is quite flavorful.  It is quite clean in the restaurant and i would most certainly go back.  The only thing that I'd like to see is a better staff.  Good for groups to go when you get a chance!
