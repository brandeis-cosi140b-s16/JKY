Delicious! The portions are huge and fresh!  Everything is made to order including the guacamole.  The fresh tamales at their food cart is what brought me to the restaurant.   I tried the guaraches.  It appears to be something like an open faced burrito.  The base is more like a flat tamale. It's a big round flat sheet of Masa.  It is then topped with refried beans, meat, lettuce, tomato, and some sort of sour cream I think.  I couldn't decide if it was sour cream or mayonnaise and it was probably a combination of both. Whatever it was it was good.  The burrito was huge and stuffed full of all the good stuff.  They have bottled beer, soda, water, and Horchata.  I didn't notice the Horchata right away or I would've ordered that instead.  Definitely will be going back.
