I do wonder if there are just so many Mexican restaurants in the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale metropolitan area that people get very discriminating if they are local.  In that, a place that to an out of towner like me would seem really good is critiqued more harshly by the locals.  

My take on this place after a friend brought me here is that the tacos are wonderful, the chips and salsa they give you are pretty good (I've had better chips out there), the Albondigas soup is something I don't get too often back home and I loved it, and that fried ice cream is to die for.  

Solid 4 stars in my book.  But I'm from Philly.  To me this place is great Mexican.  You locals may be more picky than I am.
