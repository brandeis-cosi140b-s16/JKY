A great thing about Serranos is how quick the food and drinks come out! This tends to be a spot we go to on Friday nights! They have a great house margarita!As soon as you sit down you are greeted with chips, salsa, and bean dip! (all very good) Then you order and bam your food is ready within 20 minutes hot and fresh. We've tried several things here tacos, burritos,chimichangas, fajitas, and enchiladas. The only thing I didnt like was the fajitas. They were overcooked and the meat was chewy! The only downside to this place is that when the snowbirds are in town its impossible to get a table before 8 pm.
