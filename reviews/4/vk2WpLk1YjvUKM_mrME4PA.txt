all and all not a bad place...   Like the other reviews... it does not win points for decor... but what it lacks here it more than makes up for in service... i go here for lunch from time to time and they always seems to be quick... i really like it when they serve you chips and salsa and they bring out some sort of mexican soup...

the food is good... i like the shredded beef tacos and the burros are typical south side... HUGE with alot of good stuff in them... while this is not my favorite place in the area... it is still pretty good and is pretty authintic...
