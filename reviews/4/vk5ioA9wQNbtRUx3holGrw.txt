The atmosphere here is "fun". Very open dining room with lots of hustle and bustle as well as noise. Therefore very kid friendly because they could make a lot of noise and no one would really notice. The food they have is very much a Southwest fusion with lots of chile used in their dishes. They even have a very good Ancho chile chocolate cake. Every dish here is delish so just find one that sounds good to you.
