We are always in search of great burritos and because we travel often it can be hard to find. We found this taco truck through yelp and are so glad we did. Not only do they have great burritos, but there is also a mariscos truck. We haven't tried the mariscos, only because they were closing early so we missed out. Definitely our go to place when we find ourselves in Phoenix.
