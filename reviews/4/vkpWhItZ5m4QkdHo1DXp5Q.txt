I used to love casa Don Juan until I came here yesterday. Everything seemed so different and the food was only ok. There was nothing special about the food and I am sure I could find something better here in vegas. The chips seemed to be a little old and the bean dip and cheese dip came out a little cold...  The waiter wasn't great and seemed to disappear when we needed napkins and forks. 
Something is different :( probably won't be coming back for awhile! 
Reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because they came out and sang happy birthday with maracas and a sombrero ! The cake they gave me was also pretty good ! Other than that, it wasn't the greatest... :(
