As others have said, the chips are really, really tasty.  The tacos were quite tasty, the rice was good as well.  Others have said they liked the enchiladas, but I didn't much care for the sauce on top of them, which kind of reminded me of canned chili.  Service was quite fast and accurate.  It was also a nice bonus to have a bottle of guacamole right there on the table.  Lunch prices were better than reasonable.  I will be back.
