I have been to Mi Patio a couple times in the past, but it has been a few years since then. After seeing so many positive reviews & recs on the place I knew I had to come back & refresh my memory of Mi Patio. 

My dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg. 

Chips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice. Hubby said chimi was ok, rice was good & burro was his fav. 

My next visit will for sure be sooner than a few years!
