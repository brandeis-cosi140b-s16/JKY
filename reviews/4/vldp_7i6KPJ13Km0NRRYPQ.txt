Ate here for lunch with my mom just last week. I got the sirloin steak with peppers and onions and 2 eggs. Come with guacamole salad, refried beans and mexican rice. 

Servings were ample, service was quick, food was very good with a nice kick to it. Salsa they use taste fresh and spicy, just how I like it. 

Mom got the chicken burrito with rice and beans and salad. I finished half her burrito which surprisingly had only chicken and cheese. No fillers with rice and beans like most places. Not sure the refried beans ate fresh or canned. I like real refried beans much more then the canned crap with lard added. 

Overall a very good meal with quick service and a good price to boot.
