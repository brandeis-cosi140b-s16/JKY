According to this reviewer, this is the best Mexican food in Matthews.  Each meal comes with a complimentary basket of chips and salsa, and the portions are very generous and generally delicious.  I highly recommend the Arroz con Pollo.  

Service is prompt and polite, and the interior is clean and charming in a constructed-before-we-were-concerned-about-stereotypes sort of way.

If you are in Matthews, this is a much better bet than Monterrey or that sketchy place downtown.
