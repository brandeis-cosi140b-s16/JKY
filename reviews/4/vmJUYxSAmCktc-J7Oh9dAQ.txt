Tasty, fresh, satisfying Mexican food.  The menu is diverse (but not too overwhelming) and ingredients are of good quality.  Unlike most "mexican" joints in town, Lindo Michoacan offers a wide range of authentic meals, not just the typical meat and beans drowned in rubbery cheese and bland sauce.  They allow the flavors of the ingredients to be the feature of the meal.  Plus, it's very vegetarian friendly!

Table-side guacamole preparation is a treat for some (although if you often make your guacamole at home it's not as enchanting as it is for some patrons), and an attentive and friendly wait staff avoid being overbearing.  This has become our staple "sit-down" neighborhood Mexican restaurant.
