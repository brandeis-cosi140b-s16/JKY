I have a very bossy friend who refuses to eat at chain establishments.  She insisted I meet her there.  While she didn't remember the name, we went inside and the cashier and her clearly had a friendly relationship because my friend followed up on her Thanksgiving plans. 

My friend ordered for me a chicken burrito.  I also had this crazy drink that was in large iced glass jars up front labeled by fruit names.  I got the orange, which was pretty tasty.

The burrito came with a bit of chips on the side.  I should have really just eaten half and saved the rest for later.  Instead, it was so good and we were chatting that I got 3/4 of the way through the burrito before I realized that I was too full to take another bit.

Besides chicken, the burrito had sauteed veggies, rice, and beans.  I would return and order for myself, but when someone offers to buy you lunch, you say yes.  The total bill was around $15 for two burritos and two drinks.
