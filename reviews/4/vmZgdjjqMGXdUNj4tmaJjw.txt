I tried a green chili pork Tamale and their special of the day Chile Relleno. I really loved the Chile Relleno. Crisp on the edges, plenty of melty cheese inside. The rice and beans were hot and fresh. Great!! I will definitely revisit.

It's tight on room in the dining area, and the line to order takes up half the room. There is a friendly atmosphere that made it feel like friends and family.
