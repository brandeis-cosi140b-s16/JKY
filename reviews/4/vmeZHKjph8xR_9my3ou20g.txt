When I saw the Ace Hardware across the street was gone, I was worried for Burrito Express.  I used to eat there regularly when I lived in Mesa, and was looking forward to enjoying it again.  I was relieved when I rode my bike up into the plaza and saw they are still open for business.  There's no bike rack, but they let me wheel my bike inside.  The guy behind the counter couldn't have been less helpful if he tried, but I eventually found the enchilada combo on the menu and ordered up.  These enchiladas are second only to Carolina's, as far as I'm concerned.  Their beans used to be too salty for me., but on this visit, they were quite tasty.  I like their red salsa a lot.  They get an extra star for serving fountain Pepsi; that's standard Yelping procedure for me.
