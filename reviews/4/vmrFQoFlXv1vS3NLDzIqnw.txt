I visited this place on a Sat night and they had live music. The music was too loud and made it difficult to carry on a conversation.  However the atmosphere was good. It's an old church that was converted to a restaurant. The food was very delicious. Not your typical tacos though. I had the urban bean coffee braised beef taco and chipotle cherry steak taco. Both were delicious. I think the tacos were a little over priced. Between $4-$5 per taco. The side of rice was dry and bland. I would recommend this place to s friend.
