I stop in after work once a week for the Carne Asada burritos, They are loaded with meat that is good quality ans stuffed, no skimping on this burrito, re fried beans and cheese delicious, don't really so much for the rice, very bland and unflavored. All in all though best Mexican food for the dollar anywhere
