We've been twice. First time we LOVED it...finally a good -- and better than good --- mexican restaurant in Madison. When I say better than good, I mean creative, imaginative, gourmet. 2nd time we kind of looked around a bit more. Food not as good and decor seems confused: it wants to be formal (there are white table cloths) but they should have lighted votives and get rid of the out of place round wicker rotating chairs. This place is so close!
