Wow, we rolled up for breakfast, and were pleasantly surprised.  My wife ordered a breakfast style burro with their green chile, and I asked if they had chilaquiles... WHICH THEY DID!

Yeah, its not on their menu, but the chef will whip an order up for you.  Their enchilada sauce perfectly complemented this dish.  Their chips and salsa were tasty, and my wife's burro was delectable.  Really, it was delectable.  I'm not just repetitiously writing the word delectable for the hell of it.

I'll be bringing the familia back to check them out for lunch, or maybe dinner fare.  And if Shakira happens to be in the neighborhood, she can come too.
