Badass Decor.   Incredible Salsa.   Great service.   Good food.

COME ON!    This place was closest to my hotel but I almost skipped it for a taco bar place because of these reviews about the food and salsa.    Lucky for me we decided to try it.   And to the reviewer with 1 * who says CHICAGO is home of authentic mexican?    I laugh at you.   I suppose if you think Chicago is authentic Mexican, then your 1* actually makes sense  (yes, I've lived in Chicago)

Old style bar (beautiful) and woodwork.   Cool patio.   Service prompt, thorough, often, and with a smile.    Huge spaces with tons of tables for large groups.

Salsa: They bring you two types.   In mini-pitchers so you don't run out.   And they are both GREAT.    And thick.   And spicy.   And "guaranteed authentic".

Fajitas were good.   Enchiladas were good.   Rice was good.   
Based on the rest of my experience I would assume most things there were good.
   
The Bad: 
No Micheladas.   Flour tortillas seemed homemade, but something was off - I think we got older ones / stale - either make them fresh or change your recipe - something there needs a change.
