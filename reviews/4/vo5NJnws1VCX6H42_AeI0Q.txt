Ordered delivery on a Saturday night and wanted to try something different.

I ordered a chicken burrito bowl with guacamole and a fish taco. The bowl was on special for $5.25.

I ordered through grubhub and delivery was kind of slow, a little over 1 hour and 10 minutes, which I guess is to be expected on a busy Saturday night. The ordering itself though was very easy and convenient on grub hub.

The fish taco was surprisingly good. The fish tasted fresh, and it was a fairly large size with all the toppings. I really liked the fish and the sauce it came with. My burrito bowl was also quite tasty. The honey grilled chicken was flavorful and appeared to be of good quality. There was no shortage of toppings, especially the guacamole I paid a ~$1.30 extra for, this was fresh and delicious. The portion was large enough to save half for later, too!

Overall for ~$15 delivered this was a pretty good deal. I'm not quite sure if it was better than Chipotle, but it was definitely cheaper for a comparable product. I would get Cactus Grill again for sure.
