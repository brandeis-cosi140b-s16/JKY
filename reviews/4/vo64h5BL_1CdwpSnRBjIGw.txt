Most people won't notice, but our kitchen at home has been torn apart to be remodeled for over a month, thus the writing of several reviews. NO appliances for my wife to cook her delicious meals. So we've been eating out almost every other night and the in-between days we have leftovers from the night before. So our local restaurants have been seeing a lot of us. Patron's has one dish in particular that we love and split because it is sooo hardy. It's their chicken, shrimp and vegetable soup!! The soup comes with about 6 nice sized shrimp, genuine white meat chicken, chocked full of veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots. You don't know whether you should eat with a fork or spoon. The flavors are great and in the cold of this brutal winter, this is just a great meal...especially if you add a fresh Margarita to your bill of fare.
