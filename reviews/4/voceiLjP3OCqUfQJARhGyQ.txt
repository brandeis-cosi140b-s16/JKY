This new taco shop was very clean. I had the fajita burrito which was very good and filling. my wife had the # 1 combo which was a taco and enchilada. Both the flour tortilla in the taco shell was very fresh as well as the vegetables and meat. I like the salsa bar with  the spicy onions and carrots. The salsa itself was okay. Bon Appetit.
