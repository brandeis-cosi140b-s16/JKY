I have to admit that I was a little bit surprised in that the food was actually pretty good.  I'm not sure why I was expecting otherwise.  I guess because from the outside it just looks like your standard cookie cutter Mexican restaurant.  Hell maybe it is.

I had a veggie fajita that came out, as it should, sizzling on a cast iron skillet.  The veggies were well prepared and flavorful, as were the beans and rice that came with them.

The only complaint I have is with the horchata I drank.  It tasted OK, but it was too rich.  Like they ran low on rice milk and supplemented with cow milk or something.  It also left a slight film in my mouth which is a quick way to get me to dislike anything.
