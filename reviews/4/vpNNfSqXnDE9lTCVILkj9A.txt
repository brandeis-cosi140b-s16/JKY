I am somewhere on the fence of A-OK and Yay! I'm a fan.  Maybe it should be a half star of YAY-I'm an OK Fan.  I popped in today around 230p, starving and in a hurry.  I sat down, the only person in the restaurant, I was greeted very pleasantly.  The chips were ok, the salsa was delicious, not dumbed down and they served that devilish mayonaise sauce that isn't all that good, but it's so bad for you, you can't resist it.

I ordered the lunch special #8 for $4.95, I didn't care what it was, I didn't even give a meat preference, very unlike me. My food came out very promptly, I started inhaling it.  It wasn't the best Mexican food, I'm not going to tell you to rush out and try it, but there was something very comforting about the whole meal.

I notice they have daily drink specials.
