This place has super yummy food, I love the Carne Asada wet burrito. The meat is a little chewy sometimes, but the flavor is SPOT on. Mmmm so amazing. Id be here everyday if it wasnt for my pregnancy causing everything to give me heartburn haha. They have super yummy tacos, although I think they could offer free guac and sour cream for the prices they charge for a taco plate. I plan on coming back again to try their tamales and enchiladas. Ive been here twice so far, and once for take out as its right up the road. literally 3 minutes walking haha. They could easily capitalize on having such a huge complex so close if they offered 10% off coupons to the complexs on the same road, and posting their menus on doors (not to mention their customer base would shoot up). 

Either way this place is amazing. I knocked off a star because there is NO seating usually except outside and that will be ridiculous in the summer heat. The place is small and the tables inside are taken always. I guess I will just be stuck getting it as take out. The outdoor chars are also super uncomfortable and offer no back support.

The owner is super sweet, gave us samples of this soup.. I can not remember the name but it had swordfish in in, and I was so surprised because it wasnt fishy tasting, it was so yummy and flavorful. It seems he and a woman are the only ones who work there. But Its just got a nice feel to it, almost cozy.
