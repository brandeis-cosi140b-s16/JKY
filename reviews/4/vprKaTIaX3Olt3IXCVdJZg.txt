5 for food...2 for ordering process and layout. I reluctantly forced myself to finally come back to the former site of Fado for the first time in a long time. The food did not disappoint at all, it's some of the best authentic Mexican food I've had here in Vegas. However, the venue is not big enough for the ridiculous ordering process. I can only imagine what it must be like when it's really busy, because it really wasn't when I was here, and was still very frustrating. Our food was mostly cold by the time the bartender finished with our 2 simple margaritas. Would be better served (even if at the expense of the "authentic"experience) as a sit-down place.
