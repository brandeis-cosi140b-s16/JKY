Eat here once a week.  I work at the airport and will always make a point to eat there when I can.  I use to enjoy the chicken delight, now I order the Carne asada.  I think its one of the best carne asada burritos I have ever had.   Yeah, it can be greasy, however, I always ask for my burrito with no oil or salt.   The service is always great.   The guacamole is good contrary to previous posts.  The "white" stuff in there is cottage cheese and it makes a great combination.    The alternative is Paradise bakery or Burger king, both with long lines.  Good choice to satisfy your hunger.
