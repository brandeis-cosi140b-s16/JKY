This is a great place for the whole family!  This location does not very crowded like the other ones.  Plus who can complain about the nutritious and delicious food.  Being a vegetarian I always order accordingly and have never gotten sick.  My father and my step brother usually accompany me and they indulge in the meat options, which they tell me taste delicious and are perfectly cooked every time.  Highly recommended and with affordable prices, I suggest switching out the regular fast food joint for your local Chipotle
