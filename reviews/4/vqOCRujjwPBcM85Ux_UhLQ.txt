The 4 star rating is for the food, because it is delicious! However I would give 2 and a half stars for the price because I cannot leave without spending $15 every time. ( the food is worth it I suppose) and I alternate between 2 and 4 stars for the service. Because depending on the time of day and who is working you will receive wonderful service or terrible service. I think the staff in the evenings needs to be evaluated, however as a whole it is great food. And the environment is clean.
