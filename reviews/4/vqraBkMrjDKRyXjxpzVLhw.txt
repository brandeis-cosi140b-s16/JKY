OK....been back (2) more times to this Federico's (in Surprise).  The customer service has been outstanding.  The restaurant has been clean.  Food has been hot, and took others advice and stuck to the tacos.......Holy Frijole!  THEY ARE AWESOME!  Got the shredded beef tacos with an Horchata.......I am SO WOW'd by these (2) visits, that they made me take the time to update my initial review/impression from a 2-star to a 4-star.  The people working there, the service, the Tacos...well....YEP, HAPPY!
