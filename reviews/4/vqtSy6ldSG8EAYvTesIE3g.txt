I love America's Tacos!!!! I go to the one by ASU all the time.... way too much actually. The BF gets jealous when I go without him... that's how good it is. So yesterday when I was shopping with my friend at AZ mills (nine west outlet FTW), I remembered seeing that a location had opened here on FB the other day. So we went to the food court, and there was the America's tacos. This is awesome considering the nastiness that passes for food in most malls. I decided to try something new yesterday, which may have been a bad decision on my part, and got the carne asada torta with extra spicy salsa. I felt like this was not the best thing I have had from this restaurant. I know the salsa was much more mild than it has been at other locations. I think next time I will stick with the tacos, burritos, or vampiros (the tostada of the future....mmmm), although, the place just opened, so there may be some kinks still there to work out. My friend got what I would normally get, a carne asada burrito and an al pastor taco and said it was super delicious. We shared some chips and salsa, again the salsa wasn't really spicy (especially for extra spicy) and the chips were stale! So that was sad. Also, no happy hour or daily specials at this location, at least not yet, and, of course, no alcohol. I am really happy for America and her husband to open another shop, especially in such a good food lacking place like AZ mills.... but I will probably continue going to the ASU location.
