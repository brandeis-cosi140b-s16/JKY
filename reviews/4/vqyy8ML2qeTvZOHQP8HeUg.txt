I love their chicken tacos here, and their homemade salsa & chips. Staff are always very friendly. Food is amazing. Great atmosphere every time. Only thing I wish they had was a separate line for the to-go orders. I call ahead of time, and still have to wait in line to get my food, instead of just walking up, paying for it, going, and enjoying the rest of my lunch. Everything else is perfect. Carlos the owner is awesome.
