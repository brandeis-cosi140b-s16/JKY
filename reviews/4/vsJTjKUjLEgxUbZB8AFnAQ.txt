Macayo's has been a family favorite for years!  There staff is always prompt, friendly, and courteous.  There food is nothing extroadinary, but is always consistent (you always know what you are going to get each and every time!).  

They are constantly bringing back chips and salsa, where as other mexican restuarants seem to slack off a bit in this area.  

Their margarita mugs are a good deal, you can bring em back each time for a $3.99 refill and then upon departure they will rinse out and bag up for you.  

Overall I reccomend this place.  

Side note:  I attended a rehersal dinner here and they were great!
