I haven't been to this place in about 5 years or so, last time I was here was when their location was over on university.  They got moved out by Tempe selling that location to build a high-rise condo thing that failed and now that location sits as an empty lot (except for one building)

Anyways.... went here for a lunch meeting suggestion.  Place was pretty busy, we didn't have to wait to get a table but it looked packed all the way back at lunch time on a friday.  Good deco. Clean. Very busy mill ave vibe. Lots biz lunch meetings going on and yet it remained a good volume in there to have a meeting and hear everything fine still.

Ordered food and got it out on the table fast.... no I mean like FAAAAST!  I didn't time it but it couldn't have been more than a couple of minutes MAX.  Like FAST.  Okay you get it I know.  Service was very friendly as well.

Hard to explain but the food was light... most mexican food you walk out feeling like you have a bowling ball in your gut... Not here... It didn't seem greasy like most places and everything up to the tomatoes were very fresh and crisp.  They used Asadero cheese on top, which is super good, not many places use it anymore.  Not the Gringo cheese you get like at macayos or anything.  The rice was really good and flavorful too.

To view the flip side of this review... I wasn't a big fan of the chips and salsa. Chips seemed semi-fresh but really thick, I like a lighter tortilla.  The salsa was just a red sauce.... tomato sauce with some heat... no chunks...  It seems to go with the "light" theme I mentioned earlier but I ended up not eating much of it at all - just wasn't my thing.  I like fresh tomatillos onion etc etc....

If we could do half reviews this would be a 3.5.  I gave them the shove to 4 because Restaurant Mexico is kind of a downtown Tempe staple - they've been around a long time and that's gotta count for something in this town.
