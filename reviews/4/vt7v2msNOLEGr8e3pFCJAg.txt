Those of you that know me, know I am always on the hunt for the best nachos in the world. I have to give Frank & Fina's an honorable "Damn these are good Nachos!" so why not 5 stars you ask? Well I will tell you.. price and portions. For the price of the nachos with grilled chicken I would expect a bigger portion size and more chicken.. a lot more chicken. So here is my recommendation to you the reader, order the grilled chicken nachos and ask them to make them enchilada style (I prefer the red sauce / you might like the green) they make a great appetizer among friends, if I am your friend then get your own damn nachos cuz this plate is mine!
