When I'm hungover we crawl to Los Taquitos and I usually get a big bowl of posole to heal my wounds.  It is so damn good.  They give you the necessary extras like red onions chopped, cilantro, limes, and tapatio.  You can either get corn (my preference) or flour tortillas to dip in your soup.  Out of all the things I have ordered, (besides the breakfast burritos) the posole is my absolute favorite and has never let me down.
