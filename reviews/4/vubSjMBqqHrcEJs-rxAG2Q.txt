Thursday night happy hour is half off certain appetizers and drinks.  I managed to get a real margarita (NO MARGARITA MIX) and a plate full of tacos al pastor for $8.25 before tax and tip.  I was hugely impressed by being able to do this in North Scottsdale and am willing to drive back up there for a second try.
