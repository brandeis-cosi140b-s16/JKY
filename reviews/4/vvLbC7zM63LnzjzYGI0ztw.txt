I'm a fan of del taco chain, so I thought I would try this out and compare it to the other del tacos I've experience. My first del taco experience was in Florida and they recently started opening chains there. That means new clean stores. This however is very old looking. You can tell the seating and tables have seen its day. I wasn't a fan of the condition of the store. But as an avid yelped, I wanted to stick it out and review it later.

The moment I walked in I was warmly greeted by the cashier at the counter. She gave me time to review the menu and suggested tacos and French fries. I probably should have gotten the fries. I got a number 1 which was three regular crunchy tacos and a quesadilla instead of fries. I loved the tacos. I included a picture and notice the orange oil that is a distinct look of Taco Bell taco is missing! I found the tacos to be satisfying! The quesadilla was just a thin tortilla and melted cheese and I wouldn't expect anything less. The first bite was good but I think I was in the mood for fries.

I also tried the inferno sauce which I thought added more to my meal. I will be back to try other items.
