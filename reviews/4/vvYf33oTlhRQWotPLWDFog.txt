Cute, cozy place. Our server was very helpful. They have a good selection of fish. I ordered the lobster taco special. They gave me the option of having it breaded or grilled. I tried grilled, and it was good. Like others have said it came with rice and beans. So with two tacos and the sides it was pretty filling. 

Overall it was good, but I probably won't go back. I love fish, but the baja/southern California fish tacos really aren't my favorite. Just personal preference.
