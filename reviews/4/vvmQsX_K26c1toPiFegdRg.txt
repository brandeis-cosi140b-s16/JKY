I am lucky enough to work with a few guys who are always in search of the best places to eat Mexican food, and thanks to my co-workers I have found Moreno's.

This small taco shop has become a regular spot for me, especially on Wednesday's when it is 99 cent taco day. 

Their Carne Asada tacos are absolute perfection. The Carne Asada is so flavorful and tasty, with onions, cabbage and cilantro. They are on perfect little flour tortillas, very thin so they double them up. Also don't forget to swing by the condiment bar and get some of their guac sauce, as I like to call it. A really refreshing Avocado sauce, with great flavor.

Their Tortas, and Sonoran hot dogs are really good too!

If you're ever around, stop by Moreno's, I usually get mine to go!
