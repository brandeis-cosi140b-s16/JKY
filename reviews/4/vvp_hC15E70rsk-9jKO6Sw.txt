about my 4th or 5th time here.....service is great....food has been great everytime.

had the lunch combo  taco, enchilada beans n rice $8.95  tastes great  wish it was cheaper for lunch but that is nothing more than sign of the times.  good salsa  mild and hot  chips are good, but could be warm.

they are in a 'tough' location  but well worth a visit,  have not been disappointed 

will post pic.
