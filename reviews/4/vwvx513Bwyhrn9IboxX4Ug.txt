I guess being a fan of Taco Bell (and posting about it) cancels out my ability to write any food review ever again, let alone be taken seriously. 
It's a basic fast food chain, most people find it gross and repulsive but I think it's heaven. Constantly traveling and being on the road I find myself craving Taco Bell quite often. Definitely not a good thing but it just tastes too damn good. 
Obviously if you aren't into fast food, this isn't the place for you. But if you're jonesing for a delicious 5 layer burrito at 1 am, you've found it!
I especially enjoy this location by my house because little over a year ago some mofos thought it would be a good idea to burn it down, and they succeeded. But instead of Taco Bell rolling over and giving up they decided to rebuild. And what an amazing job they did. The new Taco Bell is the best one I have ever seen. Good on Taco Bell for shoving it right back in those kids faces!
