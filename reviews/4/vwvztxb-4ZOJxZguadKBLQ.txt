I love this place! I moved to Madison from New Mexico, so I was understandably mourning the loss of my favorite Mexican restaurants back home. I can't say it's as good as those old favorites (hence 4 stars rather than 5), but it's consistently good, and you can't beat the prices. I've had every vegetarian item on the menu, and have been pretty happy with all of them. Their tortillas are fantastic, and I highly recommend the horchata.
