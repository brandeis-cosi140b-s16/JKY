We have eaten at Macayo's many times over the years.  We have always found the food to be fresh, perfectly prepared and the service fast.

We have our special Macayo's beer glasses that we take for refills that are cheaper than the the bar prices and they always clean them before we start and after we are done and wrap them up for us to take home again.

I would say this is the best, most consistent Mexican place we have found nearby and have never had a bad meal here or bad service.  They do a great job and we find at times we need our Macayo's "fix" and are never disappointed.

If you are there.......ask for Clenard, he is a fantastic waiter and just an overall great guy.

We bring visitors here and will continue to recommend it.
