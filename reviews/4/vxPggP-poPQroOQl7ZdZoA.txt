Wanna know how to ALWAYS get something good from this 'Bertos?

Order this:

Steak Egg and Cheese Burrito

That puppy will NEVER let you down.  Moist, tender, flavorful carne asada with fried egg (yolks cooked all the way - not runny) and artery-choking cheddar cheese.

It is a huge amount of food, and be sure to ask for 3 containers of red salsa if you are taking it "To Go" as you will need that many to have salsa with every bite.

The flavors meld together VERY WELL and this will hit both your salt craving and your protein sweet spot.  It's my favorite "fast food" burrito in town - and I've had a LOT of them over the last 15+ years of living in The PHX.

Guaranteed you will like this one, if you eat carne asada and eggs in any other setting.
