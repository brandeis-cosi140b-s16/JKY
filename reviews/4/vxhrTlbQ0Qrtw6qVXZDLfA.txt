We were in Charlotte over the weekend and this was among the few places open for lunch near our hotel (being from New York, we were surprised that so many places were closed on Saturday). We got lucky with this place though. We had the chile chicken tacos with plantains, the huevos rancheros, the chicken burritos and the mango crisp. We were very happy with our entrees and the plantains were some of the best I have had. The service was very friendly as well.
