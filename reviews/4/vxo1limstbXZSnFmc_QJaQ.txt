First let me say that our server Natalie (I'm had dark hair and was expecting a child in two months) was wonderful. They could have served dog food and we probably would have liked it given Natalie's personality and the great service she provided. 

I actually had a restaurant.com certificate from here. It was a $25 certificate that I paid a whole $2 for. With five us including sodas (no alcohol) our bill came to a whole $50 including tax and tip (after the $25 discount). Not bad at all given the location. 

Now for the food.. I loved that they served fresh chips with three salsas including one green salsa that was heavy with cilantro. It was amazing. I ordered the chicken tostadas and they were very good. The dressing they were served with was sort of sweet and just made the dish. The only thing that bothered me was that the avocados on my salad were a little brown. Coming from CA, I think I'm just spoiled with beautiful avocados so most probably wouldn't have noticed this. My daughter ordered the same thing and she liked it as well. My oldest ordered a steak burrito that I think she felt was average. She did like that they had black beans. My parents ordered enchiladas and they were pleased. 

If not for Natalie, I might have been tempted to give a three star review, but she was just great and I wish her all the best with her baby.
