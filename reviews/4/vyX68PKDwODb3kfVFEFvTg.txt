This is a slightly upscale location of the chain. The food is always consistent and they offer vegetarian options which is a  big plus. It is in the quality of Chipolte and Baja Fresh. The food is good for quick Mexican food. I would give the food 3.5 stars. The bar is a great addition and gets the extra star in my rating. Good staff, good food, its worth stopping in if you are on the strip or looking for a  good place to drink/eat without taking  much time..
