I am a frequent visitor of the Don Pedro!  Don't let the location detour you.  As long you come when the mariachi band isn't there - you're good!  I'm pretty sure my ears have almost exploded when they have played beside my table!  But for authenticity purposes, the band is pretty cool :)  Typical delicious mexican food - the queso is really good - margaritas are delicious and they give you free dessert at the end (which I never need, but always eat).
