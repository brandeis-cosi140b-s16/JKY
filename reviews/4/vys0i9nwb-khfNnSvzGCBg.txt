My go to spot for steak tacos in old town.  Fresh every time. Comes with only beans which are delicious but I get half rice gotta have em both. When me and my Co workers want Mexican there's no question it's here. Still hot and fresh for takeout as well which is a plus for me. Great crew working there w great authentic Mexican food.
