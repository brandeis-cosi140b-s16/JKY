As a big fan of ambience, I was a bit disappointed when we first walked in. However, that quickly disappeared. While the table arrangement was plain and decor not fancy, the overall feeling was warm, friendly, and cozy.  It's a small restaurant and quickly filled up.  

Service was excellent!  Not only were our servers attentive, but I was able to make my own combo plate that  was not shown on the menu. 

We began with some of the best guacamole all four of us had ever had.  For almost $5, it was a smaller portion than expected, but so good we were fighting to lick the last bits from the tortilla shell.  

The tamale (my favorite dish) gets a 5-star rating.  Moist, flavorful, and with a delicious green sauce, it was gone much too quickly.  Should have ordered two.  The server said that the restaurant was known for its guacamole (we agree) and chiles rellenos, which my husband ordered, along with an enchilada. Since he's Mr. Picky, I wondered how it would rate, but at the end of the meal he told the server that this was now his favorite Mexican restaurant.   

Our friends ordered a fajita mix (good-sized serving) and a combo plate that included a real crab enchilada.  We had planned on trying the deep-fried ice-cream or the flan, but no one had an inch of tummy room left.  

Prices are average for a Mexican restaurant in this area -- $7.95-$13.00 for dinner, less for lunch.  Rio Rico offers a good list of seafood entrees and is open for breakfast.
