This location is average, not as good as the one in Gilbert.
I ordered the Carne Asada taco, it's was good and lots of meat! They offer special everyday and so I added the Mondays "meal deal" of 3 rolled tacos with cheese. They offer only two salsas at their small little bar- a red ( it's ok) and a green ( not much flavor to it). At the other location I've been to they have a few more options for salas and the thick green one is the best!! I missed that here! They do offer radish & cucumber slices at no additional charge. Restaurant could use a good cleaning and someone on patrol with a fly swatter, but again it was just average.
