We have never actually ate in the restaurant but have gotten take out a few times. My latest decision, the meal for two number 1. Wow! That's a lot of food for $26 dollars. There were apps. Cheese quesadillas and chicken taquitos. There was an entree. Huge shrimp, chicken, steak, peppers, onions with cheese melted on top. Flour tortillas on the side. Speaking of sides. Everything you could ask for. A quart of rice! A quart of refried beans! Yikes. I wouldn't want to be around the person who ate those beans. Guacamole, salsa and sour cream. This was quite the Mexican feast! And the flavors were fantastic. My only criticism is that the entree consisted of mostly shrimp and was short on the steak. Overall, CM has great, authentic food for very reasonable prices.
