Yummy crispy burritos! It is like a giant ground beef taquito. I was introduced to these by my BF since he's from Seattle and they have Taco Times everywhere there. I was skeptical at first, but it's good fast food. Since the one in LA closed a few years back this is our closest option. We always buy a bunch when we are leaving Vegas and bring them back home. I wish there was one closer...
