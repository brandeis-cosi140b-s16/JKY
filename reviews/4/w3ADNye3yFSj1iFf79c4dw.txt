So many memories at this place. I have been coming here since I was a little kid. The staff has always been friendly. Serrano's has always had top tier quality bean dip and salsa to go along with their chips. Few restaurant rival them in that area. I know plenty of people who come here just for the chips and salsa so that should tell you something about how good they are. The food on the other hand is fairly average. The price for their food is pretty fair and a little on the lower side.  This location is right in the heart of downtown Chandler.
