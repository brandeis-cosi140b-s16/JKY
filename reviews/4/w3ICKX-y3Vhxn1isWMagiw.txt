Small and cozy local place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner at the bar or a table. Excellent New Mexico style cuisine utilizing the right balance of chilies. Highly recommend this place but don't get lost looking for their sign-don't think there is one and they really don't need one. Just park in front of the strip mall on the NW corner of Bethany Home and 16th st and you are there.
