It is as American as a an Americanized Mexican joint gets, without screwing up the food.

This place has such a simple concept, great organization, and consistency in their products and service.

Although, it's not an authentic Mexican joint, they do a great job at preparing kids and Americans who are uncultured to cross over to the true Mexican side.

The names of the dishes, as well as the presentation of many are all good, but they have tamed down their versions of these dishes to cater to a different crowd.

I recommend this place when you are on a quick lunch break from work.

The Chicken in the Pollo Fundido, is more flavorful, tender, and juicy than any of their competitors, such as Serrano's Garcia's, etc. They roll the marinated chicken breast into a burrito, deep fry it, then top it with Crema, and Cheddar Cheese. It is served with a side of shredded lettuce and rice. The consistency of this and other dishes has been there over the years.

They make their red chile salsa in house and keep it mild for the target audience. You get free chips and salsa with your purchase.

It is basically a Mexican fast food joint that makes things fresh and in house, but with a slight American twist.

They run a great, simple concept of a business. If you enjoy Mexican food that has been tamed down for the Weditos, then this is your place.

Salute! =)
