I showed up around 6:30pm and was amazed at the lack of vehicles in the parking lot.  By 7pm more people started showing up.  The service was excellent, everyone was very friendly.  My food was good starting with the salsa and warm chips.  I ordered enchiladas, a taco, and rice.  It was typical mexican fare to me with the exception of the carnitas taco, which was outstanding!  It was juicy pork piled high on two corn tortillas topped with fresh cilantro and onion.  I could overhear a local regular suggesting a friend order the chile poblano and tamale, while he himself was ordering the special burrito of the night.  He said, "it's all good, you can't go wrong" and I'm inclined to believe him.
