I went to Carefree Station for the first time and had brunch. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, especially the outside tables which were very romantic. It was way too hot out to sit outside though so we sat inside, which was pleasant as well. 

The wait staff is extremely attentive. We were seated with menus, and asked what we would like to drink within 1 minute of arriving. The menu is very eclectic, with fancy brunch options such as Crab Benedict, and Stuffed French Toast with strawberry cream cheese. I went for the crepes filled with mascarpone and ricotta cheese, covered in the cobbler for the day (peach). Dee-licious. Not to mention the complimentary champagne that gets re-filled when you're done. (Nice touch!)

My boyfriend had the breakfast burrito, which came with refried beans and potatoes. Of course, I had to sample his meal, and let me tell you...those potatoes were perfect. Just the right temperature so that I didn't scar the roof of my mouth; seasoned perfectly, and not too hard, not too soft. His burrito was good, but I wasn't in the mood for something so heavy so it didn't wow me. 

I am definitely going back to try the Crab Benedict, and enjoy some more champagne. This place has managed to jump on my list of regular joints in one try.
