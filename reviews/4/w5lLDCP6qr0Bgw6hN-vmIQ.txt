So I'm rewriting again my review of this restaurant. The service is typically really good, but I have to say the food is hit and miss. Sometimes great and sometimes just okay. They need consistency. I don't know how one day the salsa is excellent and the next just so-so and it seems like their tortillas are not always of the same quality. Still one of the best for Mexican food in the area.
