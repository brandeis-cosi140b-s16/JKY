When trying to think of things to say about Sal's that haven't been said already, it's very easy to avoid mentioning the pizza itself. So, i'll get that out of the way immediately: It's easily in the top 3 in Madison, if not #1. You only need to read the menu to know that you're going to get something good, as the concoctions and topping choices alone should tell you a lot about what you're going to get: Very fresh taste, and unique flavors. This alone obviously makes it worth a trip.

But like nearly every other restaurant in the world, Sal's is more than just one type of item, it's well, a restaurant. So how does it stack up there? I'd say decently, but not amazingly. When it comes to the space, it's definitely too small. Some would call it intimate, but i'd call it cramped. The only time there isn't a wait for a table is right when they open. While being a crowded place certainly helps the hype factor, it's a bit detracting from the experience. At the very least, they do allow take out, and you can order and eat at Johnson Public House, so that makes up for some of the space problems.

When it comes to their non-pizza offerings, I have mixed feelings. They're at the very least interesting, but not really for everyone. I've tried the burrata, and thought it was a good starter. I've also had the veggie tacos. Some people love these tacos it seems, but I was more "eh" on them. They definitely taste fresh, but they rely too much on the spice of the peppers to give it flavor. So to me, it turns out being kind of bland, and actually somewhat unpleasant. If you're into spice though, these may be for you!

So I think that Sal's do the pizza nearly perfectly, but they could tune up in a couple areas by tweaking some of the menu options. If they did that, then it would be a top-tier dining experience!
