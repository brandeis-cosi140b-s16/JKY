Not bad for a Chipotle-ish layout.  I tend to like the americanized Chipotle food better, but I've just had Bajio's salads so far.  

The only issue with the salads... they are SOAKED by the time you are finishing your meal, so it's not crunchy anymore.

Other than that, like the paintings on the walls, the mexican feel.  I hear the nachos are RIDICULOUS.  I will be trying more foods later on, but so far it's pretty good.
