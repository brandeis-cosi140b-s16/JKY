This is the first restaurant I tried once I arrived to the Phoenix area.  I had just spent 2 days crossing Texas, New Mexico and finally arriving into sunny AZ.   There was a short wait but nothing unusual for a weekend.  The chips and salsas were very addictive.  I have tried the chicken burro and the shrimp quesadilla.  I can't seem to get away from the shrimp quesadilla. The mango sauce is amazing; not too heavy yet not too light.  The only draw back to the menu was that they did not serve alcohol (at least when I was frequenting this place).    The staff is always very friendly and prompt but I can't say that for the customers.  Like most places in Gilbert there are children running around like wild monkeys.  One time I was eating dinner with my date and a small child ran up to our table and proceeded to fondle our tortilla chips.  We looked around but found no parent in sight.   To me it's a little too relaxed with the "family friendly" atmosphere and that has kept me from returning but if you are in the area do stop by and check it out for yourself.  I'm sure the meal will please you.
