A ray of light in a fog of way overpriced, arguably unhealthy food for blocks.

Chipotle usually gets 3 stars from me. It's reliable, does the fill-the-tummy trick, and I salute them for their sustainability chops, considering the chain's footprint, at this stage. But it's Chipotle. Not a mom and/or pop. And there's like not a whole lot of variation in the flavors you can get, when you go there; I usually get the same thing. Every. Time. But in Lost Wages, Chipotle is different. Even magical. 

I needed food. Preferably vegetarian, less than $20 for an entree, and within walking distance from Paris Las Vegas. I searched Yelp for an hour. Resigned myself to eat at the closest $$ Asian place, even though it didn't have very many vegetarian options (though the menu did say to ask, but I digress). But then, the clouds parted, and there was Chipotle.

At home in LA (that's Los Angeles for the tourists, not Louisiana), I eat Chipotle as a last resort. Here, it's a first resort amidst the panoply of resorts. That's a lot of resorts. 

There was a line. At 10:20 pm. There was a line when I left. Not longer than a lunchtime line at any busy Chipotle. You know the one. It moved quickly enough. I caught up on social media, as I wanted to avoid thinking about all of the awkward, as I stood in line by myself. 

One thing I was surprised not to have learned before: sofritos counts as a "protein," so even if you get a smidge of sofritos, like I do because in larger quantities they invariably give me acid reflux, guacamole is extra! Go ahead, take my money. 

But, Chipotle, your experiment to get people to eat tofu at an American quick food chain is going to fail, if you make people choose between guac and sofritos. Just telling it like it is.
