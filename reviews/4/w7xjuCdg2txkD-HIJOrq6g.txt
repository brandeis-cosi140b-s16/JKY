What better way to end your Vegas trip with more alcohol before your flight??  This restaurant is located within steps of the Southwest gates.  Me and my girls walked in Saturday around lunch time with one thing in mind: bloody marys!

They have a station at the bar where you can order drinks to-go; they'll put it for you in a plastic cup n send you off to your plane.  The bartender we ordered from was very patient with us.  We originally asked for 3 bloody mary's and the count kept inching up to 9 as the rest of our girls found us and wanted one for themselves! Not the best bloody mary but hey, it'll do if you're stressed out or just want to relax while waiting for your flight. Not bad for $9.88 each.

If you sit in the restaurant they have a variety of bloody mary's and serve it to you in a glass.
