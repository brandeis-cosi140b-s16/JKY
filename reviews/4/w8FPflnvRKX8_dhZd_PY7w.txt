First things first - Chuy has graduated from a food truck to a brick and mortar location:

2201 S. Maryland Parkway
Las Vegas, 89104
702-336-6631

The restaurant is a stand alone building about two blocks away from the old parking spot. It's on the east side of Maryland Parkway on the corner of Exley about a block north of Sahara. 

Now for the rest of it....

The owner Chuy is a very nice guy. He's passionate about his business and strives to provide great service. The food is made quickly and the portions are generous and loaded with flavor. The salsa bar has some spicy and mild selections along with radish and grilled peppers.  

I ordered:

6 tacos al pastor
2 asada multias

If I recall correctly, the total came to $21.63 or so. This might seem a little steep to some ($2.50 per taco/mulita) but the portions are very generous and the meat is very flavorful. It's also worth noting that Chuy - from what I could see - is no longer offering the smaller size tacos. Also worth noting is that the asada fries come in only one size - big! It's on the higher end at $7.50.     

Despite the great service and food, I am left a bit confused. When I look at the pictures from other Yelp reviewers I see the larger tacos filled with guacamole/avacado, sour cream and maybe even cheese? My order had what you would normally get with a taco - meat, cilantro, onion etc. but none of the extras that others had posted.

Not sure what's going on with that. I'll need to confirm all of this with Chuy on my next visit and will update this review once everything is understood (I take orders to go so had no idea until I got home).   

My only suggestion would be to tighten up the menu and pricing so it all makes sense. Once he does this and also gets the word out about the location change he'll be kicking butt and making tacos. 

Give it a shot, you'll love it!
