We were there last night for dinner.  I was a little concerned because of two recent negative reviews.  But our service was very attentive, and the food was served hot.  I had the Camarones and Rice, and my wife and daughter had combo platters with Enchiladas.  All of our food was good.  And the price was reasonable.  I would go back.
