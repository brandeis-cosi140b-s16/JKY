This is our usual tb so I gotta represent.

Good:
Chicken quesadilla

Bad:
Sometimes a long line

One time they forgot to give us the sauce... So not as good!  This last time the guy must have sensed it because he have us like 20 so he made it up to is:)

The order has never been wrong that I can recall.
