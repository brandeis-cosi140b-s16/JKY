Fun Mexican joint in the Hard Rock, I really like the chips and salsa they serve. the wait staff is always friendly and the gift shirts they sell are fun souvenirs to bring home. I always order the mojado burrito here with carnitas and I am never disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the sweet corn tamales are a must try, they were so good.
