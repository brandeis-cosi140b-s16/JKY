Upon entering, the patio is incredible!  I Once the temperature warms up, that will be one serious hot spot.  It's all set in a gorgeous 1920's villa, and it visually does not disappoint.  The music was slightly a buzz kill (Shaggy, Blink 182 , Smash Mouth, and other 90's songs..) but I'm hoping they'll work out the kink on that one.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly, happy to suggest items from the menu.  The items on the menu are all named from lines from movies, which is really fun!  Food was great - Wonderful chili queso, tacos are priced between $3-$4, sides additional, and I thought $9 for a small bowl of chili was a little steep.  They offer a very eclectic cocktail menu and frozen margaritas which is also a nice addition.  Overall, great place!  I knocked off a star for the music and pricing, and the fact that chips and salsa weren't free..  Other than that, a must try.
