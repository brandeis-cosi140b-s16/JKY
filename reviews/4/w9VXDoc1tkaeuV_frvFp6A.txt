In Fear of new Mexican places and running to the bathroom 30-45 minutes after a Meal, I was hesitant to try out Jesters,, I was driving by and thought a "GOOD" chicken Quesadilla would suffice for lunch... 

On Entry, this place is immaculately CLEAN, seriously.. Nice Job. I arrived a tad early, 10:40 as they were still setting up for the day. 

When I Ordered, I was told the chicken wasn't ready yet, but other options available,, grr, but then one option was Red Chili Beef... Hmm, ok, since the Tamales i got on Christmas SUCKED, I could use a good fix of Red Chili Meat... SO got that to go.. 

Red Chili Beef Quesadilla. Preparation, consistent as they prepare in front of you, Flavors on the meat, Juicy, Tender, n flavorful.. Wow,, don't think I will EVER get the chicken version again.. The guy running the show was VERY courteous, and polite. 

Will be back there SOON to try more options,, Great first impression guys !!

FYI: 45 min later, no urge to run to the nearest bathroom... A++
