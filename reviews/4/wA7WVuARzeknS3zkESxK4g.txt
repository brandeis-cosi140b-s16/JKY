If you can't find a spot to park, then there is a good chance you are about to eat a good meal! Cute quaint little restaurant. Outstanding made to order table side, guacamole dip! Generous portions, and super speedy service. There's nothing I hate more than to wait around for a long time for food with two small kids. Courteous staff too! This is only my second time eating there, I am certain to go back. And to save money, I will make sure to go at lunch time. The lunch menu will save you a few bucks, and you get the same great food!
