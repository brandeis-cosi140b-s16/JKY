This Taco Bell/Long John Silvers is awesome! My coworkers and I frequent this location pretty often and we always get good service, our food is made quickly, and the workers here are nice. I'd have to say this is probably the cleanest Taco Bell I've ever been to. If I'm going to eat food that's kinda bad for me, I'd at least like to have a pleasant experience doing so...
