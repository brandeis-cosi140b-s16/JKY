Not my first time here, but had such a great experience in the drive-thru. Nina was so friendly and engaging, I found myself wanting to chat with her. This wasn't an ordinary fast-food visit. I'll come back just to see her again. The food has never disappointed at this location, either. I recommend this spot.
