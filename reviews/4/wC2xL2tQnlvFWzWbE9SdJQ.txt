Rubio's has always been a solid choice - can't recall any bad meals here over the years when I first ran into this place down in San Diego. Lately, everything they seem to come out with is fish related. Tilapia, cod, etc, but since I hate most fish, I wish they would upgrade their chicken with some exotic spices once in awhile. Still, the chicken tacos were pretty solid last night at $7 for two of them in a large corn tortilla with chips and rice. Salsa bar hasn't changed in years and that is another spot where they could be more creative like Baja's mango stuff. Chicken nachos are really good as well.
