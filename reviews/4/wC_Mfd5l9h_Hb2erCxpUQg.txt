After 9 years in Tucson I have developed a love for good tortas and Carne asada. This place meets the need for an outstanding torta with lots of fresh ingredients and nicely spiced meats. We had everything on the menu like the Carne asada tacos which were solid, not Carne that had been sitting in a warming pan but fresh grilled to order for the tacos and the quesadilla. The highlight for me was the green Chile beef torta. Perfectly seasoned meat on a toasted bun with fresh sliced avacado! They do tortas right here!
