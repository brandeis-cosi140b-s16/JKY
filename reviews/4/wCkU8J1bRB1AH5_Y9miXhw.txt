A superb Mexican grocery store. It's a great place to pick up fresh tortillas and chips. They carry large selections of spicies, sauces, dried peppers, beans, and rice. They also carry cooking supplies such as molcajates (bowl used to make guacamole). I like that they usually have house made salsas and dips to try at the front of the store. The final kicker is the collection of pi√±atas hanging from the ceiling.
