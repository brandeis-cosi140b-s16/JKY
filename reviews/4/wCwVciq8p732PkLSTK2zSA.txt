Next stop! The SandBar "cervezas buey!"

Dance club at night, relax during the day time. Its Bi-polar goodness!

Rolled with my friends and the 'tenders were professional and according to my one of my friend were all "7up's." As long as they can make my drink strong and quick its "Sigur Ros phenomenal."  

4friends, 4 partons, and 4 hours later the dance floor was too small for us! Minus the midlife crisis'ers it was worth the drive. 

Great place to visit when in Phoenix.

Hint: its ok to bring sandals, you may want to feel the sand between your toes, good touch Sandbar.
