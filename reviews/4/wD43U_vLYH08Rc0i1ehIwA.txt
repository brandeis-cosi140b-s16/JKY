Delicious spinach salad with a perfectly prepared chicken breast.  My friends indulged in the huge grilled cheese with tomato soup and raved it was good w/ a doggie bag to take home. 

If I were to change anything...the staff is different and struggled to get things right with our order and bill. Other than that I love the decor and the expanded menu here.
