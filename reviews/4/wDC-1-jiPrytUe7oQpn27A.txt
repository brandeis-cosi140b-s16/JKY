It's 7:00 a.m. with nothing really good for breakfast open while waiting for our flight. We came upon here thinking...could we want Mexican food so early? Well of course...love the stuff. 
I ordered the Chicken Big Blue Burrito which was delicious. Hubby got the breakfast burrito and didn't say a peep, so I'm not sure his thoughts. I was in a flavor heaven with all the wonderful seasonings coming together in this wrapped up tortilla. It's a must try. I have to add that the Burrito is a good size. I could not finish it off. Hubby had to take over and he loved it. I believe more than his breakfast burrito based on his attack on the thing.
 We got some chips and salsa on the side. Even those were good with the blue chips mixed in. There were 2 types of salsa that did a nice burn in our mouths just like we like it. We are chilli junkies what can I say. 
What I want to know is...will Blue Burrito Grille be coming to California? We like it!
