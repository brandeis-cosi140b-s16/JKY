I'm so full I don't know what to do. 
I just ate more than I should have. Luckily it was so good, and really pretty healthy that I don't feel so bad. I got the pounded chicken with lemon and other yummy spices. With an appitizer of little mini cuban sammies and it was a meal. 
Then I just couldn't pass up a bite of homemade flan. Now you know what kind of horror I'm in for. 
Ugh, oh well it was so amazing that I can't wait to go back to have some more of that yummy smashed bread and another mojito and try another entree. 
SO YUMMY!!!!!
