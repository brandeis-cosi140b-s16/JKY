I've always seen Cantina Laredo but never had the chance to visit until tonight. Walking in on a rainy night not sure what to expect but it didn't look like a Mexican Restaurant. It looked like a modern western theme restaurant. Very clean looking. 

Anyways, sat down at our table and before we could breathe they bought us our chips and salsa. He even explained which one was mild and spicy. Very nice. By the time we turned around then our waiter was there to greet us with water cups and asking for our drink orders. Really nice for a change. 

I ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos. Came with three tacos, rice and black beans. I got the chipotle sauce on the side. Really spicy and glad it was on the side. Tacos were very good but small. The rice didn't have lots of taste and the black beans were pretty good. 

My wife had the chicken tacos. This also came with three taco, rice and black beans. She wasn't a fan of her meal. The chicken was pretty dry but okay.

My son had the fajitas tres which came with beef, chicken, and bacon wrapped shrimp. I tried the beef and it was insanely tender and tasty. The chicken was nice and moist with a pretty good taste. Didn't get to taste the bacon wrapped shrimp cause he gobbled them up. He really enjoyed his fajitas. Very good and tasty. 

The chips were so good. Light and not to greasy. We could tell they were freshly made. As I said before, the service was great. Always filling up our glasses and the serve filled up our chips basket when it was empty. Our server was friendly and helpful. 

So we had a good meal. Great service, good to ok food with a nice ambiance. My wife even said this wasn't a typical Mexican restaurant cause the food wasn't greasy at all. Enjoy
