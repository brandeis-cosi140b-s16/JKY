Salazar Bros food comes faster and fresher than the competition up the street. They are also more friendly. I have only had carne asada burritos,  quesadillas, and enchiladas so far and all were delicious. The meat was tender.. and the beans were magical ;) oh ya and the sauce is titties. Get drunk and try this shit out b
