Sat at the bar and had a lunch while at a conference.  the fish tacos were awesome!  Some of the wait staff was great while others were just rude and gave strange looks.  Sitting at the bar with a friend who was personable we had a good time and chatted up the bartender.  She was great, lots of fun and I wish I could remember her name.  She just was sweet!  

Well tip well and enjoy the fish tacos if you get a chance! 

They had indoor and outdoor seating.
