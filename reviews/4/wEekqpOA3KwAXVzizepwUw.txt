The food is 4 star, service is 3 star. But you don't exactly go to a Qdoba for the service. The food is good, fresh tasting and every entree comes with free guacamole!

We like this place because if you're on the Qdoba mailing list you get BOGOs occasionally.  

I would recommend this place if you like chipole or similar type joints. It's classic Americanized Mexican food. 

I like the plain veggie bowls and tacos best. The chicken is mediocre and the steak a short step up from that.
