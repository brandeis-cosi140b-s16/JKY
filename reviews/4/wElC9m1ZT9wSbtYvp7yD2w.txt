A very traditional, old fashioned Mom & Pops run Mexican restaurant. It's small in there but they have a few seats outside,  useable only on non-sweltering Phoenix days. 

Newcomers note - there is no Hostess. You have to go to the counter and order. But David (owner?) Will gladly make a recommendation as he did to me.

I got the Burrito stuffed with shreaded beef, rice and beans. He then recommended Christmas style, meaning dressed in red and green chilies. It was a really good, tasty and large burrito. Their chips are homemade and delicious. While their salsa was decent it was a little watery for my taste. I prefer a chunky style and a little more heat.

Overall a good choice for solid Mexican food in Downtown Mesa.

Oh they don't take Amex.
