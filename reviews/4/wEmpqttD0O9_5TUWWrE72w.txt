I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and chef Kelly's creations so it is no wonder the Revival was a big hit. I was sad to see Mucho Gusto go but the great location and beautiful patio spot will keep people coming in. Now first off this certainly wasn't the cheapest lunch but I dug into my pocket book a little deeper because it is well worth it. 

A few of my favorites from the menu are the caesar salad with its spicy dressing and pumpkin seeds and the braised short rib sandwich with shallots and an apple cider slaw. The fig itabout it cocktail was wonderful. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try out one of the steaks.
