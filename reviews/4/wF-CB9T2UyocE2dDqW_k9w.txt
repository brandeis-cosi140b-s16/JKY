I came here when some of my friends were shooting a film there and I went to visit them so I really didn't get to experience the actual bar and swimming party scene. From what I saw the place seemed cool. I was there on a Thurs night so it was not crowded but it was filled with beautiful people as my friends were filming and there were a lot of beautiful and good looking actors there. I liked the vibe there so I would go again for the swimming pool party and drinks with friends!
