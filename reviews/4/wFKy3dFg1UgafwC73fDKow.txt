I love the old church that houses Taco Guild. It's such a pretty, unique dining experience that if nothing else, try this place out to enjoy the ambiance. Luckily, the food delivers, so you aren't just enjoying eye candy at Taco Guild.

I like that the tortilla chips are warm when they're served, and the accompanying salsa is fresh and delicious. My husband and I started with the Guild Duo - guacamole and queso. The queso was great, with fresh tomatoes and cilantro. The guacamole was good, though a little lightly seasoned for my personal taste. The portion size was big, though, so I can't complain too much.

We tried the guild chicken taco, vegetable taco, and molida lamb  taco. The chicken was really nice, with a touch of sweetness. I could see this becoming my favorite go to taco at Taco Guild. The veggie was great, with wonderfully seasoned vegetables. The molida lamb was rich and delicious. Make sure you like blue cheese before ordering this, and I would suggest only ordering one because it's rich and heavy. The lamb was moist and wonderful - really liked this taco. We also had the beer battered onion jalapeno straws, which were your standard fried goodness, but nothing spectacular to write home about. I think I'll try the corn next time.

I think the prices were pretty reasonable, and the service was good. Parking was easier than I thought it would be. I would forgo turning in from Osborn but instead turn in from 7th St behind Taco Guild and Starbucks.

I will definitely be back to try more tacos.
