If your searching for a quick mexican food spot I HIGHLY recommend Roberto's. ( a while back a lot of them changed to Lauritas) The menu didn't really change neither did the prices.

The have a large selection of items. My absolute favorite are the carne asada nachos. Those things will fill your life with joy and happiness. The rolled tacos are a solid chose as well. They come with sour cream, guacamole, lettuce, and tomato. The burritos are good as well. The horchata is always tasty here. Never flat or too milky. 

For the kiddos I have ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans and that easily fed my 8 and 3 year old. The breakfast burritos are dangerously delicious. I seriously almost ate one and then ordered another one day. I was on a huge Roberto's kick for about a month and after stepping on the scale I quickly realized that I had to make some changes. SOOOOO with that said if your on a diet you may want to avoid this place.
