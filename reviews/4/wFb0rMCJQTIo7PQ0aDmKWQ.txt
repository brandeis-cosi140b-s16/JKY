What to order: the shredded beef tacos (which is what earns the 4 stars).  I'm a huge fan, my mouth occasionally waters thinking about them (like now).  This is a great spot for cheap authentic Mexican to go food.  This review is more for my friends.  If you're hanging around Roosevelt or Co+Hoots, there is a great easy place to take-out from right in the hood.  Nothing about the overall experience jumps out at me, dining-in sitting in the straight back chairs isn't recommended.  They don't speak much English and the local Mexican families do eat there - so you know it is good and authentic!!!
