I eat at TF about once a month, and have had nothing but good experiences. The Tuesday and Thursday specials are a good bargain, and the food and ambiance are certainly a step above Taco Bell. Certainly not fancy, and I am not a big fan of their sauce bar (I have tried several varieties and still haven't found any I really like), but it is a consistently friendly environment with good food, which puts it in my food rotation.
