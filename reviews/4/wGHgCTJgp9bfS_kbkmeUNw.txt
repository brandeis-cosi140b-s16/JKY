I llike this place. I've heard it called the Subway version of Mexican food, which is pretty true. You get in line and order your basic item (burrito, tacos, other things) then customize it as you sidestep down the counter. One thing to remember: you get a lot of food. Last time I got a burrito and ate the whole thing and regretted it. Not because it wasn't good, but because I was like a python that had eaten a wildebeest. 

The food isn't fancy, but I don't think it's any worse than Pedro's, and for a lot less money. Also, you can drink beer! I love a fast-food place where I can booze it up. 

The people who work there tend to be a mellow bunch, which I also like.
