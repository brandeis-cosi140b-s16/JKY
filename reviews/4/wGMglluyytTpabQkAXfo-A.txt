I came here while on vacation because my aunt and grandma always come here. We were sat right away and the decor reminded me of my favorite childhood Mexican restaurant.

I love chips and salsa, but their salsa was not good. Neither impressed me. The chunky one tasted like Pace, the thin one tasted like enchilada sauce.

We ordered the chili queso dip and it was SOOO good! I ordered pollo con Espinaca which was pretty good. Tortillas were great, beans and rice were average, the sauce was amazing, but the actual meat wasn't. The sauce would be amazing if it was on fresh grilled chicken breast, but the chicken that I had tasted like frozen precut strips like from a lean cuisine meal. It was rubbery and not great. 

My dad got the fajitas and said the meat was flavorful, but veggies were overlooked. I personally like soft veggies, but to each his own!

I would come back and try a burrito or just come for the chili dip and drinks!
