Official name: Tacos El Buen Pastor.

I guess they changed their name from Tacos El Pastorcito to Tacos El Buen Pastor a year ago, but their Yelp page fails to reflect that. Combine that with another taco stand's Yelp page that claims the same name and I am completely confused. The good thing is that they will always be at 530 N Las Vegas Blvd, regardless of name. 

The taco stand is situated on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza, which is home to Payless Tire Shop (open 24 hours). The space is unfortunately small, so parking sucks. There's usually a gentleman directing traffic and helping you park in tight spots, but he wasn't available when I arrived. I had to circle the block (not an easy feat on Las Vegas Blvd, home of no U-turns) and the only space that seemed plausible was the 7-11 parking lot across Bonanza. There are several unsavory folks that hang out there, so the key is to move quickly. Thankfully, there is a crosswalk at the light.

The tacos here are small, but just $2/each (except Lengua for $2.25). Their menu seems more extensive than other taco trucks in the valley, but primarily the same offerings. The salsa bar is also standard with three types of salsa, radish, cucumber, and toppings like diced white onions and cilantro. The mild salsa, made with green chiles and avocado, was particularly delicious.

I tried two tacos with Pastor and Lengua. The pastor comes with the perfectly sweet chopped pineapple that they heat up on the flattop as well. The pork is very flavorful with great spices and importantly tender. It made me appreciate Pastor and forget all about my love for Carne Asada. The Lengua was really great too; super tender! Their Al Pastor is definitely the best of the street vendors.
