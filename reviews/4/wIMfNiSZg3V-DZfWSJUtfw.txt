Worth a visit. The 4/5 is mostly based on the chips and salsa being $2.50, small in quantity, and not all that great. The Carne Asada burrito was outstanding. The red chile beef enchilada was outstanding. The chorizo breakfast burrito was plentiful but lacked the spice and full flavor that I like out of my chorizo. The marinated pork burrito deep fried and smothered in red sauce was a bit on the sweet side for Mexican cuisine but it was good and, like everything else, big enough to get all the value out of the price paid. We didn't partake in the bar offerings but the margaritas tempted me. We also dropped the ball on looking around before ordering as we missed the specials board for Taco Tuesday at a buck a piece. The value was great and we will be back to try the red chile beef and green chile pork burritos. Glad we finally tried this place after living close by for more than 2 years.
