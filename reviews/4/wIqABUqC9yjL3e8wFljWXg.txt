DOS MAMACITAS

Panzon translates to "potbelly" in Spanish. Don't worry the two ladies behind the counter could care less how you look.  Prices are open range cheap.

Carnitas tacos would make Pancho Villa's lay down his pistolas. As for the menudo, a reminder of a never ending slow and dreamy cattle drive. An aroma you can't forget. 

No doubt this taqueria is for the hombres whose wives are still asleep at home.
