This location is busy. If you are on a lunch break I suggest phoning your order in because the wait can be long especially on Wednesdays when chicken tacos are only .99 cents. I got a carne asada burrito, rolled beef tacos and a cheese quesadilla. All was above average for a hole in the wall chain. Some people think 'berto's is only good when your drunk and depending on the location you're right but this one is decent.
