Great service,  interesting food.  
I ate at the bar and looked it so much I got some friends and went back the next day for more.  The tacos are delicious and you can pick a couple different filings.  

The best thing on the menu is the table side guac.  The dip is delicious,  but the chips are incredible.  I ate an entire basket without realizing it.  

4 stars because it was solid quality, nothing wrong but nothing mind blowing,  so I rarely give 5.
