I erased my previous review.  I had a concern about the pricing but just spoke with the owner (Mike) and he addressed my concern.  Very impressed how quickly he got in touch with me.  Corporate set some guidelines that he is working on fixing.   If you order a Naked Joey in the Bowl they don't have an option in the register, so you get charged for a Homewrecker or "Earmuffs".  Makes total sense now.  Earmuffs aka the rice bowl that was added to the menu in the fall.

I also mentioned the limited indoor seating.  Mike is trying to reconfigure the restaurant but he's at the mercy of the building owner.  This is the most efficient Moe's that I have seen.  They get you in and out very quickly.  I rarely see long lines.  Mike said they pride themselves on their efficiency.  

Quality of the food is very good.  I always get steak with mushrooms, onions, peppers, salsa (tomato and corn), and cucumbers.  No complaints.  

Lines are shorter than Chipolte.  When the weather is warmer they have plenty of outdoor seating. You get a nice view of what is going on the square (Market Square).
