Food was good enough to go back plus you get chips with access to the salsa bar! I was encourage to try the red sauce because I wanted my carne asada burrito enchilada style but I should have went with green. Red sauce had very little flavor. Wish they had salsa bowls instead of the small salsa to go cups. I had to fill about 8 of them just to finish my chips!
