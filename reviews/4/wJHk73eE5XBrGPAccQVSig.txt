Yum. Baja fresh is the place to go if you want something a step up from Chipotle in variety and warmth as far as the food goes. 
It's not finger licking if I don't have this I"m gonna die good, but the food is made fresh, and the customer service is always excellent
Highlight: the plethora of salsa choices as well as fresh cut limes for your meal & if you so choose your coke like beverage. :)
