Stumbled upon this place while waiting for my car windows to be tinted.  I'm not the biggest Mexican food fan, and wasn't expecting much.  But to my surprise, the food was delicious.  I had the fajita combo with rice and beans.  It all had better flavor than any big name Mexican restaurant I had ever been to.  Even the tortilla chips, which came hot out of the fryer.
