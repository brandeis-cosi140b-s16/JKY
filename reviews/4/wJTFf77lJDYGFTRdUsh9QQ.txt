This place recently opened, it didn't take long for them to open their doors after Poblano shut their doors. Have been here a few times, and really enjoyed this place. My favorite is their Mexican Steak Burger, it's your usual burger except has added chipotle sauce, pepper jack cheese. I have had their sonoran dog, first time I ever had one and really enjoyed it. Glad they open this place up,
