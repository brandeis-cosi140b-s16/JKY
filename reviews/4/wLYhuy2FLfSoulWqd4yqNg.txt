Much better then the critics from the RJ and weekly have rated it. Low key environment in the heart of Henderson where the prices won't break you and you can still get a very flavorful dish. I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food in Vegas, but yet it's one of two I always crave when thinking about Mexican fare. Margaritas are good too and they offer plenty of flavors for everyones tastes. Beans and salsa are more addicting then any other place so be careful bc they are generous and will keep filling you back up. Definitely recommend.
