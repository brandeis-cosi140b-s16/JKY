This little hole in the wall is a gem, although it looks more like plain old rock from the outside.  Don't let the looks fool you.  Took the better half to dinner here last week and she was a bit apprehensive from the start.  Small parking lot, not much to look at on the outside, and really not too much on the inside either.  But the food changes everything.  I had the molcajete, which had beef, chicken, chorizo, some cotija cheese and a nopale.  It came out piping hot in a big bowl with beans and guacamole on the side.  Fantastic.  Even better were the made-in-house corn tortillas served with it.  Just take a little bit of everything and wrap it in one of those fantastic tortillas and your taste buds will thank you.  My girlfriend had the fajitas and from what I tried, they were fantastic as well.   When she couldn't finish hers and we had it wrapped for home, they threw in some extra homemade corn tortillas.  Great place if you are ever on that side of town.  Good food and friendly service.  We will be back.
