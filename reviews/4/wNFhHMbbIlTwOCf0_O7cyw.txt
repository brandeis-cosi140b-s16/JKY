I am always impressed by the chipotle chain. I came in around lunch time and there was a line to the door but I waited only 3 minutes (at most) to order. Customer service is still great even at the fast pace they are working at. Some of the food is a bit spicy for my taste but I love the barbacoa and guacamole!!
