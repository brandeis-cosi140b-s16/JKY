Being a transplant from California has made me picky about Mexican food. It has been difficult to find delicious Mexican since moving to NC but I have been pleasantly surprised by La Poblanita every time I visit. 

The tortilla chips always come out warm and thankfully are only lightly salted. The salsa that goes with them is delicious! It has the perfect consistency between liquid and solid and a spice level that lets you know it is there without overwhelming.

My most recent visit I opted for the Pollo Fundido and it was amazing! They seasoned the tender chicken perfectly - and who doesn't want their meal smothered in cheese? The plate was huge and I was barely able to finish it all (possibly because of the amount of chips and salsa I had consumed before). 

I am also quite partial to their nachos which I frequently order after I have spent some time at the bar next door. I cannot speak to the quality as a menu item but as a late night munchies food it has always been perfection.
