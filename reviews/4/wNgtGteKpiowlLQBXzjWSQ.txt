A neighbor recommended this place.  No difficulty being seated, and our drink orders were taken immediately.  Chips and salsa arrived.  The salsa had a canned taste; however, our server brought a corn salsa and guacamole spontaneously.  
I got the chimichangas stuffed with cheese.  They came with rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. Quite good.  My husband ordered the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas.  He seemed surprised when a plate of rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole and salsa arrived with his grilled vegetables.  He did not use the corn tortillas and appeared to prefer eating his rice and bean plate, along with the vegetables.  My husband stated that the vegetables had no seasoning, but, to be fair, he did not consume them in the way intended.  I did try the vegetables, and they needed salt and pepper when consumed without the other items.  Salt and pepper not on the table, which seems to be a trend with restaurants these days.
My husband had a touch of the grouch that night, so my review is primarily based on my experience.  I will return when he is having a night out with the guys!
