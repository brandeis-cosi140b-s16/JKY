I have two words for you...House Margarita!  They are a must have.  Yes, they are $10, but there's a reason for it!  They are insanely tasty and even more insanely potent.  Be prepared...they seem harmless when you first start sipping on one.  But once you get to the bottom you are not going to be in the right frame of mind.  In fact, you'll want to order a second one and when you start drinking that one, well...you'll realize you probably should have stopped with the first!

Being picky with my Mexican food in this area (I'm a SD baja style fan) I actually didn't find theirs too bad at all.  Their salsa is nice and chunky but with a good amount of flavor.  Not at all bland like so many of the other spots and restaurants around the valley I've tried.  Both times I've been, I have ordered the Burrito Verde, and have not been disappointed.  It's easily shareable or good for leftovers.  It is filled with pork in a mild green sauce and topped with my favorite...tomatillo sauce.  Mmmmmmm good!  

Did I mention the house margaritas yet?
