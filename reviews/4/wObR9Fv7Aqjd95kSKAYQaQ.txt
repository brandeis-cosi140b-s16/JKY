Best Mexican take out...its fast and delish. There prices are a little all over the place, but overall it's a good value, when you get the lunch specials or the 2 or 3 item combos. The fajita quesadilla with either chicken or Carne asada is to die for and comes with sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole which is definitely my go to meal there! My husband loves the 3 item combo (which is always enough food to feed too grown men) with the green corn tamale and (he gets two) chili rellenos. Yum! You get chips and salsa with every order, even to go and they are generous with their salsa! Other then the fact that I am not crazy about eating inside and sometimes if you order no beans you get them anyway...Your food is at least stove hot and made to order. I have nothing bad to say about this place! only that I think we eat there or take home food from there way to often...
