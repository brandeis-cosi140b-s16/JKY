This is a pretty good place.  I generally like the quality of the products, the price is very reasonable as well.  The obvious comparison is to Chipotle (and I have to tell you, though I like both, I do think it is freaking obnoxious the way that Chipotle has decided to open up right next to all of the existing local Qdoba locations that were here first--i mean alls fair and all, but it is a d%ck move).   In any case the quality of the ingredients seems a cut above at Chipotle vis a vis Qdoba, but Qdoba has better overall menu variety and selection. 

Qdoba may not be very authentic, however, that said, I am not a culinary anthropologist.  If I was traveling to a far flung destination in Mexico, I would want to make sure that the food I was eating was authentic and true to the "experience" I was looking for.  When I am hunter gathering for dinner, I am interested in reasonable prices, and food that it just plain Yummy.  Qdoba qualifies.
