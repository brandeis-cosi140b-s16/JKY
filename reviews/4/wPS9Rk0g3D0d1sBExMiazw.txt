Just stopped in for no other reason than we were hungery. Never heard of this place. Very glad we did. The food was fresh, tasty and well prepared. Very authentic mexican food. Loved the tacos and the quesadillas. Appreciate the choice of sauces and condiments. I enjoyed watching my food being made. I have been back twice since and will continue to stop when in the area.
