Not surprised at ALL that I ended up at a Mexican place for the second time before heading home from Vegas.  I do what I want!!

It was a Sunday and the football game was on, so it was pretty lively in there.  The service was a bit slow, but oh well.  Chips and salsa - for FREE - was a nice change from the other Mexican place we tried (Yolos @ Planet Hollywood), and the salsa had a nice smoky flavor to it.  

My chicken tortilla soup was just how I like it - good amount of broth-to-food ratio and everything was super flavorful - I looooove my cilantro, that's for sure! Chicken was nice and tender.  We also shared an appetizer of chicken taquitos, which also had a nice blast of flavor and topped with some deeeeeelicous cheese.  

Good pick if you want something more on the casual side.
