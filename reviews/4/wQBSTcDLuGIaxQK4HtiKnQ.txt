I was in the mood for something I don't always get for my lunch break last week so I decided to go to Z'Tejas.  I'd been to their other locations but never this one surprisingly.  The hosts at the front were very friendly, the one who walked me to my table actually stayed and made conversation for a couple minutes which hardly ever happens anymore.  My actual server was very friendly too.

I was very happy to see that they had a Build Your Own bar where you could pick from a Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Screwdriver and one other drink I can't remember and it was incredibly cheap!  Only $4 for my Bloody Mary!  They had a wide variety of choices too as far as juices, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, it was hard to decide!

For my actual entree I ordered the Hickory Burger which has barbecue sauce, chopped onions, bacon, jalapeno mayonnaise and a couple different cheeses.  It was delicious!  Kind of a mess to eat but worth every splatter you get on your face and shirt.  I just wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're with someone you're trying to look dignified in front of... The fries were great too.  Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and I will for sure be coming back in the future.
