Welcome to Moe's! I'm a big fan of Moe's. I'm a regular here and I get treated really well here. The staff here is always super friendly, chatting about sports, the news, just about anything. It definitely helps to create a fun atmosphere. 

The food. I'm a sucker for the burritos, although I've tried the bowls before too. Similar in style to chipotle and qdoba, and while I like the seasoning of the meats and chicken at chipotle, Moe's gets an edge for their toppings. They definitely have the most topping options compared to their competitors. A great example of thjs is their saut√©ed mushrooms. Always a good choice. Oh and the guacamole doesn't cost extra here.

I also am a big fan of their salsa bar. I'm addicted to the green salsa.

The prices are reasonable and if you come on Mondays it's only $5 for a burrito, chips and a drink. Queso is a little extra, but that's not so bad. They even have one of those nifty coke products machines in there. Love it.

Give Moe's a try. You won't be disappointed.
