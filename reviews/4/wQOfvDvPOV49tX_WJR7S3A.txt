This time it was MUCH better. 
First scene, the hostess was no where to be found so we were almost sat by the bouncer (bouncer on a Thursday night?). Our server was Joey (I think everyone there kept calling him Jo-Jo). Very sweet guy.
We all shared a queso dip. My boyfriend and I had the molcajete bowl, which, let's be real, is the only thing you should ever get at Steel Cactus, and my friend had the chicken fajitas. We came in for Wine night on Thursday, which they were out of the Bluefeld riesling, but Joey came by and showed us 2 other options that were just as reasonable (Estancia Chardonnay & Naked). Unfortunately for Joey, the hostess had seated us without silverware, so he had to run and grab some, and the wine glasses could have used a wipe down or a wash prior to being given to us (my friend's had red wine and lipstick on it still).
The bread pudding dessert of the week was fantastic, so good that my boyfriend ended up stealing most of it from me.

All in all, the food and the server were the best part of the restaurant. This visit was infinitely better than my last visit, but could still use some improvement.
