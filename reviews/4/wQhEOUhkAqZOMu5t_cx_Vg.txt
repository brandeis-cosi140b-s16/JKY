So I went to the Roberto's across from UNLV because I had a random urge to eat carne asada fries. Now, I only get this urge once every few months because after I eat them I always feel like dying, but it's still always worth it. So the carne asada fries were priced at around $8 which isn't a bad price for the amount of food you get.

The carne asada fries come topped with guacamole, pico de gallo, carne asada, cheese, sour cream and probably more. I would tell you everything, but once you mix it together it looks like one big mash up of amazingness. The fries were pretty delicious, but filling. One order can most definitely be shared by two.

I've seen some other reviews talk about the service, but I had pretty decent service when I went. The cashier greeted me and my friend as soon as we walked in, and had our order out in a much shorter time than I had predicted. 

Would I come here again? yeah, probably just for the fries. While the other food looked decent, I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food.
