As a companion said, we should have ordered to go boxes to come with our meals. Scoop half the plate into the box immediately, and then you have a reasonable meal!

Chips were blah, but food was great. I had the El Jefe Chimi. Loved the seasoned chicken with onion, but not dripping in cheese. Rice was a nice companion. Service was prompt, and they were great with the kids. Love that they keep a pitcher of water right on the table.
