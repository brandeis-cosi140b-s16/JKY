this is my favorite mexican fast food in las vegas...I recommend the steak quesadilla with everything.....at first your like "$8 dollars?"  but once you eat 1 quesadilla (all you need is one to fill up).... your body trembles and your tatse buds go crazy!  you just want to come back over and over....feel like mexican food ?  go to los tacos right in front of the swap meet!
