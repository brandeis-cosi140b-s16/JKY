This place was a lot better than I expected. Not too sure if it was because I was craving nachos, but they were delicious. I ordered the beef nacho plate and a drink. The lady preparing it made it look so good that the man behind me added a plate onto his order. Nachos usually look pretty messy and are a pain to eat but these were good. Chips stayed crunchy, the meat wasn't oily, and they were very generous with the other toppings. The lady who rung me up was a different from the lady who made my food. The woman running the register looked like she owned the place and was very friendly. As far as fast food mexican places go, this one was pretty good. Too bad this food court isn't in the middle of the mall. It was a long walk from my car.
