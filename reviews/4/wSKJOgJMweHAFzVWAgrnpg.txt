We stopped by on our way to Vegas and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was very friendly and fast. The food was good except the salsa was a bit on the sweet side not very spicy at all. We tried the pancakes, biscuts and gravy, huevos rancheros and beef tacos and all the food was flavorful and nice large portions.
