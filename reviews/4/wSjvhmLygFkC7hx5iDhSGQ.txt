This is my favorite Taco Bell because it is the closest one to my house. So when I decide to fill my mouth-hole with Doritos Locos Tacos of varying colors/spices I come here.

Often I enjoy getting several Doritos Locos Tacos and turning them into a taco rainbow. I then supplement the tacos with whatever bonkers/delicious scheme Taco Bell has come up with in the past week, such as the Grilled STUFT Nacho, which happens to have a festival of basic carbs that make my blood sugar rocket within seconds, meat/beef (?), AND NACHO CHEESE AND RED TORTILLA STRIPS FOR LYFE.

Oh, also Taco Bell has embarked on putting multiple gut-bomb items in a box, so you can forgo the peasant-like plastic bag they put your ONE TACO in - but seriously, who gets one taco when they go to Taco Bell?

I am not a fan of their burritos, as I can get a magnificent burrito from Chipotle. However, I do have a space in my heart for their hot sauces that give me endearing messages.

Other notable mentions: Nachos Bell Grande, any of the items in which they wrap up another food item with a quesadilla-like shell, and the "Meal Deals" that come with tiny bags of Doritos, because yes, I need to eat Doritos with my tacos.
