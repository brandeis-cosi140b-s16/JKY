Been wanting to try this place out for a while because I have have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant ever since I moved from New Mexico. To this day I still have not found a place that I can give 5 stars to yet. 

I will say the food here was good. The refined beans were tasty, the Mexican rice had a great taste, and the hard shell taco plate with carnitas was alright. Couldn't really taste any seasoning on the carnitas but the shells were amazing and crunchy. If you enjoy cilantro you will love this place. Salsa is very very mild roasted green chili with cilantro that I would say gives the salsa its flavor. The green sauce at the two Mexican fast food joints near here are hotter. 

Overall service was great, love the decorations inside, and the authentic spanish music that is played! Gives you a great vibe while eating and a feeling of being in Mexico!
