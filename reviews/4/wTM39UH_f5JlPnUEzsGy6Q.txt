I've been here a couple times and hafta say, I like Los Cabos. 

The restaurant is cheerfully decorated. Service is relatively and the staff is very friendly. I even stopped in one night just as it appeared as they were closing up. However, they very happily took my takeout order and I was on my way.

As for the food, it's pretty good. I've had a number of their burritos and soft tacos. I like quesadillas and theirs are no exception. Prices are also very reasonable.
