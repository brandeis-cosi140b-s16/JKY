So fantastic! The salsa bar alone is worth going to see, unique tasty salsas. The tacos are big not street tacos, found out after I ordered 5 of them, but had plenty of take homes. Their horchata is the best I've ever had. The place it's self is small so make sure you get there before the rush. But absolutely check it out!
