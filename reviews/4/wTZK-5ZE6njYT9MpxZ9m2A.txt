Seriously....middle of nowhere joint, but they really put a great effort into the food and it shows.  We were a group of ten at 2 pm on a Wednesday.  Not a bad thing to say about the place or the food. 

Draft beer served in mason jars. Give you Sharpies to decorate your dollars for the walls.  Service was super too. Saddle up to the bar....literally. All was great!!!
