Their chips and salsas are excellent and very spicy.  I always get the same thing on the menu... it is a combination plate with a beef taco and cheese enchilada.  The beef taco is yummy... I think they mix potato in with the beef.  I really like this combo although some people do not.  Everyone I have brought here absolutely loves it.  I told my mom about this place because (she is a local restaurateur) and she loves this place too.  That is saying a lot coming from her:)
