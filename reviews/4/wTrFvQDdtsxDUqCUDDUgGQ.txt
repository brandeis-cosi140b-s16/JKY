Went here again today and I enjoyed it a lot more. I mixed it up and had the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas. They were really good. I would order them again. The corn tortilla was a little chewy, I wish they had better tortillas. The shrimp and fillings were great though. My mom enjoyed her taco as well. 
I got it in a flight and it came with chips. I got the croquettes again and they were a little mushy. 
The service was friendly and good. 
Hopefully they continue this upswing as they get more experienced! I will be back. 

Oh I had the brushfire salsa and it was good!
