This location is quite near the Nest, and I've been eating here since before the Orchid Stop/Sinclair station was bought out by Green Valley Grocery/Shell (when the gas prices were cheaper).  So, on with the review.

In the interest of full disclosure, I will state that the Great Bearded Bird is allergic to avocado is all its forms.

I've ordered the carne asada nachos numerous times (specifically ordered WITHOUT guacamole), the shrimp cocktail a few times (also without caterpillar guts in any form), and the flautas/rolled tacos/whatever they call them a couple of times.  Never any complaints.  Super-duper-classy?  No.  Decent food at a decent price?  Definitely.  The condiment bar is a nice touch (I do tend to eat the carrots in escabeche, and the scallions).  And, if you aren't in the mood for a standard fountain soda, you can grab a can or bottle from the gas station convenience store that's in the same building.

I've been back, and unless something quite untoward happens, will continue to do so.
