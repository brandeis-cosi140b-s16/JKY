Came here while visiting Charlotte from a recommendation I got at another restaurant. So glad I came! Service was great, it was my waitress' first night on the job and she did wonderful!

I tried the bbq mahi taco and a blackened mahi taco. The Bbq mahi was better by far, not sweet, but a little tangy, it was amazing. After the bbq mahi my blackened mahi taco seemed a little plain jane. Also the flour tortillas were so unique , they were fluffy and reminded me slightly of Indian fry bread. They were so good and made it much easier to hold/eat the hearty tacos!

I also tried a skimny margarita in the rocks, which was yummy and paired great with the tacos. 

I would definitely go back, I was told after I ordered that the calamari tacos are delicious as well, so that's what I want to try next!
