Good, cheap, and fast!. This is a place to go when you're craving Mexican food but don't want to spend Scottsdale type of money. My understanding is that its owned by one of the members of the Garcia's family, but unlike the restaurants which were sold by the family to a franchise chain, this place is still a local operation, much like Garcia's de las Avenidas at 35th Avenue and Encanto. It's basic, traditional, Mexican food that is homemade and tastes great.
