Their horchata is so good. Their bean dip and their chips are a great starter. Their pupusas are very flavorful. My favorite is the chicharron, or pork skin. They have two tip jars. One is for the mesera, or the waitress. One is for the cocinera, or the female cook. 

If you order their regular pupusas to go, you can get 6 pupusas for 99 cents each. Their specialty pupusas remain regular price. 

They make everything to order. It's delicious, flavorful, and simply good. I'm a fan.
