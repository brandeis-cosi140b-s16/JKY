When we had the urge to have good Mexican food, but didn't want the greasy (yet SO yummy) kind from Roberto's Taco Shop, we would come to this place.  

The decor is very pink, yet exotic and the food in DELICIOUS!  The chips and salsas (they provide three different salsas - verde, regular and spicy) are really good - so good that one day, we were craving JUST the chips and salsa, so we came to this restaurant for some drinks and chips and salsa.  Who does that?  :-P  

The tacos are excellent, whether we ordered the carne asada, al pastor, rock shrimp, or carnitas.  I had goat tacos one time, but it looks like they don't have it on the menu anymore.  The rice is your typical Mexican red rice, which can sometimes be dry, but for the most part, it's really good!  

Their Mango Margarita is definitely on point - love it!

The prices are not that cheap, but during happy hour or after 10pm, you can get really good deals, like $2 tacos!  Great deal for bad nights on the slot machines from the Red Rock Casino across the street!
