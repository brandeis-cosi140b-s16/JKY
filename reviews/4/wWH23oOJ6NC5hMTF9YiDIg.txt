I enjoy the Chipotle concept.  This is a good quality location.  The line (there is always one) moves quickly.  Staff is always friendly.  I like how they always pass their health inspections!  

I tried the bowl for the first time.  No beans and the veggies.  Cuts the calories down.  Their medium clears up my sinuses, so I stick to mild salsa.  Yum!
