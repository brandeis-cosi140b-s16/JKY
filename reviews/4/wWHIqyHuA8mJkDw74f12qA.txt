I have to say I've been a fan of America's Taco Shop for as long as I can remember. I frequent the two Central Phoenix locations often and make sure to bring everyone there when they want amazing Al Pastor, Guacamole, or anything else.

I opened my mind to this location, it is their first corp freestanding location since Kahala brought them under their umbrella. I was worried, I can't lie. I generally have a closed mind to corp locations but I had to give this a shot given my history. 

I walked in there ready to say, this is nothing like ******. Instead I walked in and found a familiar face, Terry. This comforted me and brought me back to reality, I was safe and trusted them now.

Well I can report that everything tasted exactly how I expected. I got my usual to compare with the new location, Al Pastor Burrito, Guacamole, and a Horchata. It was a 1 for 1, I tasted all the rich flavors that I was accustomed to and I was excited. I now have a location near my work and 2 near my home, see you at lunch!
