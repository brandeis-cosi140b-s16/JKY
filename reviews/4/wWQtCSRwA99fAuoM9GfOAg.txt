LOVE. Seriously, this place is delish.

We've been eating El Burro once a week for the last couple of months and we're not even close to being sick of it - if anything, we're becoming even more addicted.

The breakfast burrito (with chorizo added) is the most insanely delicious thing I've eaten in a long time - eggs, a few fries (because why not?) salsa, spicy chorizo, all wrapped in a tasty tortilla. Rich and filling enough to share. 

The chicken soft tacos are consistently good, with slow-cooked white and dark meat and a thick green sauce. Topped with onions and cilantro, the only thing that makes them better is a squeeze from the lime wedge that comes alongside.

Finally, the chips and salsa steal the show, in my opinion. Chips are actual deep-fried flour tortillas (presumably their leftovers) with just the right amount of salt. They're flakey and oily and oh so good. The salsa is thin (which I love) and bright and fresh tasting - a good counterpoint to the richness of the chip.

Highly recommended. Local delivery service is a bonus for those of us living on the North Side.
