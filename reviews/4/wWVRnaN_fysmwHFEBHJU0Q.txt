I wondered into this place on a beautiful Saturday afternoon and fell in love. I ordered the veggie taco topped with guacamole and it was phenomenal!  The prices are very reasonable and I love the laid back atmosphere with the cool music. If you want to sit outdoors they have a beautiful patio where you can sit outside!
