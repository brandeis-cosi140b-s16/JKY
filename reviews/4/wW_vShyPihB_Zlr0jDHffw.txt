Not a bad spot for some quick southwestern food!  I got the carnitas burrito with lime-Cilantro rice, pinto beans and the rest of the fixings and it was very good!  The chips and salsa are good and everything is fresh! I really like that their meats don't have any antibiotics or hormones! You get a lot for your money.
