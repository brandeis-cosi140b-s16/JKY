Good, standard Americanized-mexican food.  I almost equated it to Azteca (if any of my Seattle fans are reading this).  However, their service and food went above and beyond what I expected!  I got the combo and everything had that great, non-microwaved taste.  Score!

Their strawberry margarita was not boozy enough.  The lime margarita, however.... YOW!
