4 stars so yes,  "I'm a fan"...but not necessarily because the entrees were anything great (they were just "ok").

No, I love this place because whenever my girls and I were picking up carryout, the staffers would let us (or at least they knew better than to try and stop us?) fill up 64oz Big Gulp cups with salsa.

MMMMmmmm good.  

Notice I said it was the girls and I.  Don't eat this much salsa if you're planning on kissing anyone in the following 48-72 hours....
