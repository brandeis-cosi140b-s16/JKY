Was happy that they reopened. Unfortunately due to my diet I can no longer eat there, but I still pick up a gallon at a time of their sauce to use with other items. I used to love eating there, all of their food is great, and I even tried their cheeseburgers back in the day and with a little bit of their sauce it was awesome. I wish I could still eat there, but I plan on bringing my kids to eat some cheese crisps and watch them enjoy the chips & sauce while I sit there dreaming of the past. I'm glad they're back.
