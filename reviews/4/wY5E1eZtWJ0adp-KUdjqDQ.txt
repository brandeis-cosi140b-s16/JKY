Chicken citrus avocado salad. I did try this salad because I like everything that's in it. Glad we had coupons. It was ok it just seemed like more lettuce than what the picture looked like. I like really good thick salads so if I am going to pay 8 dollars for one it better be a mega salad. It is El pollo loco so they could have put a bit more chicken on that sucker. Maybe a few more slices of avocado. Well it was tasty though. I really like el pollo loco the chicken is bomb. Wish they had one closer to me. :(  I am still a fan though.
