I was craving a bean and cheese burrito and Bibiano's was the closest and only Mexican restaurant around were I live.  Even though they closed at 1700 on Sundays we got there just shy past 1700 but they still welcomed us and made our food delicious!  The food was pretty good.   Friendly customer service and clean environment.   Even though we took the food to go we still paid attention incase we were to ever dine in.   Their salsa was okay I have had better but not bad.   I did like that it had a bit of a kick.   The sopapia was good, probably would have been great if we ate it when it was freshly made.   We will definitely be coming back.
