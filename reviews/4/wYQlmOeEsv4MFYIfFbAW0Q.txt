We had trouble finding this place, but man was it worth it. Talk about a mans-man kind of spot. There is no sign, there's a random wooden door with a joke about stray children on it. When you walk in, a waft of smoked meat hits you. You see the grill, the full prohibition style bar, the huge bar level bucket of ice containing bottles of beer, it was a lot to take in. 

The food--excellent. It was hardy, large portions, perfect for taking men out for brunch and having them feel full. It's a meat-driven menu, but there is a lot of options including scrambled eggs and pancakes for the less adventurous. Definitely a locals only spot we infiltrated. 

We sat at the bar since there were only 4 tables in the bar area, which only improved the experience. We talked with the owner, saw the meat turn and met strangers over mimosas. Great joint.
