I've been a fan of the original Tacos La Mexicana on Decatur and Twain for some time. So, I'm thrilled that they brought all that taco goodness closer to my neck of the woods with their second location near Durango and Spring Mountain. The carnitas tacos are just as good as the ones at the original spot. The quality and flavor of the asada are better than almost any taco shop on the west side of town and the al pastor wasn't bad either. Tacos are pretty cheap at $1.39 each. The chicken tamale ($1.75) was pretty good, but the carnitas is what you should load up on.
