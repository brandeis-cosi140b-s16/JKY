Great patio atmosphere and great margaritas!   Those two things make up for the very very slow service. The chips were awesome and we had the salsa, guacamole and street corn queso.  I would recommended them  all. To finish it off we had the cod and shrimp tacos.  They didn't disappoint. The place is charming and feels like you are sitting in Baja.  Just go with the same attitude.
