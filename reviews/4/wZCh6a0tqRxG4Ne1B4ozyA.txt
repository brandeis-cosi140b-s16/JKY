I went there for lunch with my wife and the service was good.  My wife had a bean and cheese burrito and I had a carne asada burrito.  With 2 cans of soda lunch came to 12 bucks. They had samples of some banana nut bread that my wife said was the best she ever had.  We will definately be going back here again.
