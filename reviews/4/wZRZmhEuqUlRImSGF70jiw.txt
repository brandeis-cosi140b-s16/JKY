$.75 tacos on Wednesday can't be beat.(but only till 8th). I had multiple types of meats and I gotta admit I will only go back for Pastor maybe Carne Asada. The pastor was very tasty. And man! Their salsa is hot!! But delicious!!! Had to order some extra to drench my tacos but if ur not into spicy food be careful. I only had their tacos so I can't speak for the other menu items. Their burritos looked pretty big and only $4.50 so I will say it's worth a try next time. Don't be scared of the area, and if you are you could order from the comfort of your car in the drive-thru. :-)
