Diablo's is the best!!! Went here everyday when I was in Vegas since it was in the Monte Carlo where I stayed. They have the best margaritas and nachos!!!! It is a little pricey, but its worth the money because the margaritas and nachos are HUGE!!!! They also have burritos, quesadillas, and other yummy Mexican items like elotes (very good Mexican corn on the cob). Also if you happen to sit at the bar make sure you ask for Darren to be your bartender because he is the best!!!! The atmosphere is very laid back and if you are there for happy hour from 3-7pm they spin the wheel and specials change every half hour. They also give out buy one get one free drink coupons outside every day. So overall I had a very good experience at Diablo's and can't wait to go back!!

P.S. Make sure you ask for their hot sauce. It has mango and habanero in it and the habanero is not too overpowering. It is very delicious and you can even buy it to bring home if you'd like.
