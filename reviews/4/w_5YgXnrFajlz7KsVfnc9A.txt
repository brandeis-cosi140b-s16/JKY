This restaurant is in a bit of a transition. Downstairs is a cafeteria style experience that has been the standard for the restaurant. Recently the restaurant received a liquor license and started full service upstairs. Our server was very friendly and described all of the proposed changes including closing up the upstairs, but making the roofing retractable so that it could be opened on nice days. 

The views from upstairs were great - despite not much in the surrounding area to look at other than ran down buildings. At least the mountains provided a good view. The linens on the table and full service made it a wonderful experience. The food was good too - we started with the freshly made guacamole. It was just as good as Cafe Laredo, but half the price. I went with a margarita for $8, which really I could skip. I ordered frozen, but didn't get it and in general it was just kind of average. The chips were very good and the salsa very good. I ordered the beef taco with carne asada - which was surprisingly really spicy. I finished with dessert - the churros and the newly introduced sundae - neither were really impressive. 

While the service was friendly and knowledgeable, the server was a bit slow. I am sure that will improve as they get more experience with the full service. The entree and the app was exceptional - skip the drink and dessert and it would be perfect. Overall it was just over $50, but subtract the $8 drink, the price for the churro and sundae and it would be a good meal at a good price. 

While the bar isn't very high, this is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. I will be back frequently.
