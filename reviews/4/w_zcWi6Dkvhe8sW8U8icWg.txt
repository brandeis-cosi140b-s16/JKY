I really like this place, but their menu is a little slim. They should add a few items or try some new dishes. Their food is always fresh, piping hot and portions are large. I can never finish. Salsa is yummy and one of my favorites in town. The staff are a little slow but courteous. The ambiance is nice, place is clean and spacious. Not too loud either.
