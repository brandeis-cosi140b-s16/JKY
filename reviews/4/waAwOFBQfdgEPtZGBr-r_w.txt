Chipotle is the new Subway... everyone loves a burrito for lunch.  Their burritos are yummy but for some reason, I'm not full after eating this huge gut bomb.  

Someone should have a Chipotle burrito eating contest... I'm sure to win only to be suddenly rushed to the hospital for a double bypass surgery.
