This place is orginally from Utah and a huge hit there.  We always heard from family how the lines were so long.  When we saw them going in here, we were excited to try them.

They do have a kid's cheese crisp that are normally 99 cents but free if you eat in.  

My two favorites are their chicken quesidilla and chicken salad.  My husband loves their steak.  I have not tried the pork, but I hear it is the best as well.  

This location is far busier than the location off of Ray Road.  My complaint is that there is not a changing table in the restrooms for babies. 

They do have a frequent diners card where you purchase 9 meals and get the 10th one free.
