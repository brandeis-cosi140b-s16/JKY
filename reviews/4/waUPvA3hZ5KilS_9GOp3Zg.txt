Yeah, Moe! You are an awesome people watching spot and your portions are reasonably sized. I LOVE the fact that you carry Dos Equis and that your staff shouts a welcome at you when you walk in the door. You are kinda like the East Coast Baja Fresh, only slightly not as fresh.....and your Verde salsa kicks mucho arse! Yum!
