Why is their red chicken so good? Why is it red? Both my girlfriend and I cook and neither of us can imagine. 

This is a rediculously delish barbeque place. Don't let the name confuse you. It really is more of a grilled food place then a Mexican restaurant. Their menu is very simple. You basically have a choice between 1. chicken, 2. beef, or 3. beef and chicken. I recommend getting number 3. It's under 7 dollars and comes w/ beans and tortillas (corn or flour).

The biggest problem with this place is that they only take cash. Bring cash or go to the Circle K across the street and use the ATM.
