Julio's Too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. The menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.
