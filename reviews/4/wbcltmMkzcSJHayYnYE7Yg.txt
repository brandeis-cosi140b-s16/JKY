Surprise, surprise....weird! Ok so we passed this place everyday on the way home for 11 months and each time I say, ugh I just CAN'T eat next to a gas station or it looks ghetto. LOL OOOOO How wrong I was. So I gave in and we decided to eat there. O.M.G. Yum! I got the green pork plate, taco, enchilada and burrito. YUM! The staff was friendly, food was perfect, I love their bean and salsa sauces with the chips! Only bad thing is the Cadillac Margarita was THE best drink I've had in a while. Should be because the drink alone was $18!!! #$%$%^ yea....no prices on the menu always mean $%^$%^& on the bill....but other than that I'd go back for sure!
