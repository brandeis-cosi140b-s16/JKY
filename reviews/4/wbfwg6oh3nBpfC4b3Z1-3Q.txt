I went to Sandbar the other night and I had a good time. My friend got off work at 10:30 pm so we had to find a place that would stay open a little later. We enjoyed Sandbar. We had drinks on the outdoor patio, played ski ball inside, and had fun both talking to the servers and customers. The martinis I had were strong but well done and the service was prompt and courteous. I'd go to Sandbar again because I enjoyed the drinks and had fun there.
