Not bad at all. They give a good sized plate or at least make it look like it's a nice portion by how they place it on the plate. I ordered the 3 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans combo plate and barely got any rice. I didn't like the beans too much, they had a weird texture to them but didn't taste bad. I hope they didn't have lard in them cause I'm a vegetarian. I was charged extra on each enchilada for having green sauce on them instead of red. Why do I have to pay extra for green sauce? I can't get red cause I believe there's some sort of beef in it and it's against my diet. Funny thing is I got charged extra for green and felt like it didnt even have any sauce in it. It tasted kind of dry and didn't have a spicy taste at all. I was hoping for hot since it is mexican. I would have given 5 stars if they hadn't charged me for green sauce, especially when I feel like I didn't even get any and if I did it was barely noticable. I'll come again one day and give it another chance but honestly I'll probably go somewhere else where they dont charge for sauce and actually give you as much sauce as you want instead of barely any and charge you for it.  The waitress was nice and the enchiladas were good and very cheesy. I just was disapointed by the little tiny bit of rice I got, the weird textured beans and the sauce situation. If it wasn't for the waitress I probably would have given this spot like 2 stars. She did a good job and raised my rating a little higher than it should be. Service was good. Pricing and the food could have been better.
