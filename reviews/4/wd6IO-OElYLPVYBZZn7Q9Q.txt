Places like this makes me wish we had gambling in Phoenix.  Yeah that's a bit much, but awesome bar/club/restaurants like this wont go to just a regular town.  

I love the whole look of this place.  Neon lights in a killer font that says Diablo's Cantina and a hot lookin red demon girl standing up there looking on LV Blvd.  

Im not a drinker, but those I was with are, so they quickly ordered drinks while I got my usual iced tea. Great tea btw.   We were looking for something small to tide us over for dinner later.   Kat was our waitress and she couldn't have been nicer.  When a waitress comes back to check on your every five min and still is able to take care of all her tables, that shows experience.  I asked her how the nachos were and she said they were very popular.  Ok,  a four cheese nacho right away makes me smile...  About 10min later she brings out this huge tray of melted cheese that have a few nachos sticking out from inside it.. lol.  Ahhhh  cheese heaven.  

All four of us enjoyed the nachos and we couldn't finish them.  Damn delicious!

Can't wait to go back to this place.  Very cool!  Also the wait wasn't that bad.  We went about 5-ish and maybe waited for 15min.
