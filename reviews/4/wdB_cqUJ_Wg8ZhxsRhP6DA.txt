Whenever I get those late night cravings or after a night of drinking, my boyfriend and I always come here for some good food. 

The interior is small, but from what I've seen, it's always been clean. The staff is friendly and food comes out quick. I always get the carne asada nachos and I have never been disappointed. Don't forget to grab some pickled jalapenos and carrots, they're always fresh and crunchy. 

Laurita's beats Roberto's, hands down.
