This was the first time I've eaten at this resturaunt and to be honest, I had it confused with a simulair establishment with a simulair name.  I went in skeptical but open minded.  I must admit I was glad it wasn't the other place.

The staff was nice, the food was good, the service fairly quick.  I don't believe I have one of these stores near me, but if I'm in this area I won't hesistate to go back.
