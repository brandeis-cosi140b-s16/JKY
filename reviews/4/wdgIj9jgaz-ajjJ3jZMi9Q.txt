Taqueria El Buen Pastor...aka Tacos el Pastorcito! Little taco stand on LV Blvd and Bonanza, near 95. 

I have been overhearing that they have one of the best al pastor in town...So I finally got to put it to the test 

First of all, tacos here are pretty cheap. Almost every meat is $1.50, with the Lengua at an even $2.  Pic of the tacos! :

The Al Pastor here was good but not the best in my opinion. The taco felt a little light on the meat, but you do get what you pay for. It had lots of flavor, but not quite as good as the other two spots I have recently tried. I think you will like it, I'm just looking for the best in town!

But what was great was the Lengua! As you can see in the picture, they shred it instead of cubing it, which gave it a nice Barbacoa like consistency, and packed with juices and flavors! I really liked this...the best Lengua taco I have ran into so far!

The Chorizo was nice and flavorful...slightly oily like it should be. Lots of other places in town serve it practically dry...I like juices in my Chorizo!

Lastly, they have a salsa bar area to DIY, and the salsas have plenty of depth and not watery and boring like some other places. Give them a try...they are open late!
