As another reviewer remarked, Sumo Maya is definitely hit-or-miss. I'll start with the misses: the music is so loud! However, I think this is part of the "hip" factor (although I can't be sure because I'm not hip). Also, some of the tables have plastic chairs which are both uncomfortable and look tacky too. Food-wise, I was not a huge fan of the asparagus because it was swimming in what tasted like eel sauce.Lastly, my steak was VERY expensive and not as good as it's price would have one expect.
Now onto the good-I started with the seabass ceviche and it was dynamite! I love ceviche and it was one of the best I've had in a long while. We also ordered the lump crab guacamole which was also very good. What really earned the fourth star for me, though, was the service-our server Jessica M. was fabulous! The place was packed yet she still stopped by to check on us frequently. Also, my dad can be a very needy customer, but Jessica handled all of his eccentric requests with warmth and a smile. The bar manager even accommodated us far more than I would have expected him too. Everyone who works there obviously cares a great deal about the business and it shows!
