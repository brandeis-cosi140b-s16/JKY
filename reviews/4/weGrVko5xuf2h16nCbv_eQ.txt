Phoenix needs more places like this. Menu painted on the wall, eat outside next to a garage, only about 8-10 things on the menu and hands down the best tacos this side of Sonora. When I was taken here by a friend I almost gagged thinking about a manta ray taco. I have to tell you it is the most incredible taste profile you will have in a taco. The place isn't anything to write home about but who cares! I'm there for the tacos and viches. Treat yourself and go.
