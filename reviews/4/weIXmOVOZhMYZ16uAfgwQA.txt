Had a dinner date with my husband on a Friday. I thought we would need a reservation, but the restaurant was far from crowded. The kitchen is fast! The Polly y mango salad is an excellent dish, with a really interesting combination of flavors and textures; I would definitely order it again. My husband had a couple of tacos, which were different and delicious. We're not a fan of the pickled vegetables (maybe because they're served cold?), but the black beans are good. The chips are best when still hot. We'll be back when the weather is nicer, and we can sit outside.
