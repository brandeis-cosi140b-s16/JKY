I had a bean and cheese chili, which was yummy. But when I walked in at about 3:50 pm, I was the only customer and all four booths and two tables  were unbussed. Manager was behind counter chatting with employees. At 4:00 an additional person must have come on, because that guy started bussing tables. He also brought me my order. I had to pick through the silverware because some of the pieces were dirty. Manager needs to step up his game and do some work if they're short handed.
 
My chimi was good, soda was calibrated correctly, and the guacamole was excellent. Their beans are always good, and the cheese enchiladas are excellent. Would have been five stars but for the cleanliness issue.
