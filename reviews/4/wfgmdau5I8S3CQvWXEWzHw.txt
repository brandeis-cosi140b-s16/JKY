Great location right across from UNLV which means you should stay far away from this place during the lunch rush. Just like all other Chipotles, it the usual build your own Mexican fiesta when you order. The staff are always nice and efficient in catering to everyones orders. Even during the lunch crush with a line out the door, it feels that you never have to wait that long before your placing your order. All in all, it's a great, clean and solid restaurant if you want pseudo Mexican food.
