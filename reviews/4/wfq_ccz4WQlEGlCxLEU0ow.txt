It's a rainy evening in Phoenix {Monsoons are the BEST! Especially when we've been experiencing a record breaking heat wave!} and getting cozy on the couch sounded much better than cooking dinner! So I stopped by Chipotle to grab an easy dinner! Sometimes it is hard to find the perfect balance between healthy, fresh, affordable and delicious! A burrito bowl with brown rice from Chipotle covers just about all of those bases! I'm picky about my 'fast food' and Chipotle is always a winner! Check out this poster that they had on their wall! Their food has 'integrity' and that's one of the reasons why I keep coming back!
