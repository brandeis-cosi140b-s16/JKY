I had the sea snail tostada, the octopus tostada, and two  scallop tacos. Oh wow! It was so good! I've never had Ensenada style before, now I know where to get good seafood. My fianc√© had the chimichanga mariachis. It was savory and creamy and delectable- I know- she made me try some. Never had snail before. It was friggin delish! Plenty of meat on those tostadas. Very generous portions. Great tortillas age salsa also. Attentive polite courteous service. We will definitely return!
