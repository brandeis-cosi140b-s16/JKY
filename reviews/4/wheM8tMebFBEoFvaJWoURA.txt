It's hard for me to believe this, but finding a good Mexican restaurant in Arizona isn't as easy as I thought it would be when I moved here.   Abuelo's is one of the best places I have eaten Mexican at.   It is a little more expensive but I find it to be reasonable for the amount of food you get as well as the selection and taste.   They have a very good sized menu and offer a number of variations.
