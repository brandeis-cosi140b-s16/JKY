When it comes to getting Mexican in C-U, this is probably my top pick.  It's cheap, the food I've gotten has been decent (the entrees are probably marginally better at Dos, except for the enchiladas, which are amazing!)  However, I keep coming back because of the chips, which are, in a word, incredible.

I also really enjoy being here.  Very bright atmosphere, and very attentive waitstaff.  Keep the chips coming, and this place is gold.
