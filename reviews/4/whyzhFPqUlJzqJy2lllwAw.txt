Having dinner here on a Monday night. Where is everybody? Food here is terrific, margaritas even better. The Mexican street corn is delicious with char that was just right, while their tacos were great. Had the two taco combo with ribeye and chicken taco--deliciosa!! Great combination of flavors. And don't miss the chips-- we had two baskets with their excellent green chili salsa.
