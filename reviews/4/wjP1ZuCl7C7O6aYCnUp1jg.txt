This shouldn't be the place you visit if you are trying to eat healthy. Sure, they have healthy options, but who is really going to a place that serves up burritos big enough to kill someone with and tries to eat healthy? You come here for a quick, dirty, and delicious burrito the size of your head. 

If I haven't made it clear already these burritos are huge. Qdoba's specialty is their queso burritos that are made with their special queso sauce. And let me tell you, their queso burritos are a work of guilty pleasure art. You have your options of meat (Chicken or steak), typical mexican burrito toppings (pinto beans, black beans, mexican rice, white rice, sour cream, etc.), and my favorite topping, shredded cheese. A cheese sauce burrito with an option to add shredded cheese to it? Oh that's right, they went there and it is delicious. 

Their burritos are a bit more expensive than their competitors (coming in close to $10 with the additional charge for guacamole), but after you have eaten one, the fat kid in you will tend to forget the price difference. Qdoba's burritos are not for the the health conscious or the light eaters. But if you're itching for a burrito fix Qdoba has the answer.
