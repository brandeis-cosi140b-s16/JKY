came here for dinner with my roommate. nice place. our waiter was super cute. =) i had the seafood enchiladas and my roomie had the chicken enchiladas. both were very good. i love that they serve complimentary cornbread. it was really yummy. i also had the guava mojito, really tasty but had very little alcohol in it. it wasn't very busy considering it was a friday night. they even have complimentary valet for diners. you can't beat that.
