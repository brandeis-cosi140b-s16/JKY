Mexican food that is almost as good as border town food.  Having lived in San Diego, we were really spoiled regarding Mexican food, and have been sorely disappointed many times.  When we moved to Harrisburg, we noticed Mexicasa and one night my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  

The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the food was superb!  Probably the best we've had since leaving San Diego.  I convinced my very picky husband to join me on my next trip, and it's become a staple in our take-out and eating out rotation.  

In addition to having actual flavor, and authentic Mexican taste, the food is reasonably priced and very generous portions.  The Super Combo is something ridiculous like $12 and takes 2 takeout boxes to carry it, and will feed a grown man for 2 - 3 meals.  

I definitely recommend this to friends.
