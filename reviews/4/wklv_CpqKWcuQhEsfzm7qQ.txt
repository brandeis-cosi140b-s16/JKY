I recently found out that Aliante was no longer a "station" casino. One thing about the station casinos is that even though some of them have restaurants of the same name they were never each consistent taste and quality wise. Cabo in the Red Rock was delicious (it is now gone), but the Cabo here at Aliante was not that great. When I heard a place called The Salted Lime had opened in the place of Cabo I knew I had to at least give it a try since it might actually be good.

The decor inside doesn't appear to have changed other then the menus having a different name. The service was excellent. We were brought chips and salsa right away and our drink order taken. I never had an empty glass the whole night. The chips and salsa were great. It also came with a bean and cheese dip that was quickly eaten. You might even want to ask for 2 bean and cheese dips because they are addicting! There was also a tamatillo/avocado dip that tasted very fresh and delicious.

We started off with "Chili Con Queso". This was terrible. I tasted like they just took sliced kraft cheese from the wrapper and nuked it in the microwave. Even if this appetizer were free I wouldn't recommend eating it.

I ordered the "Carnitas". It cost $15. The side of rice had a lot of flavor and the beans were thick and very good. It came with warm corn tortillas but I asked for flour. The carnitas had a lot of flavor. I was impressed with the amount they served. This is something I would order again.

The others in my party had "Beef Fajitas" and "Cheese Enchiladas". The fajitas were a big hit but the enchiladas weren't. 

Inside is clean and they have tables or half booth/tables. 

TV's are everywhere.

You can sit at the bar where they have daily happy hour specials.

I will be back!
