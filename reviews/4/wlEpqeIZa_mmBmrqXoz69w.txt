I've been searching for a totally legit sit-down Mexican spot rather than a fast-food type of establishment & I'm so glad I found it! 

I love the atmosphere here, the colors are a lot of reds and oranges inside, definitely a welcoming vibe to experience good Mexican food. Service was great, all hosts, servers and bussers are very nice & accommodating. I also love that you get delicious complementary chips, salsa & refried beans as well as soup. The menu is extensive! A bit overwhelming but I suggest opting for their combos or have your server suggest a popular dish.

I loved my flautas and soft tacos! I'm not a huge Mexican foodie but I must say, Viva Mercado's has changed me. Can't wait to go back!
