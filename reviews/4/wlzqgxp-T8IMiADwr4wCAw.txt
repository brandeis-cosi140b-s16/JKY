I have not been to a Rubio's in years because I was not a fan of the menu. I am glad that I returned. I love that my food was brought to the table. The condiments bar is a nice place to add some more flavor to your meal. Food was light and filling. I didn't feel heavy and overstuffed afterwards. A big step up from other "Mexican" fast food places.
