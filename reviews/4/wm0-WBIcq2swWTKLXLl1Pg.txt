We have only been there a few times but I have got to tell you, this is a pretty good mom and pops mexican food restaurant.  It is located where where the old Gin House used to be.  They have a good selection and pretty inexpensive prices.  Their food is really good!  I was pretty satisfied with their quality and mom and pop atmosphere.  Try it and you'll see that they are a GREAT alternative to Taco Hell down the street.
