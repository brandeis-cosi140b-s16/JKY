Stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a steak bowl and my boyfriend ordered a taco salad and both were very tasty. The steak had some really nice flavor to it. The ingredients all looked very fresh and we had a lot more options than at other chains that sell similar food (Qdoba, Chipotle, Moe's). For the two of us it cost $17 for two entrees and two drinks.
