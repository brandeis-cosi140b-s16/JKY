First off, I'm a lover of all Mexican food!  I could literally eat it everyday.  I could also eat chips and salsa everyday, unfortunately for my backside lol.  

I like this place- it's a bit more "fancy" for a cheaper Mexican spot.  It's a cute date spot.  Cozy booths so you can talk to your dinnermate in peace.  

We had table side guacamole.  It was great!!!  We asked for it extra spicy, and she even brought us an extra huge side of slice jalepenos to get it to the heat we were wanting.

The ambiance here is great.  If you want big portions- stick to my spot Three Amigos on Central.  I got the mixed grill fajitas.  The shrimp were tiny compared to Three Amigos and the portion in general of fajitas was half the size.

Ulimited chips and salsa were delish!  I'd go back, but may try something besides the fajitas.
