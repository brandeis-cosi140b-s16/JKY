Green corn tamale, rice & beans, chips & salsa, and a margarita. One of my all time fav meals. Tamale is one of the best anywhere. Salsa is perfect. This place has been there forever - and there is a reason- good food! Sit at the old school bar and watch a game while you enjoy fantastic Mexican food! I try to make this happen about once a week at Rositas.
