They really do have healthy, fresh ingredients, but your taco isn't going to have a lot of flavor unless you dump salsa on it. Also my hard taco fell apart in a minute cause their steak made it too soggy. They do have 5-6 free salsas, and the touch screen soda fountain. Their queso doesn't taste like real cheese to me, but it's alright! I like Chipotle better, but Ill be back here if convenient!
