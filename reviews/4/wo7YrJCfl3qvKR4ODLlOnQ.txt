I have been here several times and am a big fan of their tacos and their carnitas on the weekends.  It seems like in my experience, this place is at it's best when it is making more authentic Mexican food, as opposed to Tex-mex.  I always get lengua (tongue), tripa (tripe/intestine) and campechano tacos, and they are all excellent.  I get the feeling some of the people who have had bad experiences have ordered less authentic dishes.  Their burritos and nachos tend to be less than stellar in my experience, so if someone only ordered those, I could see them being underwhelmed.

On the weekends, the carnitas are about as good as it gets.  A huge portion with rice and beans for about $8 or $9, so good.

I see lots of negative comments about the salsa, and I agree it isn't the best, but it isn't horrible either.  Also, it is free salsa, how much can you really complain about it?  On the plus side, I find their hot sauce to be very good; good flavor, heat, and definitely homemade.

Stick with the authentic dishes, especially tacos, and you can't really go wrong.  Some of the best authentic tacos in town.
