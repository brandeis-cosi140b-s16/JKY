Nice and Flavorful Taco in South Park.   Place is a tex mex flair with a massive selection of Tequila.  If i wasn't so deathly afraid of tequila, after one previous bad night a long, long ago,  it would have been neat to sample the margaritas and shots .

I came here for lunch and it was really nice. My strategy was just to get tacos and no fillers. I got 3 single tacos and it was the perfect amount for lunch.  I highly recommend getting the standard PACO's taco. You'll be happy with your choice.  Then branch out and get one of the crazier flavors.
