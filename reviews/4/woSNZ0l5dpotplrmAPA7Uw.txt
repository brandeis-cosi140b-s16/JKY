I have been wanting to try Anayas for a while now but my husband was skeptical. He either wants Macayo's for sit down or Filiberto's for drive thru. Anaya's is a little bit of both.  

Stopped in on a Friday night around 6:30 to find it empty except 1 table with 3 diners. That was a red flag but we were greeted promptly and the restaurant was exceptionally clean, even the restrooms were spotless. We were seated quickly and immediately were given chips and salsa, and without asking they brought out basically tomato sauce for my 5 year old son. He was ecstatic, he had his own salsa and it made him feel special.

I wasn't really feeling Mexican..I know, I know, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. My husband ordered the Expresso Burrito with Asada, the child ordered off the kid's menu. All items are only $3.99 and come with either rice & beans or fries. He wanted the kid's cheese crisp. I tried to get him to order something else..so we could share, but he wasn't having it.  My husbands Aunt ordered a Pastor street taco with rice. 

Food came out quickly and was plated attractively.  My cheese crisp looked run of the mill, but I have to say it was exceptional. I'm really can't place what they did to that tortilla but it was delightfully crisp..almost like it was deep fried.  Husbands burro was of good size but he said the meat was cooked to much. I tried it and I would order it next time. To me the meat was carmelized from the grill and had excellent flavor. Aunt said the Pastor was good, she would visit and order the same thing again.  I did try the son's rice & beans. The beans had a good taste but the rice was just run of the mill spanish rice.

Our first dining experience at Anaya's was a excellent one, and it's a place we keep on our list. For 3 adults and a child our bill was only $40 and that included a margarita, Dos XX's and a soda. Fresh, fast food in a friendly, clean atmosphere. I hope they survive in this economy, it's a great neighborhood restaurant.
