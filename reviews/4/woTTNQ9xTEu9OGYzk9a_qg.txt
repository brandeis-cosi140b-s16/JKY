Even though there is a Pink Taco here in LA hubby and I never had the chance to check them out but always wanted to! Luckily we got the chance in Vegas this weekend.

I got the Panuchos (Pink Tacos) and hubby got Carne Asada Tacos and both were deelish!  You get 3 tacos with rice and beans.
What's addicting is the chips & 3 salsas especially the sweet & tangy salsa! YUM!

Can't wait to try the LA locations soon and other dishes!
