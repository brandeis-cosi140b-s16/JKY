Not sure why Nandos only has three stars? I get the Alfredo's green Chile dish every time. It's huge and tasty. I can never finish it. Also all you can eat chips and salsa. Awesome! 
Gina has been our waitress a few times. What a fun on-the-ball server she is!  You should ask for her. You'll be very happy. We always have to over tip her. Her service is that good! (And she is also a sweetheart. )
