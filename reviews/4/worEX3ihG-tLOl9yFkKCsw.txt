The price is right here. Quite affordable for good food. The service is also great. 
I had the shredded beef burrito which was tasty and tender. 
The tacos my husband had were also very good. Generous portions. The side of beans had great flavor. The chips though lacked flavor, but were not greasy. 
The salsa had great taste, not too biting hot.
