Half-priced margaritas on Saturdays? WOO HOO! 

We've taken our family here for dinner, maybe 10-12 times over the past 9 years. That doesn't really represent how much we like the food; we're just usually shuttling around other parts of town. 

So here's what to like: 
1. Consistently good Mexican food. From their standard combos to the chef's selections, everything we've tried on the menu has been really good. Yum! 
2. Chips & salsa until the cows come home. And it's really fresh salsa with super-tasty, hot chips in a bottomless bowl. Yum! 
3. Fresh tortillas, hot off the press. You can even buy a dozen for about $4... it seems pricey until you taste 'em. Yum! 
4. My little chitlins actually eat the rice and beans here. Nowhere else. Weird, eh? 
5. Did I mention half-priced margaritas... on SATURDAY?? We got their jumbo-sized house margaritas for $4. Even better, the bartender did not have a light hand. The worst part was deciding who got to drink, and who had to stay sober to drive... lol 
6. VERY reasonably priced. Dinner for five, with alcohol, was under $70, including tip... AND we had leftovers. 
7. Their whole menu is available to-go. Score! 
8. Friendly, efficient staff. I've never had to wonder where our meals, drinks or bill were, and everyone is smiling and courteous. BIG plus in my book. 
9. Mariachi music... ole! 

Not so great: 
1. Yeah. It's right by Sun City, which means a lot of golden oldies. More power to them, though, as they appear to lap up those margaritas like water. Just wish they weren't driving after... :/
2. The parking lot ain't great. This place can fill up, making parking only possible across the road... next to the railroad tracks. Meh. 

So based on my scientific analysis above, this place is a good value for a great, casual Mexican dining experience. Great spot to hit, on the way to/from the lake or Vegas, or if you're a local!
