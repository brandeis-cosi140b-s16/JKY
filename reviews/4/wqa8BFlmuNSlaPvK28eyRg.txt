Every year on my uncle's birthday (December 31st) my entire extended family (and usually some friends) goes to Ajo Al's.  

Every year my Father (or one of my uncles) gets me to split a giant (GIANT) plate (really enormous platter pan) of nachos.

Every year there are at least 20 of us.

Every year the food is good and we have an amazing time.


The menu is expansive, but not overwhelming, so anyone can find something he or she likes (even if you don't care for Mexican food, you can find something more American...without this place feeling like an Applebees...because it certainly doesn't).

The service is not always the best (always nice, but sometimes slow), ESPECIALLY if they sit you on the patio (they usually forget about you there).

I only go there about twice or three times a year, but it certainly isn't because it isn't delicious.  Definitely looking forward to it this year!
