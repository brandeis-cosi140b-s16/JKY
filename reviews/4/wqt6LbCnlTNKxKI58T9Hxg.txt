After reading the other Yelp reviews I planned to visit this restaurant, but then I saw a listing in one of those hotel guide magazines that described the cuisine as "standard Mexican food." Standard Mexican food bores me, but fortunately I decided to take a look at Garduno's online menu. Sure they have tacos and enchiladas, but they have a lot of interesting food as well, including 5 kinds of chili, lots of interesting seafood, and even some seafood gumbos. I had the house special gumbo, which included lobster, shrimp, and scallops, and it was wonderful. Nice and spicy, with fresh fish and lots of okra and other veggies. I also tried a couple of their margaritas. They were both good, but the better and more unusual one was a coconut margarita. It was smooth and coconutty, and the rim of the glass was coated with honey and toasted coconut. Yum!
