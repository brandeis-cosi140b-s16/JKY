Yep, it's a chain, but a pretty good one overall. The ingredients are just about always very fresh and tasty. You can get your items customized pretty much anyway you want as long as they have the ingredients. In particular, the meats are all very good and well cooked, unlike Qdoba which tends to dry everything out. The pork in particular is excellent. One nice thing:  you can get tacos priced per each one. So if you only want 1 taco or want 15 tacos, they will accommodate that. The price per taco is 1/3 of the menu price (where you get 3 tacos). 

One other point I want to make is if you eat Paleo or Whole30 or similar. It is surprisingly hard to eat at Chipotle on those programs. While the chain boasts of their sustainable practices in regards to ingredients, they often prepare items with non-Paleo ingredients. For example, except for the pork, all of their meats have soybean oil (Paleo/Whole30 no-no). Same goes for their fajita vegetables. This severely limits what you can order if you are eating on these programs. In particular, I wish they would change how they cook the veggies, as I really enjoy them. Chipotle does make changes to their menu items (for example, they just made their pinto beans vegetarian friendly) so it may be worth reaching out to them to request a change. Anyway, just something to keep in mind. Luckily, the pork is so good  and the red salsas Paleo-friendly I usually put that on a basic salad and am good to go. 

This location is a little small with limited parking, so be forewarned it can be a pain during busy lunch/dinner hours. 

Despite my issues with the use of soybean oils, definitely a good place for a quick meal.
