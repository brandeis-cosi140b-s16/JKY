Who would have thought that my favorite Vegas Valley Chipotle location would be at the mall?!  Yes there is a perpetual line, but it always moves fast and I firmly believe that the turn over is why the food always tastes fresh here.  They always seem to be on top of replenishment because they've never ran out of anything while I was there.  

Their chips are the best!  They spritz lime juice on the chips before they salt them which gives them a fantastic fresh flavor.  I have noticed that not all locations do this and their corn chips a very bland without the lime zest.

I like that they don't charge extra for fajita veggies (saut√©ed onions and peppers) like other similar restaurants; that they now offer brown rice and wheat tortillas; and that they don't charge you more for a salad or bowl.  Burritos, bowls, and salads are all priced by your protein choice.

The fun thing about this location is their seating in the middle of the mall walkway.  The people watching opportunity is priceless.  They also have in-restaurant tables, if you prefer, but it's crowed and usually loud.  

The one bad thing about how busy this location is, is their drink/utensil station.  It always wet for some reason and really congested with people trying to fill up.
