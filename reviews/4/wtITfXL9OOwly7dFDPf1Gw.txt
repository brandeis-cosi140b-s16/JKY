Very good blackened tilapia tacos. The lobster taco was good as well but a little expensive.  We have been a couple of times now and it has been good both times. My son had their bean and cheese burrito from the kids menu and ate all of it. Also had good ice tea. I am weird about tea I know but I hate all the places that serve gold peak (nasty) tea. This place has great ice tea. It's fast food but it's fresh fast food.
