We went there with a Groupon coupon, and found the food and service much better than expected. This is not your average Mexican restaurant. The menu is interesting and imaginative, and the service prompt, informative and courteous. But most importantly, the meals we had, Cochinita Pibil and a salmon special were very good. We will definitely be back.
