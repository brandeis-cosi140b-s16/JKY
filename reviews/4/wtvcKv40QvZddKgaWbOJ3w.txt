The service was perfect. The lady behind the counter was very courteous and helpful and big smile.  Orderded the enchilada and shredded beef taco and the cheddar nachos.  I was given a plate of chips and offered salsa bar while I waited for my order.  My husband is very picky about his enchiladas and he love the enchilada and the shredded beef taco!!!  I loved the nachos.  We will definitly be going back!! Yum!!!
