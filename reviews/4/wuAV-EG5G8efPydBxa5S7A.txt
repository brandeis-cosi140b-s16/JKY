7 of us visited for lunch on a Saturday (adults and teens).  Service was very good and everyone enjoyed their entrees.  The lunch entrees were just the right size and ordered off the regular menu and the portions were very large (may want to consider splitting between two people.

Based on this experience, we will definitely be visiting again.
