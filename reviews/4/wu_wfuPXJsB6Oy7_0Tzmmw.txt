First off, Terminal 2 at PHX Sky Harbor would safely be described as a remote wasteland on the far outer fringes but, I was desperate for something to eat between the 2 flights to get me back to Austin.  I had passed this place a few times and didn't think much of it but I saw a number of Airport employees in line to eat and thought, what the heck, couldn't be any worse than the other options there.  Probably one of the best burritos I've had in a very long time and the wonderful young lady who put it together for me offered to run down to their other store to get me one of their very cool t-shirts.  I'm not skipping this place again and highly recommend it - a pleasant and much welcomed surprise in the middle of nowhere :)
