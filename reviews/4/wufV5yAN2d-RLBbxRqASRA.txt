Chino is one of those places that I grew up eating.  It seems like it has been here forever and we used to order takeout from them when I was just a little kid.  There was a long period in between that I grew up, found other places to eat, moved away, and just plain forgot about this place.  Now, working right down the street, I've always intended to go back.  I finally did and boy did I miss this place.

Of course the ordering style is a bit strange and is the only thing that knocks one star from my review.  I don't understand why I can't just freakin order.  Why do I need to pretend I am ordering sushi when I just want a standard mexican bowl of rice and meat?

I ordered something...red pork or something like that.  I'm not really sure.  I just looked at the menu and picked a number.  It was great.  Spicy, meaty, excellent.  The prices were reasonable and the food was great.  No complaints there.

Sure the place is in a ghetto strip mall (although PoppaMaize next door is killer!) and looks dirty as a barn, but the food is great and you can always do take-out.  Chino is the best fusion in town...I must say.  They are all about the spicy and that is what I like.
