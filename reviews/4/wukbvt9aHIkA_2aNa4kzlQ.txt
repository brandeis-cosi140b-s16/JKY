This was a last minute find.  We were headed home to Goodyear when the traffic took a turn for the worst (it was close to 6 pm).  So I hop on google maps and find Rita's where we decide to pull off and grab a bite.  It was a great experience!  The area is a little off-setting.  But once inside it truly is the cutest little restaurant.  Our server was so sweet and helpful and attentive.  Great happy hour margaritas!  All the food ordered tasted great.  LOVED the salsa!
