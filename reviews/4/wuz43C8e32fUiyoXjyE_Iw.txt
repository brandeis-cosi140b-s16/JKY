Huge fan of Mexican food., love coming here after drinking or a long day at work. They have the small tacos for like 70 cents or something like that. Also have the avocado slices which I love. They usually hook it up if you order a lot of food. I like that it's more authentic then a Taco Bell or Chipotle. Most places in Vegas are just tex-mex.
