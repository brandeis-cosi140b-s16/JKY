It's cheap, fresh, and delicious! Far as Mexican, fast food goes- I perfer this place over Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Their guacamole is actually guacamole and is really yummy... most places it's some green stuff not something I want to eat. The chips are better then other places as well in my opinion. I really think far as chain food restaurants go this one needs to be around more areas of town!
