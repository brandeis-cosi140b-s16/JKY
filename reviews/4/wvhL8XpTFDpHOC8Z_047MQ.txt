Awesome experience from the mango and regular margaritas, the chips and salsa, table side made guac and crispy tacos! I had the 3 taco lunch special, 2 chicken and 1 shredded beef. The chicken was really tasty but after trying the shredded beef I was so mad that I didn't get all three beef! LOL. Yes, the rice is not the best I've ever had but I quickly looked past that in comparison to the rest of my lunch. The guac was super fresh and perfectly made as was the salsa. My travel companion had the chicken enchiladas and loved them as well. I felt since we were in Vegas, we had to try other places to eat but honestly, I would have been fine eating there every day! Will surely come back and eat there next time I'm in Vegas.
