I'm addressing this review to the Z'Tejas in Tempe, since I like the sidewalk dining there better, but it applies equally to the one in Fashion Square, Scottsdale.  It took me a couple of visits to warm to this place, but since they started serving the skillet corn bread and I've discovered the Catfish Beignets and Ancho Chile Fudge Pie, I'm hooked.
