New kid on the block and a winner for sure. Upon entering you'll be dazzled by the colorful d√©cor and the gracious service. This is a very affordable little spot right near a neighborhood bar, a great cupcake shop, and the $3 Cinema. We were wowed by the flavorful salsa put before us - not too spicy at all. And the chips kept coming.... Terrific icy margaritas (I'd get the rocks marg next time) and well-priced beverages. Every single thing we tried was delectable ... except the tamale. Why is that? No matter, everything else was delicious and we'll probably make this our neighborhood Mexican spot for dinner. Their brunch menu looked pretty tasty too. YUM.
