This is not my first time to carambas. It is an easy stop at any of the locations. This one at 67 and bell is clean and the staff is friendly. I usually order the giant caramba it's the most bang for the buck. It is the same every time I order it and I appreciate consistency. I came with a friend who ordered some other burrito that pales in comparison to the giant caramba and it was only 50 cents less. Needless to say he left hungry while I dined on the kings feast. It's now 5 hours later and I'm still full. I'll bet next time he will go big or just go home.
