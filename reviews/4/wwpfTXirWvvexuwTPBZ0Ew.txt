Wife and I ate there last night and it was good but not great.  She loved the bacon wrapped filet with Brussels sprouts, and my chicken schnitzel was very good, and would have been great if I was more into capers.  I like where they went with the chocolate cake, but the ceme brûlée didn't live up to billing.  Again, pretty good but not great.  

My one main irritation was all the advisories and signs about NO SPLIT CHECKS, and NO SHARED PLATES.  It's a lame way to kick off a night out having to learn all the gripes that management has about the restaurant business.  Our waiter was nice and very professional.  

We don't eat out that often, and have had better meals for the same money.  Four stars.
