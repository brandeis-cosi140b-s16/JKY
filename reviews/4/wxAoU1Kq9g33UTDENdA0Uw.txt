Service is always friendly here. Have been 3 times now and have had to wait 10-15 min each time for a table. They are always busy which I guess means it's good!  I have had the street tacos which are great but get a few because they are small. The best is the shrimp guacamole. Holy schmoly rolly Polly does this appetizer rock. It's so big it became our meal! Drinks are good as well and they have happy hours. Free chips, salsa, and beans!
