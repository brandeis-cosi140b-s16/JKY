I loved this place!  My family is a big fan of mexican, so we try to hit up the best mexican places in each place we go to.  When we visited vegas, we were desperate to get off the strip, so we drove to this place for dinner on a weeknight.  We were seated right away.  The layout is a little awkward as there are 4 smaller rooms.. I guess it is to easily accommodate smaller parties.  Anyway, the food was amazing!  We got some tacos and the fajita dish.  The servings were large and tasty.  I also enjoyed the complimentary bean dip.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for some place to eat off the strip.
