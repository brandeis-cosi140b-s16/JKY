Went their for lunch today with my wife and my old English sheep dog. Thay Sat us in the outside patio & my wife had shrimp fajhita, & I had a ground beef taco and a green corn tamale. Food and service was excellent. The place had a real authentic Mexican look. It reminded us of Mexico. We will be back. Red Estilo Mex would not let our dog on the patio, so we came to Eva's & glad we did.
