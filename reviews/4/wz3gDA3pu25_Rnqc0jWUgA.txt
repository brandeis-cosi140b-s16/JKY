When our friends told us we were going to a town up a mountain that had a population of 6 people, we were concerned with the outcome, but figured it must be something or they wouldn't take us there. This place is a well kept secret from the country, but not the locals. It was extremely busy and the restaurant was not only interesting to look at with all the details, but the food was really good. The scenery on the way is breathe taking. The food was not only good, but the staff were really nice and, in my opinion, prices were surprisingly lower than I would think they would have been.
