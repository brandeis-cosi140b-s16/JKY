Ok, so it wasn't an AMAZING burrito, but for airport fare, it was top notch.  Seriously, healthy food is hard to come by in airports- I always find myself grabbing a yogurt amidst the sea of french fries and cinnamon roles that are abundant in airports.  This time I was able to scarf down something healthy during my short layover in Phoenix.  No lard or MSG and plenty of vegetarian options.  Prices are fantastic- I spent $6 on a vegetarian burrito with chips, salsa and guacamole.  There was a neighboring Mexican sit-down restaurant with a fully stocked bar.
