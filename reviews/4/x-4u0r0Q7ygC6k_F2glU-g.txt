Love Kristine, Megan, and Nick! They know our "usual" and always make time to come by and say hi. Not just say hi, though. They ask how our week was, what's new...they take a general interest in us which is refreshing to experience from the normal bar atmosphere. It's dog friendly so be sure to bring your four-legged friend!
