I love me some Chipotle, and this place is pretty good. The chicken burrito or chicken salad is my usual go to. Sometimes we get crazy and get a side of chips and guac. 
The place is clean, the portions and food quality consistent, but the staff.... Ugh... Can you find some people with a little self direction? I mean, there's like 11 employees working and 2 making orders while 9 others stand around looking on with moony stares and strumming their index finger along their lips making motorboat sounds. The brown rice is almost empty, look down people take notice, anticipate a refill of the chopped chicken, don't make the line back up out the door! C'mon Chipotle, you're better than that....
$11 and change for a chicken burrito with guac and a medium drink (and yes, I know the guac is extra...)
