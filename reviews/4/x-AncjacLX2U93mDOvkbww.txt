1st time visit using a Groupon and i must say it was delicious.. I couldnt stop eating till it was all gone. I got the Garnachos Nachos with carne asada and it was the best nachos besides the ones i fix at home. My friend got a torta and couldnt even finish the whole thing, she loved it. We both will be back and i cant wait to try the $1 tacos!! YEP I am a fan.
