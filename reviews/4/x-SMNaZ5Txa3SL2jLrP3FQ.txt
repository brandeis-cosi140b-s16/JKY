Very nice exterior and interior which probably explains the little higher prices for Mexican food.  I was a little taken back by the table we were seated at as it seemed to be covered with plastic contact paper and had a couple of holes in it.  However, the salsa and chips were good with the salsa having a little more 'bite' than expected (which was a good thing).  I ordered the Carne Adobada in a red chile sauce which was excellent.  This is always my favorite dish to order and with it was a chicken stuffed sopapilla with green chile sauce (which I had never heard of but sounded interesting) and that was also very good.  The amount of food allowed me to take home a good portion of it for an extra meal!   The waitress and busboy were very attentive and the front desk seating people were very friendly both coming in and going out.  I was impressed and we will definitely be back.
