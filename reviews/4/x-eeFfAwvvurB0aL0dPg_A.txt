In an effort to start eating healthier, we opted to go to Chipotle today to satisfy our craving for a burrito.

First of all, they have an iPhone app you can order directly off of,  with their full menu -  toppings & chips & drink offerings. You can choose to pay on the app or pay inside the restaruant. Already I was a happy girl!

They gave us a 20 minute pickup time.  When we arrived, people started piling in.  Lucky enough, they have two spaces reserved for iPhone, online & fax orders. Another plus!  When my boyfriend went inside at 1:15 PM, they were finishing up our order, he paid & came right back out. Yes, another plus!

When we got home (about a 15 minute drive), our burritos were still hot inside the foil Yum! My chicken burrito with fajita mix and tomatillo green salsa was delicious. The chicken was seasoned just right & the fajita vegetables season was spicy. And the chips...crisp & flavorful, with the lime & salt. The guacamole was fresh & not mushy. 

Other notes: Not a huge place, but they do have a nice patio area with ample seating. Boyfriend said the employees were nice & the inside was clean. The prices do seem a bit high.

The biggest plus of all: eating the burrito & half the bag of chips, I didn't feel fat & yucky!
