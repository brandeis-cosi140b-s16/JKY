You gotta try Mim's Burger & Mexican Food for lunch if you haven't tried them already!  This is a little "hole in the wall" place located very close to the airport.  Catching an afternoon flight out to "BFE" from Sky Harbor the other day I decided to give Mim's Burger & Mexican Food a try. 

I was greeted by this very friendly man, the owner I believe, who was doing everything from taking orders to cooking and cleaning.  This place is bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the outside.  It's "dive-ee" inside too, but its clean and he has some really cool retro video games and a couple of pinball machines :^)

I ordered a double cheese burger with a side of fries.  He fried the fries fresh and I watched him cook the burger.  Everything he makes is homemade and taste very good.  

This is another one of those places "you can't judge a book by it's cover", so stop in see what's available inside.  Mim's is a great place for lunch if your on your way to/from the airport.  I'm looking forward to trying his fried fish or maybe even his BBQ brisket on my next visit!
