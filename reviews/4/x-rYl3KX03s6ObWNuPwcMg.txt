Delicious Mexican food. We stopped in for dinner after Photoshop World. Friendly fast service. Airconditioned. Wonderful carne asada. Great salsas especially the green one. unlimited chips. So nice to be able to order Diet Pepsi. Pretty expensive like the other restaurants at the Mandalay hotel, but the plates were full enough for 2 of us to ask for take home boxes. We ate lunch there a couple of years ago. Soft tacos and enchiladas were just as good last week as before.
