We've (me + 1) been 3 times now (each time, during the week, around 5-6 p.m.).  We are still fans!  The chicken is fresh, the customer service is excellent.  The people that work there are pleasant and helpful.  This is about equal or a step above Moe's (and I am a fan of Moe's).   But, since discovering Tijuana Flats/Concord Mills location, we haven't been back to Moe's.  The place is clean and the menu offers quite a variety.
