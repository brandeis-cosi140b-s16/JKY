Late nights and good eats for me at this Mexican spot.  I work at a club on the strip and after work I hit up Tacos Mexico before I head home. It's a must!! I will tell you though the only thing I eat here is the tacos. I usually get five and most of the time it's the carne asada. You can usually judge a Mexican spot by how good the carne asada tacos are and how they are prepared and this spot is THE spot to get some good, authentic tacos during the nighttime hours. Corn tortilla, meat of choice, onions, cilantro and salsa, what else you need? NADA. I will say that the patsor is only okay and the chicken is not that great, haven't tried anything else there. Stick to the carne asada and you'll be good. They also got a drive thru which is a plus and there usually is a line of cars bout 3 deep at 4 in the mornin.

Oh and the other thing is the location... Its on Tropicana near the strip. In other words - the "track" - so if these tacos is not satisying enough you can get you some nasty tacos from the random girls walking down the street at any time of the night!
