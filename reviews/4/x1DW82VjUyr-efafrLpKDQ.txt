Do you know how hard it is to find bao in Phoenix? Pretty freaking hard. I was trying to google "places to get bao in Phoenix" the other day and Adobo Dragon didn't even show UP!

...but then I ended up at DeSoto for dinner and realized AD has bao. And I fell a little bit more in love. (Again. I already love DeSoto.)

If you've never had bao, or you have an insatiable desire to consume a soft steamed bun that seems to be made of clouds and carbs, I suggest going and ordering the albondigas bao and the pork bao. You get two bao and a side salad for about $10, and its definitely enough food for a meal. 

The albondigas is a nice Mexican twist on classic bao, and the pork is (from what I understand) a more traditional form of bao. Both are delicious. Both are something I would eat everyday if I could.

Honorable mention goes to their curry noodles. I was just a little disappointed to find half my curry noodle bowl was actually a salad. What are you doing, Adobo, trying to make me healthy?!
