What a gem of a place! Gracious owners with a charming, nice atmosphere. The posole here is the best around. A local staple that is easy to overlook, I grew up down the street but just never went to eat there. I recently ate here for the first time, and now I keep craving and going back for that posole. Seriously delicious! Good cervezas and margaritas, too. It's a perfect midday lunch spot.
