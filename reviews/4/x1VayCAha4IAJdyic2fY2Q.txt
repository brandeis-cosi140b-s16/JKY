I really enjoyed my shrimp bowl-rito! The flavors mix well together and the portions are generous. There is a good variety of options on the menu including basic options (tacos, burritos, quesidillas, etc.). The menu also has some unique items such as nachos that use fries instead of chips. There are also a variety of toppings to choose from! The only thing that I didn't like was finding a lot of avocado skin into guacamole. A great lunch spot!
