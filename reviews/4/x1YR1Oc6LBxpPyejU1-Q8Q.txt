This place has the best happy hour. $1 street tacos, $5 skinny margaritas, and $2 chips and salsa. Also, during regular hours the margaritas are all fresh squeezed lime juice, great tequila, and fresh ingredients. The owner Obed takes great pride in his new place. I'm excited to have a new place within walking distance to our our house.
