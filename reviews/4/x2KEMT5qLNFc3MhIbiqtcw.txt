The fruity margaritas get a 5/5! Best margaritas i have ever had! The alcohol was top shelf, their flavors were unique and yummy! Baja Eden was my personal favorite!
 If your looking for those huge frozen margaritas this isn't ur place. The quantity is small but tasty and potent. Loved their flavored margs so much that i had 3!  Pretty smooth drinks, considering i didn't get a hangover the next day. 

Cant comment too much on their food, salsa was okay, chips were fresh, guac was mediocre, and had their rock shrimp+avocado crema+ quinoa fritatas (this was too salty).

Their chicken enchiladas rocked!  

They abs need reservations. We made it a week in advance and they were pretty direct as to when we were expected to leave. I didn't think when a party of 5 had a 300+ bill and kept ordering, we would still be asked to leave, but we were. 

I would go there again, the waiter was friendly, bars great, good ambience,  crowded but it was a good crowd.
