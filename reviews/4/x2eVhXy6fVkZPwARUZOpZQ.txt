A good quality burrito joint.  

The ordering process is a little confusing to the uninitiated.  Pick up a menu, and walk along the right wall to place a order at the counter.  You then sit down and they bring your order out to you by calling your name. 

They have a tons of different options for your burrito, so take your time and you can finding something you like on the menu

1 THING that you have to experience is : CHURROS.  They have amazing churros. OMG so good. I probably could eat 3 orders every time I go there.
