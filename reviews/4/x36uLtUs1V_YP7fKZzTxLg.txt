Went to this restaurant for the first time this past Saturday, seeing the $2 margaritas All Day sign out front. The restaurant itself is very clean, very modern, TV outside (the NCAA basketball game was on), and very friendly hostess and staff. 
For starters, we ordered several of the margaritas, fully expecting sampler margaritas in small glasses...I mean, what restaurant has full-size margaritas for $2 on a Saturday afternoon??? Well, apparently this one does! Full-size house margaritas for $2. And they were good! Absolutely best Saturday afternoon deal in the Valley!
For food, the fried camarones appetizer was good, and came out hot. The Tricolor chicken enchiladas were DELICIOUS, and presentation was excellent. (After seeing mine, a patron at another table ordered the same, and thanked me for the idea afterwards, as she enjoyed the dish too)
My friend ordered the Shrimp Empanada, and was a big fan of that dish too. Again, the presentation on it was excellent. 
Everything about this restaurant was fantastic, and I'll definitely be returning. 

One thing to note is that it IS a little difficult to reach if you're going WEST on Baseline...it's wedged almost against the I10, so you'll basically have to flip a U-turn at some point to start heading back EAST. (if you're heading EAST to begin with, no problems). Next to the Waffle House.
