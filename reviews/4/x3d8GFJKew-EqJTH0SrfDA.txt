Very good Mexican food. I love how the food is so hot the cheese and sauce are still bubbling on the plate when they bring it to the table! Much like Cali Mexican food. Not foo-foo "fresh mex." They do the basics well. Enchiladas are great, chips/salsa are rockin; good, and many people order the chile verde pork burrito. The Albondigas soup is the best soup around. Very basic, but delicious. Will cure any ailment (excellent for a cold or flu)! 

Casual place, easy for kids and picky adults to find a great dish. Popular for breakfast, closed on Mondays and some holidays (a week at Christmas time). 

Easy to locate off the 95/wagonwheel exit, off boulder hwy next to the gun shop.
