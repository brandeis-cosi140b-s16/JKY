I have been to Ajo Al's probably over 50 times over the last 15 years. This is definitely one of my favorite mexican restaurants. The chips are a bit greasy, but taste amazing. If you like hot salsa, request the "hot red salsa". You have to ask for it, they don't just bring it out. For years I would gorge myself on the gigantic Pollo Con Queso entree. I really don't enjoy over eating & a couple years ago I discovered the mini chicken chimi's on the kids meal... I order that, asking for it "con queso style" and I still have left overs to take home! They also have an awesome seasonal Watermelon margarita. If it's not currently on the menu, the mango margarita is delicious as well!
