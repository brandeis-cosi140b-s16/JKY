My boyfriend and I just visited this location for the first time this morning. We wanted to fuel up on something fast and tasty before a full day at the DMV. Don Tortaco has a full menu available 24 hours -- so we were able to feast on tacos for breakfast without question or judgement! Woo!

My favorite part about the whole place is the Salsa Bar. They have two salsas available (a green and a red) and offer a plethora of other toppings as well: whole scallions, diced white onion, cilantro, crushed red pepper, fresh sliced cucumber, quarters of lime, and on and on. I'm a saucy broad, so I really appreciate the ability to go to town on sauces and toppings - for free! 

The green salsa was vinegar based, with a nice tang and a bit of heat. The red was smoky, spicy, and thicker in consistency. I preferred the green; my boyfriend loved the red. 

As far as the tacos go, we ordered two each of the carnitas and carne asada. Both of us favored the carnitas, which were crispy, hot, and flavorful. The steak was great too, but we were wishing for more carnitas at the end of our meal. Both types of tacos were covered in a guacamole sauce, diced white onions, and pico de gallo. The tortillas tasted fresh and flavorful. 

All in all, great breakfast at a great price! As I type this review from the DMV, where I have been standing in line to reach the information desk for nearly 2 hours, I am SO GLAD that we stopped by Don Tortaco this morning. I would be a hungry, cranky monster without those tacos. And that's the truth. :)
