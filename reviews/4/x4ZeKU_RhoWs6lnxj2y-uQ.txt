A friend recommended this place to me.  Met my expectations and then some.  The food is really good.  I got the chimichanga--yum!--and my DH liked his burrito as well.  We both left holding our bellies because we were so stuffed and we only spent sixteen bucks!  Not the best atmosphere for a date, (hey, it's fast food) but very clean and comfortable.  Has a dollar menu, which is always nice, especially if you have kids.  We'll probably eat there again.
