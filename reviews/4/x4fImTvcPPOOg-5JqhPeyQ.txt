The food was solid. Nice chips and salsa, not too rich of beans, and the right amount of cheese. Ordered chorizo and eggs, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada tostada and an enchilada (just because we have to try an enchilada everywhere).

Chorizo and eggs - good but not great
Bean and Cheese burrito - not overly filled, so it could have had more
Carne asada - Excellent!
Enchilada - a very good enchilada (not on the menu, so make sure to ask)


The only problem was the service. There were only 2 people working, and the woman didn't speak english well enough so the chef had to come out and take orders. So he was obviously very busy and missed the side of rice we ordered. No fault to his own, he was doing everything, but it was something to note. We were thinking that maybe she fits more with the spanish speaking neighborhood, but for us it made it a little difficult to order.
