I have eaten here 2 times. The tamales are incredibly consist ant. 

The beef ones are good and super moist, they didn't use enough guarjillo chiles in the beef mariade in my humble opinion. .. 

The cheese ta males however are next level amazing! Seriously! Super cheesy with great sauce and always juicy.

The prices are weird. They charge too much for some things like a single tamale. On the other hand they only charge 22$ for a dozen though. Its 4 something for 1 by the way. 

I recommend getting a dozen and getting all of them cheese except for 1. Get the sweet one for dessert. Yum.
