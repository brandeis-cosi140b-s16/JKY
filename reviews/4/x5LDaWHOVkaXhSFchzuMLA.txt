Herrera's is probably better then every mexican food joint in its category. I'll even go as far as better than most fancy mexican restaurants. The 2 things that keep me coming back are 
1.) consistency - the food is always great, they literally never skip a beat.
2.) I'm a clean freak, and let me tell you they keep their restaurant CLEAN.
