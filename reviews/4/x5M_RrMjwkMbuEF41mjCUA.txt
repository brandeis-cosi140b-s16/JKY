Finally made a trip here last night and enjoyed my chicken and pork burrito with queso sauce, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, brown rice and black beans on a WHEAT tortilla. I was waiting to see when one of these Mexican grill joints were going to start using some other types of tortillas... there are some great flavors out there. Seeing how Zabas is the only one I have been to that offers an option besides a white tortilla. They also had brown rice as an option besides white rice which was actually a nice change. The queso sauce here is not as good as Qdoba and they charge you extra for it here (which I don't believe Qdoba does) so that is a big reason for the -1 star. They charged me $1.25 for what rang up as a SM. QUESO for the half a scoop of queso sauce I asked for on my burrito.

Overall the burrito was good... very flavorful. A burrito with queso sauce and a regular drink ran me $10. Bit pricey but at least it was good. The decor is nice and it was very clean. The location is not that great for them and I'm sure it hurts business but once you get to it its worth a try. I will be going back and giving a second opinion.
