The menu is not huge but what they offer is great. If I have had homemade tortillas before, I can't remember, but these flour tortillas are the bomb!  I love their salad and order the Fire Grilled Chicken meat to go in it. It is so fresh and the house vinaigrette is superb and adds so much flavor to an already tasty salad. By the time I hit the bottom of the bowl and get to the delicious flour tortilla, it's just the icing on the cake.

My husband gets the Pork Barbacoa burrito, enchilada style, and it is so jammed packed with meat and rice and other savory items. He loves it. And if we go for a late lunch, we don't eat dinner because the food is so filling.
