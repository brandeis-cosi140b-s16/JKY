(review is for breakfast only)

Fausto's is a hole in the wall taqueria.  Which isn't to say that they do a bad job (see the four stars above)--just that it's quick, tasty and not the healthiest thing you'll ever order.  

We went there for breakfast to grab a quick breakfast burrito before hitting the road and they wrap up a pretty delicious breakfast burrito.  The tortilla is fresh and packed with potatoes, eggs, cheese and, if you're a meat eater, a choice of meat (thick cut bacon, chorizo (spicy sausage), steak).  Oh man, that bacon is good--crispy and a little tough, which adds wonderful texture  alongside the softer ingredients.

On its own, the burrito would make Fausto's worth a breakfast visit (i.e. three stars), but their salsa alone earns the place a fourth star.  Many taquerias have a salsa bar put out for customers to add some flavor, but Fausto's salsa is wonderfully spicy.  The salsa verde has some good kick.  You'd think that's common in a Southwestern town filled with Mexican restaurants, but a lot of places dial back on the spice.  I love me some jalapenos (with the seeds) in my food and so it was nice to find a taqueria that could send little sparks to the tongue.  Add in a tray of free pickled carrots, onions and jalapenos and Fausto's gets my thumbs up as a good breakfast joint.
