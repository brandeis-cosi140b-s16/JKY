Pretty much all the Yelpers got it right, a fun place with good food at a reasonable price. Visiting friends asked for Tex-Mex, I Yelped and Casa Don Juan popped up. On a Sat Nite we had to wait for seating for 8 as the place was packed. The menu is extensive and has just about every combination and alacarte item you can think of. A excellent choice for atypical Tex-Mex experience.
