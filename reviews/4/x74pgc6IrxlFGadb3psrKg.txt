Is every Chipotle the same? Is every prom date the same? NO!

This location is fantastic. The staff is fast, the food is fresh, and the restaurant is kept clean. 

I've never been disappointed. 

I'm not going to get into the nuances of what makes for a great meal at Chipotle, because they are quite prominent around town. The menu is simple, and you can pretty much order whatever you want, as long as they have the ingredients.

My only piece of advice for you is, when you walk in, turn left to get in line. Don't be a jackass like me and turn right. You'll see what I mean when you get there...
