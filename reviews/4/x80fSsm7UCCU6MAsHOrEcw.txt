I have been frequenting El Pollo Loco for a couple years now.  It is a great quick option for something fast that is mildly healthy and low carbs (if you order right).  They recently went thru a renovation and really improved the interior.  Service is always prompt and friendly.  

Menu is pretty basic, they have added items like tacos ect.  The tacos are very good but not healthy at all.  The main menu item of course is chicken and they offer a few choices of family meals with 2-4 sides.  I recommend the loco salad with the avocado cilantro ranch, yum, yum.  

The chicken is not fried and is grilled but has a nice crisp to it, and served with corn or flour tortillas. You may doctor up with chopped onion, salsa and cilantro.

If you are in the area and need a quick dinner - Give El Pollo Loco a try
