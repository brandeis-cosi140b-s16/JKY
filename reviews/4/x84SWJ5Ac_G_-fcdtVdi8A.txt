This place was so yummy and fresh. I got the chicken teriyaki bowl and it was good. I will come back for sure. People working here were friendly and nice so that's a big plus. 
The above was the first time I went there. The second time, however, food was not as good. Food is fresh every time and the people working there are great. Mike the guy that works nights at the bar is super friendly. Victor, the day manager was friendly and made a point to make things right after they made some human mistakes!
Revised: went back and ..that is the reason for taking one star off. still a good place to go...clean...
