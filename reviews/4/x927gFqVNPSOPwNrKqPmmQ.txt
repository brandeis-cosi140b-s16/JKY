I've eaten at Matador almost once a month for about15 years. I won't get into the logistics of others reviews. I give the higher than average star rating based on service and the salsa. Service was really good: the wait staff is always nice and attentive. Never a bad experience.
The salsa is fresh and good. Made chunk style with fresh green peppers and they provide, in abundance two kinds (I like to think of myself as a salsa expert...both the eaten and the dancing type ;)!!). They also fry their own tortilla chips. 
Ok, so anyway for AZ/MEX it's good, not great. The combo plate is good, with a tamale, a taco and a cheese enchilada. This is food that is cooked for high volume. You can get much better in Arizona, granted but for downtown, it works. 
Lunch is always packed, especially later in the week for the specials. Decor is old Mexican: still reminds of the days when most of the politico's would come down from the capital on main street to eat in the 70's and 80's. I love it. It looks dated inside and the booths are red leather. 
I've never experienced the bar or the adult beverages at Matador so I can't comment on the quality but it looks impressive. 
One more thing: its a landmark in downtown. Anyone who works the downtown area knows this place and goes there once in awhile (they will admit it) for a quick AZ/MEX fix.
