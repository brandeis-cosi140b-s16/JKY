I went with a business group and lowered expectations, but sumomaya really surprised to the upside. Very upscale, modern space but casual enough for jeans. Large numbers of housewives and girlfriends of Scottsdale present and decked out. Crowded but we scored seats at the kitchen bar. 

Started with a sumorita, frozen margarita concoction that was terrific and terrifically strong. We took the server's suggestion and order a variety of small plates. Although a sushi traditionalist would be horrified, the goofy combinations actually worked very well. The standout dish was the hamachi ceviche. Slightly sweet with a citrus ponzu sauce, caviar saltiness brought it to an exquisite balance. Pad Thai was less successful, but still decent. Didn't have a bad dish. 

Was glad this was on expense account, but would bring family on my own dime if we are back this way.
