Gonna have to up this one star after my second visit.

Went back for lunch with one of my lunch Amigas and it was a good experience.

Salsa was yummalicious and the chips were warm, crunchy, and fresh.

The homemade tortillas were totally yummy.

I had the Carne Asada w/grilled shrimps.  Steak was thin and didn't have a lot of seasoning, but was T-E-N-D-E-R which is a rare find in a Mexican food place.  Most steaks are tough, and many of them have gristle.  Good to know this one is top-notch.

Beans were good, salad was decent, rice was fairly blah.

The one knock this time was service - again, like last time, the servers were slow to respond to an empty salsa bowl and an empty water glass.

Above average joint, but still not quite in the same class as Mariscos Playa Hermosa, which is my #1 Mexican Seafood stop in the PHX.
