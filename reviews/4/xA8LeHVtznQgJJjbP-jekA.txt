Far from fancy but when food comes into play, fancy does not matter in some places this is one hole in the wall I will be back to.  

Great food great service even though the communication factor comes into play.  When food is involved language/communication can be usually forgotten.  Food is the universal language of love.  This food is love, it may depend on the time of day but we have been there a couple of times and OMG good.

They have went out of the way to accommodate us they were almost closing this time  but she agreed to make us food right at closing.  I thought that was amazing, they could have said no but made us amazing burritos with extras.  Not only that  but she came out with a cup of champurrado which is kinda like a mexican hot chocolate, SO GOOD...  We left with a lot of homemade sauce FRESH hot made burritos and warm bellies from the hot chocolate and amazing burritos with extras.

I would recommend this for a hole in the wall joint with great food amazing service and authentic food...
