I'm upping my review one star for two reasons. #1 I just remembered that Mi Patio is a dedicated parter to KAET. Despite the long drive, they consistently donate food for 50 to 75 people during each of KAETs four yearly pledge drives. It's not often you find an establishment committed to the betterment of the entire community!  For that they get another star in my book.

The 2nd reason is service. It doesn't matter how busy this place is, you are always greated by a smile, served super fast, checked on throughout your meal, etc. They really do excel at service!
