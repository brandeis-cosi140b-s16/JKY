How have we lived in Goodyear for a year and never tried Se√±or Taco? We fixed that tonight and let me just say yum! My husband and son ordered the chile verde burrito chimichanga style and both agree that it's the best burrito they have had on the west side. I ordered the carne asada fries. First of all the portion size is HUGE! I could probably make 3 meals out of it! Not only was it big, it was delicious. The meat was super tender and flavorful. The fries also had beans, sour cream and guacamole. 
Yes the service was a little bit slower but think of it more like a restaurant that fast food and it might not seem so bad. I am anxious to try something else next time maybe a chile Rellano burrito chimichanga style. Mmmm. Always happy when we find a new favorite.
