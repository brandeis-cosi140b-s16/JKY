Following the La Canasta tradition, this location hits it out of the ballpark. The food is great, the prices are extremely similar to the other La Canasta locations and they have a chip/salsa bar!!! The flour chips are delicious; not greasy and very easy to consume too many if you aren't careful. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
