I suppose there are both pros and cons in having a pretty solid Mexican restaurant right up the road from your home. The obvious pro being the accessibility to great food and drink (generally Dos Equis or Modelo for me), followed swiftly by the obvious con of un-doing your exercise routine for the day. 

But in any case, I generally enjoyed this restaurant with the exception of cost. In the grand scheme of things, it isn't necessarily pricey. It is generally comparable to other Mexican restaurants. For me, if I'm looking for a quick, around-the-corner Mexican restaurant- this is definitely the place to be. If I'm looking to penny-pinch, I'd drive a few minutes down WT Harris towards the university and hit up Zapatas (my absolute fan favorite). 

I generally liked every other aspect of this establishment. The atmosphere and d√©cor were set perfectly for a Mexican restaurant. Good ambiance. The food was well prepared and was pretty delectable. Beer was flowing. The service was spot on. What more can you ask for really? 

There were specials here, which most looked appealing. 

Definitely worth a try!
