I always get the Veggie Salad at this place. It is a great, carb filled way to end any day. Their tomatillo ranch dressing is so good that I try to hoard it for other salads through out the week. 

This last time there I tried the queso for the first time. I was definitely missing out every time prior! One of the best quesos that I have ever had! 

Secretly, I hoping that they will continue expanding across the country. Ok, maybe not so secretly...
