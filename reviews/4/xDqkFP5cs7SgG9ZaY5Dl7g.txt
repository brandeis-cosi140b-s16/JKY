I've only been to Nacho Daddy once and it was fantastic! I ordered the filet mignon carne asada nachos and a raspberry margarita. The nachos were delicious. The chips are nice and thin and fresh, the cheese was melted, not a cheese sauce, and there was just a little bit of heat.  I also liked the smokey flavor that I think came from the meat.  These nachos are easily big enough to share.  The margarita was amazing. It didn't taste like a margarita from a gross bar. It tasted fresh and fruity and the flavors were balanced. 

I also had the flan, which was great. It was a little firmer than I am used to, but really great. 

I sat at the bar and enjoyed the videos from my high school days and the friendly service from Tyson (Tyler?) and the other bartender, who was fantastic.
