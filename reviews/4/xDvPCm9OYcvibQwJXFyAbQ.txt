First trying this place wanted to explore new options sense I live close by, I Got the taco plate 1grilled fish soft and crunchy shredded chicken with a side of black beans and potatoes, Im a fan of beans so they def hit the spot they were very flavorful. I didnt really care for the potatoes that were recommend but there tacos were so good I forgot about them so next time I will be sure to get double beans or try a new side and tacos are a must yummmy
