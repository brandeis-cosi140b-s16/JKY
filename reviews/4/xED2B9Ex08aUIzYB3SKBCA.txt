If you're an English only sort of person, Gorditas El Tio is probably not for you. For me, this most recent visit was an opportunity to bone up on my Spanish by watching a Spanish language version of Peoples Court on their television. Something about $2,000 in damages and a woman wronged. Guess it's back to Rosetta Stone for me.

The menu board is in Spanish, with some English. The frequent visitor punch cards (buy five combo plates, get one free) have one side in Spanish and one in English. The television is tuned into a Spanish language channel. And your order will be likely be taken by a person for whom English is clearly a second language. In other words, perfect! It's a Mexican restaurant for heavens sake! 

You order at the counter and they call out when your food is ready. Language is really not an issue. You'll have twenty, yes twenty, value combinations from which to choose. Don't be worried when you see no salsa bar and only ketchup and pepper sauce on the tables. You'll receive bottles of serviceable red and green sauce when your food is ready. I do wish they had the beverage machine in front of the counter instead of in back. Oh well. Not a big thing. The menu is extensive and the food is solid. The $1.35 mini tacos, for example, are quite generous. They also have a $3.99 menu para ninos. 

The d√©cor is very basic. A taco shop sort of vibe, but with a much more complete menu. Service is not ultra fast, but your food will be hot and fresh when delivered to you.
