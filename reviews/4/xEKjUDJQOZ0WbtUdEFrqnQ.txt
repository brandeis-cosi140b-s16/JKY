Best mexican food in town! The food was extremely flavorful and the portions were spot on. We kept going in for more chips and salsa. They should jar and sell that stuff!

We went in right before heading over to see Wicked. It was a great start to a wonderful evening. We started with drinks and appetizers. The drinks were great, not too strong, just enough to set the mood right. We had their Ahi una Tostada and chicken taquitos. Let's start with the Ahi Tuna Tostada, what a great take on two opposing dishes. It was extremely fresh and flavorful. Next up, chicken taquitos. The meet was seasoned to perfection and the shell was crisp and created the perfect texture. We knew from that point on that our entrees would be perfect. 
The wife had the Sea Bass and in her words "The best I ever had." I chose the Wagyu Skirt Steak and as predicted it tasted great. 
You can't go wrong with Mundo, just make sure your wallet is ready. It's just tough looking at bill knowing your paying that much for mexican food.
