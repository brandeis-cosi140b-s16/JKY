Stopped in for a quick bit since it's so close to my house. Identical to Chipotle.  Bowl was really good and similarly priced. Staff was super nice. Not a fan of the Buffalo chicken but they have regular flavor as well. So not busy for a Saturday afternoon which is a little shocking, could be the parking confusion. I think you are supposed to park at The Burger Company.  I'd give it 5 starts except for the chicken, I think they should just drop the additional flavor. Will be back for sure!
