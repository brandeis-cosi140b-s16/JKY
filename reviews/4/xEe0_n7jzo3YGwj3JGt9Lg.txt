There were six of us for dinner on a Saturday evening so we made advance reservations.  We were seated the moment we walked in the door and our server, Christopher was there a moment later.  Before I discuss the food or anything else let me say that Christopher made the evening.  He was attentive, friendly, funny and helpful.  One of the best servers we have seen.

Macayo's is an Arizona chain, so one should not expect "homemade" type food, and we didn't.  I grew up in Phoenix, not far from one of the original stores, which was called Woody's Macayo then, and ate there a lot.  The food is average, which is OK for a chain place.  I had the red chili, which was a little bland for my taste, but the meat was tender and cooked well, just not quite spicy enough for my palate.  

We had internet coupons for a free appetizer, which was the spinach mini chimis, and there was not one for the table of six, but six free appetizers, one for each person!  They were excellent and filling, so most of us ended up taking half our regular order home with us for lunch the next day.  Everyone was pleased with their dinners, which were reasonably priced and very big, so the dinner out was very successful.  

We have never been disappointed by a Macayo's store, and this one was no exception.  Good food with excellent service should always be a "go back" and this Macayo's will be the next time we are in Casa Grande.
