Being from New Mexico, and a lover of fine Mexican food from various regions, I am pretty particular about my Mexican food. It has to be just as good or better than I can make at home. I was pleasantly pleased with my visit to Valle Luna (Bell). I sat at the bar and it was hoppin'. Lots of people from their seemingly popular Happy Hour. My beer was cold, and the bar tenders attentive even though they were busy. When my chips and salsa arrived I was told one was hot and the other not as hot. I couldn't tell the difference other than one was chunky the other smooth and one had cumin and the other more cilantro. I was later told the smooth one is their Hot one. But I wasn't complaining I enjoyed both salsas and the fresh chips made in house. I ordered the Shrimp stuffed Poblano peppers. I was half expecting just a couple of mini salad shrimp but loved that this was stuffed with several good sized shrimp. The rice was just the way I like it and the refried beans were perfect. I will be going again.
