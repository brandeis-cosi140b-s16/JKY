Four stars for a quick-service Mexican chain with a drive-thru? You bet! See, I don't care for Mexican fare. Well, there are a few select items I enjoy, but I usually end up feeling greasy, heavy, and bloated after I consume them. And that goes double for the likes of most fast food joints that specialize in tacos and burritos. But there's some magic happening when lunch time rolls around and someone suggests Taco Time. I am always, always, always in. Heck, I'll even be the first to offer to go pick it up.

First of all, Taco Time never smells like burnt beef or grease. Every one I've visited has a clean, pleasant scent. And I've never had to clean my own table before I could sit down. But the menu ... ahhh. Allow me to suggest the chicken crisp burrito, a slightly crunchy flour tortilla gently cradling chunks of all white meat chicken, cream cheese, and green chilies. Or the veggie burrito, accented with real aged cheddar cheese and a sprinkle of sunflower seeds. The seeds, at first, sounded like a terrible idea, but they offer quite a unique flavor and texture to the burrito.

Mexi Fries ... are just seasoned Tater Tots. But boy, are they yummy. They even offer stuffed Tater-- I mean, Mexi Fries. And, this location in particular even offers a huge smoothie menu, with such add-ins as protein powder and vitamins.

Oh boy. I just ate breakfast, so I probably _should_ wait at least an hour or so to declare "lunch time."
