One morning I woke up next to a burrito and although I do not know exactly what kind of burrito it was; it most certainly was from Qdoba.  I'm a huge fan of pretty much everything there; nachos, salads, and of course the occasional burrito.  In general Qdoba is tasty, fresh, and predictable and if it wasn't for their late night hours, I don't think I ever would have had to pick rice out of my bed.
