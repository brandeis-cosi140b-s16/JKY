Went there the other night, and my husband and I with little one thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  Staff was friendly, I can't remember the last time in an Anthem Restaurant a manager stopped by to see if everything was doing well, he seemed genuinely concerned about our enjoyment. A huge plus.  I remember the old restaurant and Ocho Locos is leaps and bounds above that one.  We will definitely be back.

I had the street tacos, yummy.
Hubbie had shrimp fajitas, which apparently they only serve on the weekends. (they need this all the time) my only complaint.
Daughter has chicken strips and French fries.
