I've gone twice and had the green chili burrito -- I have dreams about this burrito. My boyfriend has tried the carnitas (which is not shredded) and chicken. He said the chicken was great but wished the carnitas was shredded. This is a going to become a go-to place for us! 

Con: I wish the restaurant actually had morning hours so I could get the breakfast burrito for breakfast!
