I went there last night with my boyfriend after hearing many positive reviews from friends and co-workers. It lived up to the hype. The atmosphere is a little more lively then what I typically like to go for when it is date night. (Bright lighting, open center booths, open kitchen concept) Please note, I am not knocking them for these features. I can dig it. 
On to the food. We had the Coctel de Camaron for an app. and the white Sangria for drinks. We both liked them. We split the Paella De Campo and each got a taco. I opted for the Carne Asada, and he got the Al Pastor. Both were good, but my vote was for the Al Pastor. It was simi sweet, not overly sweet which is why I chose the asada instead. Then we over indulged and got the coconut pudding for dessert. We enjoyed it, but could have used less chocolate shavings (I know, what kind of girl says that?) The chocolate shavings were shaved small, but there was a lot of it which I personally felt took away from the pudding.
Okay the best part, the price. We had a total of 4 drinks, 1 app, 1 entree, 2 tacos, and dessert for $56. I was very impressed. Keep up the good work!
