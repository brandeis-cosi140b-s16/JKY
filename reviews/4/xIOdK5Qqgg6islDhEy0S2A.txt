I don't know why it took me so long to try Burrito drive!  I ordered delivery for the first time last week.  It was recommended to me by friends to try the Grilled Chicken Burrito.  I also looked through their menu and couldn't resist the sweet potato Quesadilla.  It was a good choice. It was AWESOME.  Those caramelized onions in with the sweet potatoes and the dipping sauce made it perfection.
The delivery was quick and the driver was very nice.  I always happen to be just outside of the delivery area of other places on Willy/Atwood, but I was excited that they have a larger delivery area.
The Chicken Burrito was good, I wished that the salsa was in the burrito and not on the side.  The flavor of the chicken was really good.  I was very pleased and I'm sure will be ordering again in the near future!
