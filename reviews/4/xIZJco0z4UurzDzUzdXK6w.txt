Salsarita's had a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The manager Mitch greeted me and made suggestions because it was my first time. He was a very friendly and professional. He was even leading by example by cleaning the dining area and making sure it was presentable. You could see the reflection of his positive energy in the staff. I ordered the burrito bowl and was a fan of how I got to choose my own ingredients while moving down the assembly line. Fast, fresh, and delicious! I will be back to this location.
