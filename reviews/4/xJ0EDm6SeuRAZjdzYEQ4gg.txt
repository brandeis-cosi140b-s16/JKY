Let me start by saying I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food but this location has become a regular lunch time delight. Julio's has great combos, the re-fried beans and rice are perfect and the burros enchilada style are just what  the doctor ordered.  I used to think that  Chipotle had some of  the best Mexican food around but this is my neighborhood spot now. The have a punch card where if you purchase 9 lunch combos you get the 10th free. They also offer free tortilla  chips and your choice of mild or spicy salsa. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
