First time visit and got food to go. The camarones cucaracha were awesome, crunchy but still juicy on the inside. Shrimp and octopus cocktail was delish, fresh and flavorful. Appreciate the fact that they still gave me chips and salsa even though it was a to go order since the majority of places won't include them. Staff was friendly, place was clean and welcoming ambiance. Can't wait to come back and eat here, hopefully the won't be out of callos. Also hope they get a Web page or something where one can look at the menu especially since they didn't have to go menus either.
