Been here a couple times just for the margaritas and chips/salsa in the bar area.  The margaritas are pretty good, I usually prefer the classic margarita, rocks.salt.  This menu had an add smoke option as well as the add heat and/or add fruit option.  This time I went with the guava margarita add heat and my boyfriend had the classic margarita add smoke.  Both were really good, i think we ordered another round after that to go with our chips and salsa.  We usually get the tasting of 3 salsas with chipotle/chile de arbol and the roja.  The salsa is good, usually the best thing to snack on while we drink.  Still haven't eaten there but most likely will go there when we just want to have some margaritas and chips especially because of the smoke/heat option they have.
