I have an emotional connection to this restaurant so I may be a little biased. This is the Mexican fast food that my parents would take me to when I was younger...whatever but I LOVE ARMANDO'S. Armando is always reliable on a late night or really, any time at all. I haven't had a majority of the menu, but for basics like the bean and cheese, chips with cheese and guac, rolled tacos with cheese and guac are delicious when you're craving such things. I also absolutely love their veggie burrito (without lettuce) and the Armando's breakfast burrito. Sometimes it can be hit or miss, usually involving too much unmelted cheese, but I can't help but love it. I will always root for Armando's over any other late night Mexican. Even when I lived in Tempe I would drive out to Armando's. My friends agree that it is the best amongst the Mexican fast food. I've never had a problem with service, even over the 4324328940 times i've been there. They always give plenty of napkins and sauces which is always necessary when eating Armando's. Go there! Don't let the Fili B's in the same complex defeat Armando's!!!!!!
