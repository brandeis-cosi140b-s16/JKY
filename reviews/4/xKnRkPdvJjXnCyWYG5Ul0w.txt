The two cons for Mariscos Ensenada is the loud music (there is no escape in the dining room) and long wait to get paid and get out. 

That said, it's a quality mariscos experience. A little on the pricey side but, hey, I don't always need the cheapest seafood. Cleaning up the two items listed above, it was a fine experience. Food was good, service was friendly and fast, and the place was clean. Give it a try if you've got that Mariscos hankerin'.
