My uncle worked at la piñata while he was going to ASU..about 20 years ago. So I've been coming here for years. Not my go to Mexican place usually..but with their new location it could be. 

It's super cute! They needed the upgrade. 

I sat at the bar - ordered a michilada. The bartender made up their own. It was pretty good. 
The menu design is a headache. Stuff all over - confusing. I didn't see a enchilada, taco, tostada, bean and rice combo. So I went with the relleno, taco and tostada. Chips and salsa was delivered promptly. The chips - a little stale the salsa -- well it wasn't ketchup thankfully. But s jalapeño wasn't in the top 8 ingredients. 

The food was okay. For all the white people in the area.. This place will be off the cha..ughh it will be busy and do well. I'll stick to tacos atoyac. I need some spice to my life.
