I can't believe I am reading this much negative response to this place... I think it is very good for what it is and where it is. The green chile is excellent, the street tacos are very good too, and they do not butter the quesadillas to death. I couldn't disagree more to the negative comments I am reading about this place...The cutomer service is excellent, they are always very friendly and the place is very clean. 

The service and food are your best option in that part of South Phoenix.  I choose Gran Taquito everytime!
