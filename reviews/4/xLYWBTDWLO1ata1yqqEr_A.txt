First time visit and came away happy. I opted for a pair of beef tacos with what I thought would be beans and rice on the side but they ended up in the tacos. Both options though are on the chalkboard menu overhead after closer review. My order was served to me a few minutes later at one of a handful of inside tables. Quite a few folks were doing take-out due to the beautiful weather so seating was not a problem.

The ingredients in my taco were fresh and tasty. They double shell their tacos to prevent structural failures from occurring. Provided with the meal was a small container of what I assumed was a house salsa. I should have been tipped off to the contents due to the small amount provided as it was some of the hottest sauce I've experienced. I'd return again with my now better knowledge of their menu.
