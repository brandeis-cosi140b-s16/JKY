I love tacos from here. I used to get the burrito, but it's just too big. Now, I prefer the tacos, and that way I can get one with each flavor: I'll get a white bean, 2 black beans, and I'll get different salsas on each one. Sometimes, the staff can be a little snarky about my mixing and matching...that's my only complaint. 

At this location, you can hop on Brueggers' wireless connection, so it's even nicely wired if you're trying to check your email or get some work done while eating your Tex-Mex goodies. The guacamole is superb, and I enjoy all four of the salsa flavors.
