I always get yummy cheesy enchiladas with rice and beans and it's always scolding hot and everything's great. The one reason I don't go as much is because my mom knows the owner and went to high school with her and last time we went the owner just kept talking to her about old times and kind of didn't let us eat in peace. No offense I just know my mom felt awkward so I'll probably be going by myself. But the food is really great.
