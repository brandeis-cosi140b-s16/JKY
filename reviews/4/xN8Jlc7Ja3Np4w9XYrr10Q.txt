They do not put sugar in the white rice. That's kosher salt. If you believe the hype, ask for a manager. They keep their kitchens clean for inspections. I guarantee having once worked there, they would never add sugar to the rice. People stop making false claims!

This place has a great reputation, I love the food. It's on the smaller size for chipotles as they go. Try the patio. Not many people seem to know about it. Line moves pretty quickly here. I recommend ordering your food ahead of time if you have a timed lunch just in case. 

Also their margaritas are bomb. Yes I have them for lunch but I'm usually not a light weight.
