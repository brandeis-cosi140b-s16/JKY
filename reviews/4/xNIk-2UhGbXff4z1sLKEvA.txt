This former Teakwoods location still sports the same light fixtures, but the cheesy Mexican-ish decor effectively sets the mood for a cheesy Mexican restaurant, replete with a giant sombrero for birthdays, gaudy tile tabletops, a creepy painting of a stereotypical mustachioed melancholy Mexican man, and the iconic sizzling fajita plate.

You've heard the old adage "judge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa." The salsa was not at all spicy, but it had a decent, slightly sweet flavor. It wasn't my wife's favorite, so if you like more spice with less sweet, you won't like it either.

The service is at the same time frenetic, polite, and terse. The combination is slightly off-putting, but functionally they are quick and thorough. Just don't expect the waiter to be your new friend. Also, they brought out my wife's tacos before our meal, and her meal was an appetizer. Weird.

We had the fajitas and a quesadilla. The tortillas were decent, as were the sizzling fajitas, rice and beans. It was a solid meal, though nothing truly special. One oddity was the 4 dollar charge to get a combo of beef and chicken. My wife's quesadilla was just chicken and cheese on a tortilla because she requested it that way, but they were accommodating and she was happy.

Overall this place is a 3.5 star place (but I'm nice so it's 4), and considering the alternatives for sit down eating under 30 bucks, this is likely your best option in town unless you want to open your wallet a bit at 347 or Brooklyn. Not the best Mexican food, but the best place that actually serves you the Mexican food. Which I suppose translates to "better than Penascos."
