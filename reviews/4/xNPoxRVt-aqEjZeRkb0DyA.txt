I had never been to an On the Border restaurant until Friday and I'd always wanted to try it. We ordered the made-to-order guacamole to start which was FABULOUS. They make it right by your table and give you these massive freshly made chips to eat it with. Yum. For my meal I got the fish tacos and they were delicious but really filling. We sat on the outside patio area and it was nice, minus the annoying flies and gnats. It would be nice if they put some screens up on the windows. Our waitress was super friendly and kept making sure everything was fresh and tasty. I will definitely be returning for that guacamole and to try what else is on their menu.
