Stopped in for lunch...nice room and very good service. I had the carnitas (sp) special. Excellent. My wife ordered carne asada street taco's...fantastic. The chips were fesh and the salsa was hot. We have been here once before and had a very nice experience then also. BTW the horchata was good too. Did I mention the good service?
