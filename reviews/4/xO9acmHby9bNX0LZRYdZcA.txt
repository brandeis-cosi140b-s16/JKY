I'm used to paying double for less than what I got at Rositas; so that alone is a big plus. I tried the carnitas burro and it was delicious -- tender, flavorful, non fatty meat and I had a few sips of their mango margarita with chili powder which was quite amazing as well! 

I will definitely come to Rositas the next time I'm in the mood for Mexican.
