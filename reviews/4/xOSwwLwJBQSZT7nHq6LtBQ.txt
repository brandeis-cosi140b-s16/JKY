We went tonight for dinner, had a great time! I believe that life is what you put into it. If you go with a positive attitude you have a positive experience. I agree the food wasn't the super best I've ever had. But it was good. Probably not worth the prices they charge. We're talking $18 and up for an entr√©e. But the service was great and the place is very beautiful inside as others have noted. I will post a couple of pictures, our waiter was great. And since my daughter is hearing impaired and uses sign language they even brought over another waiter who knows sign language which I thought was really nice. The manager, or at least I think it was the manager, he didn't introduce himself, came over to our table a couple of times and thanked us for coming which I thought was very nice.
