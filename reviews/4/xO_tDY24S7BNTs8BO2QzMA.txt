Food is reallyyy good - I always get the cheese enchilada (and I hate enchiladas) with a beef taco, and the fish tacos are AWESOME too. They deliver really quickly. Side note: if you get it delivered, have exact change if you're using cash. EXACT change. One of the delivery guys always refuses to let us pay separately with cash when we order for lunch at work and it turns into a huge confusing mess...more dollar bills thrown all over the table than the stage at your local strip joint. Just either pay with a card or make sure you have the exact amount!
