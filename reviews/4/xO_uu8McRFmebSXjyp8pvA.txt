The Cactus Rose is a relatively new offering - though there was a Mexican outpost in this shopping center (in this same exact space, if memory serves), it was not the same as what is here now.

When they first opened, decorations were on the slim side - even the name of the restaurant was only a banner on the front of the building.  Either the delivery was delayed or they are doing well enough to afford an actual sign now, because there is an actual sign out front.

That is a good thing, because it should attract more people to the food, which is worth trying.  The beans are among the freshest I have ever had - rather than an unrecognizable mush, you actually see beans on your plate.  This is not to say that the beans are the only good thing - just that it is an impressive feat, for something as lowly as the bean.

On the downside, they can get busy - say after church services let out on Sunday - and the service is not quite as good as the food.  Hopefully they can catch up, at which point they will be well worth a stop.  Right now, it is a bit of a stretch.
