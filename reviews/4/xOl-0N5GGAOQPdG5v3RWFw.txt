What a wonderful evening we had at Macayo's... where do I begin. I get a little bit of a daze when I think about Macayo's mostly because I felt so warm and welcomed when I was there. Everyone working there is so friendly and cool. I love the creative interior and the restaurant itself feels like an modern adobe. 

We were celebrating pre wedding, and it was a full house.. friends family, the whole shebang was out. Everyone was hungry and happy. Macayo's had a beautiful and plentiful array of salsas, fresh tortilla chips, and guacamole for everyone to enjoy. Once the buffet was unleashed it was just utopia. 

Must try: THE TAMALES.... holy guacamole, I don't know if I want to know what's in this because it tastes so good it has to be bad for you. One of the best tamales I've ever had in my life. Who would've known. There are a few to choose from and all of them are winners. 

They had other basic Mexican food staples: beans, rice, asadas, poillo and those were all deliciously divine too, but I HIGHLY recommend the TAMALES. 

Tips: The parking lot can get a little tight, so Uber is a great alternative. Also using uber is smart to prevent poor choices when under the influence. Check out Fate Brewing near by and Ernie's. Both are within 1 mile from Macayo's.
