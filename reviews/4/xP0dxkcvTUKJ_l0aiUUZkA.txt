For anyone who has not been here, please show up on a Tuesday so you can try their amazing tacos first hand. The location will make you worry initially, but do not be afraid, it is very cozy and clean inside!! It's got your standard bar seating along with an abundance of seating areas around the restaurant. 

The green salsa is amazing, my coworker and I can always down a bottle and a half in one sitting. It has wonderful kick to it and the texture is just perfect. You'll be munching more chips than you ever imagine (and this is before your order comes in). You can also buy the bottle of salsa to take home if you can't have enough of that goodness.

Taco Tuesdays has $1 tacos (grounded or shredded beef) and $2 coronas. Do not be afraid of eating more than 5!!! It is that good. 

I've also tried their Chicken Mole enchiladas and their chimichanga. Pretty good size for the price and quite tasty. 

The staff there is very friendly and will engage in good conversation with you (even when they are swamped with customers on a Tuesday). Shoutout to Jose/Luce! You guys are da bomb.

All in all, very reasonably priced mexican food and consistent. A little jewel on Camelback Rd that should be discovered by anyone that enjoys Mexican food.
