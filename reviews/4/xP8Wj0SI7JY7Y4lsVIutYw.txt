Sitting out on the patio, great way to people watch!  Brian, our server, was 'Johnny on the spot!'  Brought drinks just when we were finishing,  talked with us about our experience here at CWLV, and stopped by every now and then to check up on us.  Bring the house of Sammy Hagar, they had shit music on when I first got he re.   I requested some Sammy music and got a great set list of Sammy music, solo stuff, Van Halen, and Chickenfoot!
When I'm not in Cabo, this is where I get my Wabo!
Brian ROCKS!
Update:  Manager Kristin stopped by when she found out REDHEADS were in da house!  Thanks Kristin!
