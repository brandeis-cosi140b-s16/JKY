Had the tacos here a couple of times during my stay in Vegas. The location is super convenient to base. The tacos aren't the best in Vegas but they are pretty damned good. The service was nice and the lady even remembered me a couple days later, probably had something to do with the white boy ordering tongue. I would definitely give this place or any o their locations a chance if your hungry for some good authentic Mexican grub.
