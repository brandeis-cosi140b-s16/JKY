Overall our experience at Sir Veza's was very good. The kids actually ate their entire meals, which typically never happens. Kids meals are served in a compartmentalized tray, which is great for mine who don't like their different foods to touch. They have a wide variety of tacos, and I enjoyed each one I ordered - the short rib, the shrimp with sriracha; and the fish. However, I would definitely skip the table-side prepared guacamole for $10 - it was basically four lumpy avocados thrown together with some other minor ingredients mixed in. It was not terrible; just very bland and not worth the price. I liked the ambience of the place with the indoor/outdoor seating; and they had a DJ playing music outside on the patio on Saturday night. Like others have said, service was not great, but it certainly wasn't the worst I've had either...I assume this will get better with time. My family and I will be back to try out some different menu items, and to enjoy another cold MX brew out on the patio.
