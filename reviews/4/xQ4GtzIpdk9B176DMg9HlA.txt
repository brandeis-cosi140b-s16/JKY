Went here on a recent Friday night to catch the tail end of their happy hour  (3-6pm) for dinner.  A lot of other people had this idea too, because not only did we have to park quite a ways away, Chuy's was packed out and we barely grabbed the last table available.  

I had an order of two chicken enchiladas ($1.99), my wife had a quesadilla ($1.99) and I got a Baja Brew ($2).  With some guac on the quesadilla, and complimentary chips and salsa, total of less than $8, what a steal!  

I was mad when I had the chicken enchiladas...mad that I only ordered one plate!  They were delicious.  I think what put them over the top was the strong mesquite broiled flavor from the chicken.  They were also nice and crisp with a good amount of cheese and sauce.  The quesadilla was okay, nothing special about it, and the chips weren't super fresh.   The beer was cold and had a nice flavor to it.

It had been awhile since I had been here, but I'm going to try to be back again soon for those chicken enchiladas!
