Being new to the area we decided to give Gordas a try. The whole family was glad we did. I ordered a couple tacos one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were delicious. I especially enjoyed the carnitas but both were delicious. My husband and son both had burritos and after seeing them it left me wishing I had ordered one myself even if they were big (lunch for the next day). My daughter loved the enchilada plate that came with rice and beans. There were many different types of salsa in the salsa bar and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. I only wish we could have enjoyed our meal with a beer. We will definitely be back though the food was that good.
