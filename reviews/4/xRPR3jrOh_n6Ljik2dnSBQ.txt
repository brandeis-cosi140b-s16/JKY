One of our favorite local places.  The staff is always friendly and make great margarita's.  Good menu choices other than the standard fare.  DH always lives shrimp and gets good quality for the money.  Haven't found anything on the menu we don't.  Love the whole pinto beans instead of the usually refried option. Try all the margaritas where else can you find this many variations!
