Have you ever bitten into a mango that is so deliciously sweet that you want to repeat the experience?  If you have then you'll want to stop by for a mango ice cream at Tortas Paquime.  Best mango ice cream you'll ever have.  Yes, the tortas are good and the quesadillas and the chilindrinas are too but I LOVE the ice cream at this place..  The mango ice cream is my favorite but all the other flavors are good also.
