I've tried my share of Pollo Loco locations, and this one is pretty consistent. The chicken is always well cooked, flavorful, and never burnt (yes, that has been a problem at other locations). When I'm eating low carb, I often opt to eat here instead of other "fast food" places. While ordering chicken with a side of veggies or cole slaw is always a safe bet - be careful with some of the salads have have higher calorie dressings or ingredients like tortilla strips (or that tostada bowl!) Although I love the cilantro ranch dressing, I tend to use the avocado salsa instead. Also, the chicken tortilla soup is worth a try - and they'll make it without tortilla strips if you ask.
