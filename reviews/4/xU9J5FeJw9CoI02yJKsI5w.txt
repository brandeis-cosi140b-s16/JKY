I went there with family on Friday night at 5:30 with a reservation.  We were seated promptly.

The tortilla chips were good and were accompanied by three different salsas--one mild one in a larger bowl and two fiery ones in smaller bowls.  The hot ones had good, complex flavor to go with the heat.

The Maria Maria margarita was flavorful & refreshing.  I ordered carnitas, which were very good, but not quite as fall-apart tender as they should be.  The accompanying black beans were richly seasoned; the rice was good.  Portions were abundant--I had enough to fill myself up for two meals.

My brother-in-law had fish tacos that were OK, but lacking in salt or other seasonings.  Others in our party had enchiladas that they were pleased with.

Service was very good, especially for the restaurant only having opened so recently.  My two-year-old niece spilled her water and the waiter was quick to respond.

The restaurant is cool and cavernous.  There's a great selection of tequilas.  The guitar player/singer is very good.  Great place for groups or families.  Nick says check it out!
