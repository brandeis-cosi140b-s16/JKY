I came here for the first time in a few years for work lunch.  The place was pretty quiet inside - though the outside tables were full.

The service was quick and pleasant.  I opted for the verde pork chili.  It was really good though, not as spicy as I had hoped.  The serving was generous - more than ample for one lunch, brought the back home for left overs.

While it was pretty quiet for us, I have been here before when it was quite busy and loud.  That's partly the nature of the place - lots of hard surfaces, bare walls, etc.  And, yes, when they are busy, there is a lot of rushing of servers around, etc...
