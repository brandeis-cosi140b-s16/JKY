I've been watching this place under construction for a while, and was glad to have the opportunity to pick up a late lunch to go today.  I wanted to try a variety of their options, so I got a 2 enchilada plate with chicken with green sauce and short rib with red sauce, as well as an order of chips with hot salsa on the side.

The food was fantastic.  I was a little skeptical of how they were going to pull off the cheese part in a to go order (my favorite part of enchiladas is the melted cheese on top!) but by putting the enchiladas in the oven right in a foil to go dish, the cheese was melted perfectly!  Both meats were tasty and high quality, and the sauces were savory and amazing.  The chips were clearly homemade and the salsa was plenty spicy but also flavorful.

I took off one star for an ambiance issue - it was SO loud in there with all of the stone/metal surfaces that it was hard to hear and speak to the line cooks to place my order without shouting and leaning a bit toward/over the super high glass partition.  A little bit of insulation for noise reduction would do wonders.

I can't wait to go back and try the cornbread and mashed potato enchiladas, as well as the chicken tortilla soup!
