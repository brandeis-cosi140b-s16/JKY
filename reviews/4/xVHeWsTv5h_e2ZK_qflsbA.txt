Fast and friendly service. Food was fresh, hot, and tasty--nothing spectacular, but still much better than any of the local something-berto's Mexican food restaurants.

Dining area was clean and open, and had a great view of the used car lot and Motel 6 across the street. ;)

I'm definitely adding this to my rotation of local restaurants for lunch!
