Biggest & Best Carne Asada Breakfast Burrito that I have found. In doing research for a new Las Vegas Best website, I have sampled almost every burrito in the Metro Area and Fausto's has just surpassed Pepe's, Carlito's & Roberto's in size and flew way past Roberto's in both Size & Taste. The addition of Potatoes speaks volumes in a burrito.

Cant give the place 5 Stars because its about as plain and boring as a Jail Cell inside. Why have a TV on the wall if it's not turned on?
