My wife and daughter took me to Secreto's last night for Father's Day Dinner and we were all very impressed with the menu, service and food.  There were a couple of missess, but for the most part, it is a good example of what ethnic cuisine done right can do in the "Tuk"!

We ordered the chips and salsa, the shrimp and the pepper and cheese apps.  They were all delicious, fresh made and promptly served.  Mind you, it was after 9pm on a Sunday, which in Awhatukee is the equivalent midnight in other neighborhoods but service was still prompt and consistent.  

For the main course, I ordered the scallops and chorizo, mw wife had the enchiladas and my daughter ordered the shrimp pasta dish.  All were expertly prepared and served piping hot (almost too hot) to the table.  My wife was a little disappointed with the crispness of her enchiladas (the tips were blackend from the hot oven) but enjoyed the taste.  My scallops with sauteed spinach and chorizo was a first for me but undoubtedly something I will order again.  My daughter is planning on having the rest of her pasta for lunch today so nuff said on her opinion.  All of the portions were sizeable  but the dinner salads got a thumbs down.  Ranch dressing with Romaine was too strong and left a bitter after taste for all of us.  

Good selection of wine by the glass and beer but their signature drinks were not printed on the menu which was a miss because they have great Pear margarita's.

Overall, good experience and we will definitely be back.  Affordable, good service and good food.  What else can you ask for in Awhatukee???
