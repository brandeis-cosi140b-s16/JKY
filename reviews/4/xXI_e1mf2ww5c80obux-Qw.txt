The atmosphere isn't great, the seats in the booths are very uncomfortable and awkward. It's half bar, half restaraunt and is small inside with one entry/exit which makes it awkward when a lot of people are coming and going. The food was good and fresh. The service was great. The owner was a Marine and is friendly. We support locally owned/veteran owned businesses so was a plus.
