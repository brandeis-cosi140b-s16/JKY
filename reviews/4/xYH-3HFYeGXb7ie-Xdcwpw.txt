Thursday's Special of the Day: Chili Relleno with beans, rice and a soda...cost me $5.25 AND it was delicious! It was a big portion and it also came with a warm tortilla on the side. My only complaint ; there were a few stray pieces of meat in the sauce that covered the chili and I am vegetarian, no biggy really,  just picked them out and moved on. The inside area where you order is kinda tiny, but they have an outside window where you can wait until your order is up. We stayed and sat on the patio to eat which was cozy and surprisingly quiet considering it is right off of a main street. I will definitely keep this in my list of places for a yummy fast lunch while at work. Keep in mind though, CASH ONLY!
