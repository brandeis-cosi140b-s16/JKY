Best white-people-Mexican-food around LOL!

 The stuffed quesadilla is BOMB. The cheese crisp, yum. Tacos, great. Chimichanga NOT great, it's very very dry. EVERY time I order it, too. Actually most of the shredded beef is dry. 

And the green salsa is sweet! Which, seems to be either a love or hate feeling for most people. I happened to LOVE it. mmm. The beans are cooked with like a smoke flavor so they taste super good. Overall I would recommend Rosa's. It's not SUPER authentic Mexican, though. Just sayin. Kinda Mexican American...Kinda.. But I enjoy the flavors. And you can tell by the almost-strictly white audience that dine in here, its not 100% Mexican flavors, but don't let this comment turn you off. It's still really good, we come here quite often. just know that there are more authentic places

Overall, there's more good food than bad. I would recommend this place (and I do often) to my friends and anyone else.
