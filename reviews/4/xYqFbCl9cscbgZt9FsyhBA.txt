This place is right down the street so I grabbed a menu today. I couldn't decide what to get because (I guess) I'm particular about a few things!?  First, the meat...how is it prepared? Shredded, cubed? Then I want to know if there are a lot of onions involved here. Los favs uses a crap load of onions and I was sad about that. Finally, the sauce.  Bland, hot, flavorful.

I finally decided on the green chile pork mixed w beans chimichanga  w red chile sauce. So good! The pork was small cubes, not too much beans. The sauce was perfect; flavorful and not overpowering. Came w small sides of beans and rice. The rice reminded me of the perfect rice Mi Amigos served b4 it became a chain and the mess it is today. When it was on McClintock and Guadalupe.  The take out order comes w a generous portion of chips and the salsa of your choice. We got hot and it was. We also got the grilled chicken burrito w green chile sauce. The green chile sauce was hot and not as flavorful as the red, but still very good. Finally, the grilled chicken soft tacos in corn tortillas. The chicken was diced small. Perfect. 

I have to mention the staff.  The woman that rang me up was super nice and mentioned that my order was checked twice.  That made me feel good so I didn't have to do it myself.  

I hope you give this place a try and I can't wait to get breakfast burritos on Sundays!

Update: 1/4/13.  They no longer give generous portions of chips or hot sauce which is a bummer.  They don't even give you enough hot sauce for the number of items you order.  They've also left things out of our to-go order several times since our first visit.  Their food is still really good so we'll keep going back for now.
