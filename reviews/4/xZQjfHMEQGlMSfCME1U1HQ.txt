I could eat Mexican food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Oh wait, I usually do as green chile is my all-purpose condiment.  Unfortunately, the pickings in Scottsdale are slim.  So I was thrilled when ATS opened a location here, two in fact!  My husband favors this location over Old Town, although it is closer and we've never eaten there to begin with!  Regardless, this location is just fine and they have Mexican Coke in 16 oz bottles!

I usually get tacos because in my mind, corn tortillas over flour erase the calories in the tub of guacamole and large quantities of chips I will also be consuming.  I really like the carne asada, and the chicken is okay, too.  But the Al Pastor is my favorite by a landslide.  So much so that I have to remove a star for not having it on a Saturday afternoon.  I guess it's everyone else's favorite, too.  However, when almost your entire menu is built off of only beef, pork, or chicken, running out of one is kind of a big deal in my book.  But it's so good, I'll come back again and again!
