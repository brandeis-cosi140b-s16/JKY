When you walk in a Saturday night and the place is packed, it's a good sign. When most of the patrons are Mexican, it's a great sign.  Don't let the strip mall location and unassuming exterior signage fool you, this place is the real deal if you want authentic Mexican.

Carbon, Al Pastor, Lengua, and Asada, oh my!  They rocked the beef selection so hard. I could barely contain my excitement as I perused the vast menu of combo plates and a la carte items.  I settled on the 3 taco combo plate to kick things off, and went with a variety pack of carne asada, lengua (yeah, tongue baby!), an al pastor.

They do it right by using those little corn shells, doubled-up for saucy staying power, and piling on the meat.  Tiny tacos, lots of meat, sauce at the table, can't be beat!  

Lengua - mmm.  tasty. kind of like machaca taste but sooo tender and almost fatty feeling.  Really good

Carne Asada - solid choice, as usual.  Probably the least adventurous as it's pretty much just grilled steak, but it was good.

Al Pastor - really interesting flavor on their pastor items.  Loved it, actually, but it may not be for everyone. 

Table sauce selections:

A few in bottles (chipotle, standard milder red, standard crayon-green bottle of habanero death) and then 2 homemades (green chile/tomatillo? and some red one?)

The green homemade sauce had really nice flavor and I made sure to apply liberally to all items.  I suggest you do the same.  After round one, I quickly and regrettably followed up with an order of 2 sopes (pastor and lengua).  They were also excellent, but my stomach had tapped out awhile ago so I only got about half of each down.

If you like authentic Mexican...........

get your Jalisco on.
