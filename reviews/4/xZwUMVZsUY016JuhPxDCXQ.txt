First time at this Fili B's. My first impression: the place is clean, organized and well laid out. They have a good salsa selection but sans Carrots and Peppers. Sad day. The menu board looks very good. Definitely an upgrade from most Fili B's. 

I ordered five orders for take out. I had to make several changes due to various allergies and all orders were done right. 

I got the Adobado Plate, which consists of marinated pork, pico de gayo, lettuce, beans and rice. It was scrumptious. It's easy to over cook since it's such a small dice but mine was rich and flavorful. 

I'll be back.
