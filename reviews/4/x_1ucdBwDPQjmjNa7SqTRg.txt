Not the prettiest place to get food, and have been shorted a taco or two once. With that said, they have THE BEST milanesa torta. Me and my husband drive a ways now to get it since we recently moved. Had it last night and still as good as always. I do think they have newamagement now. The old owner was always there and was not last night. The green salsa had been better, but the torta and pastor tacos are so good they could be eaten without it last night.
