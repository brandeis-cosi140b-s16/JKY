The taco al pastor is the best i've had. They only serve it on weekends and its made to order. The al pastor meat is slowly spining on a spit and the cook cut the meat as the order comes in. 

The carne asada burrito is grilled on charcoal and not cooked on a flat top so it has that chared smoky flavor unlike most carne asada around where its cooked on a flat top. This maybe the best mexican restaurant in my opinion. This is my go to mexican restaurant. F*** filiberto!
