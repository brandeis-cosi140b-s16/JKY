Heaven had best have a 'bertos or I will be sorely disappointed.  This one is the closest to me, and there are always two or three cars at the drive-thru 24/7.  There's a reason: at least a few of their dishes are fantastic.

I've gotten takeout there about 20-30 times.  Most commonly the carnitas super nachos, which are HUGE and flavorful, with more than enough of every topping.  Slather with two each of their red sauce and green sauce.  Be sure to have a friend handy--otherwise, you will convince yourself that reheated nachos aren't so good and therefore you should finish the entire deliciousness in one sitting.  Chips--crispy and tasty, never stale.  It's the kind of chow that's so good, you scrape the bottom of the styrofoam container for remnants.

I've gotten really tasty taco combination plates a few times, and the huevos rancheros breakfast plate is also yummy.  I don't branch out much here because the nachos and tacos are so spectacular.  If anyone else posts a review and raves about a different dish, I'll go for it.  Oh yeah.. got carne asada once and I recall the parachute-sized tortillas that came with it were incredible.
