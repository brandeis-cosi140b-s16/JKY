I generally enjoyed this place.  I'm kind of a Rock and Roll fan and really enjoy Sammy's work (Chickenfoot Rocks!).  So, when I got the chance to go to one of his signature joints, it was a no brainer.  

First the drinks.  I had the Waborita.  Three of them actually.  They were, as expected, really good.  I've had Cabo Wabo tequila before and it's a good tequila.  These drinks were large and packed a punch.  Not to mention, they tasted good.

Second, the food.  The food was also good.  The portions were large.  Not super large.  But not small.  The food tasted good and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The salsa, which they claimed was XXX spicy, was not what I expected as XXX spicy.  It was hot though and tasted good.  

Next, the service.  Service was prompt.  The waitress was attentive to our needs and friendly.  Really couldn't ask for much more!

The price.  It's a bit on the high side.  But then again, you are in Las Vegas.  If you are looking for cheap Mexican-ish food, there are plenty of Chipotles and Taco Bells floating around.  The quality here is better.  Expect to pay more.  

Lastly, the atmosphere.  This is where I have my only real complaint about this place.  It felt like Jay Z, Pitbull, and Drake were on loop play, with the occasional rock song thrown in.  I know there are people that like that crap, but come on!  This is Sammy Hagar's place.  Play some damn Rock and Roll!

All in all, I recommend it.  Just be prepared to spend a bit above average and to hear some crappy hip hop pop junk music.
