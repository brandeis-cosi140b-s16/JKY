Love this location (and you can see from my activity that I enjoy my Roberto's)! The food is always well prepared, fast, and fresh. It's in a kinda sorta strip mall next to a sweets shop and behind the 7 eleven by unlv. Never crowded (even on taco Wednesday), and always seems to be the same four guys working. Whatever, they know their stuff and the food definitely shows it.
