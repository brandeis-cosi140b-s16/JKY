A group of five friends ate "family style" (shared everything), allowing us to sample a wide variety of dishes. Group consensus was that the chicken flautas and jerk chicken burrito were the highlights, though nothing went uneaten! I personally especially enjoyed the jambalaya, though it was a bit spicy for a few of our group's more timid eaters. The green sausage had a neat look, but it tastes suspiciously like sausage of other colors. 

Service was very good, and the BYOB policy was appreciated as we enjoyed margaritas while dining. 

The churros, served with ice cream and chocolate sauce, were a delicious finish to the meal. While the restaurant has an out of the way feel, I'll certainly be back!
