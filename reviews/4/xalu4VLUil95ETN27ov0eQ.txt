Thank you Yelpers for pointing me to this restaurant! 

Wife and I tried a few tacos, arepa, plantain and yuca fries, and a few other dishes over two separate visits. Had a cold beer to wash down the good food as well. Great spot, warm food and quick and friendly service. Charlotte needs a lot more of such restaurants!
