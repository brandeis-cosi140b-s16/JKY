If you are looking for the most authentic Mexican experience in the eastern Phoenix area, this is definitely the place to go.  Be warned, a translator definitely might be necessary!  My amiga and I had this spot recommended because it's one of the few that serve Birria and I would definitely agree on the quality.  Birria is a kind of goat soup that is spiced heavily and served with tortillas.  

The restaurant itself is more or less a large room with tables and a cashier stand.  The menu is 90% Spanish, and there were definitely a few things I had never heard of before.  Every time I've gone there I believe I have been the only non-Spanish speaker there, but for the most part everyone is very friendly.

Again, this is not a date-spot or a place to impress anyone (unless they are snobs about traditional Mexican food!), but rather a good place to go to kick it with some Telemundo and delicious food.

One last piece of advice if you're headed there - bring cash!  They definitely don't take credit.
