When I moved back to Pittsburgh from New York I found myself in constant withdrawal because I no longer had a taco truck on my block to satisfy my cravings.  I had pretty much lost hope in Pittsburgh until I came across Edgar's Taco stand at Reyna Foods.  These are probably the best tacos PIttsburgh has to offer.  The tacos are also picture perfect.  I have never seen such a beautiful taco.  Seriously.

For only $5 (plus tax), you can get two tasty and fresh tacos.  The ingredients are super fresh, and the tacos are prepared on the spot.  The actual taco is a perfect blend, and they are packed full.  I got the carnitas and pollo tacos.  They meat was not spiced as well as I wanted, and they were a little too mild for my taste.  There also wasn't any sauce/salsa/etc. out, and this lead to a rather mild taco.  However, I plan to come back for the full experience soon.

This is definitely the best place to find real deal tacos in Pittsburgh.  The staff was super friendly, and I can't wait to try the burritos as well!
