When I first started to write this review, there were a few complaints that could have been easily resolved by speaking up. Been here dozens of times, I've seen a lot of people do it wrong (with these tiny burritos!) and it's mainly because they don't ask for the extra stuff. You don't ask, you don't get. As far as the Chipotle chain goes, this is a great location and they've accommodated my requests. And I know my Chipotles. Their rush hour assembly is worked down to a science and their management is solid and friendly from the run-ins I've seen. It's also one of the biggest Chipotles I've been to, with more than ample seating. One thing I don't understand, though, is how to take it to go. The juice always gets everywhere. Might want to offer some plastic bag option for those commuting.
