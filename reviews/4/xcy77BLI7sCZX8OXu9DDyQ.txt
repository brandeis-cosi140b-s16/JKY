When I heard that Moe's had opened shop in the EpiCentre I had to give it a try.  I am a big fan of Moe's.  There are plenty of what I call the "Big Giant Burrito" places, but here is why I think Moe's stands out above those others.  They give you free chips and salsa with your BGB.  They have 5 kinds of salsa including a tasty tomatillo salsa which is my favorite.  Less than a week old this Moe's was running fairly smoothly.  The line for food was 3/4's of the way to the door, but it moved quickly.  The staff assembling the BGB's did a good job of moving the line along.  

Here is the one bad thing about this location.  The cash registers, salsa bar, drink machine, lid & straw station, etc, were jammed into a corner that has a support column right in the middle of it.  The 100 flavor coke machine didn't seem to be holding things up too much, but salsa bar, lids & straw station did cause a bit of a traffic jam. I was able to get my food, drink, & salsa, find a seat, eat and get out in about 40 minutes.  

So even though it was busy it wasn't too bad to get in, eat and get out.  Moe's is great and the layout works well except for the corner of delay.
