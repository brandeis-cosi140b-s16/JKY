When you're at Nacho Daddy, you have to try the nachos! 

Came in on a Saturday afternoon and we were quickly greeted by the hostess. Upon entering there were basketballs and hoops located on the back walls, my boys were entertained. There was no wait so we were seated right away. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful, since it was our first time she made recommendations.

Items ordered:
-Fiesta Chicken Nachos ($14.95)
- Spicy Shrimp Nachos ($15.95)
- 2 chicken tenders and fries kids meals ($6 each?)

Our order came out quick and the food looked delicious, although, it wouldn't hurt them to add more fries to the kids meals. The plates looked bare and my boys finished the fries in a matter of minutes. The fiesta chicken nachos were really good and came topped with refried beans, salsa, queso fresco, sour cream, and guacamole. My favorite were the spicy shrimp nachos, although, they don't really live up to their name since they only have a small kick. The tortilla chips are jalapeno chips, they're topped off with monterey jack cheese, jalapenos, diablo sauce, tomatoes, and cilantro. Everything was very delicious and our meal with drinks came out to a little over $50, so it was inexpensive for 4 of us to dine in. 

Food was good, atmosphere was pleasant, our server was on top of everything, we never had to wait on refills and she constantly checked up on us so excellent service on her behalf.
