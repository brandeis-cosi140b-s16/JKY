Crab cakes....fantastic! My only knocks at this place are that they do not have Guacamole (for things other than fish tacos) and that the scallops were a tad over cooked. BUT, I can look past this as the food, atmosphere and staff are awesome and overall this a great place to go! I recommend the Crab Cakes, shrimp tacos, chicken quesadilla with Baja sauce.
