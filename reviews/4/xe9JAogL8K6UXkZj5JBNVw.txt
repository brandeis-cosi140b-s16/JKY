BEST VEGAN ENCHILADAS EVER. 

Margaritas...not so much. Tastes like you're drinking straight syrup.

Guy behind bar: complete prick. Made fun of my vegan food tasting like a cardboard mushroom. Way to sell your own product and give it a good name, asshole.

The service is mediocre BUT the food is so amazing that it totally made up for anything that the employees lacked. The fact that they offer VEGAN MEXICAN FOOD thats extremely flavorful is enough to keep me coming back!
