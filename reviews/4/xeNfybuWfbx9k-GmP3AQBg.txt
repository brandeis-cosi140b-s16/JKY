I love this chain so much but this location is lacking in service. Every time I go I feel like I am seriously inconveniencing the staff. A 5 star chain in my book but with a star knocked off because no one really feels like working here. Chips and queso or chips and guac (though the guac at chipotle is better) have to round out every meal (unless you're having nachos, in which case it might be chip overload!). They have a rewards program too that others have mentioned. If you've never had it, definitely try it out, but don't expect happy staff.
