I really wish I could give 3.5 stars to Leticia's. I've been here three times and had widely different service each time. The first time was fabulous and inline with the overall score this place gets on Yelp. Our waiter was very helpful in navigating their somewhat complicated menu and process. It all turned out well.
The second time we went was a tragedy. We arrived with friends for a double-date night, signed in and waited outside with lots of other people waiting as well. After a half hour and noticing other, new tables getting seated before us, I enquired of the hostess what the deal was and found out that we'd been totally skipped on the list about ten patrons ago. After expressing my displeasure, we still waiting about five minutes, then on the way to the table, my friend fell due to water on the floor. Apologies? Manager rush over to gush on us? Nope...just a, "Sit here" in a booth a little too small for four grown adults. The food was still good though.
Third time, tie breaker, we arrived on a Sunday after church and sat outside and it wasn't very busy. This time the service was prompt and the food delicious. The beautiful weather on the small deck didn't hurt either.
So, that's why I'll let the "tie go to the runner" and give a four. We'll see what the next visit delivers. My advice? Go when it's not super busy to ensure a good trip.
