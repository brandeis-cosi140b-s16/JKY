Good day drive for us touristy folks!  Even more fun via motorcycle!  One of the only places left with the ever-so-delious prickly pear icecream!  For some reason, the bathrooms really stand out in my memory of this place.  Guess they were really fun for bathrooms with the paintings!  The saloon has all the things you'd expect in the wild west.  Saddle up!
