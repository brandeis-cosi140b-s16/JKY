4 Stars for an overall satisfying experience including the best Chile Relleno I've ever had. El Torito uses pasilla peppers, which are dark green, and havarti cheese. Damn good!  The green chile is very popular here, and we all enjoyed our margaritas. The tortilla chips were a little disappointing, but 19 of us had dinner together, and everyone enjoyed it. This family run restaurant has thrived for 39 years - it was packed when we were there. It's easy to see why El Torito attracts a loyal crowd of locals. I'll definietly go back.
