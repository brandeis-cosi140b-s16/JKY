Saw the reviews of this place earlier today so thought I would give it a shot.   Area is a little iffy but nothing major.  The inside was really comfortable.  We sat down and got our chips and salsa right away.  Decided to wait for my soda before dipping in to the green salsa sue to reviews.  good thing.  Hot Stuff!  Good flavor tho.  Red was more managable for a medium type person as myself.  Ordered the Red Chili burrito and right away tried the rice and beans.  AWSOME!  However the Red Chili burrito was average.  Pretty bland and some of the meat were big chunks of really tough eat.  Still good.  5 of 5 on everything but the burro.  Burro was probably a 3 or 2.5.  Not going to be on my regular rotation but I'll probably be back and just get a bean burrito.  Im not very adventurous with my mexican food so...
Beans were great tho.  Worth the trip alone.
