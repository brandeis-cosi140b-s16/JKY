Found this little gem after leaving the RenFaire.  Quite a few others had the same idea so our table of 8 had a 45 min wait.  The layout is odd with very little "waiting space" so the 45 min felt much longer.  The resturant has an industrial edge without the cheesey mexican decor.  It was clean.  

The salsa is very good. The house special hot salsa was green, tangy, but not really hot. The cheese dip was so-so and lacked flavor. 2 of our party are vegetarian.  They had the zucchini enchiladas and the shrimp chipolte.  Both were excellent. The remainder of the party had more typical fare....only nothing is exactly typical.  Its more mexican fusion than standard mexican. The pastor had pineapple; the tripe taco was deep fried so the tripe "snapped"; the shredded beef was very tender and well flavored. The flavor and portion of food was generaous. The manager, Mario, stopped by several times to check on everything. 

I deducted a star for A) the trash in the restrooms had overflowed and B) the sanitation score, while high 90s, was hidden behind a plant (a no-no).  I would definitely eat there again.
