If you are looking for HIDALGO Regional Cuisine look no further THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!

Brain Cheese Crisp , Cactus Soup , Tacos De Cabeza , Huitlacoche (corn Smut) Barbacoa (Hidalgo State Dish) , Mixiotes and much more .

This place is located in a small strip mall (all Mexican) behind another business so it is hard to see from the road the name is EL TLACOYO . 

The cheese crisps or as our waitress call them quesadillas  (a long list of many to try) are really more like flaky crispy dough pockets in a half moon shape  . I didn't have the acquired taste for the corn smut that is considered to be a delicacy or the pumpkin flower either but that is just me because these are very special dishes .

I do have to say as far as chicken burritos go mine was a five star burrito since it was so much tastier than any I had before . The chicken was white meat carefully shredded , very moist and very flavor able with lots of minced onion and cilantro some tomato through out . You can order enchilada style baked with sauce and cheese or without I choose without and really enjoyed the two sauces they give you to try the jalapeno cream sauce that is very layered with flavors and the smokey creamy chili sauce both sauces are EXCELLENT but are spicy maybe a seven out of ten .

I remember seeing lots of Mexican Fish dishes on the menu,I think I saw goat? and I know I saw tripe .

This place is not fancy but is extra special and adds to the diversity of the area and is WELL WORTH a Try!
