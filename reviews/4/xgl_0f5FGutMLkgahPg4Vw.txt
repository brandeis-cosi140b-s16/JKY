Very unique reuse of an old church, yes an old church that now serves great tacos, beers and tequila!   We tried many items on the menu and all were very tasty, moist and unique overall.  Good salsas (i preferred the smaller red and green salsas personally.  Great atmosphere and decor!  We'll certainly be back again!
