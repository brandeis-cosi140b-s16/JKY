Friendly staff, decently priced seafood options and yummy tacos. The chips and salsa were good and pretty spicy, so take caution if you're not very good with spicy food. The calamari fries were good but wish there were more than 8 pieces. And it was nice having refills and drinks to take to-go. Downside would be just not enough room inside for seating.
