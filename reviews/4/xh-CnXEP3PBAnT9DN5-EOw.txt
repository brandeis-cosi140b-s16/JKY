If I lived closer to this Chipotle location, I'd go here all the time. Of course, the food is exactly the same as the South Boulevard Chipotle (which I frequent at least once a week), but this location is just much larger and has an adequate number of tables to meet the demand's of the lunch crowd. Not having to sit crammed next to someone else makes it a much more enjoyable experience. As for my favorite food there, I tend to go with the chicken burrito bol. Mm. So good.
