Excellent find for a quick meal.  The wife and I were on a very short layover and needed something quick.  For such a busy airport, there isn't much to choose from here, especially close to the departure gates, so we opted for 360 Degree Gourmet, which appeared to be serving fast food Mexican.  I opted for a Chicken Spinach Mushroom burrito, and my wife had a taco salad of some sort.  My burrito was excellent, with rice, black beans, and the aforementioned chicken, spinach, and mushroom.  There wasn't much chicken or mushroom in it, but it still tasted great.  The wife was very complimentary of her meal as well.  Prices were typical airport level, but since it tasted so good it wasn't a big deal.   No seating is available, but they do have some counters you can stand at if you'd like.  It's pretty crowded in there, so we headed for some empty seats at one of the gates to eat.
