Its a bit overwhelming how many fast food burrito chains exist and what really sets them apart. Moes you get free chips, Qdoba has really good rice and Chipotle is apparently all organic? I am all for organic so I had to check them out. When I arrived the line was nearly out the door but the service moved at a steady pace. I got a chicken burrito with everything in it, including guac. I swear it weighed three pounds which had me wondering if I could finish it, but in the end I destroyed it. I am not sure if it was the organicness or some sort of organic placebo effect but I did not feel nasty full. The burrito also tasted much fresher than the other two burrito chains mentioned. What really decided the four star rating though was the guac, I LOVE chunky guac and I was coming up with quarter sized pieces of avocado NOM.
