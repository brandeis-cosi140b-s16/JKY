Cinco de Mayo offers fresh, tasty, affordable Mexican food and good service, all in a location that is (literally) a two-minute drive from Great Wolf Lodge. My favorite is the Burrito Loco in the Vegetarian Entree section -- fresh zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, and onions in a large burrito with a creamy ranchero sauce. Yum! Dinner for my husband, son, and I came to $35 before tip and we were all full. We'll make this our dinner stop on every GWL weekend.
