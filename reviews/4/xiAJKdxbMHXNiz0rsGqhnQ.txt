I'll start by listing what I ate: Pork Fried Rice with Black Beans, Machaca and a Quesadilla with Jade Red Chicken.

I have to admit that it was the Guy Fieri DD&D feature that drew me to this place -- and I am glad that I went! The staff are friendly and invite you to sample their menu items, they provide recommendations and they help you come up with your order. I was skeptical about the encouragement that I try their black beans, but I was glad that I did. I normally do not like black beans, but whatever they do to them here makes them pretty good.

I was also skeptical about the "fusion" element to their menu -- but needlessly so. The Jade Red Chicken works well in a quesadilla, and (probably most surprising for me), the Pork Fried Rice went well with the black beans AND the machaca.

This is definitely a casual dining experience, and the culinary category here is definitely comfort food. You'll walk away with either leftovers for later consumption or a very full stomach -- for me, it was the latter :)
