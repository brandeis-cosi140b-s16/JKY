I miss Rosita's.  I've not lived in Arizona in a few years, so perhaps it's gone downhill.  However, their chips and salsa were always fantastic.  I could get full just from that.  And their chimichangas were to die for.  I always went during lunch, as it was just up the road from work.  It was cheap, quick, good service, and tasty for the price.
