We had the chicken burrito chimi style. Wasn't bad...the steak was obviously roasted and was in chunks, not shredded. The beans and rice were good...the rice wasn't dry like most places. Was disappointed our takeout did not include any salsa. Don't most Mexican joints give you salsa when you take out? Guess you have to order it. Wi try it again but will order something different.
