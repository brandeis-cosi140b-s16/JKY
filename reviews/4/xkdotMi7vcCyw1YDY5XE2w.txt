Cool place to hang out at the mall. We will definitely be back to watch games and hang at the bar. The garage theme is cool, and it'll be great to hang out on the patio in the spring.  The shrimp tacos and carne asada tacos were excellent. portions are big, not those little sample size tacos. Try it out if you are at the mall or looking for a good place to day drink or go for happy hour!
