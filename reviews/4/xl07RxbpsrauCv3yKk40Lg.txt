This taco place is good, but I don't understand the massive hype. Sure, it's fun to watch a guy carve pork off a spit directly onto your taco al pastor. Sure, it's fun to watch a guy chop beef and scoop it onto your carne asada taco. However, that doesn't warrant a five star rating.

Let me be clear, the tacos are delicious. Probably the best tacos in Vegas. Is it the best priced Mexican fast food in Vegas? Not even close. Just because something is $2 doesn't mean it's a good deal. I'd have to buy 5-6 tacos here to become full, whereas one burrito at Roberto's or Fausto's will fill me up at half the price. I rate as much with my wallet as I do with my taste buds. If your restaurant looks like a hole in the wall and has a hole in the wall service system, then I'd better get hole in the wall pricing too.
