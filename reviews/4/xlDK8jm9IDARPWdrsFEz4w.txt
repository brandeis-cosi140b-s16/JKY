For those of you who don't "habla Espanol", Mi Patio is Spanish for.. My Patio.

We have already heard from umpteen people that there is no patio. That is the point! Get it?! it's a metaphor. The whole restaurant is the patio! amazing.

The quesapilla. It is a sopapilla...giant one...full of cheese...oh fluffy greasy goodness. 

Now...this place would have to be pretty bad to suck when they offer margaritas for a mere 4 George Washingtons: one paper and three terminator washingtons (quarters) For those of you who don't habla gibberish that is $1.75. ($9 a pitcher(a big pitcher))

Eat. Drink. Be whatever the hell you want to be.
