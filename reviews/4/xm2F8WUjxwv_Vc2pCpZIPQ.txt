After a 12 hour drive, we got into town around 7pm on a Saturday night and checked into our hotel.  We were tired and needed a shower, but we were also starving and in need of cold refreshments.  We headed into Old Town and went by at least 10 places that had long waits, had nobody seated (which is always a bad sign on a Saturday night), or looked like they were a little more upscale than sweaty t-shirt and shorts attire.  By now it was around 8 o'clock and we decided to take a chance on Loco.  They were slammed, too, but we found a booth in the corner and took a seat.  Let me be the first to tell you that we were not expecting much - chain restaurant, young crowd which usually means the beer is cheap and the food is edible "enough" (hey, I was a college kid not too long ago and things haven't changed), and terrible service if you're not a local or someone they know.

We. were. totally. surprised.  And, in a good way.  Our server, Emilee, greeted us quickly and took our drink order and one of the other servers brought us chips and salsa.  Emilee came back a short while later and told us that our beers would be coming and she took our order - their "award winning" pork tacos with refried beans and a side salad, and two different enchiladas with the same sides.  Our beers arrived soon as did our salads.

The good-sized salads were extremely fresh with lots of different veggies.  Wow, we thought as we wolfed them down.  The rest of the meal was served right when we were finishing the salads and I have to say that everything was good.  Including the beans, which is usually the worst part of the meal at most Mexican restaurants.

Good food, good service despite the crowd, quick kitchen.  We left sated and with smiles on our faces.  Pretty damn impressed, too.
