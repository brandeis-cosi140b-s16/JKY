The Sandbar is a place to pick up or to be picked up; I went there for a goodbye party for a coworker. We had 6 in our booth, all ordering different drinks and food. The appetizers are pretty good, the nachos are a little better than most, the fried clams are very good (tender not chewy) and there is a great Thai chili dipping sauce.

 They have a heavy pour on their drinks which is great when you're drinking Knob Creek, however they need a little work on their mix drinks the Mojitos were just bad. 

We went 01/25/13 and Kyle was our server. He was very nice at the end of the night to help sort out everyone bill. This rating should be a 3.5 but I round up.
