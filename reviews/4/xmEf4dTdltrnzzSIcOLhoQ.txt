The nachos are amazing. And just generally the food is very good. The staff can be a bit less than friendly and that's really the only thing that keeps me from going there more often. I suppose I've been there 5 times and not once had wait staff that was genuinely friendly or had any sort of humor/personality. Odd considering the groovy style of the place.
