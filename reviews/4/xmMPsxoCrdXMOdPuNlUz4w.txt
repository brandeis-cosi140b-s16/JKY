Finally!  Cinco!  

It really is open!  A few months ago the sign went up.  A few weeks ago the sign was covered.  At that point, thought it was another restaurant that would never open. Yesterday the sign was uncovered.  Yesterday it opened.

Stopped in for a late lunch.   The place was nearly empty.  

Lot's of tables.  Wonder if the kitchen will be able to keep up with all of these tables?

A Mexican restaurant with some very traditional meals.  The menu has Especiales Monterrey (Tex Mex) meals; burritos, tacos, chimichanga.

The Sopa Azteca is a popular traditional soup that has tortilla strips, avocado slices, green pepper, cheese and some sour cream.  Very enjoyable.  Have notice this style of soup with some variations at a few other restaurants lately.
The Chilaquiles con asada is probably traditionally a breakfast item but also great for lunch.  It has crispy tortillas covered with a green salsa, onions, and some cheese. The green salsa was very good and full of flavor.  The steak was thin but juicy and flavorful with some hints of pepper.  

Our waiter was great.  He stopped by many times.  He let us know that the liquor license should be available in a few days.  
He gave us some chips and two salsas.  The queso, which was almost addicting, and an avocado, which was not as spicy as most other restaurants but very good and in a more traditional Mexican style. 

A nice additional to the neighborhood.
