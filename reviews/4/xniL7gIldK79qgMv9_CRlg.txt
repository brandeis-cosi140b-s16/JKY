The salsa they bring to your table is fresh with a little bit of heat.  We had the nachos appetizer and was in luck, they had a special so we snazzed it up with chicken and guacamole and sour cream.  The chips were not too thin nor too thick and had a great hearty corn taste and crunch!  It was quite tasty and they were good servers.  I'd come back and try another taste ...might be soon, I'm getting a hankering.
