My new office happens to be within a stone's throw of some of the best little Mexican joints in town. Due to this, I have gained about 4 pounds in the last two months and have eaten an obscene number of breakfast burritos. I like my chorizo burros, but my office mates prefer more Americanized ingredients like bacon and ham - which is why we generally wind up ordering from Dora's - something for everyone!

Due to its proximity, speed and reasonable prices, we have recently started ordering lunch from Dora's. The tacos and lunch burritos are some of the best in the area, and my co-worker swears they have the best green chile around - which the owner told me they make fresh in house, and you can buy in a large side to go. Since I have been overindulging in Mexican food of late I decided to try the chicken gyro for lunch on my last visit. They were out of chicken so I went ahead and ordered the lamb, against my better judgment. The gyro was well made, on a super fresh pita, but the lamb just wasn't my thing. They also offer a Greek Salad for $5.95... so as I prepare for a couple upcoming weddings that may be my next order. 

The 'restaurant' is in the back of a market called "Minute Liquor" so you can pick up pretty much any sort of beverage you'd like to go with your meal. Cervesa anyone? It may seem a little strange to find a dining establishment located in the back of a liquor store, but the neighborhood is rife with these little combo shops and the kitchen is clean and the food is good and economical, so I can navigate the aisles of beer and chips in the mini-market to the back of the tiny shop for my lunch.
