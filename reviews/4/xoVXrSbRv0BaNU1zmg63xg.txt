Great little Mom and Pop with Mom running the front and Pop doing the cooking. I've had the Tacos and Red Asada Enchiladas (not on the menu but they accommodated my request for Asada as my meat). My daughter had the Red Chicken Enchiladas. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Everything, including the tortillas, is homemade and you can tell. 

The interior is very basic, order at the counter and sit at a formica table but, for fresh authentic inexpensive Mexican this is a great place!
