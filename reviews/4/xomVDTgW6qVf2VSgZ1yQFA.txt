Loved this place. The atmosphere is great, and the food was better. My service wasn't too great, but the food made up for it. Their salsa tastes fresh and spicy, their rice and beans were hot and to die for, and my quesadilla was possibly the best I've ever had. If their service was better I'd rate it higher.
