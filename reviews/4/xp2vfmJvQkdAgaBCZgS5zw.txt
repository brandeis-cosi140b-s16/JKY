La Poblanita is a great little Mexican place in the Plaza Fiesta food court.  I went there for lunch recently and had an awesome plate of chicken enchiladas.  They were covered in salsa verde, cheese and slices of avocado.  The tacos also looked delicious and they serve horchata!!  Prices are cheap.

Look for it behind the playland area in the food court.
