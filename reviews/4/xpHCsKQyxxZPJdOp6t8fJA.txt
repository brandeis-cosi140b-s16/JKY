restaurant portion is tucked back beyond the store.  Seating is a lot more ample than I read elsewhere in a review.  Soda you do get from the cooler and may not be ice cold.  We waited to order from a waitress, and waited a short time. The wait for the bill was horrid! I don't think I have waited this long ever. I went up to pay versus take more from my day, they seemed startled that we were ready to go.

The wait for food was not terrible long.  Food was good, but greasy; if that's what you like, then go for it. Cheese enchiladas were not filled too much, so lots of extra tortilla.  Place filled up with other diners around 2pm, I could tell they had been there before.  Not many options on the menu, but sometimes that is better!
