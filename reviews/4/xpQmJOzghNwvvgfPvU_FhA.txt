Didn't know this food court on Charleston across from the junior college campus existed until someone told me about it. I work less than a block way and have driven past this place over the past many years. My original plan was to try Kaba Curry, but when I arrived at 11 am, they were still closed. Walked a few paces and found Tacos El Jefe. Ordered up their #1 Daily Special: 1 can of soda and a  huge Chile Verde burrito that had to weigh close to 2.5 lbs. While not the tastiest chile verde I have had, it is the tenderest and at $4.99 it is certainly a bargain.
