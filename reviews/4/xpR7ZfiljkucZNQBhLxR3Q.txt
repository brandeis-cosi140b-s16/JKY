Very good tacos with fresh tagging ingredients. Got the chicken burrito, with their salsa and guacamole, everything felt freshly sliced and authentic if you will. Wasn't a huge meal, small bag of plain corn chips and about a quarter pound burrito, but decent for 7 bucks, and another place that you get a deal with the coupon book when you check in.
