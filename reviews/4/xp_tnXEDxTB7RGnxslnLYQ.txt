It's Mexican fast food -- but it's really good Mexican fast food. My wife and I split a fish taco plate and an order of Carne Asada fries. They were a bit too generous with the tartar sauce on the tacos but I suspect most people would prefer it that way. Carne Asada was great.

The restaurant just opened at the northwest corner of Baseline and 35th Ave. It's a clean and inviting place. The workers seemed friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

UPDATE: Returned for Taco Tuesday (3/8/11). Burrito for $2 was huge -- and flavorful -- taco truck quality (a positive thing from my perspective as one who grew up in California eating Mexican food sold from trucks -- the best stuff!). The after-burn on my tongue from the green-pepper burrito lasted 45 minutes. Chicken taco was bigger than street size and tasted great.
