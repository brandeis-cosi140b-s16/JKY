The food was tasty and fresh.  Chips were wam and crispy and salsa was good.  While it was not the greatest Mexican north of the border, it was way above average.  What knocked it out of the park was the service.  Explained to the waiter we were in a hurry for a family reason and we got food right away with check right after it.  Assured us we did not have to rush but had everything ready so we could.  We will bring the kids and return  Good food and great staff.
