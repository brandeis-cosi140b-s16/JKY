I am still a fan of this place even if it seems to have gotten a little stale. Nothing ever changes here, including the daily specials. It would be nice to see some new menu items.  Salsa and chips are always good and HOT. We love the chorizo dip. Adovada ribs aren't the best, they really should try to get better meat.  The marq's are tasty but a little overpriced. All that said it is a favorite of guests from out of town due to its charm and hot food.
