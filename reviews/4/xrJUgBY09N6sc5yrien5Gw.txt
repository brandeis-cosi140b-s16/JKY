Great restaurant! We just moved to the area and this was our 1st experience at a local resturant. The dishes are not authentic mexican but dont let that stop you. Portions were huge and lots of flavor. Homemade quac was a huge hit at our table. The server was extremely helpful and recommended his favorite dishes. Margaritas were so Gooooood we each had 3. Can't wait to go back!
