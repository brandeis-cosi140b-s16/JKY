We did the 2 for $25 (I think it's $25) and the food is really good. There was so much food in the beginning that I couldn't even eat my dinner because I was so full. First there is salsa and bean dip and part of the 2 for deal is an appetizer and my husband chose this sampler which was a dinner itself. The only thing that wasn't that good was the churros for dessert. They were kinda stale and they covered it with chocolate and whipped cream. It sounds good but it didn't taste good.

The employee's are nice and as always it is not a busy restaurant.
