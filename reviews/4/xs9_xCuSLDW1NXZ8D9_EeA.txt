it's the best mexican i've had in the area.  mad mex can't touch this place when it comes to the food...unfortunately, there is no liquor served here.  even beer would be nice.....thing is....the place has the best tacos around.  the rice has the spice it should at a mexican joint.  they do serve a complimentary chips and salsa basket.  they will not refill FOC on those chips though...

bottom line- if you want the real deal cooked fresh to order, come here.  please note- the decor is nothing to write home about....
