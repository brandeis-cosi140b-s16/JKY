I went to this restaurant last week for a team meeting and we ended up getting the buffet as they have a Mexican buffet every weekday from 11:30 - 1:30. It ended up costing $7.95 and that is with water to drink. If you want soda then it is additional.
However, the buffet is very good and the Burritos, Chimichangas, Tacos, Enchiladas and even the "Pollo Magnifico" which is like a polllo fundido just drips with cheese. If you love cheese on your food this IS the place for you, they NEVER skimp on cheese or any of the salsas or meat in the other enchiladas. This time they did have shreaded meat for burritos which you could get pico, salsa, sour cream, lettuce mix that goes with it. The plates are paper plates and the knives and forks are right there by the plates and napkins. You DO get free chips and salsa (only if you eat in). They kind of police the chip and salsa bar if you try to take the chips and salsa to go after your meal. However, they DO keep the buffet well stocked and replenish the food almost immediately when they are empty. The service is very friendly and the food is great. I have no complaints and have been back regularly.
Give it a try, youll be glad you did.
