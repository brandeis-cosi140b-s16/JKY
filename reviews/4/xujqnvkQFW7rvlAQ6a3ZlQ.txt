I almost don't want to leave a review cause the place is already busy and it doesn't need carloads of Yelpsters from Summerlin but I think it deserves the praise! 

Best Mexican beef soup in town....$5.99

Best Agua Frescas (especially the Cantelope) $1.50

The service is always fast and efficient...especially if Jasmin is working the counter! 

And I can grab some groceries on my way out.....highly recommended
