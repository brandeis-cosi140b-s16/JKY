After reading several review's I decided to give it a try, I had a green chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans.  It was very good, I will definitely go back.  The portions are much bigger than I expected you really do get your money's worth.  The staff very friendly and helpful.  Small quaint little spot I would recommend you give it a try.
