I visited this particular Chipotle (chi-poht-ley) for lunch this past Saturday where there's always a line no matter what time during lunch you go.  It's not that they're slow; quite the contrary.  It's just that large numbers of people pass constantly through during their Saturday lunch, which seems to extend from about 11 am - 3 or 4 pm.  

The seating here is a bit odd.  It feels like you have to find a spot at the one, long single table in the high school cafeteria all over again.  Can you say, "Awkward?"  If you want some privacy while stuffing your face, take your meal outside where they actually have individual tables. 

The crew seemed to gel really well together.  They all looked (and sounded) like they were having fun at their job, but still very professional when assembling their customers' orders.  That's the kind of place you want to visit.  

The burritos themselves are your traditional burritos which are very similar to Qdoba, Moe's, Salsarita's, etc., etc., etc.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing that stands out from the rest.  The one thing that seems to set Chipotle apart from those others (at least for me) is that they're the only burrito chain that carries the chipotle-flavored Tabasco.  How apropos.
