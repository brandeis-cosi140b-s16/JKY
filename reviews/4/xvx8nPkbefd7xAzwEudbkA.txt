I haven't been there in sometime but this was my staple lunch go-to for many many months. It can get crowded and hectic during the lunch hour and when it's cold outside the end of the line will be by the door for sure.
This is the best fast food Mexican I've ever had. So much that when I moved to Chicago I went to the Salsarita's website to ask for one to come to Chicago. Not one here yet. This is so much better than Qdoba and Burrito Beach.
For starters you can eat somewhat healthy here. I used to order 3 hard tacos with shrimp, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, and onion (do this instead of the pico to avoid the added salt) and it was so good. If I had room to splurge in my diet I would add guacamole. When I was having a really crappy day I would get nachos loaded with everything and they would taste amazing.

I don't get to the Queen City much anymore, but when I fly through Charlotte I make sure to go to the one at Douglas airport. Tip: the one in the E concourse has hard shell tacos, the one in the main concourse does not!
