This place is amazing! They're guacamole is fresh and their queso Laredo is an amazing starter. I've tried their salmon with chimichurri sauce and jasmine rice which was delicious! I've also tried their chicken Tampico which was overly Charbroiled but the sour cream poblano sauce was tasty. Their beef is very flavorful and great in the fajita dish! But the brownie desert will melt in your mouth! Def an enjoyable date spot.
