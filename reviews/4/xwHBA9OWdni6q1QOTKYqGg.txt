A solid little taco shop located conveniently (for ASU students & staff) at the NE corner of ASU's Tempe campus. Easy to drive right by on University. Just look for the small strip center with Fed Ex in the front and a variety of ethnic food offerings in the back.

Fast service, great for carry out or dining in their small seating area. Chips and salsa available for those who dine in. Wish there were more choices at the salsa bar than just a red and a green sauce. Love their tacos. Went for a basic beef taco special on this day. Delicious. Not quite as strong on some other items like enchiladas, but solid enough.

Discounts for ASU students and daily specials make this a great option for the university crowd and others nearby. I'll be back.
