We rolled into this Taco Bell after 9pm for a little drive-thru after a long afternoon horseback riding. The employee was patient with us after we asked for a few minutes to decide on what we wanted. When we made our way to the window our order came soon after. And the taste of our food was just the same as it is back home.

All in all it was a successful quick dinner run with familiar food. They didn't include any utensils in the bags however, which was sad, I love the sporks.
