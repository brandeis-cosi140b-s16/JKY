This is our favorite local Mexican food restaurant.  The food is excellent and they also have a vegetarian section which is amazing for me.  I love their salsa bar.  They have a delicious variety but their chunky red salsa, sour cream salsa and green salsa cannot be missed!  Also, if you like local beers and a good variety of Mexican beers, this is a great place for happy hour.
