This is a GIANT restaurant! I had never been to this side of town but came here for a restaurant.com coupon. FYI- that coupon didn't work!!

All of the fried fish dishes we tried were very good. Price for 3 of us to eat (with 1 beer and 1 horchata) was about $45. We had a cerviche that was quite good too.

This is the kind of place you'd expect random people to walk in and sell you roses and candy bars. The service was attentive but there also weren't very many people in the restaurant on a Friday night at 6pm. I wish this place wasn't so far north away from the city center. I'd come here more often if it was.
