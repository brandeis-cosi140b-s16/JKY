Was waiting for my connecting flight to  Nashville and I needed something to eat so I went to this restaurant.  I ordered an iced tea, and the three battered fish tacos.  The taco had a jicama and a white dressing. They were pretty good, it was expensive but that's what I expect from an airport.  If I am at the airport again, and I need to have something to eat, I would definitely go to this restaurant again.
