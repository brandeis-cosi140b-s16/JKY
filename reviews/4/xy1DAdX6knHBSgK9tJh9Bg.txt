I was looking for something new to try and actually my boyfriend pick Blanco's where as I wanted seafood.  Well regardless, I'm so glad we went. The quacamole dip was amazing! Probably some of the best I have ever had.  After we demolished the dip and salsa we got out entrees. He ordered beef enchiladas and I got the shrimp and steak fajitas.  I wish that I didn't love he dip so much so that I could have enjoyed more of my awesome food!  It's a definite must try. Atmoshpere was great; food delish, and don't miss out on their margaritas!  I'll just take one of everything.
