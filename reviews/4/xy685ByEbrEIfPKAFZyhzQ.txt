Decent food and drinks here.  I am a fan of the guacamole, shrimp tacos and fajita salad.  Margaritas are decent enough.  Have yet to try a "yinzerita."  Atmosphere is also decent depending on what time you are there and what you are looking for.  Music selection always makes me laugh - it is quite an eclectic mix sometimes.  One night, there were 8 Frank Sinatra songs in a row that then transitioned into a few country tunes before sliding into pop music for the rest of the time I was there.  There is always something for everyone.  I haven't been for brunch, but I have heard that it is absolutely amazing - on my to do list to try it out myself!  Overall, a great place for a good meal or even just a drink.
