First off, I just have to say that the el hefe dog = heaven. This is not your typical bar food, it's actually good. I've had lunch and happy hour (dinner) several times at el hefe, had very good service and the food was excellent in quality/taste. Because of the times of day I have been there, I'm sure my experience is different than those who went at night when it's jammed, but so far I've had no reason to not go back just for the food & happy hour.
