Technically, the wife became a fan. And therefore, I am a fan. It was our first time visiting this place after Yelp's awesome Halloween party. Everyone were on their feet dancing! And though I usually don't until I'm tipsy, Maya grabbed me and we started dancing salsa. I don't even know if that's how you say it. Dance salsa?

Anyway, it was mui fun. (Is that right?) The crowd was feeling it. And I ended up promising that we will return with a set of buddies so we're looking forward to it.
