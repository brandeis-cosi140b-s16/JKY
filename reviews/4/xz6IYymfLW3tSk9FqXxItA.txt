Love the concept here.  It reminds me of Chipotle but dare I say, better??  They make their own tortillas which are super warm when you get them.  I ordered the taco salad and it was extremely good.  It lasts me 2 meals which is great if you are on a budget.  I have only tried their chicken and it is very tasty.  Def will be back to try their other meats!
