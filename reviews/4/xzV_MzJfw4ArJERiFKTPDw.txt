Visited May 2015:  "Mesa Hidden Gem"

I came in with my mother, for the first time, on Mother's day. The atmosphere was lively, but not too loud; the decor was very Southwestern where I felt I was in Sante Fe NM; the staff was polite and friendly. Our waitress provided us with a large bowl of chips and some salsa. There are no various of salsa, so unfortunately my hot chili craving was denied. The salsa she brought did have a great flavor blend. There was a margarita special going on , for mothers, and we partook. The margaritas were just the right combination of tart and fruity. We shared an appetizer, that came with more chips, and I got the lobster tamales main entree. I also had the creme brulee, which was one of the largest bowls I have very seen. The meal was filling, and I brought home at least half of mine, so did my mother. I would definitely come back with my immediate family.
