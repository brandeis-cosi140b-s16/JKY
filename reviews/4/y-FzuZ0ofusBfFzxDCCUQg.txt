I love this location !

My favorite is the macho burrito ( Huge ) and the french fries all for about $5 give or take plus tax.

Del Taco is right next door to the ghetto Circkle K so you can't miss it.  They have great specials from time to time such as .39 cent tacos.

If you live near one give them a try.
