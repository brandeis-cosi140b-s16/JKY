I've heard so much chatter about this place that we had to stop in. 

The menu is set up just like a Qdoba (for those who might be familiar). You choose if you're having a burrito or a bowl, choose your protein (or vegetarian) then your extras. 

I had a vegetarian burrito with brown lime rice, black beans, pico de gallo and guacamole. The flavors were fresh, the textures on point and the serving size was massive. We also sprung for the $1.25 chips & salso; however, they didn't give us the salsa. The chips were delightful, not greasy and perfectly salted with a lime-salt that made my tastebuds jump for joy. 

Was I blown away? No. Did it satisfy the rumble in my tummy? Yes'sir.
