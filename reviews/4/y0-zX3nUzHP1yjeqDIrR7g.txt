In town on vacation and wanted to get some good tacos. Being from St Louis we dont have the variety of mexican that is available in Vegas. We really liked the food at this location, carna asada tacos with guac and pice were VERY good and fish tacos a close second.You can get a good meal affordibly and they are open 24 hrs
