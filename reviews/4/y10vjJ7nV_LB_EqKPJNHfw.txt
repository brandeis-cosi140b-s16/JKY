Just returned to Richardson's after more than a decade -- really -- the place is just as good as ever. The food is OUTSTANDING. Spices are nicely balanced and there's heat where there should be, and everything is a joy to look at -- as well as eat.

Our waitperson was also GREAT. Very friendly, very laid back, and VERY helpful -- great job on describing the fish dishes, by the way.

We ate TOO much -- guac was great, stickers were tremendous. Chicken Chimayo was really something else. Asparagus, brussels sprouts, green chili potatoes. Chicken stuffed with spinach and asiago cheese -- fantastic!

I had Pasta Heidi -- tons of white meat chicken, nice heat to the pasta, nice creamy sauce. Tremendous!

Even the chicken quesadilla, presented simply on a wooden plate with two sauces, was a treat.

The prickly pear margaritas were also great -- and BIG.

The flan finished off the whole thing. Too much!

We'd be back there tonight if we didn't feel silly being in town for only two nights and eating at the same place both times...
