It would be a 5 star if my wife was fully on board. As a guy who likes dives, this one is great. S/M/L beers for any of about 12 beers on tap, plenty else to drink. Cheap as you could ask for. 

Has an iTunes (or similar) jukebox and some billiards. Crowd was interestingly mixed, which I love. This was on Friday evening.
