I ate here on a Tuesday night while on a last minute staycation (our power was out for 24 hours due to a monsoon storm).  The best part about this place is the ambiance.  Music and lighting was really chill, would be a great place to meet a friend for dinner and/or catching up over drinks and dessert.  I sat at the bar (dined alone), ordered a taco and half order of posole.  The service was perfect.  I even had the opportunity to charge the dinner to my room which was very convenient.  The taco was really tasty and I'd come back for that, but the posole was just ok for me.  It wasn't the best I've had in Phoenix.  The broth, hominy, side ingredients were good but the pork was kind of terrible. It was cubes of hard pork. I'd rather have no pork than weird cubed pork. I'm thinking maybe they throw that in last, like when you order pho?  Either way, I'll be back and maybe just pass on the posole and definitely get tacos and a beer.

Also, I ran into some friends who were having a beer at the bar.  Super fun to have a local hotel restaurant/bar that is awesome enough that the locals hang out there too.
