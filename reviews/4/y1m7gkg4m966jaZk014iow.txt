I have been here twice now and I am a fan! The service is on point and the food is yummy. My first time in I did the two cheese enchilada combo and a carnitas street taco. While the rice and beans had virtually no flavor, the enchiladas were tasty. The highlight was definitely the carnitas street taco. I had been thinking about that carnitas over the weekend, so I returned for lunch yesterday. I had the carnitas burrito which was really tasty! I am looking forward to giving the rest of the menu a try! :)
