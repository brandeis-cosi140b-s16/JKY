I use to go to Cafe Rio when I lived in Utah and it was a favorite. So needless to say I was real excited when I found out one opened 6 blocks from my house! My favorite is the enchilada plate with sweet pork and medium sauce. I don't like rice and beans but they will give you lettuce, pico, and sour cream in place of that. Make sure to get a stamp card at the end to earn a free meal! 
The main reason I didn't go 5 stars is because sometimes the staff get a little sassy when they don't need to be and won't listen to what you're trying to tell them before interrupting you. Food rocks though :)
