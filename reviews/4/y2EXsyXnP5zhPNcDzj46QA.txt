Way out west, we're saturated with hit-or-miss little Mexican spots. Paquime is definitely a hit, specializing in sandwiches and desserts. 

So many kinds of desserts. 

First, I'd tried the chocolate chip ice cream. The consistency and richness of it lets you immediately know it's the real deal, and will be totally satisfying. I also tried the nuez or "nut" ice cream...I think it was pecan? I'm not sure. Could not be any more vague...it tasted to me like pancake syrup ice cream, which I didn't like, but my breakfast-loving dining companion fell in love with. 

After a few minutes, my quesadilla was ready (ha! I didn't even get a torta!). Instead of having precooked steak like a lot of the competition, it looked and tasted like it was made fresh to order. It was complete with tomato and avocado slices. I must admit it was a little skimpy--I ended up tasting everything *but* the cheese every other bite...but it was still tasting great, even if a bit on the small side. 

I'll update you when I actually try the main attraction here, a torta with fries. But until then just know that you're getting some good quality stuff for the price, and that even if you're just feeling pastries or ice cream, Paquime is still worth dropping by.
