We stop here every vegas trip for nachos.  8 of us were promptly seated, got our nachos ordered & decided on a few other options also.  The wings & calamari.
Nachos were great, wings were great as were the cocktails but I didn't care for the calamari at all.  The batter was different than I'm used to & had an off taste.
This is my first yelp for Diablos but I've been numerous times & will continue to do so.  We have had 3 star visits & 5 star visits. A great spot on the strip.
