Very cool restaurant concept.  Service was great and the decor was awesome!  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the fact that the noodles had way too much sauce.  The Mexican chiliquilas we had were FANTASTIC!  I would for sure go back for the Mexican food again, but not sure I would it the Chinese.
