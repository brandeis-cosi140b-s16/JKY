I usually come here on Wednesday morning. This is when I am at work by 5:00 am. Holds me over until a reasonable lunch time. Actually sometimes it holds me over until dinner. I always order a chili verde and egg burrito. Not on their menu, always willing to make it for me. Love this breakfast burrito, use to visit my grandmother here in Phoenix when I was a child and she would make this for me all the time. Now this burrito is huge, and very filling. Plenty of pork in the chili. I might not get there every week, but it will be a lot.
