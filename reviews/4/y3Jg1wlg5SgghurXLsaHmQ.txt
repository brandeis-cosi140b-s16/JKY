As a big fan of authentic Mexican food, I was surprised that I haven't been to any in the 'Burgh. Yelp recommended Los Cabos and we set out on a Friday evening to get dinner before drinks. 

You have to order at the counter and they will come serve you where you are seated. The staff were very warm and extremely polite. I was very happy to see they have tamales as an option. We ordered the guacamole and chips. The guacamole was fresh, with a fine blend of tomatoes and shredded cheese on it. It was a big portion and tasted reasonable, but definitely not one of those -will die for it- guac. We ordered the combination meals and I got the enchilada and chille releno. The enchilada was perfect, and the sauce was fresh and flavorful. The chille releno was good too! We also got the tamale and oh man, it was great! Having become a recent fan of tamales, I was so happy to find good tamales in Pittsburgh.

Will definitely come back here to get dinner/take out again.
