Popped in for a great lunch at 9 bucks. The chips were hot and thin and served with a mild and a hot salsa. The pollo fundido was epic with the roasted white meat chicken bursting out of the small lunch sized fried burrito. The jalapeno cream cheese was layered on top, but tasted more like sour cream and then some melted cheese was on top of that action. The rice and beans were solid and they also give you a pitcher of water all to yourself. Cute waitress made this an excellent lunch choice and no crowds about 1:30pm.
