YES!!!!!!
FINALLY I have found a great, no frills delicious Mexican Seafood place in LV!!~
SO HAPPPPY!!!

After scouring Yelp reviews, we decided to go with some friends to try Mariscos out. So glad we did!!! IT is a bit of a dive, in the best possible way. And the food was fantastic!

We started with fresh guacamole for the table, so good! Great flavor, definitely fresh! I had the Shrimp and Octopus cocktail. Tons of flavor, super fresh and decent size shrimp, not those tiny annoying little shrimp. (right? no one likes those little shrimps!)

Everyone else at the table loved their food and said they would definitely go back! The comments were about great flavor, and they loved the rice too!! 

The service was awesome!  The ONLY downfall was the music, that started 1/2 way into our meal was SO LOUD. I know, I feel like such a gringo! I know this is part of the culture, but to see a little kid at another table pressing his hands over his ears makes me think I am not the ONLY one who found this a bit excessive in volume. But that is my ONLY tiny complaint. Not bad right??

Can't wait to go back!!!
