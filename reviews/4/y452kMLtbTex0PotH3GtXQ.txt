The family and I had our first visit to PB this evening. We enjoyed quick seating and friendly service. The decor is bright and colorful, the food was fantastic, authentic Mexican and the beer was ice cold. Yum!

I'm a native Phoenician and a salsa snob! Minus one star in my rating because the salsa was a bit on the bland side this evening. The mild sauce was flavorless, watery tomato sauce. The 'spicy' version of their salsa sported a few more chunks of onion and green chilli, and overall had a better flavor. Chips were thicker than I like them, but that didn't slow me down from shoving them in my mouth! Refills were prompt.

I'm definitely going back to PB in the near future!
