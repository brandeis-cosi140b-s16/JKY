I was wrapping up a road trip and staying at a hotel, so what'd I do? I Yelp'ed for Mexican takeout. When I read some of the other reviews, I decided to drive by a couple chains and find the hole-in-the wall that promised to hit the spot. 

The menu was in Spanish and had just a few choices. I was the only white girl in there. And I basically just pointed to what I wanted, got a nod and a smile and BAM - the food was packed and ready to go. 

And it was GOOD. Not just, it'll do after a long day in the car, but "maybe I'll head back to Madison one day" good. If you're passing through or want more authentic Mexican than you're used to, keep your eyes pealed and pull in, point and smile.
