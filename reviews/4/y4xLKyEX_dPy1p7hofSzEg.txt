The Mexican fusion dishes are exceptionally delicious. The pricing is moderate, we had a large party for dinner and we tried various dishes. The Plato Mixto was a great choice for some of us. Ahi ceviche dish was served in a martini glass and garnished with chips. Brand new restaurant and bar, Bar is open til 3am.
