The fajitas were awesome and the tortillas were fresh from the tortilla-machine which was kinda fascinating. Delicious corn cakes. The fish tacos however were shitty, the fish was fishy, dry and not enough of it, Maciek had a dry tortilla, which is weird since they were all fresh and everything. All in all it was pretty good and the service was great, they stayed open way past closing time for us.
