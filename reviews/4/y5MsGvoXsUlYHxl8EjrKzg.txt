I love the sopes (Friday special), and everything I've had I have enjoyed. It's a modest Mexican food shop- what you see is what you get, and that works for me. (I love the neighborhood family businesses and this one is another example of giving something a chance and finding a new favorite.) Yes, it's a humble store front, no it's not fancy- but I couldn't care less about that! It's clean, the food is good and the staff is nice and friendly.
