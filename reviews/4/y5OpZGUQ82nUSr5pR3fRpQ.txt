Tried Chronic Tacos for dinner tonight with the Groupon I've had for a bit.  Went with my girlfriend, and we split baja fish taco and a chicken burrito with a drink and chips.  Entire order was under our $12 Groupon, so decent value.  Food was just OK.  Actually, the chicken burrito was pretty tasty once I put Tapatio on it.  But the baja fish taco was a bit underwhelming.  Bonus points for having Coke Zero, though.  I hate when places only have Diet Coke.
