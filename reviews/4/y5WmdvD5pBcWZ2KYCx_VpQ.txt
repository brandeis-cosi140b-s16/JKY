I like coming to Roberto's. They by far have the best carne asada nachos! Plus I like the fact that when I order it with no beans with the sour cream and guacamole on the side at the drive thru, they don't give me a hard time. I also like coming here on Wednesday's for their $0.99 chicken tacos!!! Can't go wrong with those especially if your on a budget! Lol... The green salsa is awesome!!! Really good place when your craving Mexican food late at night. Also a great location! 4 stars!!!
