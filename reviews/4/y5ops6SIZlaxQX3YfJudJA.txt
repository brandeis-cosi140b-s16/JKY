Read the reviews and thought to give it a try...

Pros: This little restaurant captures the Mexico vibe and puts it on Thomas Rd.  And we know, as they say a "whole in the wall" restaurant can turn out to be the best! The carne asada was made fresh to order, the beans were amazing and the salsa is authentic and "home made" fresh daily. Fernando and Ben are great hosts! Definitely will be back to try another dish! 

Cons: they could work on their Spanish Rice...a true Mexican staple food. Get that right and my son will be  regular patron.
