Based upon Taric's recommendation, I visited Polibertos when I was in the neighborhood last week.

It did not disappoint.

I arrived around 3pm, after one of those days where you get nothing to eat because you've been so busy. 

 I found  Polibertos to be  very clean, staffed with friendly employees, and  about 8 customers inside eating, decent clientele, eclectic mix.

I admit to having difficulty choosing what to order.   I was intrigued by the carne fries description, but this was obviously a pile o'food, and I decided that would be best ordered on another visit, when my children can help.

I ordered a combo #1- cheese enchilada, bean tostada, shredded beef taco..  The meal was ready fast.  The food was really good, overall.  Taco generously stuffed with shredded beef, loaded with very fresh shredded lettuce and cheese.  The beans in the tostada were tasty  I found the red sauce on the enchilada kinda weird, not bad as in spoiled but oddly flavored- more of a matter of taste, but i will not order something in red sauce on my next visit..   

Definitely give Polibertos a shot~ I know I'll be back!
