Great place in Madison right off Park. The food is cheap and the service is fast. I've never had any problems with it. It's also a great 3am treat for all you bar crawlers and night owls. Did I mention its CHEAP? Like I've ate their for less than $6 ordering ala carte with my friends and the quality/size of the meals were nothing to scoff at. Amazing! Outdoor seating even makes it more fantastic.
