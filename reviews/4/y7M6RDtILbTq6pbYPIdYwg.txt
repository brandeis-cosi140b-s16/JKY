This is my family's go-to spot for mexican food. We consistently receive top-notch service and great quality food.  I love their homemade chips and salsa, especially the flour chips! The green corn tamales are fantastic, and most portions are big enough to share. Yes, it is pricey, but not exorbitant for the area. 

We always sit in the bar area to take advantage of the happy hour specials. We typically avoid the main dining room, because the bar area includes plenty of seating options: booths, low-tables, and high-tables. There's also an extensive outdoor patio.

Happy hour runs M-F from 3:30-6:30. Half off all appetizers and few dollars off margaritas. Check the chalkboard in the bar for all the specials. I typically just go with a Cuervo or Don Julio margarita, but they also have some usual picks such as a prickly pear margarita and a mojito-rita!

They offer a lunch menu (even during weekends), which includes a two item combo for $8 and three item for $11. Also look out for game day specials on Sundays during football season. Overall, a great neighborhood restaurant and happy hour spot!
