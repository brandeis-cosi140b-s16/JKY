I thought they had closed for good! I didn't realize that they moved! What a relief! This is one of my favorite Mexican Restaurants in the Valley and was really disappointed when they disappeared from the Gilbert and Guadalupe location they had been in for over 10 years! I usually skip the refried beans at most Mexican food restaurants because they bore me, but Gecko Grill's beans have a special smokey flavor and are lighter, almost fluffy. Their Fiesta Chicken is the best marinated and grilled chicken anywhere and I absolutely LOVE their Crab Relleno with their crabby sauce which is the most amazing sauce I've had on Mexican food. My wife loves their Pollo Grande (Pollo Fundido) and I love their seafood version, it's slightly sweet because all their seafood is cooked with fruity salsas which go perfectly with shrimp and fish.

I am utterly ecstatic that they are back in business and will be making a trip there soon!

UPDATE: I just ate lunch at this new location and am happy to report that my favorite menu items are still on the menu, along with some new things to try. The recipes seem to be the same, but you can tell they are being made by different cooks. Everything was still good though. They are still getting their feet wet with this new restaurant, but they were extremely busy and there was a wait for lunch at 12:30 on a Thursday! I'm glad they are getting the business. However, they ran out of high-chairs when we got there and so the nephew we were baby-sitting had to sit on our laps until one became available. Also, the food seemed to take awhile to come out, but it was worth the wait. I'm sure they'll get into their groove soon, but until then I had to reduce my review to 4 stars.
