Being in town for punk rock bowling and not having a lot of places to eat due to diet restrictions, I was super excited to find this place. If you are looking for a quiet place to play, this is not for you. The DJ is blasting remixes of 80s song the entire night. The service is absolutely abysmal, but the food is decent. Definitely worth a try if you aren't in a  hurry.
