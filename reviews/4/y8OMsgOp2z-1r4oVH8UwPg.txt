It's good food (what the rest of my party had) and great service, but my entree fell short. It wasn't bad just unremarkable. I mark a good Mexican restaurant by how well they make their chile rellenos - this one had the seeds still in it. Which shows lack of attention to details in prep and just ruins the chile. It was flavorless and I pushed it aside. Super attentive servers.  Fast refills. Really good prices for food and drinks, including Margaritas.
