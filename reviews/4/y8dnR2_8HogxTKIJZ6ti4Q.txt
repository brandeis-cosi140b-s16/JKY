Great food. We moved here from Chicago and have tried variations of Mexican food from the hole in the wall to high-end cuisine. This shop is exactly what I've been craving since leaving my Chicago taco joints.  Their tortas are amazing. Tacos are flavorful and they don't skimp on the amount of meat. 
There was a mix up with my order but they were very accommodating and with food as good as theirs, I quickly brushed it away!  Great food-Excellent service
