Hello good food! Really this place has some great food! I was soo happy to eat here on my visit to Phoenix. Lets thanks my friend for taking me here and then lets thank the chef for the great tasting food. I had a NY Strip Steak with crab meat on it. The sauce had heat but not too much to burn your mouth. Which was excellent. I've always said that food needs to tell a story and this dish had a subtle beginning and an amazing end. The service was friendly and fast. The decor well it looks like a hideaway so that's actually kinda cute! The prices seemed reasonable for the food and the flavor. I'd go again!
