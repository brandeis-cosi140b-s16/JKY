La Fonda is your basic Mexican food restaurant. Nothing fancy, but also not a dive. I like the food very much. Again, nothing fancy, but quite flavorful--and the portions are generous. I've eaten at La Fonda for many years, mostly when it was in south Scottsdale (or was that north Tempe?) on Rural. Now it is only a half mile from my house, so I go more frequently. Service is quick and pretty friendly, though I tend to eat out at slightly off times in order to avoid waiting. If you live in Glendale or Arrowhead, there is no need to make the long trip to try the food. But if you are anywhere near Baseline & McClintock in Tempe, you should try the restaurant at least once.
