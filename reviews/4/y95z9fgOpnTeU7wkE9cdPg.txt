The people here in the morning are great. Very friendly and helpful.  The building is really old and the parking lot is very small. Those were my only complaints.  The food was made correctly and hot.  The manager in the morning is very nice. They were actually getting a safety audit during my visit and scored a 98.5.  So the food was safe as well.
