Service was a little awkward today, but the food is always delicious. I had the enchiladas with beef and my friend had the chicken flautas.  The portions are SUPER generous.  We both ate half our plates and were REALLY full, the kind of full that almost hurts.  The horchata is rich and delicious.  I recommend having it as dessert rather than a beverage.  I don't particularly like the sweet flavor while I eat savory food.
