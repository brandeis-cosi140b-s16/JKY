I'm from ABQ, NM so when someone puts NM on their signage I review seriously. I've eaten here about 5 times, breakfast and lunch. I had the chicken enchiladas with green chile good, then I had huevos with xmas good for Arizona, then one day I tried the shredded beef enchiladas with red and it all came together. 

The shredded beef is so tender and flavorful! The corn tortillas are thicker than I am used to but good, the red chile is truly awesome and I know red chile. This is NM red, it's not my Dad's red which is the ultimate but to find in AZ, in Gilbert? Awesome. Just the right amount of quality cheese too. I cleaned my plate. I never clean my plate I always leave something out of respect for my waistline. Not this time.

They have chips and salsas available via self serve, salsas are good with some bite but very salty.

Both my boys ordered bean and cheese burritos, they were huge and they were devoured. 

We drank water as they only have Pepsi, iced tea & coffee. For my enchiladas & two burritos it was $14 something.

The place is small and you order up front and then find a table, they have maybe 10 (4 & 2 tops), self serve drinks and aforementioned salsas. They will bring your food to your table amazingly fast. Sometimes you also get complimentary cinnamon chips that are great but only when they aren't too busy apparently as I've gotten them twice even after asking to pay for them.

The service and the people/owner are so incredibly welcoming and friendly you feel good spending your money there!

I left off the 5th star because I like my chile hotter/spicier (I know most don't and he wants to make it a successful business), with fresh chopped white onions not green onions and with a cold beer and a lime.
