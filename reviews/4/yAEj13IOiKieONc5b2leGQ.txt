We've only been to the Lunch Box for breakfast but our experiences have all been good. I like their menudo and Jenny gets any of their breakfast items. For that, it's pretty much a can't-go-wrong affair. The staff is nice and (great on a weekend when everywhere else seems to have a 45 min wait) we've yet to encounter a wait to get a table.
