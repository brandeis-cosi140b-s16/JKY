If you read my reviews you can probably tell I drive back and forth from Phoenix to Tucson.  This Rubio's is another great convenience for me.  I stop here all the time and the service is great.  I once ordered a burrito especial and the accidentally gave me the wrong burrito.  The manager took care of it immediately and also comped my lunch.  I didn't think that was necessary since it was an honest mistake but I was very impressed nonetheless.  I always appreciate good service and full lemonade containers when it's hot outside!
