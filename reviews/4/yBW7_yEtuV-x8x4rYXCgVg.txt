I have been here at least 6 times and not only has the food been good, but they have been consistent.  I always get a shredded beef taco, ground beef taco, and a chicken taco-all are pretty tasty.  Yeah, they can be a little greasy, but not any more so than some of the other places in the area.  Prices are incredibly reasonable.  I prefer this place over Filiberto's.
