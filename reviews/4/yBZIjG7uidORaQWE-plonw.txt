Had to bring this down to four stars. Went back for the third time yesterday and ... The food has only gotten better and the service has only gotten worse. It took our drinks 25 min to get to us!!! We ordered our drinks about 10 min before our food, and actually got our food before our drinks!? We ordered another drink as soon as our first arrived for fears of never getting another one. Our waters were empty non stop (this is how it always is here), and the waiter asked if we needed anything else three times... Each time we said yes the bill. I will still continue to come here because I know they are going to quick and the food is so amazing, but come on... Nearly half an hour for a pre made frozen margarita???
