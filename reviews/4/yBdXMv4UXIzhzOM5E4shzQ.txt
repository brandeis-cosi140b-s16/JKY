We wanted to skip a day of doing touristy things around Phoenix so went out to explore the desert. A group of 9 of us -- all typically a country club crowd, but not opposed to trying things off the beaten path -- descended on Humberto's for lunch. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and authentic, and came out relatively quickly. The man working the counter was very nice and even came out to wipe down one of our tables for us because it was a little sticky. The only reason I knocked a star off was the texture on my uncle's cabeza burrito (beef cheeks) was a little rubbery -- not as tender as he would have liked -- and the bathrooms leave a little to be desired. Still, don't be scared of this place if you're passing through Gila Bend. Treat yourself to some delicious, authentic Mexican food.
