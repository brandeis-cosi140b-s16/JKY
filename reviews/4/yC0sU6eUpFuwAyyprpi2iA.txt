The first time I tried Braddah's I was not sure if I really liked it or not.  So I went back once.  Twice.  Three times.  Before I knew it I was a semi-regular.  Now I am a true fan through and through.  I like coming here for a good burrito.  Its a nice alternative to the over crowded Chipotle restaurants and has a different take on the whole burrito thing.  A burrito with Hawaiian flavors.  I'll take it.  

My usual order is a burrito with huli huli chicken, seaweed rice, black beans, any combination of salsa with their 1, 2, and 3 toe-curl spice ratings, sour cream and cheese.  It is a tasty treat that I can get even in the drive-thru.  Safety warning, don't try to eat this on the road.  If you are a drive-thru explorer, wait until you get home.  The burritos can lean towards the large side and get messy as a result.

If you are so inclined, get adventureous with your burrito.  Don't be shy.  Ask for a half and half burrito with huli huli chicken and kalua pig.  The two together are so ono.  I get that every so often just to mix things up.  

In closing, try the cocount bark.  I'm not a big fan of coconut but this stuff is just awesome.  Sweet and chocolatey with a little toasted coconut added in.  I took some to California for Christmas and it didn't last long.  My family was all over it.
