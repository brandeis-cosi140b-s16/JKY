I've been here a couple of time for drinks and this past Vegas trip for food.  Their carne asada was really good, but I wasn't that hungry so I couldn't even eat half the plate.  Prices are not cheap.  It may look like a mexican fast food place, but it's not.  Drinks were good.  The bartender was really nice.  I'd come here again.
