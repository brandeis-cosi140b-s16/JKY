This place has often steered me away from the junk food clutter you find along Boulder Highway. Roberto's Carne Asada Burrito can't be beat from around 5 bucks. Three rolled Taco with Guacamole are another favorite. If you really want to chow down plates with Spanish Rice and beans are available. Not overly greasy and very tasty. The drive thru window has been a daily drive now for months. I notice if you go to the same guy at the drive thru, put tips in his jar your Burrito tends to gets larger. If you don't tip they forget to give you salsa. Ready for the secret, Wednesdays the Chicken Tacos are 99 cents.
