Here's the deal--I'm not a fan of everything on the menu.  In fact, I think that the majority of the menu items are not good.  But, if you order carnitas tacos, you won't be disappointed.  Toro Loco is worth a trip, but only for these tacos.  The salsa lacks flavor, and if you ask for anything hotter, a warm, unappetizing bowl of hotter salsa comes out.  

Margaritas are 1.99 on Mondays, and beer is reasonably priced too.

The service is always friendly and reliable.  I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here, but seeing as I'm in the neighborhood, I'm glad Toro Loco is in town.  And I hope they never run out of carnitas tacos.
