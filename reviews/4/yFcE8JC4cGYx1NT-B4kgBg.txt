quick, clean, fast   good value which gets the basics right  and beats out the place on 43rd / Cactus handily both in speed and taste.  The beans and rice aren't just required filler they're actually good accompaniments to the meal.   No frills,cash only and  not the easiest place to get in and out off ( then again neither is the new In and Out on Cactus)
