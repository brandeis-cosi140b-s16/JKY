Ok, I'm not sure if Cafe Rio is really an authentic Mexican cuisine or is it like one of those american tiki bars that are all dressed up like the islands, but actually resides smack dab in the middle of the US. Either way, if it is an American corporation that dresses like a mexican spot, call me one to turn the other cheek! I'm just in love with the food and flavor.

Coconut shrimp taco tuesdays. Thats what its all about. They are VERY generous about the shrimp too I may add. I also love the pork barbacoa tacos. The burritos are just too big for my hand to hold, so I opt for the tacos. I love the barbacoa flavor because its sweet, juicy, and meaty as well. The pork is tender and perfectly shredded. Its just so full of flavor, and has that nice marinated bbq taste to it. If you like more soft, and less over powering flavors, I'd try the coconut shrimp, salmon, and mahi mahi. Those are primo. It's not filling, the flavors are very soft and subtle, and the fish is tender as well.

But what makes everything perfect and my personal favorite is the torilla. It's freshly made, and because it trastes so wonderful I always ask to DOUBLE the tortilla. It's a thick tortilla and very soft. It has this light, sweet, doughy taste and texture to it. It's not flat and woodfired or stovetop grilled like most tortillas. Expect to see the cooks in the back making the dough and cooking the tortillas fresh for you. My favorite.

Also, they have a stamp card. But 9 meals, and get the tenth free. WHO DOESN'T LOVE STAMP CARDS?!?!!?!
