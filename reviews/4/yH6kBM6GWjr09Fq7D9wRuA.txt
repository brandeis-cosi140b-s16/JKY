Stopped in here one day, the sign for Taco Tuesday, 1.95 tacos drew me in. I ordered a chicken taco and a pork barbacoa taco.  Both were very good, in fact, I will be back for the pork again and again.  I will say, the service needs work. The staff is not very personable and when I asked for a side of rice, I got half a scoop in a bowl.  Luckily we were not charged for the side of rice.  All in all, good food and clean place.
