Great fast food mexican style, almost authentic - not your Taco Bell.  Have had the carne asada combo plate, dry burrito, taco combo plate and the chorizo morning burrito.  Fresh and hot cooked to order.  Inexpensive and nice condiments of cucumbers peeled, carrots, jalapenos, lemons, both green and red sauce.  For quick, fast mexican food 24 hours a day this is the place.
