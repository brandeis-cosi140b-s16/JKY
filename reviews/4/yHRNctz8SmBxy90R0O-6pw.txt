Ice cold mugs, tiny pitchers, beer.  What a great way to start after a long hike on a chilly Sunday afternoon.  The warm chips and tasty salsa were immediately brought to the table.  Next came our waiter, a newbie to Arizona from Arkansas, with a cute southern drawl, easy demeanor and not bad on the eyes, either.  But most importantly, he was SO attentive.  Especially since one of our diners is gluten-free, lactose intolerant.  He guided us through the menu, made great recommendations, even went back to confer with the chefs to be sure everything was done correctly.  We each ordered the taco trios, an array of different smells, proteins, veggies graced our table.  Each of us having a favorite.  It was topped off with warm, sugary churros accompanied with a chocolate dipping sauce, on the house for our birthday boy.  We will definitely be back.  We enjoy that part of town, seeing old buildings (used to be Humpty Dumpty's Restaurant) coming alive.  Oh, and ask for Jeremy.  Hope he sticks around.
