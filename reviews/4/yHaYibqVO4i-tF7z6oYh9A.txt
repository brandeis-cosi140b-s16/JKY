I think the owners must take the Yelp reviews seriously, because I visited this new Carlos O'Briens location for dinner recently and had an excellent experience.

We were greeted right away in a friendly manner by the hostess at the front desk. She seated us and within 10 - 15 seconds, a friendly wait staff member brought chips and salsa to the table. The waitress greeted us about 20 seconds later and took our drink orders. Staff members worked together to keep our beverages filled. Several staff members offered more chips and salsa to us, but we declined, knowing that the entree portions are huge.

The combination plates were large and satisfying (especially the tacos). The shrimp fajita platter was huge and delicious. The menu is large enough to satisfy most everyone. They even have non-Mexican food items if you are in the mood for pub food.

The only complaints I would have was my rice was clumpy in spots. Also, while the tables were cleared off quickly, there was a bit of trash on the floor here and there throughout the restaurant.

This location is quite a bit noisier than the old Scottsdale/Bell Road location, but the noise wasn't overpowering. I will be back!
