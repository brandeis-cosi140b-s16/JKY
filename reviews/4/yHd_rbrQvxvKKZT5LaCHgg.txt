After I wrote my first review, I was asked to visit a second time. I tell you- everything had changed for the better! we were met graciously with a smiling host, the waitress Maria explained the options of the brunch. the food was abundant at the buffett table. We also ordered the fruit platter off the brunch menu and it was a huge plate of pineapple, melons and strawberrys. The managers, Augustine and Margaret came by and checked on us, to ensure everything was good. Everyone in the restaurant was enjoying themselves! their was a gentleman and his son playing the guitar and singing, he also involved the guests into singing with them. It was a great time! I will defintely return after the service I recieved on this visit. Thank you Margaret for taking the comments and views of previous customers and making the changes, so that it is an enjoyable experience.
