Great food! Awesome service. I had a travelzoo deal and it was well worth it. Everything was excellent, the chorizo fondue and scallops were highlights and almost too good to describe with words. The guacamole wasn't as good as the rest of the dishes, but overall, a great experience.  I would definitely go back, but probably look for the deal again because otherwise the prices were pretty high.
