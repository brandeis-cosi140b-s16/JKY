A friend and I were  on are way for a gamenight and had some time to kill.  But we didn't want to stop at any generic fastfood place. we saw this place on the way near a B.K. So we decided to stop and check it out. 

The place has photo of the food on the wall and a poster that said "Gorillas Love Milkshakes!" He had the a burger and I had the pallpork. the Food look extraordinary, Mouth wateringley  delicious! However the palled pock was only average. the sauce was sweet and the pork was soft and fantastic!  A spice green pepper was a nice teats too. 

I would love to go again with another friend.
