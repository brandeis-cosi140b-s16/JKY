Quite possibly the coolest hang out in the East End - and the drinks are pretty stellar (I recommend El Rey), but if you order food be prepared to dig pretty deep into those wallets for a small portion - oh, and watch out for the chips. It's tragic that some of the best guac in town is paired with these greasy monsters. If you are merrily throwing back some margaritas in the sunshine - that tequila won't settle too well on top of these - just saying.
