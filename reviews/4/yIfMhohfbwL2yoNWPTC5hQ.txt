Came here over the weekend while visiting some childhood friends that relocated here from Cali.  My BFF happens to live around the corner from here and had been raving about the food.  I love island food and anytime I can get it is always great, when I heard this is a chipotle concept restaurant but that served island protein instead the sound of it instantly caught my curiosity.  

I walked in with a party of nine.  We came around 11:30 am and was greeted by the employees.  We were all asked if we had been there and most of us said no.  the young lady and gentlemen informed us of the concept and gave us samples while doing so.  The Kalua pig and pulehu steak were my top choices.  Both were so flavorful and moist.  I went with the salad bowl with pulehu steak and chose the mild and medu salsas.  They definitely give you huge portions and the prices and reasonable.  We were all so stuffed and couldn't finish all of our food.  Two people could definitely share a bowl.  I will probably do that the next time I go and order a burrito as well.  Those darn burritos looked epic!  By this time a swoon of customers rush through the door and seems they have their rush times like any good eatery. 

If you don't have room to enjoy their coconut bark at their restaurant... Take it home!!! It is so delicious.  I bought an entire pound for my group and we munched on them.  Munching accompanied with moaning and ahhhhs while we enjoyed every single morsel.  Haha!  Trust, get yourself at least a piece to try and enjoy!!
