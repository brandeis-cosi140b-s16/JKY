I will try my hardest to write reviews for only local businesses or locally owned businesses, because the last thing I need to know was what you think about the rude cashier at McDonald's. This will be one of my few exceptions. 

My friends know when my night out is ending when they see the famous "Yelp Check In" at Del Taco. This one is on the way home for me and so on a Friday or Saturday night, sometime between 2:00 am, to as late as 6:30 am the last time I was here, this is my last stop before hitting the bed.

The drive thru is open 24/7. They are always super fast giving me my secret combo of value menu items to prevent that next day hang over. 

OK, you convinced me to give up my secret. This is how I prevent hangovers. Get the bean and cheese burrito, and the chicken soft taco. Get your preferred level of hot sauce (mine is inferno, nothing but the hottest for me). It's only $2.07 out the door with tax and when you get home, drink lots of water and tear into your food. I never have a hang over when I do this. 

Protip: Take out your contacts before eating that burrito. It's tough enough taking out those things when drunk but when your fingers are like little balls of fire that your just rubbing into your eye, it never ends well.
