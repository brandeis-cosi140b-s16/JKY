Finally! Vegas gets a really good Mexican sea food place. My dad had heard about their San Pedro style shrimp platters so we had to come check it out. We order the shrimp tray and it was really good. It came with garlic bread and lots of veggies (onion, bell pepper & potatoes). The seasoning on it was really close to the ones in San Pedro. We also had their shrimp tilapia. The place started to get pack after we arrived so we got lucky. Can't wait to come back and bring friends with me.
