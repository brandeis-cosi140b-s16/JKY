Massive menu made choosing my Mexican meal mighty difficult! 

The four of us opted for appetizers of table-side guacamole, yum, made to order with our options of tomatoes, garlic, jalopenos, cilantro, and onions. We also ordered some cheesy fundido thing that was also yummy. 

The meals were sort of superfluous at that point, so we all took leftovers home. Maybe not the best Mexican I've had, but certainly tasty enough. 

$70 covered the two appetizers, four entrees, at least a couple sodas, and tip. 

Service was pretty on-point, but the tables were way too small to handle that much food. :)
