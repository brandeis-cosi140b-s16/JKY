Dont pay heed to the negatives. I'll tell you exactly what this place is. Its a good place to eat without breaking the bank. I've been eating here since the late 90s. Back then they had an awesome $2.99 breakfast. I'm sure the price has gone up on that now but I still come for the burger meal deal , hotdogs and occasionally the fish. Prices are great and yes it takes time for your food to come out because they are cooking it! Mims is cheaper than most fast food joints and you get home cooked flavor and quality! I love this place
