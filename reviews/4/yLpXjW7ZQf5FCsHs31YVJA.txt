I think I am more of a fan of the layout of the place. I love sitting outdoors and this has a great outdoor seating area so this was a plus for me. 

The food was great, although all I had was a carne asada burrito...which was awesome. Also the chips and salsa were very good, the man who took our order at the register also came out later and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa which I thought was 
nice. If I did not get a large salsa with my chips I would have needed more to go with my burrito. Also, if I had not ordered the chips I might still be hungry because the burritos were a little on the small size. (Thanks Chipotle for ruining that for me)

I'm looking forward to going back for happy hour, and if you friend them on facebook I believe you get info on specials on certain days.
 
So if you are looking for a really great place to sit outside and have some great burritos and beer i would recommend this place first to anyone.
