Stumbled upon this place today after decided to eat elsewhere - our other restaurant choice had a 45 minute wait time. We started with the special soup of the day - poblano corn soup. It was amazing! Highly recommends. Such a heart soup that tasted homemade. Could not have been better. For mains, my boyfriend had the Pollo Asado with rice and beans. The chicken was cooked excellently - nice and moist, and he enjoyed his meal, but the taste of the sauce was not to my liking. It is mild and has a chocolate base - if you want it spicy, you need to add hot sauce on the side. I had the bbq pork quesadilla and the Barbacoa steak quesadilla with flour tortillas - both were excellent, although I did like the bbq pork one better - it was tastier because of the sauce. Both quesadillas were served with a small side of guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo. We wanted to try their hot chocolate, but were too full! The table next to us couldn't stop raving about it. 

It's a small, but extremely cosy place. I loved the ambience. Good music, good service. A definite must try. You won't be disappointed!
