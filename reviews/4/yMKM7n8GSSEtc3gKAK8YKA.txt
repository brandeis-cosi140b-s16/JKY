I grew up on this Macayo's location's food, literally. My grandmother moved to Arizona in 1942 and was excited when this place opened. So my family has been coming here for 50+ years. Is it the best Mexican food ever in Phoenix? No, it's not "foodie" food. Do they serve a great chimi? Yup. Enchilada sampler is good too. Chips and salsa always good and it's dining room is family friendly, if kitchy and dated. Love it or leave it, Macayo's is a landmark to Phoenicians.
