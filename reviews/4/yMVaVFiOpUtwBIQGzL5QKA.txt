I have eaten here a several times in the last couple weeks. Tried the shrimp el diablo and it was really good and so was the fillette empanizado.   They serve a small bowl of packaged type chips with salsa at the begining of the meal. The home made salsa they serve with the chips is really excellent, I asked and they let me buy some to go. This place has been here forever and continues to serve good food for a good price.
