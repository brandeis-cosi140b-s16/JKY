Classic New Mexico roadside comfort food at it's purest. Open the door, step back in time, and enjoy a slice of New Mexican pride. Pork chile verde and beef chile Colorado rock the house. Wet slow simmered pork burritos with that green chile sauce is full of love. The sopapillas are hard to beat. I wish my mother would have washed my mouth out with these sopapillas instead of plain soap. The 2 dishes of tableside salsa are vastly different from each other and both delish. One looks pretty tomato saucy, but don't judge that book by it's cover-it's bursting with flavor. I have seen orders of nachos (which I rarely order) that look amazing...but have not tried them. Nothing else like it in Vegas.
