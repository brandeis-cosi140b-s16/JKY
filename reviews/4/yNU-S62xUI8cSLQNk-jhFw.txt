I'm a very health conscious person, and this place was suprisingly great for me! I had a chicken burrito with veggies and pico, and they have a way to make simple and healthy very yummy! I enjoyed the availability of wheat tortillas, but was shocked that they don't have black beans; they only offer refried. Nor do they have brown rice. Nevertheless, the flavor was amazing, and the ingredients they didn't have did not cross my mind once  I took a bite! I would love to have one in Central Phoenix.
