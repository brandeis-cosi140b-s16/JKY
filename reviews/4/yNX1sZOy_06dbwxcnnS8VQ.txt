Fried. Intestine. Tacos.

Yes, yes..I know it may sound gross...and if you really think about it then, maybe it is..
BUTTTTTTTTT, it's DEEP FRIED GOODNESS! And in a taco form.
The lime, the tortilla.....everything just works. Reminds me a lot of Kogi tacos which, you know I love to death.

Best part is it's cheap! $1.50 each. Cost less than my drink did.
