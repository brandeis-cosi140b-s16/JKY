The dinner crowd was very sparse but I'm glad I tried this place. We enjoyed the chips and salsa very much, and we found both the green and red enchiladas to be good. The rice and beans were also very tasty. I would have appreciated a beer with my food, but I was happy with the price and quality.

The portions were also good. We ate every bite of our enchiladas but didn't leave feeling hungry. This was a very different experience from chain Mexican restaurants and I will certainly be returning.
