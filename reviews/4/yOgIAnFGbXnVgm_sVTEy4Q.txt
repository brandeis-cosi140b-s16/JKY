Many reviewers have already done a great job reviewing this restaurant so I'll just weigh in with my rating and share my two experiences.

To date I've ordered take out once and eaten in once at El Conquistador and was very satisfied with both experiences.  My first experience was ordering take out with my wife; as it was our first venture we both ordered the El Conquistador burrito (Chile Relleno, Steak Picado, Guacamole & Beans). The burrito was very good; the chile relleno was moderately spicy and firm, the steak was well seasoned and served medium and the beans were well prepared and likely scratch made.  One often overlooked but key item really delivered; the tortilla. It was a superb flour tortilla and if not scratch made then they're sourcing it from someone who knows what they're doing.

My second experience was group dinner in which I ordered Carne Asada tacos (soft).  The tacos were simple (as one should be), fresh and delicious. The beef appeared to be slow cooked in an oven rather than a traditional Sonora style grilled asada but that did not take away from the quality.  If you're a cabeza fan then you'll love their asada.  The obligatory chips and salsa were excellent. Homemade, thin yellow corn chips and two salsa options; a fresh, mild, traditional but tasty rojo and a smokey, spicy offering that was quite good.

The restaurant itself was very clean. On both visits I was served by the owners, apparently a husband and wife duo.  The wife was fun, friendly and attentive. 

If you're craving some greasy, cheddar cheesy hangover curing Sonoran style gut bombs then hit up Mixtecca.  But if you want some terrific, homemade authentic Jalisco style food at a fantastic price you should get yourself to El Conquistador with the quickness.
