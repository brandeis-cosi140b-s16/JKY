I had read all the reviews and was a little nervous abt going. Not sure why now. 
Went with friends. Each of us had a drink, and they were good. Tasted like what we ordered and what we expected from margaritas and mojitos (and without the Strip price tag).
We each had some version of tacos. No complaints.The fish tacos were a little spicy, but I do have a sensitive palate. 
The chips and sauces were more than enough for the three of us, and we shared a two-person order of guacamole and had a little left over because our food came before we finished it. 
Sat outside on the patio. It was a little windy, and they turned on the fire place about half hour after sunset. (As an East Coast transplant, always humored when 75 degrees = cold.) Service was totally fine; waitress was friendly and quick to meet our needs for more water and shared dessert. Music was '80s hits until abt 8 when they dimmed the lights and put on mariachi music. $30 a piece for tip, shared dessert, drink, guacamole, and entree. Sounds average for Summerlin.
Really not sure why so many poor reviews. I went to Agave once and liked it the food but really don't see much difference. Feel like others may be splitting hairs and comparing red apples to green apples.
