i had the entire restaurant to myself on a recent Tuesday night at 8pm which is pretty unusual in anyone's lifetime at that hour. Regardless, I wanted to try the $2.50 tacos special. The grilled chicken and Carne Asada both had top quality meat and both tacos were very filling overall. I have been seeing cabbage on tacos lately, but that is not necessary, unless it is native to whatever section of Mexico Ricky comes from. The bar guy had the Suns game volume jacked up like he was watching in his living room and it is kind of weird just being the only person there, but hey the tacos and $5 Corona draft were on the spot and hit the spot as well.
