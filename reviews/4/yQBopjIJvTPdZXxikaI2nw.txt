The Red Chile & Mango Steak Salad is one of the Top 5 best salads I have ever had, if not #1. The combination of steak, blue cheese, spicy walnuts, tomatoes, and fresh chunks of mangos provides a flavor combination that is out of this world! Sweet, spicy, salty, savory, all it one delicious salad. What could make for a better lunch? The service is pretty good, the cornbread is hot, and the margaritas are worth every penny! Go there for lunch, or for the Bloody Mary Bar on Saturdays (only at this location) or Sundays!  Their brunch menu on the weekends is also one of my favorites!
