Love this place but it is not for the faint hearted. If you do not enjoy spicy foods, I am not sure there will be much for you to eat. But if you can handle the heat you need to go!

Everything is quality. I always get my enchiladas or rellenos Christmas style and with the pecan grilled shrimp.

However, the salsa is not my favorite (more of a chunky salsa girl) and the chips are sometimes too heavily salted.
