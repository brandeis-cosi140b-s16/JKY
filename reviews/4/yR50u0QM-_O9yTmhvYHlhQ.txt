I come here for one thing...


The grilled chicken chimichangas with the red sauce on the side so i can use it for dipping.  I cannot tell you what is all in it but the grilled chicken alone is fantastic. Do i love the price for all of this...I guess.  Its not a stellar deal or anything but its like a once a month or every other month thing for me.  I love that the place gives you chips and salsa before your meal but i usually like to wait for my actual meal so i am not absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand.  
Believe me Chimichangas are not good later on so you have to have an appetite on you for sure.

Horchata is okay. Not my favorite either seems too watery in my opinion, I love it when horchata is more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet.  One guy that works here knows my friend who is hooked to this place and got me started so when we walk through he already knows.  The girl who cannot do her makeup for the life of her on the other hand is a different story.
