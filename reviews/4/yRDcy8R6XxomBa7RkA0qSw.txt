I ordered a beef taco, chicken enchilada, and a beef tostada. Everyone understands there is sauce on the enchilada, so it seems like they might have separated that from the other two items, especially the hand-held taco. Instead, it arrived all on one plate, with the saucy enchilada in the middle. Picking up the taco without getting enchilada sauce all over my hands would have been impossible. They were nice to bring me another taco and take the sauced one away. 

Also, it was my first time here and no one explained the fresh guacamole cart upfront. When it hit my table, I wasn't sure if it was complimentary or if I would be charged for it, so I passed.  The tip container on the container was right at eye level. Couldn't miss that. 

The enchilada was nicely seasoned, but the chicken was a bit on the dry side. The ground beef on the taco and tostada was decent, if a little greasy, and it needed salt IMO. Chips were good, as was the salsa. 

I might try this place again when I am in town.
