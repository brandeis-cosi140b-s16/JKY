Proud to eat at and support a business that is committed to a Non-Gmo menu! They offer healthy options while eating out at reasonable prices. My fav is the chicken fajita; I get it with lite brown rice, double black beans, chicken, fajita peppers and onions, guacamole and lots of Tabasco both red and green. Yum
