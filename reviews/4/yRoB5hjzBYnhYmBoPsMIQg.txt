Since its located in the Miracle Mile mall and we stayed at the Elara which is connected the the mall we ate here a few times for breakfast since it was good and cheap. Breakfast special has 2 eggs any way, a meat (bacon, sausage, etc) hashed potatoes, and tortilas. The get you with the drink prices though. $3 for a juice. Huband had the steak burrito one morning and he said it was very good to. Waitstaff isn't always helpful or friendly, but some of them were.
