This place is good! There aren't many places to get real tacos in 89108. Cheap and delicious. I had carne asada and al pastor, both to my satisfaction. They put beans on top of the carne asada tacos which I'm not used to, but enjoyed. Salsa bar and pickled vegetables like Robertto's or any other taco shop.
