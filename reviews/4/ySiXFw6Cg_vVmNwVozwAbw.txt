This is my favorite location that I've been to (much better than Stephanie & Eastern.) Both the Stephanie & Eastern locations have run out of certain things when I've gone, which I find extremely odd & inconvenient, but not this location. This location also has the best customer service & I've never left disappointed. However, I still feel that it's overpriced.
