About a month ago or so, I gave El Gran Taquito another try and I was very surprised! I'm a little bit of a regular now! Having gone there three times in the past month! 

I am happy to report that they got rid of these HUGE wooden chairs they used to have and exchanged them for some smaller more sturdier chairs yay! They also worked on their timing, I never waited longer than 15 minutes for a dine-in order for two. They have also added to their menu, now boasting 16 combos and now includes new breakfast & lunch specials. They have also lowered their prices, their combos range between $4.50 - $7.25, which is GREAT! 

more professionalism with their staff. He was nice and helpful and even suggested substitutions, but he was obviously very young and kind of... figity. Their dining area could use some love, it's never dirty dirty, but I usually have to wipe off the table with a dry napkin before we sit down. 

My favorite is the #16, a taco, enchilada and toastada with rice and beans for only $7.25! It's a lot of food too! *see pics* The enchiladas are my favorite! They don't put onions in them!! YAY!! Their tacos are nice and crisp and the lettuce is always fresh (big huge plus for me). They could use some more chili in their hot sauce, it lacks that nice kick I like in my hot sauce. The beans and rice are decend, nothing special - but still decent. 

I hope you go to El Gran Taquito soon and give them a try, it's not wonderful or perfect, but it is good and I'm a fan.
