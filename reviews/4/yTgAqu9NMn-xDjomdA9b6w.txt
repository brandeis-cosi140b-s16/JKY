My Mom and I dined here  for lunch one Sunday.  It wasn't very busy. Staff there were SUPER nice.  I was looking for a lunch menu, and slightly bummed that they only have their regular/dinner menu so it was a little pricey for lunch.  I had their Fajita Quesadilla and LOVED it. The veggies inside were cooked perfectly, the steak was nice and tender, the best part? It was loaded with cheese! (yep, I'm a Wisconsinite)  Sadly I didn't really care for the refried beans they didn't have much flavor and almost tasted watery, and the Rice was just OK. I would go back for the Fajita Quesadilla though!  I didn't have one of their Margaritas, but saw that they have them very cheap during the week at Happy Hour.
