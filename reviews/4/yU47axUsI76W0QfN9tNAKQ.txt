Yes. Delicious. I had street tacos and a tamale with chips and salsa. They have a salsa bar so you can eat as much as you want.  The tacos were delicious and the tamale was one of the best I have had. This is authentic Mexican food, and I recommend it to anyone. The staff was very courteous. I will eat here again!
