Oh..the chicken and pinto beans of El Pollo Loco! 
Now, my foodie friends may make fun of me...but I am a regular. To me it is just a bit like sitting in my grandma's dining room on a Sunday when there was always a pot of beans and a roasted chicken. 
My midwestern self needs some of the simple things of home to keep me in balance with my "wild Vegas" life style---yeah...those who know me can atest to how not wild my lifestyle is ever!
My only experience with El Pollo has been here in Vegas...and all I want to say is...Oh El Pollo...how have you not been a part of my life for ever!
