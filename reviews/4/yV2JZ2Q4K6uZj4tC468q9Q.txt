OH EM GEE!!! Sushi burritos?! get at me. 

I am a sucker for a saucy, crunchy, fresh tasting sushi roll - with a lot going on. I love tempura and eel sauce and avocado - and tuna and salmon and the list goes on and on. This becomes a bit extreme on a roll because they end up being gigantic (and never mind the cost). BUT Chef John Chien Lee solved my problem! THANK YOU MASTER! 

Jaburritos is such a winning concept. It's like the Chipotle of the Sushi world (but better). 
Pick your wrapping - soy or seaweed - (i opted for soy) and then decide whether you'd like a concoction that has already been perfected or if you'd like to take a stab at your own creation. I went  with a modified Rockport - which had soft shell crab, spicy tuna, surimi crab, jalapeno, masago, cucumber, red onion, tempura crunch, chipotle mayo and sweet anguilla sauce. I said nah to the surimi crab and added avocado and salmon. Enter - my perfect roll! IN A BURRITO! It was so freakin' good. 

These are like a giant hand roll of everything you could ever desire. The thing that makes these so legit though -hands down- is the quality. Nothing is mushy - the rice is cooked perfectly, the fish is fresh and firm. It's a high quality roll in a beautiful blanket of burrito-ness. 

I'm really hoping for an expansion to San Diego because the two places that tried their hand at this concept have failed. PLEASE CHEF LEE - HELP ME OUT!!! 

I promise if you love sushi, you'll love this place - and you'll crave it...often...like all the time. Like every day. ugh.
