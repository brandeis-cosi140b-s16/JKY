This place is the bomb and you have to know what to get. The Machaca beef is amazing and the enchiladas are on point. The owners might be old and fussy they have never bothered me but get what I tell you to get and you'll go home satisfied. It's a small joint so don't expect some great service only 2 people work here. This is a top 5 Mexican food spot!
