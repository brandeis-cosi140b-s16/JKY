A hidden gem for cheap lunch in Cave Creek. Restaurant is a little dive shack in the back of a souvenir store. Indian fry bread and tourist friendly inauthentic Mexican food. Simple cheese and meat fried to gooey goodness. Low brow heaven. Pro tip: on a nice day sit on the patio out back - even more hidden than the restaurant!
