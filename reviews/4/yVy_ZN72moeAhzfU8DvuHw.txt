For airport food this place gets four, count 'em four, quatro stars. 
All day long.

Pricey? Maybe a bit but not bad for good airport food.
Super-friendly bartender? Yep, he has been working there for many years. Good food? Yes. 

Much better than the standard fair usually found in terminals.

Oh yeah, great margarita and you get to keep the shaker! LOL
