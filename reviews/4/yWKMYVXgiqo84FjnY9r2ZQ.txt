My mom was in town visiting and we were both craving Mexican food. We stumbled on the place by accident, but it was actually very very good.
We seated ourselves in the bar, chips and salsa were delivered to our table in less thank two minutes. Our server was a little busy but we didn't mind, we were busy catching up.
Food was very good! I had chicken fajitas and my mom had some type of enchiladas and we both had a margarita. Ordered a burrito to go for my husband, he demolished the whole thing. 
We will definitely return!
