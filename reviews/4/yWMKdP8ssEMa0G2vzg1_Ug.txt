The wait for the restaurant (when there is one) is most definitely worth it. Employees are always friendly, the chips and salsa are quickly served and delicious, and the service itself is speedy. The menu offers a variety of authentic Mexican food, but I will note that the less pricy options don't have the same quality. I once ordered a bean burrito (literally--nothing but beans in the burrito) and a side of rice and paid close to eight dollars for it. The burrito had little to no flavor; I was thoroughly grateful the salsa compensated for it. Vegan options are practically nonexistent but the other food I ate there before becoming a vegan was indeed worth the price.
