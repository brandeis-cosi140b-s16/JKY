I am sad.
Today was last day in a very long time I will be eating at Rubios.
I am starting this ridiculous almost all protein diet, and sadly, Rubios just doesn't cut it.  With all of the sodium and carbs that this place carries...I just have to say goodbye for a little while.
So, today (after working out no less...because I am an oxymoron) I decided to give my bon voyage of tasty mexican good to Rubios.
Rubios I love you.
You are my favorite.
But I promise to see you soon :)  And I will get enchiladas again.
Yummy.
