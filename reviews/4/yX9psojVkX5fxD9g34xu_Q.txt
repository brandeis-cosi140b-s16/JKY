We were hungry and looking for a Jack in the Box.  Never really found it because my friend saw the Fausto's sign and shouted "Fausto's go Fausto's!!!". I've never heard of them before but must be good to shout it out like that. It was like any other Mexican restaurant like Roberto's, Don Tortaco, etc, which I do enjoy, cheap, fast, very filling, and perfect when drinking or recovering. 

We ordered a few burritos. Being only about $5 you can't go wrong. The carne asada burrito was my choice just because I don't think I could've ate an entire plate of nachos. It was satisfying and did the spot, delicious and filling definitely.

I saw a sign for menudo and being a chilly Friday night I wanted some but it was only made on Sat and Sun, so maybe next time.

They are clean, fast, and reliable. If you're feeling like Mexican, Fausto's is good especially if its the nearest Mexican around you.
