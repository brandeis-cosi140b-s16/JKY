First time to Dos Caminos and it wasnt bad. I came at the right time (Happy Hour). I always sit at thr bar to gamble while waiting on food and faster drinks. My bartender Geneveive gave me tips on food to order and brought my drinks right out.  Talked a little before my Nachos came. Which I thought were good, but not at all amazing. But I will need to come back and actually try a entree like i read in other reviews.  That seems to be the deciding factor.
