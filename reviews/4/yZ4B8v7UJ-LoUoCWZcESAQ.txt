Having moved here from Southern California, I was skeptical that I would be able to find delicious, authentic Mexican food. This place delivers. Sells great michiladas, asada tacos with two corn tortillas (those are my markers for authentic Mexican food). 
Bachata and salsa music make me feel right at home. 
Highly recommended.
