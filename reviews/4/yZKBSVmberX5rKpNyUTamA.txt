Oh my gosh, queso.............

I could end my review there and that would be sufficient in my eyes!

Anyways, came here today for a quick lunch (Joey Jr) and it was free queso day! The junior was delish as normal. Moes always seems to serve a consistent product and the free chips and salsa just add to its greatness!

The only two comments I have about this particular Moes is:
1. The bottleneck. Anyone that has been in here knows that the drink machine/salsa area is just an accident waiting to happen...
2. I dont usually add a ton of things to my burrito (for example on this particular occasion it was rice, black beans, chicken, corn, and lettuce). The guy ripped the shell....no biggie at all. However, instead of replacing the tortilla, he just re-wrapped it with a new one (aka now I had two tortilla shells instead of one). Since I was about to eat my body weight in chips and queso, I really only needed one tortilla. Thus, I made a huge mess at my desk trying to unwrap one and eat the burrito that had the ripped shell. Eventually, I just dumped it in a bowl and gave up. Not really a deal breaker but, since it was fairly slow when I went in, he definitely just could have just removed the ripped tortilla!
