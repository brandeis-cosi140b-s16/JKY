Came here lastnight after getting no service at Macayo's down the street, yea thats right. Took about 4 minutes for someone to finally walk up and greet us at the host stand to be seated(they werent busy), then sat at our table for another 5-6 minutes with no server to greet us. Oh but atleast 4 or 5 different staff members walked by, but just ignored us. Finally just got up and left.

So i admit Arriba's was our second choice, but that's only because my wife likes Macayo's more, but if it were up to me we wouldve saved a half an hour of our lives and just came to Arriba's first. LOL

Walk in, got a friendly greeting right away, got seated immediately. Chips came asap, greeted by our server right away, she was very nice. It was the bartender waiting on us, so the drinks came out super fast, and really hit the spot after dealing withe the garbage service over at Macayo's. Had refills of chips and salsa brought to us without having to ask.

Pazole, great
steak tampico, great
fajitas, great

So lesson learned, if you're in the ahwatukee area and in the mood for mexican. Don't even bother with Macayo's and their ridiculous service. Go to Arriba's, much better! plus c'mon its all about the Hatch chiles they have there! SPICY!
