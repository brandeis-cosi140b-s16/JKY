Great stop as my gf and I were staying at the Four Seasons and we wanted food stat. Keep in mind, it was extremely hot, we just arrived, and were hungry. But the food was good, the mexican chopped salad was plentiful and the avocado was fresh. I had the sangria and my girlfriend had the pomegranate margarita, which she loved.
There is construction so it was a maze of sorts to get to the actual restaurant area. But for the price, a nice sit down lunch.
