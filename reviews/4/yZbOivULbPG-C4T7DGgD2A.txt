Location, location, location.

This Chipotle is in a great location, seeing as the Wallace Theater (or now its something like Hollywood Theater) is minutes away (by electric wheelchair).

The staff has ALWAYS been friendly.  The dining area is always clean.

I'm not a big 'salad' kind of guy, but I'll take the Chipotle chicken salad with rice and pinto any day.  Their medium salsa is my idea of a perfect salad dressing, but if you are more traditional, you can get their house dressing.  I like to top off my salad (or as Sponge Bob would say: "sahh lahd") with a dollop of freshly made guacamole.

When you go to a chain like Chipotle, you know what kind of food you're going to get.  When you come to this location,  you also get great ambiance.
