The Tenorio brothers ("Filiberto" being the eldest) opened their first fast-food restaurant in San Diego, and soon after, one on Main Street in Mesa. I used to live near and eat at that second location, and trust me -- when their company website says it was an "instant success" and "people lined up" to eat there, they aren't exaggerating!

Today, Filibertos boats 28 restaurants in Arizona and California. The newest addition in Chandler lacks the reverse-ambiance of the original one that occupied an abandoned Jack-in-the-box, but the food is the same. 

Filibertos falls somewhere between a Taco Bell or Del Taco and a full-fledged, full-priced Mexican restaurant. But that's a good thing when you want better-than-fast-food but only want to spend around 5 bucks. Filibertos has become my go-to choice for comfort (read: fattening) Mexican food. Some days I would give the eatery 3 and sometimes even 5 stars, when the food is especially fresh and not too greasy, but overall I'll play it safe with a 4. 

My personal faves are the Arizona burrito with cubed beef, potatoes and cheese and the Chile Rellenos plate, while my husband prefers the Adobada burrito and the fish tacos. Note: it helps if you intend to get your order to go, since many locations offer limited or no seating.
