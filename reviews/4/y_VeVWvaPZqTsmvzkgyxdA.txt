I love this place. Initially, I went for their grocery store and then I discovered their tacos. Hands down, it's the most delicious $2 one can spend. If you are looking for Americanized tacos, don't come here. These are authentic Mexican tacos. They have a selection of meats to pick from as well as a great salsa bar. I can't wait for Fridays.

Back to the grocery store, in addition to some great Mexican specialities, which cost much less than at Giant Eagle, they have a great little produce section with very affordable prices. Example -- limes were five for $1 last week. And best of all is their carniceria (butcher shop). Tired of bags of frozen chicken breasts? Try theirs.
