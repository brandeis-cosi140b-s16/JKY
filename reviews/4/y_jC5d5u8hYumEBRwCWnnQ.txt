As a Mexican food snob, it pains me to say this. It pains me to say that I love a corporate franchise that is owned by McDonald's, but I do, so there, and it's Chipotle.

Something about the brick of a burrito that I always get there is calming and makes significant steps towards soothing a weekend hangover. It isn't greasy at all and afterwards you don't walk away with the "I just ate too much Mexican food" stomach. They prep everything in house and the freshness comes out in everything I've ever ordered, all the way down the line to the chips they serve. 

Even the music here is surprisingly good . . . If McDonald's weren't involved, it'd be hard not to give them five stars . . .
