I want to go back and eat there right now! It was the best meal I ate in Vegas! I ordered nachos with chicken and a chicken quesadilla (Not looking for the healthiest meal). Staff was nice, didn't stand out as amazing, but overall good service. If you are staying at the MGM Grand, it's really close by. After I ad eaten at McDonald's twice, the buffet and ordered a pizza, I just wanted some yummy Mexican food. Thanks for saving my life that day.
