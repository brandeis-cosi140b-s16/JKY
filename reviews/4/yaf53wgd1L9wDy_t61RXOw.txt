I'm writing to update a pretty negative review I wrote a few months ago because I had three really poor experiences in a row at the Chandler location. Within 48 hours (I also emailed the review to their direct customer service email), I was contacted by multiple top managers in the company. What was even more amazing was that they didn't try to say "Oh, we don't have any idea why that happened to you" or "that must have been a fluke." Instead, they acknowledged that they were already working through issues at that location, apologized repeatedly, thanked me for my feedback, and sent me gift cards with the promise that when I next returned I would have a different experience. And I have! I have been back twice since giving up on them and there is a marked difference - huge improvement in management and staff attitude/customer service, better food quality control, and just an overall happier vibe. I am back to thinking of Z as my "go to" place for brunch, happy hour, date night and business meetings alike.
