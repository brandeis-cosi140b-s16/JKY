SAY What??! I haven't written a review about The Crazy Chicken yet?! For those who know me and those who don't I love the Crazy Chicken! I normally go for the 2 piece breast and wing and 2 side order and that's exactly what I did today. Most of the time the white meat gets overcooked and its tough to eat....however, El Pollo Loco makes it just right. The combination of the chicken with some flour tortilla, rice and salsa make it soooooo delicious. It may be pricier than most fast food joints, but its well worth the dollars.
