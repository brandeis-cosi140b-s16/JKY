My first visit here was great, the second a bit of a letdown, the third was stellar again. Adobada was dry last time (particularly unfortunate in what seems to be a braised version of this dish). But on the next visit the taco salad was excellent with tender, well-seasoned shredded beef and a good dollop of guacamole. We also enjoy the fresh salsa.
