BYOB and the food is just outstanding.  Only four stars because the waiter is, well, offensive.  He doesn't mean to be and thinks he's being funny, but he literally said to our table with two young women, "Okay, let's have the pretty one order first" insulting the other beautiful woman who was with us.  He also made some crude joke about fire balls, some kind of cheesy spicy appetizer we ordered.  

I could look past this because the food is so good, the others who were with me could not.  Their mole is arguably the best in the city however and the outdoor dining is great, BYOB is great, and it's a good value.
