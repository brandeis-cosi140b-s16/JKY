I thought they closed the Mesa restaurant (I was there over a year ago). Anyway, "I've been to this one and the one on Central in Phoenix. The food is excellent. In terms of food only, I think it's arguably the best in the valley.  It's spicy, flavorful and well prepared.  Anything on the menu is delicious.  

About the Mesa vs. Phoenix thing...to be honest, I think the Mesa one tastes better. The Mesa one definitely tastes more authentic and has more flavor. The Phoenix one tastes more Americanized as if it is geared toward Gringos.

That being said, the Service is horrible and it's been horrible for the last 10 years or so. No, I'm not being hard on them.  They charge for refills on chips!!!! They give you very little chips in a small tin bowl.  They don't refill your drinks. They take forever before you order.  They are inflexible in altering items to cater to vegetarians (Im not vegetarian but I've been there with vegetarians). The waiters have attitude and leave before you can ask questions. 

If the service was somewhat respectable, I would eat there more often. Still the food is delicous but go there with the expectation that you will pay a lot of money and endure horrible service.  It's almost a joke because the service is so consistently bad the owner doesn't really care because people still eat there. NOTE TO THE OWNER: Yes, people eat there with bad service but if you provided better service, guys like me would eat there 20 times a year instead of twice a year!  

P.S.  The best Margaritas in the WORLD...I've been everywhere and you won't get  abetter margarita. It's not Kool Aid nor is it tequila with lime....strong but actually tasty. Don't order a pitcher though. It's a rip-off. They water it down to save money
