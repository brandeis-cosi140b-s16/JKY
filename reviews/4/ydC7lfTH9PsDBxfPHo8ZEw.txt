Things Evolve over time, so has La Condesa, There now is a big fancy bar and a somewhat different menu.

What really matters is that the flavor, ans salsas are still here.

I had a burrito with Mahi Mahi in it, it came loaded with spinach, mushrooms, cheese and rice. The cheese was a bit much but was still great at 10.59 with tax it should be.

What really mad it great was the salsas. Everything from a peanut salsa, to a strawberry to many of the classic favorites. I really enjoyed the roasted peepers and onions salsa.

Yes the inside is small and the parking is suicidal when you leave, but if you need a flavor shot give this place a try.
