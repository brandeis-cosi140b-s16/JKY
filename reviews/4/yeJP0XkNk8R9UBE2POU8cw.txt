Good service, great happy hour, tasty food! I've been only three times but I'm pretty impressed! Happy hour is the best deal.. Food & drink specials are lovely. My friend & I had the chicken nachos and chicken skewers along with two Pacificos. Yummy! I had the pink tacos (I think they're called?) before which were good & this last time, I had the chicken & cheese enchiladas. SO GOOD. The sangria with champagne floater was really good, as well. All in all, great place to go.. I'll be back!
