I've enjoyed eating at El Veracruz for lunch and drinks after work.  It took me almost a year to realize that it was an old Hardee's that they slapped a patio on and turned into a Mexican restaurant.

I defiantly enjoy the outdoor patio. They are constantly making improvements to it.  It's one of the rare places in the area where you can actually sit outside.

The food is good and the portions are plentiful.  The service is always great.
