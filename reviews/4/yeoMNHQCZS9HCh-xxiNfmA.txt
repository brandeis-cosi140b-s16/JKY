Yelper's......... 

Great spot right off the freeway. Large menu and chips to die for. They even make fresh tortillas on the spot. I had the most delicious soft shredded beef ever there. Also got the table side guacamole which was mixed perfectly (to your liking). 

This will be my default restaurant while traveling the 15 fwy.

Large place, clean and plenty of parking. Huge tequila bar too. Oh and outstanding service, water and iced tea filled without asking.
