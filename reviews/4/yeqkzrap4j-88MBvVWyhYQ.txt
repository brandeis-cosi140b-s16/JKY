If really good menudo is your holy grail, this is where you'll find it. I found their piping-hot menudo to be flavorful, its tripe tender and very well prepared. With a sprinkle  of chopped onion and cilantro that come on the side and with a squeeze of a lime wedge, you transform a peasant dish into something almost royal.  I also ordered their chicken enchilada, a rich entree which came out to be a very generous portion. Don't expect an elegant atmosphere, as this place is very basic. But definitely come here for some of the best Mexican food in the Valley. And while most of the staff may have difficulty with English, you will have no problem conversing with the affable young lady at the counter who will take your order and guide you through the menu.
