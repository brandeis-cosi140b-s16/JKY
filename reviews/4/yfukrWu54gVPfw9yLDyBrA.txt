I went during the Iowa Football Homecoming game against Penn St. and the place was loaded with Iowa fans, in their hawk gear, into the game, and cheering on the team. I had $2 Bud Light bottles and $5 for a dozen wings and $5 plate of nachos. It's a hip place, spacious, and good atmosphere. I had a fun time for a good price.

I probably enjoyed this place a little more than your average guy, since I'm a University of Iowa alum, and this is an official Hawkeye bar.
