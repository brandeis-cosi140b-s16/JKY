I'm new to this area and needed my mexican food fix because Cinco de Mayo was on my mind. This place is AOK in my book. Staff was very friendly,  salsa bar was nice and cold, place was clean. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito w/everything...which is rice, beans, cheese, pico, guac and sour cream. Then I made it green sauce enchilada style...what do I know I'm a yankee. It was big, affordable and most importantly tasty! They gave me some chips to dip while I waited. My salsa bar favs were the gaucamole salsa and the spicy(I added salt). I'll be back.
Mari-crapa as I call it, is lucky to have a place like this.
