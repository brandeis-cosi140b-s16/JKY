If you mind eating at a six person plastic resin table in a non-descript quasi-strip mall, please keep driving, McDonalds is just up 19th a little more.  However, if you want to taste some of the best black beans in the world coupled with some incredible Jerk Fried Rice to match beautifully with tastylicious Jade Red Chicken- this is the place!  Chinese-Mexican takee-outee is one of Phoenix's best food combinations in Chino Bandito.  Fun staff, great food, and a line out the door keeps the masses coming back.  I think it's hilarious the amount of money this place must absolutly rack in yet they refuse to spend one cent on ambiance or to fix the place up (I bet if I did the research, they probably own the whole shopping complex).  It is what it is and if you didn't see the line out the door, which by the way, by the time it gets there it's already 30 ft long, you'd never stop-but you need to and you'll be glad you did!
