I cannot comment on very many items but I can tell you that the Baja Chicken Pizza is delicious, the carne asada nachos are excellent and the spinach queso dip, well, let's just say that I would live on that stuff if I could. It is a combination of Velveeta, spinach enchilada filling and baja cream cheese that is nothing less than perfect. It has just the right amount of spice and is not too hot and not too mild. Just right in my opinion. I am on a budget so I cannot afford to eat there often but I go during happy hour and all 3 of the items I mentioned are 1/2 price during happy hour so I get one for eating there and I usually take home at least 2 of the spinach queso dips and eat them for the next few days. They give you a pretty large portion and a big bag of tortilla chips with each order so each appetizer is enough for me to eat 2 separate meals. It is a great deal for the money and the spinach queso warms up really well too. 

The servers have always been really nice and taken good care of us. I would definitely recommend going during happy hour and trying the spinach queso.
