This is probably my favorite Rubios location for really one main reason. The 2 girls/ladies (sorry) that work here during the lunch hour. These ladies have made it a point to remember the regulars and always be the most pleasant people around!

They always greet me by name and ask how things are and they even remember what I usually order, which is way impressive! 

I grew up in San Diego going to the first Rubios ever on the SDSU campus, I remember when I was a young kid and I hated when my parents took me to Rubio's. Now I love their Fish Tacos!
