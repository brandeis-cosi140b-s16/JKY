Pretty freakin good mex.  Think it's a notch above Senior Taco and a bit cheaper.  Good salsa.  Think the bar looks small because of how it is arranged, but still good.  My son ordered 4 hardshell tacos with nothing but lettuce and beef.   They got his order correct!  (yay) Worth the trip!  This cooking reminds me of my grandmother's style of Mexican.  There are many different types of "authentic" Mexican food, but this one has my vote, as it DEFINITELY reminds me of my Mexican grandmother's cooking.
