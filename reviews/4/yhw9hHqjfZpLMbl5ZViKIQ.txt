Friendly staff and a super clean location.

I am a huge fan of Robertos' taco shops. Love getting bean and cheese burritos, chips, breakfast burritos, and recently fell in love with chimichangas.

My only complain about the chimichangas is that some locations (this one included) will smother your burrito with guacamole and sour cream. I am not a fan of that because I want to crispness of the burrito shell. When it is smothered in something wet like sour cream, it defeats the purpose of deep frying my burrito and just makes it a soggy mess. Also, the burritos are the size of a small infant, so I need to split that meal up and it gets soggy and gross sitting in the fridge with guac sauce on it.  Easily fixed by asking for toppings on the side.
