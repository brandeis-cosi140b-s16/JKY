Los Dos Molinos doesn't know how to do mild. But if you like it hot, woweee this is your place! 

Service is slightly spotty; however, I always have a great time when going here. 

They make one mean margarita here. Had a blast with Missy F. with Dude as our DD once! 

Love their green and red salsa. Just a tip, the first bowl of chips is complimentary. After that, you get charged. 

Of the three times I've been here, only have tried the green and red chile platter with beef, and my favorite: the Machaca burrito. 

Worth paying extra for sour cream as this is melt your face off status . . . Right, Miss?! And it's big enough to share. 

It's been a long time since my last visit, and will have to drop into LDM for either dinner or drinks soon when I'm in the Tuke.
