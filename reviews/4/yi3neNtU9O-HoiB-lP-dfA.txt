Wife and I stopped in last week for a quick bite.
Great chips and salsa, fresh chips and the salsa is house-made; with good heat.
Machaca was very good, and ground beef tacos good too.
It's very clean and the Mexican food is Sonoran/AZ style. Predictable, tasty, good but not awesome. 
Lots of free parking and close to Chase Field!
