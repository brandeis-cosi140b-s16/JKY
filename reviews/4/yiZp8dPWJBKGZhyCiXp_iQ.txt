This place has some good authentic food. I like it, especially the street tacos. Every taco places are different but the same. Different flavors of spices or the way some things are made can change the taste of the food. Various tacos you get in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, or California have some distinct taste and flavor of the food. For me, this place has some good food. Like or not, try it or not, that's your opinion and your choice. I'll keep going back.
