We were starving on the way back to Las Vegas from the Hoover Dam.  I was on Yelp trying to find a place to stop and stumbled on this gem. My husband always says "4 stars and 1 Dollar Sign? I'm in." Roberto's Taco Shop did not disappoint. 

CARNE ASADA FRIES. Do it. You will have dreams about these fries. They are just that amazing. Honestly, the hubby and I ordered two combos and we both just ate on these fries.  I had the beef taco and cheese enchilada combo plate--I can't tell you anything about them (other than the rice and beans were tasty).  

The carne asada fries on the other hand----The fries were crispy, fresh, hot, and amazing and topped with a heaping pile of juicy, hot carne asada meat, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and sour cream.  I took turns with the green and red salsas for dipping.  This are insanely delicious. 

Tourists---DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP.  It's a must try on the drive between the Hoover Dam and Las Vegas. Get the fries!
