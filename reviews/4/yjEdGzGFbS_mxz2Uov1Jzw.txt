To add to what many other Yelpers said: you really can't tell what is Richardson's and what is Rokerij; the free valet is very convenient, especially considering there is basically no lot; it is extremely dark inside, so don't plan on enjoying the appearance of your food; and MAKE A RESERVATION if you want to eat in Richardson's.

That being said, we had very good service - not super attentive, but I much prefer when servers don't spend a lot of time hovering.  All our meals were correct and everything was prompt but not rushed.  We went on a Tuesday, which happens to be half price bottles of wine night, so that was a great surprise.

I ordered the Posole to start.  It was VERY spicy but delicious.  We also had the chips and guacomole, with the 3 different salsas, and that was wonderful to start.

My husband ordered the enchilada platter and his father ordered the New Mexico platter.  They both loved their food, although it was alsy very spicy (the particular green chiles in their sauce were very spicy at least).  

My mother-in-law had the skewers and it was fine.

I had the Pasta Heidi: green chili pasta with chicken and a chipotle cream sauce.  I literally could have died right then and been satisfied.  It was SO.  GOOD.  We literally can't wait to go back just so we can have the Pasta Heidi again.  My mouth is watering.  YUM.  

I would also recommend checking out the basement bar, just to have a drink.  Have your server or a hostess show you how to get down there.  It's pretty cool, and a nice place to spend some time while you wait for your table.
