This is the best Tex-Mex place we've tried in town. Plates range around $6-9 per person. The tacos and tostadas will be piled high with fresh toppings like lettuce and pico de gallo and nestled next to extra-dirty rice and beans. The chile verde soup was really spicy with rib-sticking beans and the side of blue corn cornbread was more like a triangular muffin with a hint of sweet. If you order the taco dinner plate, try it with the blue corn tortilla shell. 

I liked the variety of options such as the half-commuter - a burrito size small - and bar menu for people with smaller appetites. For example, the carne asada peque√±os tacos (three small tacos), were succulently slow cooked,  piled high with fresh toppings and queso fresco - this was the best thing we ordered. 

The location next to Hilldale is the perfect place to dine al fresco too, though the bar seats aren't bad when the restaurant and patio area get crowded on sunny evenings.
