Staff: Friendly and quirky. You can tell they care a lot about the food and check in several times to make sure everything is up to par. Might be overbearing for some food enjoyers. They are a few months in and are working to develop their brand. 

Food: Salsas are homemade and you get various options a la carte and free. Spanish Rice was flavorful but a tad too fluffy and overcooked. I don't think the rice was extra long grain which is what I believe most Mexican dishes use . Meat options were plentiful and tasty. I'd say their meat is the strongest item in terms of flavor on the menu. 


Drinks: They do have horchata but it's in a big glass server and not machine so it's not getting consistently stirred and the alcohol is literally BYOB (there's a liquor store right next door). Kinda fun and they have ice buckets and frozen glasses for you.

I would definitely come back in. This is the type of restaurant that seems to go the extra mile to get to know you and find out how they can continue developing their food!
