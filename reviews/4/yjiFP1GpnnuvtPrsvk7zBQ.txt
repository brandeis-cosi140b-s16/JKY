I eat here almost every day. The regular staff (I mainly go in the afternoons) is FANTASTIC!!!! Always friendly and helpful with anything you need! Food is also great!! I've had a few issues with the evening staff, which includes forgetting to put part of my order in my bag and having to drive all the way back and get it as well as not being overly helpful with the salsa bar, but all in all, this is one of the best El Pollo Loco's I've been to here in the PHX area.
