I had been looking forward for this spot to open and I have not been disappointed. I find the space warms and inviting and feel as though I am in a small eatery in Mexico. My husband ordered the Torta Pierna. He found it had a nice kick and was more sandwich than he was expecting, but the taste was so delightful he finished it in spite of being full. I ordered the chicken taco special. I found this dish good, but a wee bit on the bland side. I have had the single taco as well with the mole and limes. It's the first item on the menu, the name is escaping me, I apologize. But THAT is fantastic. All they need to do is spice up the food and kick it up a notch or two and this could be a nifty little gem here in the valley. OH! They have real Coke, in bottles, made with sugar! Hey, I was excited.
