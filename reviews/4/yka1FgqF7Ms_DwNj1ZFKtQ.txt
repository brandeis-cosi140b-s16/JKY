Outside looks grim, inside was clean, friendly and quite Mexican.
In the shadow of the 51, easy to get to.  My wife and I visited a relative at nearby Good Samaritan Hospital, it was a very convenient location.
We had jumbo shrimp stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon (12.50) and Shrimp & Fish fillet in Garlic Sauce (13).  Both came with salad, rice, refried beans and french fries, all on the same platter.  The fillet was fresh, cooked to perfection and delicious.  We had warm tortillas on the side.  Flan for desert, dense, sweet and filled with the tiny holes I always look for in home made flan.  Good lemonade (not too sweet) (2) and a can of soda (1.50) rounded out a filling and gratifying meal.  We will certainly return to try more of their extensive menu!
