I've been going to Julio's in Scottsdale for many years.  I love their Pollo Magnifico and their albondigas (Mexican meatball soup) is the best.  If you don't like beans and rice, they will sub salad or sauteed veggies.  It's been my experience that the servers are attentive and efficient - for a smile they will often bring free dessert!
