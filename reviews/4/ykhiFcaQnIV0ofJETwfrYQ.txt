I'll give the 'economic kitchen' a round up on a 3.5 star review. 
 I happened by this place the other day and ordered a carne asada burrito.  Usually I gripe about no free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants but I ponied up the extra dollar for some chips to enjoy at their free condiment bar.  A basket of warm tortilla chips came out a few moments later and I was lovin' life.  The salsa roja was really solid I only wish I wasn't so rushed as I would have liked to have tried the salsa verde.  The burrito was big and beefy (insert joke here) and quite tasty.  I'll definitely return to try some of their other dishes when I have the time to sit a spell!
