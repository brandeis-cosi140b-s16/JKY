Reasons Modern Margarita is amaze balls!

1) Their Margaritas are ridiculously good... fresh, delicious, and quite dangerous if consumed in high quantities during HH
 
2) I love their tacos - so much so that it wasn't too long ago that I was dared to consume their 15 taco flight, I did... Made Adam Richman from Man Vs. Food proud!

3) I still want to eat their tacos after my infamous 15 taco consumption challenge

4) Their happy hour is one of the best in town

5) Service is always spot on... Never ever have I ever had a grumpy waiter/ waitress/ bartender/ hostess... you get the point

So.... there you go my friends, 5 reasons why Modern Margarita should be on your list of places to go for Taco Tuesday, Margarita Mondays, Tequila Thursdays, Salty Saturdays, Sloppy Sundays, Fajita Fridays (so what if they don't serve Fajitas) or Wasted Wednesdays!
