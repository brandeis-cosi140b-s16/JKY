Had a great lunch here. Which made the trip to the "west-side" much more bearable :)

Large, dark, lots of big booths. Great $6.95 lunch specials, friendly service, and good quality food. Lots of old folks here (close to Sun City)... which is good, they are less dangerous than most 'westies".

I will return to "Crazy Earl's" (what their sign says) IF I ever go back to the west-side...
