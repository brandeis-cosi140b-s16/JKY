I frequently go to La Hacienda after a night out because they are open very late.  I usually order tacos de carne asada and those can be closely compared to the tacos you can find in Mexican restaurants in Chicago. On my last visit I ordered Caldo de Camaron and it had a good amount of shrimp and veggies. It was missing that spicy kick that I usually taste in most shrimp soups. Service was great for me (not sure if it's because I am a girl and all the waiters are men) but I did have a few male friends complain about the service. I am a regular at this place and I still have many more things left to try!
