When it came down to picking a lunch spot I saw El Yaqui and wanted to give it a shot... It's in this really cool open air shopping complex walk to the back and you will find El Yaqui. Walked in and the staff was really friendly they seemed to have a lot of regulars going in and out... I ordered the # 1 (3 tacos and beans and rice 1st taco Lengua   was really good 2nd taco Carne Asada was super good 3rd taco Pastor was good). Out of the three I would get the Carne Asada again really good salsa as well so this is a must stop for any fan of real deal street tacos.
