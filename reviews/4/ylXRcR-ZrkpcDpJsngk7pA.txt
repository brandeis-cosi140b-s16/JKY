The food here is  great.  Has good flavor and reminds me of my grandmas cooking.  Customer service was also good, the lady at the counter was friendly and patient while we looked at the menu and decided what we wanted.  I ordered the gordita and taco combo and everything tasted great.  My husband ordered the enchilada and taco combo.  He said this was very good.  I also ordered a champurrado and I must say that it was the best I had ever had.  The taco was good, but I have had better.  If I'm looking to only have tacos, I already have another place for that.  Since the food was so good here I know I will be returning to try other dishes.  The only thing I did not like was the way the food was served on styrofoam containers cut in half.  It just looked a little ghetto to me, and that's why they got 4 stars from me.  Also, for all the food we got and drinks, our total was $16! You can't beat that, every time I go out to dinner with my husband our total tends to be around $22.00
