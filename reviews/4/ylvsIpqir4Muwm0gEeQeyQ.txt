Figured this place could use a recent review as the last were almost a year ago. I have only been to Roberto's a few times and this was my first time visiting this particular one. We just moved in not too far away and decided to stop in on the way home from a night out. This is definitely not the most glamorous place but the guy at the register was kind and outgoing and I liked that you can see into the kitchen and watch everything that goes on. It was after 1am I believe and its one of the better non-fast food options. The breakfast burrito was huge (I actually wish they had a smaller option) and a bit heavy for a late night meal... however it was very tasty. I'm sure I'll be back now that it is so close. I always see a bunch of people there when I drive by so this location must do fairly well despite the negative reviews. Hopefully my experiences stay positive moving forward!
