Three Amigos is situated in a strip mall in a not-so-inviting stretch on Central. Despite appearances, we gritted our teeth and entered Three Amigos.

Chips and salsa: delicious
Menu: Not too extensive. I was especially wary because there's a section called "Mexican Fast Food" or something that highlights quesadillas and tacos...the enchiladas, though, are the restaurant's self-proclaimed house specialty. I went with Enchiladas al Hormo with vegetables instead of chicken or beef (**Vegetarian side note: All the enchiladas have the option of coming with veggies instead of meat. Delicious**) -- best enchiladas I've ever had.

Will definitely go again.
OH and drink specials every night. We enjoyed $2.50 Coronas.
