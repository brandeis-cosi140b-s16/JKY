So, Mexican food in Pittsburgh? Hellz yeah! Yinzerita & the 412 Burrito. 412 Burrito? Well yes, a burrito with fries and slaw in the burrito. It's Pittsburgh! We ate upstairs on the patio. Seems a bit out of place for the neighborhood. Shadyshade seems pretty gentrified to me with it's Apple Store and Microsoft Store, but then again, there's nothing fru-fru about a Yinzerita and a 412 Burrito.
