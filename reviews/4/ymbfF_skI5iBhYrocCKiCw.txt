This was just a little hole in the wall and it was fantastic!  The menu board on the wall with the photos reminded me of a take-out Chinese place which was pretty funny! I had a burrito and it was fresh and tasty.  They also seemed to have fun chatting with their regular customers which seemed to have a steady steam in while I was there.

A definite stop for an inexpensive plate of Mexican food if you are in the area
