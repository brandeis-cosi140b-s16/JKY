The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is the fact that it's pretty run down.  Apart from that, the food is consistently amazing and the staff is super friendly.  I go here for lunch probably more often than I should, but the food's so fresh I can't help it.  My favorites so far are the Chicken Enchiladas and the Tacos Adobadas.  The latter are downright revelatory!  The Beef Burrito's really good too, though!    I'm not even close to finished trying everything here, but I aim to try it all.  I've yet to introduce a friend or coworker to this place who hasn't loved it.
