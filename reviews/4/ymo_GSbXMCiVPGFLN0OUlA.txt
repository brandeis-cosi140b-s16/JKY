Two words. Emerald Chicken! I chose to have mine in a quesadilla and it was fabulous, but it also makes a mighty fine burrito! Newbs... make sure to get a lesson in ordering because it will be a bitch if you don't know what you're doing and also make sure to taste EVERYTHING they offer you. It's all so very delicious. I also really like the Jade chicken. It's not what you'd think when you hear Asian Mexican fusion... it's much better!
