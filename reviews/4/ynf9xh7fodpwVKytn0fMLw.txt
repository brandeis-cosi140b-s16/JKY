From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted by very friendly and welcoming service, the waiter took the time to ask if I had any questions about the menu and to recommend a few items. My drink order was taken very promptly and i was offered complimentary miso soup that was to die for. I decided to try a new roll tonight I went with the "Culichi Roll" the plate was very presentable and I was highly pleased with the flavor. Truly do recommend this new restaurant if your in the mood for sushi or Mexican food. Will definitely be returning with more friends :)
