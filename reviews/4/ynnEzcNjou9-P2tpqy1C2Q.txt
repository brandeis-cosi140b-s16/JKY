Let's start off by saying this joint is not your typical Filiberto's. It's an actual come in and sit down restaurant with a bar! How crazy is that..... I'm assuming some crazy mariachi music is playing on the weekends and this place gets Vida Loco! I don't have much to say really. It was empty because it was a Monday morning but the place was clean. The waitress was pleasant and checked on us a decent amount of times. I ordered my 2 Filiberto favorites - horchata and a carne Asada burro. Everything in it plus bacon, cheese and sour cream. I know.....that sounds freaking awesome! Horchata was decent, I've had better but this was way better than most. Now the burro-imagine a small child delivered to your plate. This burrito was huge and well worth the $$. Filled with everything I requested. There's only 1 Fili B's in chandler that does it right like this location does. So next time I need my Mexican fix in Scottsdale ill be making a pit stop here.
