Found this place on Yelp earlier today and decided we would try out something new for the wife and I. Menu is pretty simple (thats not a bad thing at all). Wife was a tad disappointed they didn't have any chicken enchiladas on the menu so she settled for the green chili beef. I decided to go with the green chili beef burrito enchilada style with a side of beans. We got our order to go since we had our 1 year old with us. While we waited we talked to a real nice gentleman who after a few mins we learned he was the owner of this location. Real nice guy. Wait wasnt as bad as we thought and soon we had our food and heading home. My wife wasnt a huge fan of her enchilada (but then again she is pregnant!). Me on the other hand, I was pretty happy with my burrito choice. It was a tad spicy which I didnt mind too much, flavor was great. Only down side for me was the first 3 bites I didn't get any meat...just tortilla and sauce. After that I was into the beef though I think it needed a little more beef filling for the price I paid. Refried beans with my burrito were on point. All in all I give them 4 stars. I would try them again and hope the next time around I end up with a little more beef in my burrito...if so I think i'd bump my rating up to a 4.5-5 star rating.
