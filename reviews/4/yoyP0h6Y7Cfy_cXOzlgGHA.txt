I have been here for lunch several times, but we finally went for dinner last night - it was hopping! We each had a Fresh Margarita and it was delicious - made with fresh lime and orange juice. We ordered the fajitas (one shrimp. one chicken) and the Enchilladas Suizas. The portions are HUGE and we couldn't finish it all - try as we might. (No problemo! Leftovers are another meal in the future!) It was very busy with a mix of groups of friends to families to foursomes in booths. Obviously family friendly and very noisy, but not in a bad way. Will definately be back!
