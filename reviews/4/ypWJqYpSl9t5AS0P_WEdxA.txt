The menu is extensive and is dressed in the traditional culinary garb of Cuba --they have ropa vieja, paella, tender sirloin steak, the famous Cuban sandwich, shrimp enchilada, slow-roasted juicy pork, the traditional fried cow, shrimp, and rice and chicken. All meals are accompanied by white rice and black beans, or colorados. It's a fun and a relaxed atmosphere. 

In addition the place is pretty clean, and offers live entertainment on the weekends. I couldn't stay for the live music but wished I did. Service was good. The prices are a bit high for Cuban food which is very inexpensive but that is probably due to the fact that this is the nicest Cuban restaurant in the Las Vegas area.
