Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price.
