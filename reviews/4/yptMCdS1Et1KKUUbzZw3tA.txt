This is such an upgrade over fast food chains!  

I always get the steak nachos.  I can't believe they're only $6 out the door.  There's more meat than I can eat, plus cheese & guacamole.   I did the drive thru and they gave me a few lil hot sauce/salsa's too.

I was still tasting this 10hrs later.  Gross to some, but a sign of good inexpensive mexican food.  :-)

Mmmmmm! Already looking forward to my next opportunity to eat here.
