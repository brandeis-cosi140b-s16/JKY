When I checked in here, I was a little surprised that it's average rating isn't higher. But then I realized that I always get the same thing when I eat here, so I decided to branch out. I can now confidently speak for two items on the menu.

The pros: The Carne Asada is delicious- that is what I normally get. This time I got the Avocado and Artichoke Enchiladas and I really enjoyed them too. Another reviewer mentioned liking the chips and salsa, and I agree. They give you two completely different types of salsa, and they are both really good. Also- I really like their chips. I have high expectations when it comes to chips at Mexican restaurants, and these ones are really very good. The service has always been really great while I am there, and there is a pretty nice atmosphere. Oh- I have also had their apple pie dessert- it comes out sizzling and they have cinnamon ice cream to go along with it. It's amazing! 

The cons: As some other Yelpers have said, drinks are just ok and when I am paying $10 for a margarita, I would prefer that it isn't watered down. 

Anyway, is it authentic Mexican food? No, but it is still pretty tasty. I'll keep going here, and maybe next time I will be able to review something else on the menu.
