I've been a fan of Carlsbad Tavern since the old location on Scottsdale Road, circa 1996. I like New Mexican food and have found them to be very consistent throughout the years. 

My favorite dish is the Red River Chicken. It has a kick to it and is topped with the most amazing Cilantro Pesto, yum! All of their salads & sandwiches are great and the Green Chile Mashed Potatoes are delish. My only complaint is that the Red River Chicken isn't offered on the dinner menu, really wish they would change that!

The restaurant has a nice outdoor eating area as well as cozy booths in the bar. 

With all the traditional Mexican food in the area, it's nice to have some variety and New Mexican style at Carlsbad Tavern.
