Great food! I got the chicken taco with the salsa verde and it was amazing, very flavorful and fresh. I also had the shrimp en fuego and you must eat it with the sauce -- it's sweet and spicy and so very delicious! And top off your meal with a churro dipped in their chocolate sauce! The only drawback is that there is no indoor dining space - there is a drive-thru or a walk-up window with an outdoor patio.
