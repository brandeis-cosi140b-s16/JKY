My girlfriend and I have hit Taco Shop maybe ten times since it opened. Madison is oddly lacking in quality Mexican (both high end and fast food), especially since the Guadalajara fire. Taco Shop is great for what it is, which is fast tacos and burritos. I've never had a bad experience there, including delivery. It' s not as good as Mexican in SoCal or Texas, but it's convenient and it's light years ahead of garbage like Taco Bell, obviously. Between here and Gemelos on State, I'd choose Taco Shop.
