As a treat my husband took me to Taberna for a Christmas weekend night out.  Walking through the door the colors were warm and inviting, there was someone who came to seat us right away. They asked several times if we had a reservation, we did not.  Any size group can dine here, inside or out, great tables, chairs even sofas to sit with friends and have a drink and a small plate. They provide complimentary chips and salsa. I had the Carne Asada Rib Eye and he had the Chicken and mushroom quesadilla. We shared the plablano potatoes and I enjoyed their lusious sangria. Topping it all of with the tres leches cake,with a nice flambe marshmallow topping; the cake sealed the deal we will be back.
