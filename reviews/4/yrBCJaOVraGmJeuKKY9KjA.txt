Dos Reales offers tasty non-authentic Mexican food. I get the Enchiladas Supremas combo every time. I don't know whether the cheesy enchilada sauce is real cheese or not, but it tastes delicious.

At Dos Reales, you get your food within six minutes, the portions are large and consistent, and the food prices are ridiculously cheap. Dos Reales is NOT romantic, doesn't offer authentic Mexican food, and probably uses cheap ingredients. For me, that is perfect, because I don't go there on dates, I like non-authentic Mexican food, and I don't expect high quality for $7.50. That said, I always enjoy my meal.

Among the majority of mediocre restaurants located in the UIUC campus area, Dos Reales stands out as being great.
