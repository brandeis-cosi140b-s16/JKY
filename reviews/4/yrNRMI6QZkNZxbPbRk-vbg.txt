Ola!  Please be seated amigos and...amig-etts.  The side effect of the great food here is me, all of the sudden, thinking that I can speak Spanish.  I love making up words while drinking a one gallon margarita and stuffing my face full of tamales, guacamole (made fresh in front of you), and saucy satisfaction.  This is the best Mexican food I have found thus far in my short tenure in Charlotte.  I have been here almost ten times and I haven't had a bad experience so far.  Now, I don't order the combo dishes, I typically get something like Pulpo, or some chicken, seafood, or meat dish - reliable broad spectrum quality.  I am getting excited about my next visit just writing this.  I envision my next entrance with me bobbling up on a donkey as I rock out a poncho with sombrero and sunglasses with a fork in a napkin sheath.  Don Quixote can inspire.  More re-fried beans please.
