Interesting concept. I was genuinely impressed by this place. I ordered the lunch steak quesadillas and they were pretty good. 

What stood out from me was the level of service by our waitress. She knew just about everything i asked her and she was very attentive to my needs. 5 stars for her. 

My 1511 margarita with herradura tequila was average at best. It was way too sour for my taste. 

This place is much more expensive than most mexican restaurants. $17 for steak fajitas seems a little overkill for me. Overall though not a bad place.
