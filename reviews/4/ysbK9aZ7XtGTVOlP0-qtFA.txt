Stopped in last Saturday night for a late dinner. Was pleased to sit out on the nice patio. Enjoyed some live music and a pitcher of red sangria. Delicious. The service was spot on for sure. As soon as we were seated, we received water, fresh/tasty chips and a verde salsa. The waitress was very attentive but not overbearing.

My hubster ordered beef lazy tacos and I had the waitress surprise me with anything off the gluten free menu (except salmon). The tacos, per my husband were delicious. I received chorizo stuffed chicken. It was fabulous. I would have liked a little more spice in the sauce and more excitement in the grilled veggies, but otherwise for a gluten free meal - amazing. There were a lot of gluten free options. I was very grateful for the menu and the knowledge of the staff.
