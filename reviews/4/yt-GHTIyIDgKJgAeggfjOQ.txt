Every time I have come here I always get my order correct, a delicious tostada salad, more than decent service, and a $2 coupon for doing a survey on my receipt. The wait time is a little longer than desirable but for fresh, hot food this is completely acceptable. Their salsa bar is always well stocked and clean, and I just can't get enough of their black salsa. It's not spicy, it's just so good! I have not been able to tear myself away from the tostada salad yet but a few other things on the menu look good.

Honestly I am somewhat snobby about authentic Mexican food. This is not authentic, but it's still very tasty and that more than makes up for that. Also they have plentiful outdoor seating unlike other Bajas I have been to.
