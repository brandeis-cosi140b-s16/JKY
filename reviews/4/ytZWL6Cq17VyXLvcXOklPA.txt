The atmosphere is kitchzy but every time I have stopped in, it appears clean. The food has always been fresh and of a high standard of quality. Their perpetual 'special' of fish tacos is served with an unexpected and lovely flourish of shredded salad items. However, only four stars because of the pricing. So, I recommend getting a combination plate instead of a burrito. Pricing for a business is based on many things, overhead (rent, utilities), labor costs, supplies (staples, food items), etc and only the owner/management knows their needs to meet their ends so I can't say whether something is overpriced. However, I have found that the price for their burritos far exceeds the price for value of their meals. You pay for convenience at this establishment.
