Tasty and authentic.

I go to Los Gemelos every now and then for a quick, inexpensive lunch. They have a good menu of favorites, as well as more unique items (well, unique to Americanized Mexican restaurants). 

The pastor tacos are delicious-- flavorful pork garnished with cilantro and onions on corn tortillas.

Quesadillas here are not your typical flour tortilla with shredded jack cheese. No, these are handmade cornmeal pockets stuffed with fresh queso, lettuce and your choice of meat. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside!

They have tamales on the weekends, but sometimes they have leftovers that they sell early in the week. They're really good, so try to catch one sometime.

Their guacamole is mild, but flavorful from all the cilantro they use. Still, I wish it could be spiced up with some jalape√±os!

Chips are average. Sometimes they are stale, sometimes you get lucky and get really fresh ones!

I like their assortment of beverages-- fountain and bottled Coke products, Jarritos, and horchata, among others.
