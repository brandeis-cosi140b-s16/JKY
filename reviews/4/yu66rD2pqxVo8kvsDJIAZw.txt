Went here for the first time based on the yelp reviews, was looking for a good local mexican place to satisfy my mexican food craving. The restaurant is in a small strip mall, and has a small authentic vibe. The two waitresses were very nice, and took our drink order immediately. I got the wet chicken burrito, and my boyfriend got 3 tacos and guacamole. Just as a tip, the guac is basic without any tomatoes, onions, or peppers in it, but still very good. The wet burrito has amazing, I only ate about half and was full. My boyfriend enjoyed his tacos very much. The prices cannot be beat either! The only grip I have is after the waitress took our plates away, she didn't bring the check or instruct us how to pay. We sat there for about 10 minutes then finally asked about it, and you have to go to the register at the front to get your check and pay. Not a huge deal, just would have been nice to be told that.

Overall good experience with authentic mexican food!
