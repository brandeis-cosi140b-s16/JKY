I had heard a lot of buz about this place and the food was just okay. I has the carne asada and was terribly disappointed. I've had a lot of carne asadas in my time and never has been so fatty. The reason for the 4  rating is because of the staff. My waitress Dee was awesome and informative and very accommodating. I will try again.
