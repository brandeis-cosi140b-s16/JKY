I've eaten here a few times recently, mostly because of some deals via an iPhone app. It's been really delicious!

I've had their tacos several times, and they really do hit the spot. The chicken and chorizo tacos are probably  my favorite, but the steak is fine too. The chips that are placed on your table are good, as is the salsa.

Their patio is very nice, with a good amount of seating available. A nice spot to sit and eat tacos, maybe have a couple beers. Even without any sort of promotion, the prices are decent. 

Also, the staff at Francisco's is great! Very friendly folks, who are attentive and simply do a great job.
