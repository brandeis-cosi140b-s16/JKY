Place was easily the best part of the Monte Carlo resort. My wife and I enjoyed 44oz margaritas and we split the fish tacos, street tacos and steak tacos. The street and steak were really good but the fish tacos were a total mess of no flavor and mayo. Our server was really good and I'm a total sucker for a place with a bathroom attendant.
