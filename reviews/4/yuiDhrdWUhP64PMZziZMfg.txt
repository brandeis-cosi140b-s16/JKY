Went there today for a quick bite and it was pretty decent. I ordered the carnitas burrito and my two friends ordered breakfast burritos: one with chorizo and one with bacon. Both looked quite good. We didn't leave with any leftovers so that pretty much sums it up. 

It would be a good hangover spot for sure.
