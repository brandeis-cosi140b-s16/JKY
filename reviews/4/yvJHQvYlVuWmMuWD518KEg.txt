This place is awesome! Went here on a date with my husband because a friend recommended it. It's spacious, has lots of room for many guests and parties. The decor is nice and reminds me of the authentic Mexican restaurants from my home town. Usually I'm very disappointed in the "authentic" Mexican restaurants I've found in North Carolina. The flavor is usually bland and leaves me craving much better food. This place... We ordered one of their large platters and I was SO happy to find that their food tasted amazing! The shrimp, the chicken, the steak, all so good and cooked perfectly. The service was good but the only thing is they forgot a small dish of received beans, they were happy to bring it to me once I brought it to their attention, only reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There was also a cute little boy who would come up to our table and ask us if we wanted any more food, if the service was good, you can tell he wants to serve the family business well :) I recommend this place to everyone! You will definitely enjoy the food and the great customer service!
