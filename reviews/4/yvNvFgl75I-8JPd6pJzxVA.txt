Ordered the Carne Asada fries and some shredded beef tacos. Delicious! The shredded beef was tender and tasty, and they didn't skimp on the shredded cheese, either. The fries were loaded with goodness and it was a large portion; I shared with my fiance and gave him one of my tacos, more than enough for both of us. So happy to come back here (although it's a different location than the one I used to visit). 

Will probably be coming back for the taquitos and the classic bean and cheese burritos, my late night favorites from times long past. Love it!
