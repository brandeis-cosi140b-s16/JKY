Never Disappoints 

With so many Mexican Food Restaurants do any really stand out above the rest?  If you have to ask that question then you have never been to Raul and Teresa's.

The West Valley has had its share of good Mexican restaurants.  So what makes Raul and Theresa's stand out? For starters, it's not the typical version of Mexican food drowned in sauce,  rice, and heavy beans. The dishes at Raul and Theresa's are excellent. The entrees are flavorful, served hot, and plated perfectly. Today, I had the taco and enchilada lunch combo and it was delicious.

Raul and Theresa's has two locations, one on Litchfield Road and the original location off of M-85 ( I prefer the M-85 location).  

Raul and Theresa's has a very relaxed atmosphere, plenty of room for large parties, and is kid friendly.  The service and food  is absolutely wonderful. If your in the area and hungry for Mexican Food stop by Raul a d Theresa's  you will not be disappointed.
