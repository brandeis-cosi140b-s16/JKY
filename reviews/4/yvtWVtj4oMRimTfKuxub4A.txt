We first dined here 2+ years ago, after moving to the area. We were not impressed and did not come back for a good 6 months to a year, when we decided to give it another shot. I believe they had a management change, and the food was much better this time. The prices are very reasonable for the portions you receive, and it's even better when we have a Groupon or Entertainment Guide coupon! The one complaint I have is that the waitress we tend to get each time is nice, but very slow on her service (receiving the food, refills, check, etc.).
