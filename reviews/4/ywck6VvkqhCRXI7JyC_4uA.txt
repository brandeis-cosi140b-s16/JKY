Drove from the Strip to eat here. Worth the drive. We could eat here again and again and never try all the wonderful food. We took food home with us because we had to much. Will Korean Nachos be good after driving 4 hours to California? Guess we will see. At least we'll have food if traffic is slow getting back to LA area. Oops spoke to soon, traffic just stopped on the 15 and were nor even to the stateliness. [Nachos may not make it to CA]
