This Rubios location is the best around. The manager is great and very involved in the daily activities. Beyond that the food is excellent. I love love love the gourmet steak taco plate as well as the mango habenero  fish taco which is tasty as well. Your going to pay between $8 - $11 for a full plated meal. Not the least expensive by any means, but its fresh and the service is great!
