So good! We visit Juan's at least once a month. We usually order combo plates because I like to try a little bit of everything, but right now I am so in love with their chile rellenos! Perfect melty cheese in a flavorful chile---I feel like I could eat 20! Lack of a star is only because a couple times shrimp fajitas were ordered by someone in my group, and there were very few shrimp both times. But otherwise a great place!
