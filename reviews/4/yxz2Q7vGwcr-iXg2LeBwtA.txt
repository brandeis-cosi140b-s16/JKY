Queso dip was quite tasty and a very generous portion for the price.  Some excellent beers here - maybe 7 or 8 craft taps, and a good bottle list.  They also have a Whisky Book, Tequila Book, and more.  Bartender was a sub, or so she said, and holy Moses she was clueless.  

Cool atmosphere with the outdoor seating.  One of the chefs was very nice too, Matt?  Anyway, good restaurant, and a rather undiscovered place for happy hours... at least in late August.
