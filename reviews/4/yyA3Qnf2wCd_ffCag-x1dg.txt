I was here with a group that took over the entire patio on a beautiful spring day for brunch.  They even had to bring out more chairs as our group grew to about 10. Most of us had breakfast, I had lunch and some had combinations of both. They supposedly don't do gluten free but the one in our party whom it mattered to they worked with to change some ingredients around.  This is not gourmet food.  But it is well cooked basic stuff, and easy on the pocket book. With a large group somebody is bound to have a food complaint, every plate was cleaned. All the staff we dealt with were pleasant.  So maybe the neighborhood is not where you would expect to find good food at a good price but I would not hesitate to go here again.
