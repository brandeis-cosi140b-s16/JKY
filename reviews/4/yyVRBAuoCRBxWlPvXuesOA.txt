They have a vegan menu!

I was surprised with how good the chile rellenos were. I got them with gardein 'beef' tips. 

It's nice to find a place you can take the whole family and everyone's happy.

My only complaint is that I paid $12 for a strawberry margarita and it had no discernible alcohol in it. I tried to flag down a waiter to make sure they hadn't brought me a virgin by mistake, but the place was too busy and I never saw them again. So there's that.

I will be going back and bringing family, maybe at less crazy hours.
