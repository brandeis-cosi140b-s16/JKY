I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Panchero's as I am from Iowa City, home of the original Panchero's location. It is a staple in downtown Iowa City nightlife; there's really nothing better than a ginormous messy burrito at 2am after a night of drinking.

I don't visit this store as often as I should. Their burritos are far superior to Chipotle in my opinion. The fresh pressed tortillas are super yummy. My go to burrito entails chicken, rice, queso (which carries an up charge but it is SO worth it!), cheese, sour cream, pico and mild sauce. Yes, this is my haven for feeding my inner fat kid ;) 

I think Panchero's is very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get. Today I got a burrito, small fountain drink, and a side of chips and guac for $12 and some change.

Be warned - the burritos are massive! I dare you to eat the whole thing in one sitting.
