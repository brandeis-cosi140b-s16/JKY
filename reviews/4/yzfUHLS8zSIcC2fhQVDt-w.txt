I've tried a lot of Mexican food from different places since I moved to Arizona and the food has been good but this place was really good! There's something different about Tortas el Rey's food that makes it extra yummy and authentic. I had the shrimp burrito and it was so delicious. Their rice was also spicy and flavorful. I highly recommend this place.
