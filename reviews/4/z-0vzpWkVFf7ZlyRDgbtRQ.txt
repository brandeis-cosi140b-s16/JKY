The sonoran hotdog was love at first bite. I want to try every taco, but only tried the carne asada one and it was pure enjoyment. The quality of meat was juicy and tender. I loved the atmosphere of the place, the local artwork on the walls, and the location. Not far from my work, so me and my coworkers go for lunch and it's quick enough service. I will have to come back on a Friday after work to try their margaritas because they look tasty. Overall cool place, delicious food! Oh, and accessible parking right by the building.
