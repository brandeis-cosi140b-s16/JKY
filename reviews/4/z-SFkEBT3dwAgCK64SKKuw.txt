I enjoyed the taco stand over near downtown so I was excited to go to a sitdown that was in a more convenient location for me to stop on the way home. 

My first experience was so-so but I came near closing and the pastor wasn't as good as it could be, but still decent. 

Came again in the middle of the day, and it was much, much better flavor and texture of the pastor. We also tried cabeza tacos which were pretty decent fine chop that wasnt too fatty.I also got a small "plato de birria" which isn't so much a plate as a bowl of a soup broth with birria in it, plate of onions, cilantro and lime and tortillas on the side. It would have been better if the broth wasn't close to room temperature and was actually hot. I think I'll stick to tacos. 

To sweeten the deal, Wednesday is 2 for 1 on pastor tacos - all day. It's not advertised anywhere I stumbled upon it. 

The thing that makes it a great spot to stop is the staff is really nice. They've been friendly even when it's near closing and they insist we stay and eat than do to-go. I also like the ordering and paying system way better. I am glad that despite their setup being for those "express lines" they nixed it so you can have all hot food, at once. 

There's some hiccups to be improved on with consistency, but so far to get some quick tacos in a indoor setup open til late, I am a fan.
