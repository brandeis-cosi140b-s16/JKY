This review is for a call in breakfast burrito take out. Had to wait a few minutes on hold for someone to take my order. Order was kind of long and I had a couple special requests. Person on phone not only understood me but I could also understand them. (thank you) Was very accomadating and the order was correct when picked up. Order was ready when my wife arrived and the burritos were pretty darn good. First time here for all in our party and everyone was happy with the food. Ready to go back and try some more of this place.
