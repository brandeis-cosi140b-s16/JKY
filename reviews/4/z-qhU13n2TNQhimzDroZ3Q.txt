a stop over while riding the bikes home. we remembered their drinks and cheap tacos. not disappointed in either. we got what we came for. 

fish tacos...tiny bit of grilled bits of fish, but when you're drankin, it all tastes fine. what we really came for was the beer-rita's. we both had a sun devil beer-rita...a giant margarita glass, a pony corona with a few drops of grenadine and voila! gold and red, gold and red! 

no wonder college kids love this area!
