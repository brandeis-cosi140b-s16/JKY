Good "American" style Mexican food. I say that because there isn't the Hispanic music or even chips and salsa. BUT our food was great with large portions and yummy sauces.  I had the chicken flautas and my husband had the chimichanga.  (See picture)

Our server, Shajuan, was very attentive and helped with recommendations from the menu.  

The atmosphere was lively without being too loud.  We ate outside next to the water fountain outside if the Flamingo hotel. 

I would recommend this to anyone.
