So I've been here twice now. I find their food to be like home cooked Mexican food.....with love. I saw someone complain about smell, WHAT? Haven't noticed any unpleasant smells at all. The menu selection is fantastic and so are the prices, just what they should be. Hope they don't raise them now that I've said this lol. Mexican food shouldn't be expensive to be good and this place proves that. Great selection at the salsa bar too. Has definitely become my go to for Mexican food. Thanks to all the Yelpers out there, this is my primary source to find good places to eat. Of course it's not always right what some say, so those of you that make reviews, try to be honest without being nasty.
