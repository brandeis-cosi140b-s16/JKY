Very good tacos - I can see why drunk folks flock there late nights - I just hiked the Camelback and was starving, pulled up yelp and found the highest rated but 1 $ cheap food - Wadaa's hit the spot.  Was a bit surprised not to see a fish or shrimp taco, as those are my absolute favorite (coulda been 5 star!), but once I saw they cook the steak and chicken over an open wood fire - ok I get it.  I always go for corn tortillas if they offer it, and these were good.  I'll be back next time in Scottsdale fo sho.
