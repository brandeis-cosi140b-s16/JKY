I really enjoy Cuzamil.  The service is always fast and friendly and their portions (in general) are pretty big.   My only criticism would be the missing meat.  As I said, the portions are big, but if you open up the tortillas, you can see the severe lack of actual meat contained within.  Overall, I think they are really trying and they have improved each of the three time I've gone over the past year or so.  I'd say if you're skeptical, wait for the inevitable Groupon (they do them a lot) and use that to at least give them a chance.
