I remember coming here a couple months ago. It was my first time here, didn't know what to get. It's kinda like Chipotle but better. I got the carnitas salad. It was sooo good, the meat was tasty flavorful and soft, shredded too! Love that. Good for those on slow carb diet! 

We happen to be there while the owner was there. We asked them about catering, they said they would be happy to do it, just need at least a few hours noticed, they said they' be able to make it happen even if it was called last minute. Glad to hear that, I always love and appreciate people that will do whatever it takes and will go above and beyond what is required. 

Kinda disappointed I didn't get one of the brownies on the counter! :( only con, but that was my fault... i forgot.
