Let me just start by saying the queso.....mmmmm! One could possibly just drink it right from the cup. I also enjoy it when the staff serenades you when you walk in the door and when you leave a tip :-). I enjoy the Art Vandalay. It's full of veggies. There is a new spicy guacamole they just introduced and it's pretty good. They also cater, which would be a lot of fun for those summer fiestas you wanna have!
