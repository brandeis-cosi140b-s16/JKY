Came here on a whim while visiting Scottsdale on business - it's close to Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West which I visited that afternoon.  My server, Nick, was very helpful in recommending menu options - I don't eat red meat, ended up with seafood enchiladas which are very good, but a large portion - don't come here if you aren't hungry!  Good local beer on tap and also, on request, they'll mix up some special spicy salsa for your chips.
