Pros:
~This place is known for their carne asada, but for me, the main attraction is that it's one of the only places where you can get authentic al pastor tacos in the metropolitan Phoenix area. And HOMBRE are they good! 
~Their beans are amazing, too, elevating a simple bean and cheese burrito to a whole new level in flavor! 
~ America's corn is divine as well.

The cons: 
~ The portions are too small for the price. By the time you order enough food to fill up, you've blown your lunch budget for the next couple of days. Don't even bother ordering the happy hour dollar-sized street tacos. They meant to call them "silver dollar tacos" because the tortilla is the size of a silver dollar coin, making the taco only two bites at most. You have to order a dozen to make it a meal, and then it's no longer a deal. 
~ The Tempe location is way too small during the warm months when it's too hot to sit outside, and the inside does have 'hole in the wall' unpleasant smell. 

Despite these flaws (which is why I cannot give ATS 5 stars), I cannot stay away for long. The pastor tacos call to me in my sleep and give me uncontrollable cravings that I give in to at least a time or two a month. So worth it!
