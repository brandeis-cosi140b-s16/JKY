I was in a rush again! Didn't really want to stop off here, but I am really glad I did! I ordered their grilled steak burrito. OMG!!!! Man that was good! grilled steak, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, and guacamole. This is a big burrito, and I managed to handle this all by myself! The steak of course is carne' asada, and it is marinated to perfection. Again, glad I came back and gave them another chance!
