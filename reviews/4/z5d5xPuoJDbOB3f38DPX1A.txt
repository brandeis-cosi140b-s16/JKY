They took my Salsa's away and made me really upset, but it was replaced not too long ago with Mi Pueblo.  The place is absolutely beautiful it use to be an Italian restaurant, any who it's really nice.  I drive by it often and decided to stop in this past Satruday because I had a taste for some Mexican food.  For some reason I always ordered the same foods when going to Mexican restaurants for some reason it just works for me to eat something familiar.  Any who, so that's what I did, well it didn't turn out like I thought it was going to.  It was really salty, but good if you can imagine.  But it was hard to eat because of the salt, and since I ordered it to go I didn't take it back.  I just desided to throw it away and eat the banana split I couldn't wait to eat.  Well I'm not sure why it tasted the way it did, but the ice cream was good the banana's were awful.  The staff were amazing people, very nice and friendly people the place is beautiful just didn't do too good with the food.  But I will give them another chance and go back soon to see if it's better to eat in.
