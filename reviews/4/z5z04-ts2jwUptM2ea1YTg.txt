Tried this place purely by Yelp Reviews and location. 

Wanted something different for breakfast so wanted to try the chorizo breakfast burrito for $3.00.

When I went to pick up the burrito,  they had a selection of home made salsas so I tried a few and when I got home to open the bag the owner placed 2 burritos in the bag.

Was a great surprise! 

The burrito was of normal size and not of one of the xxxbertos or chipotle. Pretty good mix of eggs chorizo and potatoes. 

Not a fancy place but good food at a inexpensive price.

Will co.e back to try other items.
