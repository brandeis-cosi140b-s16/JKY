I really liked this place.
The drinks (they have lo cal drinks for us ladies counting calories), the foods (some sushi rolls, tacos, etc), and the atmosphere were excellent!

I did hope that the pool would be open at nighttime, so I could see some drunken pool antics, but it closes at 6pm.  

Will be back many times I'm sure...
