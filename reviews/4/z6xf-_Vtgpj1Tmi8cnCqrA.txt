I am the Duke of Chipotle.  Bow to me.

I like this location a lot.  The food is, of course, Chipotleish.  The service helps set it apart.  The crew is fast and incredibly attentive.  I have had several of the prep guys look at the ingredients, decide they weren't fresh enough, and get new for me.

Fine place to stop in for a burrito.  Outside of that, it's Chipotle- you just know you can't go wrong.
