I have visited here many times and find it a great place when I am craving some Mexican food. The place is open 24hr and the food is consistently decent for the price and the portion. They also serve fresh in house made tortillas like most Mexican places do these days.

I visited this location on a friends recommendation and because I had a coupon and I also wanted some home style Mexican food and not some del taco. The location was semi hard to find since its kinda of not visible from the 215 exit but once you know its right next to the gas station you cant miss it.

The restaurant itself is clean and very roomy they offer booths and table seating. Their menu offers some pretty standard Mexican dish's with good explications of what you will receive. If you are unsure about portions ask the server and they will be happy to tell you portion sizes. Once we took out booth and ordered our drinks the complimentary chips and salsa came out fresh and tasty. After a short wait of maybe 5-10 minutes all of our food came out. The portions where exactly as explained by the server so it was no surprise there. Overall the food here is good and not overly greasy like a lot of Mexican food can be. I would recommend it to anyone craving some sit down food any time of the day. Last time I visited I noticed they have a lunch special menu as well which is very reasonably priced.

I usually end up orders the SuperMex Burrito covered in read sauce. Its a kinda big burrito but if you can eat a lot like me I would give it a go!
