1st trip there a few months ago I was very disappointed.  Food was cold, order was wrong and while leaving I just had a feeling I got jobed and the crew had messed up.  Tried it again today because recommendations were so good.  I must say, service was very good, food was fantastic and the order was correct this time..hah..very reasonable prices and food is cooked fresh.  I/we will be going back again for sure.  I must say there tacos are a bit on the skimpy side but very tasty.  The pollo fundido is fantastic.
