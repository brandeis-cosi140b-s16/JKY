Had lunch at Bea's today. I've past this place up too many times because every time I thought of doing lunch here,  the line seemed incredibly long. There was a bit of a line today but not quite as bad as other times I've walked past (must have been the cold weather that kept some away today). 

I ordered a ground beef taco and a chorizo taco. Wasn't disappointed at all. The ingredients were super fresh! And just two tacos filled me up nicely for lunch. I will definitely go back, even if the line is long, and I recommend the place to anyone who likes authentic Mexican food.
