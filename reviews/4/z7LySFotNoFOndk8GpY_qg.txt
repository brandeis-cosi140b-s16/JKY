I think it's genius that this place is literally right next to a 24 hour; famous, strip club. The food was definitely high quality, which I always appreciate. Our waitress who was also our bar side guacamole maker was very knowledgeable about this restaurant and even gave us information we never knew about, which is always a plus because we're locals. And we love to eat!  25% off of menu for locals on Mondays. Yes, all day! Another plus about this place is that they were able to accommodate my vegan diet. The manager even stated, " I'll make the whole thing vegan, even the rice. It will be with brown rice instead, because our cilantro rice has butter."  I love it! My veggie burrito made vegan was ok. I didn't like that it had big chunks of squash and zucchini, it kinda over powered the burrito. But I ate half  
I don't think I saw a vegan selection for desert. But don't quote me to that because I don't recall looking thoroughly. Overall; yes, I would come here again, maybe this Monday
