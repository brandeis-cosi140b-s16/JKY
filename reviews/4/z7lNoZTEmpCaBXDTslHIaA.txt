Man i've been coming here since i was 9 years old and it has never disappointed. The salsa is so freakin good and their daily specials for lunch and dinner are perfectly priced. 

I've had everything on this menu at least once, my favorite things are enchiladas, pollo con crema and the shrimp burritos washed down with their authentic horchata. 

Skip the margaritas, they don't put enough liquor in em.
