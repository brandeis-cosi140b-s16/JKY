I ate here for the first time for lunch today. We went in around 2:30pm and the place was dead. We were sat quickly. It took a while for us to be greeted and after waiting for 5 minutes the bartender finally came over to help us. We received super yummy chips and salsa to start off with. I ordered the fish tacos and they were by far some of the best fish tacos I have ever had. I wish they had come with rice and beans or something but it was definitely enough food. Our server was cute and filled my iced tea several times without me asking. I'd definitely eat here again. It looks like a cute place to take a date!
