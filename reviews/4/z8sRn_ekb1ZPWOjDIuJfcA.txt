Well I read it all and it caught my interest so here I am. Like they say don't judge a book by its cover as you see this is a definitely hole in the wall but a gem none the less. 
Debit/Credit cards are excepted but they will add a 50 cent charge FYI.
So I had the taco trio well 5 tacos 6.95+ tax also 10 cents for guacamole worth it. They were indeed very good (asada,pastor,pollo,carnitas) yummmers
I recommend you try it if your in the area and as always be kind n enjoy!!
