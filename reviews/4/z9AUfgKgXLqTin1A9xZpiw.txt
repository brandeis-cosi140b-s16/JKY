one of the only safe havens on mill from the rampant and ferocious packs of yuppies, d-bags, greek life and all other forms of undesireables that frequent that short strip of put on commerce. My hatred for mill avenue aside; Hippie's Cove is a decent spot. 
The new owners are pretty decent people that treat you right and have always done good by me; once drinking on their front stoop a disgusting little flying rat of a pigeon happened to shit smack dab into my pitcher of brew! incredulous i stared at the white gob of feces floating in my beer, as a street tramp chuckled and said it was 'good fortune to have a bird shit on you.' "well he didnt shit ON me rather in my beer!" i said exasperated, so i walk inside and show the owners son (methinks) and he laughs and gives me a free pitcher on the house! good man.
  The food is generic chipotle/qdoba-esque mexican digs: not bad tasting and healthily proportioned but "run of the mill". My main reason for coming here is some cheap munchies, and the ice cold PBR on tap. no where else on mill ave (at least the short stip along campus), as far as i know, offers my favorite hillbilly hipster beer on tap, hell even the sail inn doesnt have Pabst on tap!  
all in all if your on mill for whatever reason, avoid the trash and duck in here, you wont be disappointed!
