Went back yesterday for some lunch with the wife and pops.
I was honestly let down at how the place has changed.
-The original owners aren't running the place or cooking, the staff aren't even the same.  You just don't get that warm and inviting feeling when you walk in.  The gentleman at the front doesn't seem to appreciate busy business; he likes it slow.  The service definitely changed; Linda was always on top of her game, I don't think these people have the same drive and motivation as they did.
-The food didn't taste the same either.  What can I say; I love Sonny's cooking.  If you gave me 50 plates of the same dish and sonny cooked one of them; I could tell you which one was Sonny's.
I think I'll be going to their new location from now on; which I heard has awesome specials that you can't get here.
My food was still very good this visit, but just wasn't the same; I'll miss the ole' place.
