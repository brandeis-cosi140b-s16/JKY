Oh Pupusa, how I love thee.

There's just something about pupusas topped with tomato sauce and curtido. The warm corn masa with the melty goodness inside, paired with the little heat offered from the tomato sauce and the bite of crunchiness &  sour and vinegar from the curtido.

It's the perfect blend of flavors, the perfect bite of soft, to crunchy, to hot and cold all in my mouthful.

This place makes all their stuff fresh, so be sure to not come here when you are on a time constraint.  I don't mind waiting for my food when I know I getting fresh, piping hot goodness.

If you want this for a timed lunch, then it is best to call ahead and pick up your order. 

For those that don't know curtido is a picked cabbage slaw. Pupusas are masa stuffed with your filling (bean, cheese, chicharron, squash or whatever your favorite combo). I highly suggest the squash and cheese or chicacharron and cheese).

If you are in need of a good pupusa or looking to try somewhere new this is definitely a must try. 

Just a helpful note, I always do better ordering my food when I  bring someone with me that speaks Spanish. I don't know if it is because I look hispanic and people do not believe when I say I don't speak Spanish or what.
