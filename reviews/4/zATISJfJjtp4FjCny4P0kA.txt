As the (seemingly) only restaurant open on the East Side after 9-10p; LaBamba's has become something of a staple for me, which is cool, since they have good cheap ($.99 beef tacos on Tue/Sat), fresh  authentic (for Madison, WI...) food made how I like it. The Staff are very friendly, they now know me by face since I've been stopping there so often. There's no drive thru, but the service is good enough that I've never been in/out in more than 5min. They have a pretty large menu, all of it made to order for you. As of this posting I've not been able to confirm the burrito/head claim as per the motto, will update if I'm able. 
The cons: The size of the tacos is relatively small (think street-food snack-handheld... or just buy one, you'll see), so get like 3. The access to this location is via the EW service road, which though 'paved' is one of the worst roads easily I've seen, even by madtown standards. So expect 30s of bumpy ride & testing your car's suspension sys. Its not the place's fault, in fact their lot is nice and well-maintaned; just thought id give a heads up. 
My personal recommendations are the tacos al pastor w/ cilantro, onions, and a cup of their horchatta, which isn't over-rich like I've had at some places. Also they stay open late (THANK YOU, at least one place gets it, lets start a movement here people!), nice variety of Jarritos bottles if you want something other than the fountain, They'll include hot sauce & limes if you want & the staff are great at helping if you're trying to learn some Spanish. Look for coupons sometimes in the monthly savings mailers. But if your by east towne and quiznos or KFC is closed and need something quick, cheap, and yum, stop by LaBambas.
