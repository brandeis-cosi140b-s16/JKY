Dining amidst anguished skeletons.  No, not our wizened elders who lost too much at video poker but rather huge unnerving bas reliefs prominently displayed in the unique dining space.  It sets the tone for an interesting meal.

This is not street food.  Mexican by design but SoCal in cuisine.  Outstanding ingredients create pumped up, exciting, familiar flavors unattainable in Mexico (Dungeness crab, Maine lobster, day boat scallops).  Get it?

Straight to it, the "Cabo Azul" is delicious and the best way to sample multiple seafood dishes.  (1) incredible, perfectly cooked, sweet Maine lobster enchilada enveloped in a creamy, slightly spicy pasilla pepper sauce.  (1) grilled relleno stuffed full with cheese, shrimp and Dungeness crab in a light, earthy, relleno sauce.  (1) outstanding Ensenada style shrimp taco in a lightly crisp, grilled flour tortilla.  All three plus the usual sides..  The beauty of it all, the flavors mix and match making it one great plate of food.

For scallop lovers, the "Callitos Mazatlan".  Pan seared in a creamy, chipotle sauce.  The mild chili flavor and heat accentuates the sweetness of the scallop while the rich cream, the oceanic flavor.  

Great surf and turf options.  The "Filete Costeno" marries a prime, cooked to temperature filet with a Dungeness crab enchilada (in cream sauce), and cotija / jack cheese stuffed chilies.  The flavors combine so well, you're almost tempted to cut everything into bite size pieces and mix it up.  Almost.

Vast selection of tequila.  Ordering a call margarita can be daunting.  Better to just enjoy a snifter of the best after dinner (yes, it's serious quality tequila).

Efficient and friendly service.

Prices?  Lets just say they serve complimentary, fresh, warm chips to accompany house made salsas.  It's Vegas baby!
