What a surprise of food and flavor. I got the jade red chicken along with diablo chicken along with pork rice while my wife got a pork quesadilla with rice and beans. The beans and rice were fabulous. I just had visions of floating the salt river all morning, then returning home tired, burned, and buzzed looking to kill any food in my sights.  Turns out all these years of running home and eating Ramiro's or Chinese was a waste. I could have had both and died happy. All capped off by a wonderful snicker doodle and the bill for 18 bucks!!!!!  I'm a happy customer who will return.
