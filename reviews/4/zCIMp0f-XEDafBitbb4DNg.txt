No fuss. Asian fusion. Comfort food. Fast. 

My fianc√© and I decided to try this place out after having this place bookmarked for quite some time. We came in around 3pm and we got seated right away. We ordered the bulgogi fries, kimchi fried rice with pork and combo plate of bulgogi and spicy pork.We also got the free chips and salsa/guacamole. While we were devouring the chips, we decided to try the 4 different hot sauces that they have. One really stood out, it was like a combination of salsa and the Korean chili sauce, super yummy! 

When the food came out, we killed them all fairly quickly. We were already starving by the time we came in. Kimchi fried rice was definitely the star out if the things we ordered. It was very flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness. The combo plate was just ok and a tad on the dry side. Bulgogi fries was pretty good, especially with the awesome spicy sauce added to it. We ordered all small sizes because we know that we won't be able to eat all of them in full sizes. The overall experience was good, the server was nice and the food came out pretty quickly. We were in and out in less than 35 minutes! That showed how hungry we were ;)

I'd definitely come back again. The only downside is that the location is quite far from the strip.
