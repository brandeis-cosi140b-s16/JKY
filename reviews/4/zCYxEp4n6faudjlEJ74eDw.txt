After surveying the family, we all agreed on 4 stars.  The three of us ordered combo plates.  Chimi, steak picado, and green chile burrito.  The entrees were about the right size.  They skimped on the rice and beans, though.  Probably half the size they should have been.

But the flavors were very nice.  Simple, but good.  The beans tasted "fresh" compared to the glop you get at most Mexican restaurants.  I would still have preferred to substitute them.  Menu says "no substitutions", but maybe that doesn't apply to the rice and beans (I like double-rice).  No chips and salsa, but that's OK.

And the price is definitely right.  Probably 30% less than most other places serving similar food.  And many of them aren't as good!

Oh...and the lemonade is fresh.  Not that Minute Maid swill.  I thought it was very good.

Seating is very limited.  If more than a dozen people show up there will be no place to sit.  We were lucky that they weren't busy when we arrived.

It's a bit far from my usual stomping grounds, but when I'm in the area this will be my choice for Mexican food.
