Finally got to check out this spot and man am I a happy dude. They have a huge menu, all seafood! They had close to 10 different types of cold cocktail salads (shrimp, abalone, calamari, octopus, squid etc.) and a few ceviches. They have some seafood based tacos and tostadas as well We went with a small Octopus cocktail ($5.00), a calamari cocktail ($5.00), a crabmeat tostada ($5.00) and the ceviche ((5.00) I have to say everything was awesome awesome awesome. The broth for the cocktails was perfectly seasoned and not too much citrus. You could tell the veggies were recently cut and the fish was super fresh! I think the standout of the whole meal was my crabmeat tostada. It literally had probably 1/4 of solid good crab meat, with a few avocado slices and a tomato. Insanely simple, let the fish speak for itself. The ceviche was great too. It's a small little restaurant right on the side of the road, but it was very clean and the workers were super nice. I think the total damage was $27 with our food, and a large Horchata. I know I'll be going back. If you're a fan of fresh really simple seafood dishes, this is the spot!
