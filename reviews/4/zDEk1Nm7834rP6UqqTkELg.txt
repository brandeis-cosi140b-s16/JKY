This review is for online ordering/take out.

I had no idea you could do that!  A couple folks from work were ordering and asked if I wanted in. Um, yes please.  The website asked for names for each meal within the order, which we found out later was so they could write first names on similar dishes... so simple, but it made such a difference.

Parking was difficult and we lucked in to a decent spot. In the future I'd likely park near a different building and prepare for a short walk rather than fight in the small lot.  When we walked in, the place was packed to the gills!  It was such a relief to be able to walk up to the to-go window and wait in a line behind one person, rather than 20.  Our order was there and ready, warm, and 95% accurate (I got white rice instead of brown).  

For being in the thick of the lunch rush, this location was handling things pretty well and it was running smoothly.  Still, I'm so excited about this new found order-ahead thing.  Rumor has it there's an app, too?
