Another restaurant in a strip mall, but this one is different too.  Rather than being tucked in a small space, this one is quite cavernous.  While the entrance seems small, you are led through a door into what is almost a warehouse that has been converted into a Mexican cantina, and you are greeted quickly and rapidly served toasty warm chips.

The meal is then served quickly, with fresh ingredients and large portions.  While the only downfall is that the rest of the strip mall around the restaurant isn't doing that well, the fact that this is part of a larger regional chain may allow it to ride out the storm.  I sure hope so.
