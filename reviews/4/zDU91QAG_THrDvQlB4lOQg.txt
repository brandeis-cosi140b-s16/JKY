I guess I would rate this place as 3.5 stars.  Four of us went for dinner last night and enjoyed ourselves.  We started with some beers and some frozen margaritas.  Like a good restaurant should, they immediately took our bar order and brought our drinks quickly--smart, they make more money on booze than on food.  We ordered a large quesadilla with cheese and chicken to share and that was pretty good.  For dinner we ordered 4 combo dinners -- combo enchilada dinner, combo enchilada and avocado tostada dinner, combo enchilada and taco dinner, and the carnitas dinner.  All pretty good -- not outstanding but good.  Service was acceptable especially since they were pretty busy on a Friday night.  The chips were excellent but only one kind of mild and unexciting salsa.  And they charge for any extras like extra salsa, extra sour cream, extra guacamole, etc. etc.  I guess that is OK to prevent the pigs for ordering so many condiments and running them broke.  All in all, we will be back.  We were satisfied.....again pretty good service, decent food, but not food that I would say was outstanding.  And BTW, they have an extensive menu, but pretty standard Sonoran dishes; nothing unique or intriguing.
