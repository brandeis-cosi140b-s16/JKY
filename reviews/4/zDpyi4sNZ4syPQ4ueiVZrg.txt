If you want an authentic Mexican grocery in the strip, this is the place to go!  They always tend to carry unique vegetables needed for Mexican meals.  In addition they make their own homemade tortilla chips and salsas.  There is also a fun taco stand out front with great authentic corn tortilla tacos.
