I've never met a taco didn't like. That being said, the shredded beef tacos are bomb!! If you are expecting a fancy Mexican spread then be prepared to be disappointed. This is quick, solid Mexican food. 

My kids love coming here. The kids meals are cheap (something parents like) and they come with churros!! Need I say more?

I've never used the drive thru but it never seems to move quickly. Park and come inside so you can peruse the extensive menu. They also have different specials for each day of the week so look out for those. Oh, and the horchata is pretty good too.
