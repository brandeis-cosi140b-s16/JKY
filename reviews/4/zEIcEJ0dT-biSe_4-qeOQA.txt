First time here and enjoyed it very much.   Nice upscale decor but very noisy. You will be greeted with a small skillet of very good cornbread with whipped butter.  They have an extensive menu with many unique items. Had a Margarita for $5 from the happy hour menu (weekdays 2 - 7).  For my entree, I chose the Anciote chopped chicken salad.  An interesting choice. The grilled anchored chicken was seasoned and cooked expertly.    It was placed on top of shredded iceberg, Roma tomatoes, red cabbage, cotija corn, black olives and pepitas.  Each in it's own section of the salad platter.  Oh, and I almost forgot, we had the Tejas Trio from the happy hour appetizer menu consisting of salsa, cheese sauce Nd guacamole.  Good Stuff!  The service was great with our server actually boxing our leftovers for us along with extra chips.  Nicely done!
