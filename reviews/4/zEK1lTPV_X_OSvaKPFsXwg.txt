We went there for dinner tonight (Saturday) around 9pm. We were supposed to go to Olive Garden, but the line was OUT THE DOOR so we decided to try On The Border instead.

First, there was no wait. We were seated right away.

The all you can eat salsa and chips were delicious and it was obvious that both were made from scratch. Yummy!

We had the shrimp and crab enchiladas which were excellent with the rice and black beans on the side. My daughter had the cheeseburger and fries. She enjoyed them and I tasted the fries. Perfect!

For dessert we had the brownie sundae. Very rich and very sweet but good.

Service was great (ask for Gavin) and for some reason it wasn't too crowded which meant the noise level was perfect.

It wasn't expensive either. Four of us ate entrees and two had dessert. We all had sodas with free refills and it came up to about $60. We would have easily spent $100 at Olive Garden.

We would gladly go back.
