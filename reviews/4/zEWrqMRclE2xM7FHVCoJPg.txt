Nacho Daddy...I've tried you again and again and you have not let me down.

In my initial review I was sad for the poor starving children and the wastefulness of the portions you serve.  I've now learned "how" to order off of your menu so I don't leave feeling less like a human because of my gluttonous ways.  Your bloody Mary's are amazing, but the Medium gave me enough kick without adding the habanero.  Half medium half mild suits my tastes (even though I always thought I could handle a kick).

We love everything your restaurant has to offer for a quick bite after a long day wrangling cats (I mean kids), from the brunch menu (huevos nachos LOVE...but share), fajitas, mahi mahi tacos, ceviche, chips and salsa...oh and yes my margarita is always amazing.
