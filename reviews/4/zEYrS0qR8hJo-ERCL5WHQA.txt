Wow.  I have been coming to this Chipotle since it opened, and I have to say, back then, only the neighborhood people, the police, and the military knew it was there.  Much better then, not as busy!  But now you walk in there and it's quite crowded.  I don't blame you all, but we don't have that many good places on my side of town so I wouldn't have minded keeping this one quiet!  I agree with Mel C, the parking lot is a little ridiculous.  Not that there aren't enough spaces, but with Five Guys, Subway and Chipotle right there, there really is no sense in trying to park in front.  Just park away and walk.  These burritos aren't low calorie!

The dining room is very clean and the service is great here.  The food is quite good.  With an open kitchen you can see food preparation, and the food tastes great.  It hasn't been sitting around.

I had this particular Chipotle cater my dad's 60th birthday party and it was a big hit.
