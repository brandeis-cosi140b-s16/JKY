This place is pretty yummy!

I came here bc my friend wantef some enchiladas. Here you get 2 for 4.99$ with any meat. I ordered a chicken burrito but it looked gross so the girl was such a sweetie and let me get something else. Instead I ordered 2 potato tacos with cheese and a kids meal with chicken taquitos for my son. After paying I heard a man ordering some carne asada fries and I was like "hold up!" She said its on their "secret menu" so I got an order of those.

My friend said his enchiladas were good. My sons taquitos were also very very good and he loved the chips and salsa. I tried my potato tacos and I was like YAY! They were super delish! The carne asada fries (7$) were also very yummy! The only thing that sucked was they dont come with guac, its 1$ extra and also you have to like yell over the glass thingy.

All in all the food was yummy and cs was awesome!
