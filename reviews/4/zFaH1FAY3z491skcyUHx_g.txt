What can you say about Laurita's? The food is great and cheap. It's open 24 hours. When you're in the mood for Mexican food and you're in this area, choose Laurita's over Don Tortaco up the street (it's supposed to be open 24 hours, but I've been twice now after midnight only to find the door locked with all of the lights on). Laurita's is great if you want something crazy, like carne asada fries, or something simple, I suggest the bean and wet cheese burrito with sour cream and rice inside. I love this place.
