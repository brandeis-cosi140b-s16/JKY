Suzie's is a cool place if you set your expectations properly. The food is decent, not overly memorable but definitely good for the price. The service is always mediocre at best ... but consistent. The atmosphere is hole in the wall / old & crusty ... but that gives it character. I'm particularly fond of Friday night's when they have a mariachi band crammed in the corner playing. Don't go out of your way for this place, but if you're in the neighborhood it's worth a stop.
