Writing this review because there are so many debates about whether or not Las Vegas can serve up good Mexican food.

I was referred to La Palapa by a friend who hails from Mexico, and is picky about their food.  Especially mariscos!  I myself, having spent a significant number of years being part of a Mexican family, have a discerning pallet when it comes to Mexican fare.

I arrived at La Palapa with my friend and his family, and upon sitting down he was immediately greeted with a michelada 'preparada'.  This is one of the best inventions ever, so I quickly followed suit, while presented with several options of the cerveza to be used in the drink.  I'm a traditionalist....Modelo Especial is my standard.  I have to say, this preparada was unique to anything I've had elsewhere, including those in Mexico City.  It was much lighter in tomato than most, but had great spicey goodness!  The 2nd one was better than the 1st!

I split a tasting of shrimp and octopus ceviche cocktail and a combination shrimp and fish taco.  All was phenomenal.  I think there was a full pound of 21-25 shrimp in my ceviche, and the lightly fried goodness in the tacos was amazing.  Super fresh and awesome.  Even did a dozen raw oysters on the 1/2 shell as appetizer.  a) I wouldn't risk this at 90% of the restaurants in Vegas and b) I never thought sliders with lime juice and Tapatio would be awesome!  I was wrong!

Needless to say, this was worth the drive off the beaten path.  I'll definitely be back!
