Pretty legit place. Between my wife and I, we got the mahi mahi beer battered fish tacos, crab cakes, shark tacos, and clam chowder. If you have a large party, get it to go. Not much room inside, but they have a great accommodating staff that will take care of you. The shark tacos were ok. It could have honestly been bass and I wouldn't have know they difference. The crab cakes were awesome. Flaky, tender, and perfectly seasoned. I'm from California off the coast and this clam chowder was some of the best I have ever had. The mahi mahi taco was legit too. We will definitely be back again!
