Had never been here before until yesterday.  Came with a girlfriend for dinner.  Decided to get the Coastal Trio to try a variety of their tacos.  I LOVED the classic fish taco. That was definitely my favorite, followed by the salsa verde shrimp taco (super yum).  The last taco was the Regal Springs Tilapia taco and it was so spicy, I could hardly eat it. Either the blackening spices or the serrano slaw made this a must for those who adore spicy things, but it definitely burned the crap out of my dainty little taste buds so beware if you're sensitive to spice.
They have $1.50 classic fish tacos on Tuesdays which is a steal.  I'm definitely coming back to take advantage of that.  The salsa bar was well stocked and the salsa verde was delicious.  The lady behind the register was very nice and happily delivered our food to our table one it was ready.  Overall, I had a great experience.  This is definitely not fine dining, but you can escape the heat, take a seat, and nosh on some pretty kick a** tacos in between getting your shopping fix.
