Call before you go to make sure they are open. I have gone here numerous times, hoping for some yummy food, and been sadly disappointed they were closed. So now I always call ahead to see if they are open. All that aside, the food is delicious. Burritos, regular, enchilada or chimi style, never had anything bad. Tacos are great too. Drinks are can soda, maybe bottled water, not sure. I always get it to go, the booths look uncomfortable lol. Cash only. There is a Circle K a few doors down, so go there if you need cash.
