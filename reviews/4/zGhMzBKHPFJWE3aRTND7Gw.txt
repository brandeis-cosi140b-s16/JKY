I was pleasantly surprised by this location. I wouldn't call Rubio's "authentic" by any means but if you are looking for a quick fix for your taco cravings it will do the trick.

The food is pretty good. I adore their poblano and mushroom tacos. Not many places serve veggie tacos so this makes me happy. These tacos are stuffed with grilled poblanos, portabellas, fresh avocado, cilantro, and queso fresco. Plus the taco shell has cheese crisped on to it. It is a surprising and tasty twist. 

I have always liked their beans and before I discovered their tacos I would get a plain old bean burrito.

My husband always gets fish tacos or burritos and always says they are good.

Their salsa isn't the best but they have a few different kind of varieties.

Portion sizes are kinda flimsy especially their side items...

Service at this location is awesome! The lady running the register is sooooo nice and seems extremely competent.  

They also sell beer which is nice for a fast food establishment. I haven't imbibed yet because I always order takeout but I saw a sign that said all beer is $2.50 in the evenings. Hmmmm... I might have to come back for that.

Give Rubio's a chance- they might surprise you.
