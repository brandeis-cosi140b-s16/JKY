I stopped by for lunch with my husband and two girls (4 and 1 year old). They have authentic southern Mexican food. 

My girls had the kids chicken strip meal which came with 2 chicken strips and some fries. It was $4.50 which is pretty typical for a kids meal but did not come with a drink. 

My husband had the hawaiian torta ($6.50 I think) and said he enjoyed it. I had a quesadilla (they are known for them) with Mexican chicken ($6 for 3). I really enjoyed the quesadilla. It came smothered with green chili sauce, lettuce, and queso fresco and the corn tortilla is definitely homemade and absolutely delicious. The chips and salsa are amazing too. They come with a green salsa that tastes a little like an enchilada sauce and is so yummy. They also have a small salsa bar. 

The only downfall was they did not have fountain drinks. They are on the menu so maybe the machine was down? No worries, they had Mexican bottles cokes. 

The owner and a younger kid (maybe his son?) served us and were so nice, friendly, and helpful explaining menu items and making suggestions. We will definitely return to try more of their delicious food! 

Oh and the neighborhood looks a little sketchy but it isn't that bad.
