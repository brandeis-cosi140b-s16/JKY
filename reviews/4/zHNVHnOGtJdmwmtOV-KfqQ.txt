Stopped by here for lunch before shopping at the Forum in Caesars. The food here is not too expensive and more importantly, it was good. We had the fish tacos and wings and they both were really good. We also ordered the big tube of Margarita which was good and felt never ending to finish.

Overall, if you want something fast without breaking your bank at Vegas, come to this place. The service was good and I would definitely come back here in the future if I visit Vegas again.
