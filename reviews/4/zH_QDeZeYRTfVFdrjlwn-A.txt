We love this place! I ordered the cheese enchilada plate with a coke and my husband ordered a bean and cheese burrito wet. Shortly after ordering the waiter comes to me and brings a bowl of soup and says my order was on special and it comes with soup for 8.99. GREAT!! The food was fantastic. The right flavors and temperatures. 
We were also given when we sat down chips and a trio of salsa, bean dip and guacamole. Sooooo Yummmy. 
Just have to minor complaints. The restraunt is always warm especially when it is very HOT outside you want to have it cool. Also the are closed Mon and Tues!! I am off on the then and want to go in so it is hard for me to always come cause of my work schedule.
Give this place a try great food and most of the time great staff.
