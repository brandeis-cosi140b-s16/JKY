I live nearby, and I hadn't been to Mucho Taco until a friend recommended it. It's great!
I ordered three tacos: carnitas, carne asada, and pescado with a side of rice and beans. They bring fresh salsa and chips to your table while you wait for your food. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but the staff was kind and the food came out fast. I would have liked lime wedges served with my tacos, but the tortillas were outstanding and the food was tasty and prepared well. 
I will definitely eat here again.
