The usual Roberto's Taco Shop fare; however, this being a rather new Roberto's, it still retains it's fresh and clean looks.

I always either get the three rolled tacos (Taquitos) or a Carne Asada burrito depending on how hungry I am. They definitely get it right, but in a town full of Roberto's, it's hard to get it wrong when they set the standard.

Service is always prompt with someone always on the register/cleaning the salsa bar, and at least two cooks in the kitchen.
