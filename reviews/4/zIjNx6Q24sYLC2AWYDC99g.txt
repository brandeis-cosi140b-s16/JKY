Industrial chic meets American Mexican.  This is yet another solid location for lunch or a quick, cheap dinner that won't leave you in a food coma due to grease and sugar.  The place is clean and the servers seemed to be genuinely interested in doing a good job, which is nice to see nowadays!  For those who have never been to a Chipotle, it is basically a choose-your-own-adventure Mexican style.  Select your structure (bowl, salad, burrito, taco), protein, toppings, pay, and enjoy.  Good, clean food that will fuel you for whatever faces you after your meal!
