I went here tonight with the BF and it was a fairly good experience. We had a coupon from the ASU coupon book for a free cheese crisp with any purchase... well the cheese crisp was good. I know, I know, it's hard to mess up a cheese crisp.... but we had a bad one a week or two ago... so this was a nice change. It was crispy, like it should be, and a fairly standard cheese crisp. We also got a chicken fajita burrito... this was good, there were red, orange, and yellow bell peppers in there and they tasted fairly fresh. It came with rice, and it was flavorful. This place is definitely americanized mexican food.... but it was good and I would come back.
