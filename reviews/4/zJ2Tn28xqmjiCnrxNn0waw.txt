Have you tried the tacos guisado al pastore?!  Or the green chile beef enchiladas?!  The tableside-made guac?!  Friendly, efficient service, authentic south-of-the-border food, cheap prices....THE place to go for one of the best lunches in downtown Pittsburgh.  I should know, our group seems to head there at least once a week!  Nummers, folks.  Oh, and if you want a margarita with that taco, head to their Wood Street location....alcohol there.
