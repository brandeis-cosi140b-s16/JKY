Ate here for the first time on a week night and business was pretty slow at 6:30PM but picked up by the time we left. Desnudo offers daily specials and their ceviche special happened to be a delectible combo of scallops in a mango reduction with red onions, lime and radish. It was worth the trip from Green Valley just for the appetizer. They have a variety of tacos and we tried three different varieties but the Tinga Poblana were my favorite. The tacos benefit from the crema and lime additions as well as the avocado and flavorful meat combination. We are looking forward to next time; we will order the Chivo, Tinga Poblana and Ceviche of the day.
