This place is always great for when you want something fast on the Strip. It's in a small food court next to a pizza place and a Panda Express and below a McDonalds.  The Chipotle, though, always has a huge line compared to the other places in the food court.  It's no different than any other Chipotle but the convenience of it being on the Strip is awesome.
