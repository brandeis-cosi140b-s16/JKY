This week when I came here for lunch, before I could open my gob and recite my normal kid's meal, the guy working recited "a Moo with black bean, tofu and no rice?" and I realized that either I'm THAT strange they can remember what I order or I'm officially a regular. At a "fast food" joint.

The staff here usually are having a fun time behind the counter, the joint usually stays pretty spotless and they always have the salsa bowls filled. Around lunch time you'll only run into a handful of people from local companies sitting down for lunch and aside from Moe's vast array of music playing over the speakers, its relatively quiet.

If you're ever up this way and craving Mexican, I'd definitely recommend it.
