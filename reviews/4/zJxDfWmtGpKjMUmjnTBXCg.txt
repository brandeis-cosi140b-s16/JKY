Growing up in Phoenix has made me a bit of a Mexican food snob, and in the land of many 'bertos, I was wary of trying yet another place. I'm happy we did - the food has been consistently delish and the service incredibly friendly.

What hasn't been consistent are the hours. The menu says the place is open 8 am to midnight, with a 24-hour drive-thru. (Yelp thinks it's 7 am to 10 pm.) The last several times we've driven by, the lights have been off. I've tried calling the number on the site (also the number on Yelp) and all I get is an automated "this voicemail box is full." I tried sending an email to the address listed on the site, but that came back undeliverable. So, what's the deal? Does anyone know when this place is open?
