Went inside on Saturday morning and ordered the Country Breakfast burrito. I added rice to the potatoes, cheese and eggs and my total was about 6 bucks for a very large breakfast which half the burro is still sitting in frig. Everything seemed freshly made to order and the ingredients all tasted nice. With no meat inside, it was hard to mess this burrito up, so it was a nice, no worry about what is inside my breakfast. Extra points for free chips on the counter and a decent green sauce was served on the side, more thick than than normal. Great radish and cucumbers as well.
