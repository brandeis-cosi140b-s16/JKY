We tried out this restaurant last Sunday and had a good experience.  The shrimp tacos were the stand out on the menu.  The green Chile chicken needed a little more flavor, as did the pineapple pork.  

We thought our server Paris was great!  She treated us well and checked on us often.

We'll be back to try out the rest of the tacos soon!
