We stopped here for a quick bite before heading to another spot and we stumbled upon their $2 Taco Tuesday.  Although you cannot select any taco from the menu the choices provided are quite good.  I had 3 tacos the Standard which was my favorite, the pork was okay and the carne was typical, no surprises.  I have to say that the Prickly Pear margarita was the absolute best!!!!!
