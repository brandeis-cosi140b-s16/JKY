We really liked this place! It's decorated very cute, and although it's small, it's quaint and light, and the food was delicious.  I had the tostada salad, hubby had chile relleno, both were very fresh and tasty.  This is def. more of a To-Go place because seating is so limited, which is fine because the prices are great and the food is, too.
We'll definitely be back!
