I would have given Ajo Al's a four star rating instead of a five star because of the tortillas. The food in general is very good but the tortillas are average. I have found that Mama Lola's tortillas are the best out there. Their baked fresh daily in Phoenix. I found out about Mama Lola's tortillas when I ate at another Mexican restaurant and loved their tortillas. Great food, average tortillas.
