I grew up with Mexican food, with a father who grew up in Southern California.  While I'm no snob, I'm sick of the faux-mexican restaurants in this area and what they pass off.
Well, La Unica is a breath of fresh air!  My 2nd favorite mexican restaurant, and IMHO the 2nd most authentic in the Charlotte area I've tried.  Anything on the menu is good, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the prices are fair.
The one complaint I would have is crowd control.  They're almost always busy, you almost always have to wait, and the entrance is a mash of people waiting, leaving and paying - such that sometimes you can't catch their eye to get your name on the list because they just don't know if you're coming or going.
But it's worth the wait to have real mexican!
