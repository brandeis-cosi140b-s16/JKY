After being on my bookmark list for possibly years, I finally tried this place a few weeks back.... and it was good! The d√©cor is a little hokey, what with it looking like a cave and being extremely dark, but it was cute. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili burger and a sampler plate (the enchantment platter) that had a chile relleno, enchilada, and a carne adovada burrito. The burger was so so... really nothing special and not a lot of heat there, but the enchantment platter.... that thing was huge, delicious, and covered in gooey cheese. There wasn't a bad item on it. Everything was spicy and flavorful, it makes me want another one as I type about it. There was more than enough food, so I had leftovers, which were equally delicious the next day. I'll be back. 


PS they have a great looking happy hour here, would love to go back and try that!
