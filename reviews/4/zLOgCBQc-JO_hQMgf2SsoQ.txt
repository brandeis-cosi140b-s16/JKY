I enjoyed my trip to Serrano's- while in Phoenix with family for Christmas, we stopped in our last day before leaving for the airport. Lots of chips and salsa, water and iced tea delivered to our table in pitchers, and by the amount of people here at lunch time I could determine that they do a mean lunch hour. Fairly standard for what you get at most Mexican restaurants, but came out quickly and hot. The house margaritas are large and cheap. If I come back to Phoenix, I know I know I'll stop by again.
