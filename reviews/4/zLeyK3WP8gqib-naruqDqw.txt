Wonderful place for Mexican food if you don't mind venturing into the aves. Cute bright yellow building, and quaint kitschy interior. Chips and salsa are very good - salsa is a little spicy (even the mild) and chips taste homemade. I ordered the steak and chicken tacos. Steak was very moist and well-seasoned but the chicken was a little bland. Have also tried the enchiladas and didn't regret it. Finally, if anything, stop by for the margaritas - lots of flavored and a nice pour!
