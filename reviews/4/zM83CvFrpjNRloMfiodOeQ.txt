I thought everything was pretty good. I had cevice and pork belly taco.

Disappointed that the cevice was shrimp and not fish, and it lacked a little heat, but nothing a little hot sauce and a squeeze of the lime on the rim couldn't fix. The pork taco was a little bland, but the green salsa fixed that right up. It was cooked properly.

Because I'm an optimist, I wanted to rank 3.5, but gave it a 4. I would definitely come back.

Though.... I was a bit disappointed that they had run out of margarita mix. Would have expected limes, simple syrup, and some orange liqueur.... But hey, in the spirit I just got the shot of tequila with lime. I think they felt bad enough I got a double.
