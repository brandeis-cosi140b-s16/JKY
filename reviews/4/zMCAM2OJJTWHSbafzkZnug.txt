Gotta be honest, even though it's a chain it's still one of my favorite places to eat! In fact, it has been one of my favorite places since college when we use to frequent the Robinson location, and contrary to popular belief, I actually named my dog Mad Max after this place (not the movie).

They've got killer happy hours, their house margaritas are some of the best I've ever had (and I hate tequila). Don't get caught up with all the fancy favors they offer. While all delicious, you can't beat the traditional house margarita, on the rocks, with salt.

We've been hitting them up for lunch quite a bit. The lunch menu is a great deal. For under $10 you can grab a burrito, cup of soup & salsa. Here's what I recommend for lunch, but you won't go wrong with any choice.

Mad Mex Burrito (I do it without the burrito shell), add a side of "insane" San-Fran sauce, side of habanero pineapple salsa, and a 22oz Big Azz margarita (16oz if it's lunch and you need to get back for a 1:00 meeting).

Oh yeah, they always have a great music playlist going.
