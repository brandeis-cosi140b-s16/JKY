Double Dipping Allowed.

Sometimes you can't judge a book by its cover.  This is true about Mi Patio Mexican Grill. The restaurant may not be  much to look at from the outside, however it's definitely worth going in.

Your greeted the moment you walk in the door by staff that are very friendly and inviting.  Once seated you are immediately served a large bowl of warm chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa at Mi Patio Mexican Grill are  fresh and so addicting. What I liked best is  each person gets their own bowl of salsa, so double dip all you want and believe me you will want to.  The salsa at Mi Patio is the best I've had in a very long time.

The portions at Mi Patio are huge. I ordered a taco and enchilada combination plate  and could not finish my entr√©e. I haven't found a cheese enchilada any where near this good. 

Price are reasonable and service excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys mexican food.
