It's a little out of the way for me, but it's always worth the drive. I always end up eating at Taco Bell, but I never know why I don't go to Dell Taco more often. The steak tacos are delicious and the crinkle fries are yummy, throw in a churro and you've got a great meal. Wish it was closer, but I'm never sorry I made the drive.
