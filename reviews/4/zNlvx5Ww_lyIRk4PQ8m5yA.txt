My coworkers usually pick up food to go.  I have never experience dining in until recently.  I was very surprised to see that they service complimentary chips.  Nice!  I had the crunchy taco, normally at other places (Filiberto's) its greasy and soggy but at Some Burros it was super crunchy.  The red chili burrito is amazing, it isn't bland, its very tasty.  We will definitely come back.
