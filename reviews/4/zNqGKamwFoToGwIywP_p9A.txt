Spinach Enchiladas.  

I always go in meaning to try something else, but that has been a losing battle so far.  Although enjoying those enchiladas can hardly be considered losing!

This probably my favorite restaurant in the vicinity of my work.  The atmosphere, service and food are really excellent.  It is a little more expensive than many (particularly Mexican) restaurants, but worth it from time to time.
