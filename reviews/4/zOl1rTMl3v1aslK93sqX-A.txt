I must say I had a really good meal here at Pink Taco. The decor was kinda wild and all over the place, but I understood what they were trying to do. Without it, it would just be a boring looking Acapulco. I ordered the skirt steak with rice and beans. The meat was really good and cooked to perfect. The typical fixings were pretty good too but nothing out of the ordinary.
