Initially our order of five bowls was incorrect.  We have some allergy issues, and some in our party cannot eat pinto beans.  Needless to say, the first time we ordered it was a disaster. 

HOWEVER, Kyeara (and apprentice and manager I think) worked with us to make sure the order was correct for the next time.  She was sensitive to our issues and didn't waste our energy or time by arguing who was right and who was wrong.  She was professional and represented Chipotle the way we expect.

Since this incident, we've been to this location two more times and have experienced good service (with smiles!) and good food.   Kyeara changed our mind about the place!
