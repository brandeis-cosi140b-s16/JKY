awe come-on 3 stars??  really?  Being from Long Beach California I enjoy super mex when im home all the time.  Was pleasantly surprised when I drove by on Durango and saw that they had opened one up in Las Vegas.  So had to go in!  

Authentic mexican food that is great tasting and fattening.  Its an awesome place, and I've been to a ton, of Mexican restaurants.  Every time I go to a Mexican restaurant I usually end up getting some sort of combo platter.  Got their soft shell tacos with rice and beans.  I love their taco meat, it is really seasoned well and juicy.  Doesn't have the texture of a dry taco.  I hate those!  

Super mex is definitely not the finest dining in Las Vegas BUT, it is great authentic mexican for a low price.  It doesn't get any better than this place!  Glad they are expanding.
