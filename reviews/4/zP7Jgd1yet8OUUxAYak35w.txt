Not bad! I pass it all the time but had never been. Noticed they had a drive thru so I popped through after a long day at work and I didn't feel loved like cooking. Not to mention I was a little hungover and needed something with some substance. This was exactly what the doctor ordered. I ordered the chimichanga and it was HUGE and quite tasty.  It also came with a healthy portion of Mexican rice and re fried beans. More than enough to have as another meal. The chili sauce on the side had a nice amount of heat and a really flavorful smokiness to it. Very similar to Roberto's. I will go another time to see how their breakfast burritos compare. Because of the proximity to my house, large portion and the convenience of the drive thru I will definitely go again.
