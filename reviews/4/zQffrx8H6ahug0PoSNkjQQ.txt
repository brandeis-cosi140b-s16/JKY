I ordered chicken tacos, chorizo and egg burrito, and a bean burrito. Everything was tasty, well seasoned, and come with salsa. I'd prefer more salsa with my order. Service is quick and friendly. The sitting area is tables and plastic chairs. It gets awkwardly silent because they have no background music or tvs.
