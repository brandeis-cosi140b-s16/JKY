Seems to be the 'Hot Spot' for Matthews right now.
Definitely doesn't have the sleepy Matthews vibe. More of a Uptown fun bar / restaurant scene.
Great selection of Tequila. Food is good.
When the weather is nice, they open up the 'Garage' doors so it feels like an open air Mexican Beach Taqueria. Really nice!
Staff is usually really nice. Can have it's service ups & downs.
I definitely recommend checking it out if your nearby.
Better than most food choices in the Matthews area.
