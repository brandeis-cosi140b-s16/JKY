I can't understand all the negative reviews for Macayos in Goodyear. YES, for those that don't already know this, Macayos is a chain. It's a family owned chain and as far as I know, they're only here in Arizona, centered around the Phoenix area. They've been in business many years.

My family loves Macayos, and we've been to several. I just ate at the one in Goodyear today for lunch - I had a colleague in from out of town and he was up for some Mexican food, and he said he enjoyed it. We both had the Chimi Macayos, with shredded beef, rice and beans (lunch comes with one or the other but you can add the other for a buck or two). 

Their chips are good, the salsa is good (not great, I admit, but good) and they serve portions large enough to satisfy any hunger. Seriously, if you eat here and leave hungry, you're one in a thousand.

They have a nice bar area, and on Friday and Saturday nights it gets pretty busy. The dining room is good sized and they can accommodate large groups. Which is good, because we often go there with a dozen or more family members.

They also have a very good line of margaritas, by the way.
