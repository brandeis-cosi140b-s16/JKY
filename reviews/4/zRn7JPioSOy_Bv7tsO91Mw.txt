-Looks like a fast-food tex-mex place, but it is a casual sit-down, full service restaurant. They even had margaritas for $2.

-REALLY good food, BIG portions! $9.95 for a Carne Asada plate loaded with guac, rice, and beans. Not super cheap like a 'Bertos, but decent prices.

-FAST & friendly service! The food was brought out by the time we started digging into the chips and salsa...like SUPER fast!

-Chips & Salsa were delicious with the wonderful taste of fresh ingredients. They also have extra "burn your mouth" spicy upon request.

-Clean restrooms. Convenient parking.

-Located in a 1/2 dead strip mall, next to Peter Piper Pizza on the west side of the Metrocenter Mall.

-I would eat here again for sure!
