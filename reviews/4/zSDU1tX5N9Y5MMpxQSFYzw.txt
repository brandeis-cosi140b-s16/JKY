I've been wanting to try La Hacienda for a while, and last night we FINALLY made it happen. First of all, the Scottsdale Princess is gorgeous. I wish I wasn't such a party pooper because it would have been great to hang out there and have a drink at the outdoor bar. Next time.

I started my meal with the Elderflower margarita. 1800 blanco tequila, St. Germain, and fresh sour on the rocks. It was incredibly smooth, but a teensy bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll probably stick with a more traditional option.

We ordered the guacamole sampler, which came with three different types of guac: Pomegranate, Spicy Crab, and Pepita. All were delicious, but I think the pomegranate was the table favorite (we had it prepared without walnuts due to allergies).

The chips were freshly made and so delicious I almost didn't have room for my entree.

I enjoyed the Pollo en Mole Rojo, and it was really very good. The chicken was tender, and I loved their mole sauce. I also liked the plantains that accompanied the dish (I love plantains). My husband was less-than-impressed with his Enchiladas Verdes, but I think he forgot what tomatillos taste like.

For dessert, we experienced their flaming coffees. This is an experience unto itself, and if you happen to see someone getting one, you won't be able to leave the restaurant without sampling one yourself. I can still smell the cinnamon. Yum.
