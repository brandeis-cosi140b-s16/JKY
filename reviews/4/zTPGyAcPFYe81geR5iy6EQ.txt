So good! I will always go here whenever I am in town because it is always worth it. I will try to be brief...

The GOOD:  My food has always been excellent.  The flavors are delicious, the spices are right, the portion sizes are good, but not overwhelming. I love Tex-Mex and Real Mex and have tasted it all and this is really good but not the best. The Cuban food is good also, but it is not for me.   

The BAD: Service has always been ridiculous in my experience.  I have had servers who were either friendly yet incompetent or servers who were evil and glaring yet bringing me my food and drinks in a timely manner. (Honestly, both of these are fine with me as long as I get my food.)
