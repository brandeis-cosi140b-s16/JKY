Funny name.  We thought it was a joke, until we figured out what the place was. 

Creative, tasty food.  Duck tongue tacos....lobster...a chinese fusion.  A lot of stuff on the menu that I'd like to try, but couldn't in  a short trip.

Splendid flan for dessert...worth it right there.

Jose Andres is a masterful chef.

Love the place.  Not cheap, but you won't mind....not for the culinary anti-adventurous.
