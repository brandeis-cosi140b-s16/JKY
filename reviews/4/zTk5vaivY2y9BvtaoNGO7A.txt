Open 24 hours (most of the time, they shut down for a few hours in the wee morning to clean up) and $2 tacos!!! 
What? Yeah, you read that right. $2 tacos! (minimum of 2 in chicken or beef)

They have a lot of alcohol specials from $2-$3. I had a strawberry margarita for $3. 

This is if you sit at the bar only though. And the bartender we had was really nice. 

Definitely check it out if you're in Vegas and strapped for cash. So worth it for a quick, delicious meal and drinks.
