This place was recommended by a friend.  He said it was one of his family's fav spots.  I went to check it out with The Better Half and was pleasantly surprised.  The food was a little better than ok but just shy of a full 4 Stars, but I'm upgrading to 4 Stars because of the service.  

They started out with the complimentary Chips & Salsa....they were just ok.  Salsa was too runny and bland for my tastes.  I prefer it with a thicker consistency and spicier.

....so I asked for the real deal Spicy Salsa, and they went to the kitchen and brought it out for me, which was awesome.

The Better Half ordered the Mushroom Enchiladas, which she absolutely loved.  She's a Mushroom fan, so this dish worked out well for her.

I decided to order the 1/2 Plate of Nachos....I'm a Nacho lover, but wasn't expecting the gigantic portion which was labeled "1/2 Order".....1/2?!  I'd hate to see what a "full" plate looked like!!  LOL  It was a pleasant surprise and I took it as a challenge to finish it, which I did to the amazement of our server...TBH wasn't too happy though and the tables around us were laughing when they saw it delivered to me, LOL.

Overall, this was a fun place to have dinner and the food was a shy over 3 Stars.  Servers here are accommodating and pleasant, which earned the 4th Star.
