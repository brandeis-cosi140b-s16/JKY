Have heard nothing but good stuff about this place so we decided to give it a try.  Really good carne asada at a great prucw of $1.50.  Refried beans were divine - smoky flavor you find much anymore.  The atmosphere is not the best; no cocktails.   However it is just around the corner, local and fresh.
