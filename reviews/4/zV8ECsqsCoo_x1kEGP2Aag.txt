It's a chain...most of you should have run into one by now. I like their burrito bowl (think naked burrito, i.e. burrito minus the tortilla), their salads, and they've got some pretty bangin quesadillas. Their steak is good (have yet to try any of the rest but I'm told chicken is good as well). I recommend.
