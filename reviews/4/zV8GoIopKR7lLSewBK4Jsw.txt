Great atmosphere! Great repurposing idea! There is a pizza place in Times Square in an old church that I love and this is even better! Huge stained glass windows and they carried the design through with the tables and candelabras. Nice. 

My burrito was totally great! Loved it! The salsa selection was fun, but the main salsa was too watery. Our server, Joshua was terrible! Very disengaged. He was way more interested in talking with his co-workers than serving tables. Ten or more minutes after saying he'd get more water, I finally went to the bar for it. That is just one example of how lame he was. BUT, go to Taco Guild, just make sure you don't have Joshua!

Food great! Atmosphere greater! Service terrible at best, but need to give it another try!
