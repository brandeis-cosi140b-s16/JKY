Just had my first Mexican sushi and it was on point. All natural lemonade was a great companion to a great meal. Have eaten there many times before and have always liked the food everytime. Service is always good and place is always clean. Nothing fancy just great food by hard working people who give their food that homemade Mexican flavor that has yet to disappoint me. Thanks to all who work there for always making me a satisfied customer.
