Went here recently and this place is pretty good. 

Although, make sure you have plenty of time if you go during the lunch rush. The same lady who does your ordering, cashiering, also is your cook and your waitress!

I'm a little wary of the ants roaming around...not sure what I'll find roaming in the back if they let ants around freely...but I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt and just give stars based on the food. 

Good flavor, tastes authentic, sweet staff, I mean, sweet person.
