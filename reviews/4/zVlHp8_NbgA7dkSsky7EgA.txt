The food was fantastic. The pupusas were stuffed with more cheese than most places I've eaten at and we're delicious! Very easy on the wallet too. I took my mom there yesterday and we had 6 pupusas, some fried yucca, a side of crema (sour cream), and two sodas and our total $23 and change! Would have given 5 stars but the service prevented that. It wasn't bad service but our waitress had a little trouble understanding my order. She wasn't completely fluent in English. Other than that, great spot and we'll be back.
