Woohoo another Don Tortaco on my regular route, located in the same shopping center as Bank of America and Wal-Mart neighborhood market by Bermuda and Silverado Ranch.  I've been waiting for this location to open for awhile, now that it's open I should be here more often. LOL

Grand opening special $3.99 for either their grilled steak or grilled chicken plate which comes with beans and rice, dirt cheap. Best part is that I don't have to wait for midnight, when Coronado Cafe at South Point offers their cheap steak and egg special, Don Tortaco is 24/7 and right around the corner from South Point.  I'm hoping this location keeps this $3.99 special up for a few months just like the other locations did, it's usually $6 and some change. 

If you check out their website they offer some good coupons. http://www.dontortaco.com/dontortaco/DontortacoLocations.html

Dinner time.
