Burritos and Bodybuilders

There's not usually much decor in Chiptole.  They keep their decorations and their food simple and to the point. But if you're in the age range of 15-40, there's plenty of male eye candy.  I think I saw 3 men who's muscles were 5 times the size of mine.  In fact, most of the people in the restaurant were men.  I'm not sure why or how, but it made my tacos a little tastier. ;)

Enjoy!

Turns out what I thought they were putting in the rice was sugar, was actually salt. Sorry for the mistake Chipotle.
