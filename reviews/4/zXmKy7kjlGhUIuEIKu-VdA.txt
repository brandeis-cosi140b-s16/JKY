We really liked this place. I got the grande burrito with zuchinni & peppers i it which was really good. Loved their carne asada and the prices were great. I wish they ha more on their dessert menu. Would love home made churros! Staff was friendly. Would for sure go here again. Much better than baja fresh, rubios, tace bell & most other mexican places around PHX that we've been to.
