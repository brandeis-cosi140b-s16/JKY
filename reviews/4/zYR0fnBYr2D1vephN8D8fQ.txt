For a cheaper Baja-style Mexican chain, Rubio's is about as good as you can get. I've had several of their burritos and tacos, and I've yet to really be disappointed. The gourmet chicken/bacon taco, the fish taco especial, the health-mex chicken burrito, and the chicken burrito especial are my favorites. Their mild red salsa and their green salsa are awesome! I don't like the bitter flavor of their hot red salsa, and I'm not crazy about the dark smoky-flavored one, either, but I love the other two so much that I don't care. Their chips are thin & crisp.

The beans lack flavor, so if you're a beans fan, try mixing one of the salsas in with your beans to make them more interesting. I typically don't like Mexican-style rice, so I can't vouch for theirs.

The service at this location has always been good, and they share a cute little courtyard with the other places in this strip, so it's a great, easy place to grab some lunch by yourself or with friends.
