The owner/chef of this place sold her soul to the devil...that's the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good. So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and we've only been here once...so after a couple more visits, more than likely I'll be tacking on that coveted 5th star. 

We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned, a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food they're serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoa's (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food. 

Anyway, I'll get off my high horse...here is what we tried:

-Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.

-Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada I've ever had. Tender, flavorful, glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm. 

-Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada taco's I pretty much didn't know what to say after biting into it, it left me speechless.

-Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner. 

God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didn't get to try the guacamole, but Katrina thought it was great. Overall, we were just very impressed with this place and can't wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily, and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks, it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to. 

4.5/5.
