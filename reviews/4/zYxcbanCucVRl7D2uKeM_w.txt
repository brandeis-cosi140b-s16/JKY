Finally stopped in to give Chronic Tacos a try and I'm glad I did! 

The prices are super reasonable and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I grabbed lunch for Boyfriend and I on the way home from work. Two burritos, one carne asada and one carnitas. Both were the size of my dog. Both burritos were really good. I'd describe them as halfway between Chipotle and actual Mexican food. Chipotle format and style, but the meat would be perfectly at home in a Tijuana street taco. 

They have a ton of filling options, including al pastor and fish (!). Burritos ($5.99) and "Fatty Tacos" ($2.99) seem to be the main options. Plenty of toppings. They stuff those tortillas almost to bursting; no stinginess here! They also have a bar, which makes this place a great quick-but-not-fast-food dinner. After all, is there anything better in all the world than a cold beer and a giant burrito? I think not. 

Since I live in Henderson, I don't foresee us popping by for dinner, but I'll definitely be picking up to-go food in the future!
