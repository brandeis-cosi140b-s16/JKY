Why the hell am I totally addicted to this place???  I usually get the 3 piece breast/wing combo but substitute the last wing with another breast.  (notice a trend here??).  I usually get the pinto beans and fresh veggies along with flour tortillas. 

Its weird...everyone can remember the best steak they've ever had, perhaps the best sushi but NEVER the best chicken.  Not that I am saying this is the best chicken I've ever had.  It isn't...nothing comes close to my mom's roasted chicken :)

I guess I go here since its so close to my apartment and the fact that it is a bit healthier than standard fast food fare.  Why go to Taco Bell when you got this place?
