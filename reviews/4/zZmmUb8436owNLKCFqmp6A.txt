This was our second time coming here so I just had to hop on and right a review. This place is great, great ambiance, fun décor, and helpful staff. The food has not disappointed us one bit, the salsa is a little hot( but as a wimp with spicy foods that may not mean anything), great fajitas, and for the important stuff: amazing margaritas. We tried two margarita flavors so far, cactus pear and raspberry. While the raspberry was good the cactus pear was fantastic, and turned out to be a great flavor for a margarita. All in all this place seems to have great food and an even better décor so I would definitely recommend taking a look if you are in the area.
