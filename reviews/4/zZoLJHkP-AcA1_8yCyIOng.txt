The burritos were a little smaller than you might expect at Chipotle or Qdoba, but bigger than at Moe's. My burrito was delicious, however - surprisingly delicious. Just as each of the burrito chains has it's own distinct flavor, so does Currito. The jalapeno salsa is what I really think topped it off perfectly (instead of the pico - I'm not a pico fan). Wish we had one of these a little closer to the city!
