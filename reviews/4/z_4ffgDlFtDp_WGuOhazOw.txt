This place intrigues me.  The reason I first went was because of the blaring "Mexican Sushi" sign.  And I was hungry.  And hot.

The first time I actually didn't try a sushi roll (tight on cash...blame teachers' salaries).  I enjoyed some shrimp tacos (limited options for a pescatarian, unfortunately) and a cup of elote!  It was delicious.  Lots of salsas at the condiment bar, too.

The second time I did order some sushi, though I forget which roll.  I also had a cocktail de camaron, which was super yum.  The sushi was OK.  I didn't see how it was "Mexican," though it was fried and a little heavy on the cream cheese.  I'd like to try another.  Next time.  

Service, over the course of two visits, was fine.  They took my order and brought my food to the table.  That's about as far as it went.  Price is pretty good, too.  A dollar or two less would be nice, but as is is totally fair :)

Environment is almost nil.  There are neutral colored walls and floors with relatively nondescript seating.  The one thing that does stand out is the counter of Mexican candies next to the cash register.

This place is a mile away, so next time it's not over 90 and I have some money, I'll hit them up again.
