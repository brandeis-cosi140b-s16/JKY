This place needs craft beer on tap which would go well with their menu IMO.  Their grilled steak tasted great and their ingredients were fresh.  Great place to watch the game and hang out in the patio area since there are plenty of TVs around the bar area.  The waitress reminded us of Mila Kunis and Michelle Rodriguez into one ;-)
