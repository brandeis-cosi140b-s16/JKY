Today was my first visit to this colorful little place on Mill. Since I work in the Centerpoint building, it was just up the street from me, and they have take-out so I can come back and eat at my desk. 

I tried the carne asada burrito with guacamole, and it was delicious (and huge!) I love that you can pick the rice, beans, meat, and veggies that you want on your burrito.

The service was good, although one of the girls working on the make line spoke so quietly that I couldn't hear her at all. Overall, the only thing that would prevent me from coming here every day is the cost...my burrito (with no drink or sides) was $8. Affordable lunch, but not for everyday!
