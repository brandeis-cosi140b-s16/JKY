I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges. Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.

The service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.

But what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!
