I opened with the korean beef taco. The kimchee was a nice touch as a topping but the beef was more brisket than korean beef. Still a decent taco. 2.5/5 (minus point for semi-false advertising). 

Being a New Orleans native, I was instantly drawn to the Mexican Pho dish, as I am a Pho-holic back home. Decided to give it a whirl and I am so glad I did. While the only thing pho'ish is the cilantro, rice noodles and lime, it tied amazingly well with the soup. Only thing keeping this from being 5/5 is I would have the preferred the soup to be a bit thinner. It is a very thick soup. 4/5

Service was very good, restaurant is trendy and whimsical, and the music selection was fun, though a bit loud, even for lunch.
