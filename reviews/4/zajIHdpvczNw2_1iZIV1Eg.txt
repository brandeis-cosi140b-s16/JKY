I was first introduced to the concept of an awesome taqueria hidden behind a tienda in Portland, OR. There was a place in North Portland (Tienda Santa Cruz) that was a bakery, market and, in back, they cranked out gorgeous, inexpensive and unquestionably authentic stuff.

S.U. and I were on an Sunday shopping trip deep into the soul-sucking vastness of West Odana malldom, it was lunchtime and I remembered hearing about the 'other' Gemelos. It turned out to be right next to the unmentionable dark place we were heading so ..let's eat.

As advertised, we walked into a Mexican Tienda. It has a meat counter with fresh and prepared  beef and pork (al pastor by the pound for example), all the basics from housewares to spices and in the back a medium size restaurant. Booths and  tables. Sunday specials. We were the only obviously not-Latinos in the place. It was lunch so we didn't have much more than tacos and sopes. They came out fast, hot and delicious.
They have Sunday specials and I tried to order barbacoa (lamb) but they were out. They also don't serve beer (sad face). I guess that's OK but, as we're told here in Wisconsin, in heaven they don't serve beer.
