As a kind-of taco snob, this place passes muster (for what one can expect of tacos in Western Pennsylvania, anyway). Chopped and sprinkled cilantro is a good sign. Diced onions are a good sign. Well-marinated tacos al pastor is a good sign. Jarritos is a sign. Expect a line, but it moves quickly and there always seems to be available seating. A testament to how you'll want to quickly savor some of the better tacos in downtown.
