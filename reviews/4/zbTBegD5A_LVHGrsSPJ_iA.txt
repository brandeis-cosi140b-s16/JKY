This place was so yummy! Before I moved to AZ, I would have told you that o don't like Mexican food, but this is one of the places that changed my mind. They were really sweet to us, and the food was pretty great. We had enchiladas and quesadilla, and the rolled tacos. I did have to knock off a star for the tacos - they were tiny and dry and not very good. Their guacamole isn't all that good, either. Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't get random chunks of avocado. I got actual blended guacamole. But it could have used more flavor - I ended up adding salt and pepper to mine before eating it on anything. 

Overall delicious, with a couple disappointments. We will order from here again, though, for sure.
