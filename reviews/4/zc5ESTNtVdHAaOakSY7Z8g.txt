This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have been dining there since it first opened.  Years ago I liked the salsa better, but now it's still good.  Bean dip ecellent.  Food usually comes out fast.  I was there on November 2nd when SEMA was at the convention center.  They ran out of bean dip and served Pico and salsa.  Was there on Thanksgiving.  There were 3 tables and food was great, got our bean dip.  We were there Thursday, Rodeo in town, they ran out of bean dip.  When there are big events nearby I notice food runs out.  Although we had no dip with our meal our waiter packed a 1 pint size of it to go for us because it just got finished cooking as we were leaving. Along with our left overs the next day for lunch it was delicious.  Prices very reasonable.  My favorite, Chilie Rellenos, which are the best I ever had.  Carnitas  Soft Taco outstanding.
