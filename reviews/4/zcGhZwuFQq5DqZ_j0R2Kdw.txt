Not a bad place to go for cheap Mexican food.  Started coming here last year.  It would be good if you order in Spanish, but English would do just fine.  Great place to be at after a long night of drinking too.  This isn't the safest area in the neighborhood, but the food is good, so I'm not complaining.
