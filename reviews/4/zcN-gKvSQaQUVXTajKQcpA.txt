This ain't Taco HELL (play on Taco Bell, if u didn't get that one?)!!!

Like Tacos Mexico, I really like their intestine tacos =) YUM.
Don't judge the deep fried goodness that is intestines....all things fried are delicious.
Just something bout eating it with fresh veggies and salsa. 

I can't get enough of it but, it's soooooo far from what I'm used to driving. Which is prolly why I crave it all the time...
