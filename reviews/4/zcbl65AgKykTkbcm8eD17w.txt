Really awesome tacos! I am glad they are on yelp now- we visited when they first opened and I was disappointed that I could not rush on here & rave about this place; now I can =].

I am SUPER glad to see another taco place in the Southside. Considering tacos are one of my FAVORITE things to eat, I was super excited to check it out. The inside is small and super cute and the staff are very friendly.

My boyfriend and I tried their American style taco, another beef one (can't think of the name) and the chicken taco. We both agree that the chicken taco was the best and is now the only one I will order. Don't get me wrong, the beef was not bad- but I have had better. The chicken is packed with fresh flavors like fresh salsa and avocado and is just incredibly tasty. At $3 a taco, this place is a steal.

What's REALLY awesome about this place? They are open late!

It was a Sunday night when we visited again, probably around 9:30 pm. I was starved and couldn't think of what I could eat in Southside besides pizza. We walked past this place and I couldn't believe they were open. My taste buds were really happy.

This place is great. Go there now.
