The best looking Roberto's I've ever been to. 
Very clean and done up. 

I used to think Robertos as low rate (appearance wise with no ac) restutaunt with good food.

When I stepped into this location I was amazed! 
The appearance of the resturant was very surprising to me.
Even the the bathroom shocked me. 
The food was good and the place was VERY clean.

The only thing about the bathroom, there's no mirror in the womens lol and the door will seriously slam shut and if your hand or finger doesn't move out of the way just in time, Roberto's be careful, theres some shady people out there.

When in the mood for Mexican food, Roberto's on Blue Diamond I am there.
