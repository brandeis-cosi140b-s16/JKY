just tried this place today. i'm way into it. i got a veggie burrito, it contained rice, refried beans, cheese, sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo. all the ingredients were fresh and good quality. the tortilla was really good and they grilled it just right. my burrito was only $4, making it the most reasonably priced (decent) burrito i've been able to find in town. they have a killer salsa bar with some of the most refreshing green i've ever tasted. they have a big menu with lots of stuff i want to try, including breakfast and california burritos. i look forward to my next visit.
