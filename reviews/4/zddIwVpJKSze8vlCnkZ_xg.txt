My husband took me to this place for a date. I felt like I was in Mexico! There were live mariachi band and balloon clown. It was packed during the whole time we were there. Food was very decent. We had shrimp chiveche and oysters on shell. They both tasted fresh. There were also several tv on wall showing ball games like sports bar. Overall, this is a very cute Mexican Seafood restaurant with full of energy. I would like to bring more friends and family here to have true Mexican dinning experience.
