Our party of 4 had a pre-birthday dinner here on a crazy busy Saturday.
We snagged a nice table on the "patio" overlooking the Strip. I had the pork chops special, which was reasonably priced and had 2 eggs & beans/rice with it. Also tortillas!
A very good entree! 
We had the tableside guac also, which you customize to your taste, and that was very tasty & fresh!
I was pleased when "beer girls" came around offering a sample and a $2.75 bottle special! 
That is always a nice bonus. 
I also tried the shrimp cocktail, which lacked flavor (needed something spicy, cocktail sauce, etc.) but the shrimp were plentiful and good. Our friend was serenaded for her birthday and got a free shot & churros! Very nice.
