stopped by for lunch on a Sunday.  I forgot how much I enjoy the kick ass margarita's at this place.  The simple standard marg, blended with salt is awesome.

Beyond that I orderd the Chimichanga Verde.  It was a spinach tortilla filled with a wonderful mix of pork, peppers and onions.  The green "verde" sauce was flavorful.  It could have used a little more "kick" for my palate yet all aound a great meal.

Once again the only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is service.  It wasn't super busy yet the waiter seemed to disappear near the end of my meal and I waited forever to get the check.
