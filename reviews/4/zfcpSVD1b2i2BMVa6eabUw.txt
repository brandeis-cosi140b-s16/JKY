This place isn't the best looking, but it's pretty tasty! I find myself craving the strange mix of foods they serve here.
I order the Emerald chicken burrito and the Jerk Chicken quesadillas.
The best part is if you've never been there before, they give you tons of samples and tell you all about the foods you can order. 
I wish they had more locations :)
