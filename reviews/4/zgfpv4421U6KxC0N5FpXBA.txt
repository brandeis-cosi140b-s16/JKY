FINALLY I found my Mexican joint in Las Vegas.  I knew I was on the right track when I walked in and every customer was speaking Spanish.

The food is very authentic and they even have Tacos de Cabesa, they also have some of the BEST Carne Asada Fries I have ever had (not really a Mexican deal, but definitely California style).

This is a little hole in the wall, but its not expensive the food is great and plentiful.  They have a condiment bar that has a couple choices of salsa, but lot's of homemade spicy carrots and such.
