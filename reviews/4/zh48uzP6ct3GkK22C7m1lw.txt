This is a restaurant you go to every once in a while, otherwise it would be kind of gross. HOWEVER, when you go occasionally...SO GOOD! 

Somehow the combination of okay Chinese and okay Mexican food goes together splendidly. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Everyone eating there seems excited to be there too, which really makes the overall atmosphere very pleasant. I will definitely return...next year.
