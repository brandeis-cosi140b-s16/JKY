My girlfriend and I practically lived on their food the first few months of doing renovations on our house. The 5 tacos for $5 and a carne quesadilla to split is an awesome way to go. Everything we've had here is great, even the napales... cactus fajita platter basically. The corn totillas are hand made and thick and delicious. The food takes a little longer than your averaged mexi spot, but so worth it.  As the other reviewer says, the ladies that work there are very nice and its always clean.
