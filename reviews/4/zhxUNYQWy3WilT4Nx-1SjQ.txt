I had dinner here last night after it being on my bookmarks for awhile and I was very pleased with my meal. We were greeted immediately and seated in a booth. Our server was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. We snacked on the chips and salsa they brought out and I am in love with their red salsa. It is very spicy but I could not stop eating it. Their other salsa was good as well. I decided on the Mexicana Torta (grilled steak, guac, onions, jalape√±os) with horchata and I really liked it. I ended up adding some of the red salsa, but on its own it was good and flavorful. I am already thinking about when I will go back again to try something else.
