Stopped in before catching my flight home. The establishment is open 24/7 which would be a great place for your late night night munchies fix. Dine inside where there is ample seating and a salsa bar to spice up your favorite Mexican entree.

After cheking out the the menu  large posted menu, I went with a carnitas burrito and a side of sopas. They accept credit cards here and my order was up quickly.  The burrito which was packed with yummy pork, cilantro, and salsa - it was so large I could only eat half of it and half of  the yummy side entr√©e rice.

Definitely would recommend this place for your nevt Mex fast food fix.
