Had the new Doritos taco supreme. Mmmm it was good a bit much on the sour cream but good. The place seems clean, I even saw 2 groups of people dining in. The people that make the food were average young people i didnt see anything dirty, but its not like i stuck my head in stared as they prepared my food...

I must have a strong stomach since its been 3 hrs and I'm ok.. 
Maybe people are just over critical? Or it just seems like the type of people to always have a grudge against fastfoods somehow ends up rating it... Pretty much disgusted before even walking in... Its taco bell what did u expect? If you are the type of person that gets sick from eating at here in the first place no matter where u go, or have a bad attitude to begin with please dont drag the rest down with you. Anyways hopes this helps.

- just cuz im lactose tolerant... Should i rate the milk bad?
