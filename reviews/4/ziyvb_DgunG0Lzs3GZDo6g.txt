This gem of a restaurant will be in my "little black book" for the best that Phoenix has to offer.  Delicious food - a varied menu that would satisfy any epicurious diner!  Our group had everything from steak, chicken, fish and veggie entrees.  No complaints - we all left happy (and full!).  Small intimate dining room with plenty of charm and wonderful wait staff.

This one is a keeper.
