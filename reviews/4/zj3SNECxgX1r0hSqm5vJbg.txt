While visiting the area I found Senor Tacos on yelp and decided to give it a go. Super yummy Mexican food in a setting comparitive to Rubios or Baja Fresh. Big menu, lots of choices at a reasonable price.
The salsa bar is yummy and while not huge, full of authentic taste! Great spot for a quick meal, or a cheap date!
