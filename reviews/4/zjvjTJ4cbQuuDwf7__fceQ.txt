One of my favorite spots in Vegas.  It's a little taste of Mexico with great service and even better margaritas! I was in town for Cinco De Mayo and was able to get a table pretty easily. They had a live mariachi band and specialty drinks to celebrate.  The tequila vodka fruit punch was like a sangria on crack and delicious.   Do yourself a favor and get off the strip for a great meal!
