Massive burritos, overflowing burrito bowls, freshly prepared salsa's and guacamole, it's not a dieter's first pick but it's a reasonable choice if you're in the market for a fast food Mexican joint. 

I'm just going to cut to the chase, the food is consistently good, hence my return visits when I'm feeling like being a fatty, I'm here today to rave about the customer service! 

Yes fellow Yelpers, I said Customer Service AND "rave" in the same sentence! It's rare to find these days and since most take the first opportunity to complain about things, I thought I'd take time out of my day, to compliment this establishment for their efforts in the quality service department. 

I tend to be a bit on the antisocial side of things so if I can order it online (which you can here at Chipotle), I'm all over it. Most human contact these days leads to disappointment in the service industries so I like to cut out the middle man and have online print outs and documentation; avoiding MOST ordering screw-ups. 

After we placed our office's online ordered, picked it up, devoured it, and resumed our work day, I received a telephone call from the store manager of Chipotle asking how our meal was! 

This being an extremely rare situation, I asked the Manager if he was kidding, if it was a joke as to why he was calling. I thought perhaps we under paid, something! Because no one calls just to see how everything tasted..WRONG! The Manager at the Henderson Chipotle location does! 

OK, this is a lengthy review regarding a telephone call, I get it, but boy I was surprised, in a GOOD way, and that is just something so special I just had to share. 

Decent food, average price, GREAT Customer Service :) 

(Hope it's a habit they continue to keep)
