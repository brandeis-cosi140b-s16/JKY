She was a past lover. I used to visit every Tuesday.. I decided to check on her. She's changed; charged me extra this time. A whole quarter more for her "fish taco." I told her: three, flour; chipotle and white sauce on the side, PLUS cilantro, AND Guac n chips. She complied, as I slipped the payment for the goods. I prepared the routine strategy. Handful of limes and four stacks of roasted chipotle sauce. No lemons. I waited for her arrival. The surprise lime embedded in every taco.. old moves, trying to play on my memories. She was different now, she changed. Yet, I still loved her. Not a bite wasted. It was done. I told myself I wasn't coming back next time; that it wasn't the same anymore. She smiled, she knew I would return, & at that very moment, I also knew.
