Ay Dios mio!  This place is good!!!

This is the second outlet of the original Tacos El Compita on Charleston and Jones  (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-compita-las-vegas)

The food is just as authentic and good as the original.  It is much smaller then the original with less seats so if you go during lunch or dinner rush you may have to wait for a seat.  That contributed to the half-star deduction as well as the fact they do not have aguas frescas or fresh jalapenos both of which they have at the original location.

I think the tripas are my fav here.  But everything else is so good - the carnitas, buche, lengua are all excellent.

I want to try the caldos here, someone next to us had some menudo that looked really good.  

I tried the cemitas and am not a huge fan because I didn't love the bread.  and unfortunately I believe it's the same bread for the tortas, but I'll have to try next time.
