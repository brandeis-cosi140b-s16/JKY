The burritos aren't 3.99 anymore (it's $6 and change) but it was good! I got the carnitas burrito. The tortilla was toasted to perfection (which I've never had it like that except for when you get a quesadilla) and the inside was very tasty. I also got to try to asada burrito which was given to me by accident. The meat was a but too salty. All in all, Id definitely go back again for the carnitas burrito!
