Cabo offers attentive SERVICE with a smile and not just by one server but by everyone who we come in contact with. The salsa bar is a very good value, the chips are hot and fresh and there's pretty much a salsa for all tastes. The $7.99 taco deal is good but I really like the cheese enchiladas as unlike elsewhere in Vegas they actually taste really good. The margaritas are good, we had a mixologist with us who threw a challenge at the bar and they made her specified drinks for all of us perfectly. 

If you look at my reviews I always find a negative to toss in. Cabo is an exception, I have nothing but positive praise for this place. Also my 2 year old can give a review of the tableside guacamole. He left the bowl it came in, but not much else.
