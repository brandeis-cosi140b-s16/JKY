Wanted to check out this place for a while now. We had friends from out of town and why not here. Started ordering food, we waited a while for it. Then they got my wife's order wrong. Made her another one waited another 10m for it. The food was actually pretty good. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5* because she brought out the wrong order and service was ok.
