I came here yesterday with my friend for lunch.  As of now I will give The Mission 4.5 stars out of 5 only because we did not have any entrees, we split several appetizers, so I can't give that extra half star or even maybe take that half star away.

   We split the brisket torta, which was heavenly.  After my first bite I was in love.  The aji amarillo sauce I could spread all over everything I eat.  Next we had the Almejas Al Vapor and all I have to say is that this soup is transcendental.  I have never tasted anything like this before.  The broth is a yellow pepper base and I never knew you could get this type of sublime flavor from a yellow pepper.  Clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, pan de yucca, aji amarillo, and roast corn.  Please bring me more of this delicious soup!!!

   Then our bartender / waiter brought us out a complimentary order of the grilled street corn.  I do have to say that I am not a fan of spicy food whatsoever but the chile paprika and cojita sauce was done so tastefully that I extremely enjoyed it.

   The decor, is intimate.  This is a place you would love to take someone to impress them.  Candle holders carved out of Peruvian sea salt, a classy act right there.  Somber atmosphere, at tentative and attractive waitstaff.  Attractive food and an all around great time.  I will be back soon and if not for anything but the soup I will be a very, very happy man.
