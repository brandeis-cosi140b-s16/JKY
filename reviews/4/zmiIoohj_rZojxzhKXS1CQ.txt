La Hacienda has some of the most authentic street tacos in town.  I brought my friend from Mexico here and he fell in love.  Warm, fresh, corn tortillas filled with freshly grilled carne asada, pollo asada, and al pastor, and served with a bar of salsas, cilantro, and onion.  

The smells come from about a block away, and the al pastor is cooked on a rotisserie located outside that brings people in just from the sight of it.  Can't blame them, their Al Pastor is what makes this place so special.  Marinated pork layered with pineapple and cooked on a rotisserie?  While it's really hard to mess up Al Pastor, it's also really hard to make Al Pastor that I love, and La Hacienda does it.  While it may be in a random spot of town, it's worth the trip!
