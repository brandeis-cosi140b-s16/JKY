I've spent many a night with Rob (that's the fancy name I share with my friends). When you ask someone if they've been to Roberto's, more than likely the response is "yeah that's where I go after a night of drinking". I'm here to tell you, you should try it when you are sober so you can remember how delicious it is. The menu is incredibly cheap, $2.05 for a chicken taco! Make that $.99 on Wednesdays!  Here are a few of my favorite menu items;

Super nachos (no carne) my second favorite nachos in town (peppermill is my first)
Breakfast burrito- this is a dos manos kinda burrito
Tacos-love them
Tortas-love them too
I'm not a menudo fan, but I hear theirs is good 

I'm obsessed with the spicy pickled carrots at the condiment bar. I given myself many times devouring these. You could approach the counter and just ask them to put a bag of food together, and you really couldn't go wrong.

This place is always clean. They serve Pepsi products (only downfall here). I love Rob!
