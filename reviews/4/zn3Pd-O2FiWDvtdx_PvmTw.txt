Stopped by Bajio's for lunch today for the sake of trying something new.  I had the chicken stuffed quesadilla which just happened to be the daily special at $6.99.  A coworker had a sweet green chili quesadilla which sounded strange but tasted very good as well! The portions were plentiful so you will not leave hungry.  I will definitely returning to try out some more menu items.

And yes.......the random bell ringing/pot clanging was a little obnoxious...
