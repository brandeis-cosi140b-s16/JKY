As late night, greasy, inexpensive Mexican food goes, this place is my favorite. A side (a HUGE) side of chips is only .50 cents. The tortas have generous slices of avocado, where most places really skimp in that area. The fish is golden brown: not grey. The pulled beef is cooked with onions and peppers, which is fantastic. 
Love love. 
Four stars because it's only open until ten on week nights. And they only have one cook if you go there late, so the wait is a little obnoxious. But taste makes up for it.
Call in before hand and they'll have it ready to go! The people are so nice too.
