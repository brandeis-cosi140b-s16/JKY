For 8 years I have been meaning to give La Unica a try.  Well, I finally did and I am so disappointed that I waited so long!!!   I went during lunch hours on a Thursday and it was busy, but was able to get a seat right away.  I had a Carnitas Taco and a Chorizo taco and a side of rice.  Everything was fantastic!  I wonder if they make their own Chorizo because it tasted better/fresher than any store-bought Chorizo I have ever tasted.  The chips and salsa were good, but I had to mix the medium and hot to come up with something tolerable for my "not too hot" taste.  Prices were great ($1.95 per taco and $1.99 for the rice), service was acceptable, and the food came out quickly.  I can't wait to go back!!
