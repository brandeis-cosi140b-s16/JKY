My friends and I went in because they were next to a shop on Mill, to our delight, it was Really good!  Some of us are vegetarian and they had quite a selection. The Clara burro and beans were awesome. For the non vegetarians in the group they loved the special chicken Mole, and great flan for desert. Although my friend got the last flan, apparently it goes fast, it would be a bummer if they were out and you came for it. Our waitress Sherry was really nice! Not fancy atmosphere for an impressive date, but very clean.  And they serve Beer. Will try to make this a future stop again.
