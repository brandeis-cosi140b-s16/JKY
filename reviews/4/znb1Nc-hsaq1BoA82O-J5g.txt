More and more, 7th Street is becoming the street to be on. Terrific restaurants continue to pop up, and even more are being built as I type! Otro is no exception to that. It's a great little casual dining spot with delicious food and awesome ambiance; it's perfect for a date. If you're a fan of Gallo Blanco, you're going to be familiar with what Otro has to offer.

Mexican beer, wine, cocktails, tacos, chips, guacamole and tasty salsas... All were had, and all were yummy. The al pastor and carne asada tacos are choice! While the al pastor was sweet and savory, the carne asada was tender and scrumptious! They know what they're doing, so you shouldn't be disappointed with Otro's taco game. Complementary chips and salsas are always a nice touch, and when paired with Otro's freshly made guacamole, be prepared for food baby status because you won't be able to stop picking at them! With all that goodness shared, I have one gripe.. I ordered a michelada, and Otro's only comes with beer and lime juice. I was hoping for some spicy tomato juice with it, but c'est la vie...

Otro is worth a visit, and I'll be back in the near future for sure. I'm already craving some of those delicious tacos and salsas. To all my foodies, get off your butts and go check it out.
