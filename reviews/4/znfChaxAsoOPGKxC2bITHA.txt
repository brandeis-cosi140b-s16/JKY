Awesome. Great scene. Cool decor. Very interesting tapas menu. Deep fried crab claws w/ verde aoli and veal/pork meatballs in a chili sauce were the best. The octopus was a bit tough. I've had better. Ceviche was tasty. House mad tortilla chips were very good. Staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.
