If you were lucky enough to grow up in Mesa Arizona, then you probably love Matta's. One of the saddest days of my life was when I heard they were closing on Main Street. I was excited when they decided to open a couple of other locations. The food is still the same taste we've all grown up on... but I miss the "restaurant" experience. This new location feels more like a fast food with the walk-up-to-the-counter and order first vibe. Best salsa in the universe!
