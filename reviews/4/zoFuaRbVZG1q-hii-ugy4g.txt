This is our favorite little neighborhood Mexican food place.  Family owned and staffed.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Lots of available parking.  A couple TV's with sporting events always on.  Good chips and salsa and really tasty guacamole!  Nothing fancy but always clean, comfortable, and friendly.

My husband rates a Mexican food joint on the strength of its bean burritos and after searching far and wide, has decided this place makes one of his favorites -- which he always gets with chile verde sauce.  He also likes their chile rellenos.  Being vegetarian, I like their quesadillas and enchiladas...but when I was still a meat eating kinda gal, liked their chicken chimichangas and shrimp tacos.  

They are closed on Mondays but open every other day from 11am-9pm (8pm Sundays).  They also offer stamp cards for frequent diners -- pick one up, rack up some stamps, and get a free meal!
