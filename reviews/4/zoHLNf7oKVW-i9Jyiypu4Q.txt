First time here, will return!

Gran Agave has been recommended several times but never had the chance to try it until today.  We were not disappointed.  The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa is not overpowering with heat and the chips are the dense type.  

The enchiladas, with the four different kinds were very good and very tasty.  Not spicy, but with flavor.  The chicken fajita was huge and sizzling.  

The service was very good and the restaurant, although small, was very inviting.

We will definitely return.
