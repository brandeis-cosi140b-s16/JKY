Went here for a group lunch with my coworkers.  I got the grits and the catfish tacos.  My coworkers got the taco trio, the mac and cheese, chicken wings and the chicken in a cone appetizer.  We had hoped the chicken in a "waffle cone" would actually be a folded waffle but it was a waffle cone made for ice cream.  The tacos were awesome we all agreed.  As other yelpers have mentioned, a greater variety of hot sauce would have been nice.  The chicken IN the waffle cone was perfectly cooked.  The catfish was perfectly cooked and so tasty.  We are all so sick of all fish being tilapia lately.  The mac and cheese, also as other yelpers have said, lacked flavor and we all had a taste but most of it was left. The macaroni was also overcooked. The manager came and asked how we liked everything and was very receptive to hearing the problems with the mac and cheese.  He said he could see that the noodles were mushy and would work to make sure that gets corrected. He was also receptive to the idea that the cheese needed a little more umph.  Like use sharp cheddar or something with more bite to match up with the jalapenos.  Our service was excellent and my male coworker loved all the TVs with the college hoops games going.  I will definitely go back and I think this place just needs to work out a few kinks.
