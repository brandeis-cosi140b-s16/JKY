BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!
A "small" queso is plenty for a group and is so delicious-- not just the typical, out-of-a-can white stuff you get at a regular place. You can tell they make it there and really put time into it.
Although it's not the cheapest place ever, all of the entrees could easily feed two, or be taken home for yummy leftovers. 

The margaritas are my only complaint-- so expensive!!!
