I'm new to the area. Just moved here from California. I've been craving some tacos and authentic Mexican food. My fiance and I decided to try this place. I ordered the three tacos special with beans and rice. I chose asada and tripas for the meat in my tacos. I have to say the red salsa is bomb. The rice is bomb. The beans are bomb. The asada is bomb. But I wasn't a fan of the tripas. I think they needed to be cut better and seasoned better. 

Next time I will be trying the asada fries!
