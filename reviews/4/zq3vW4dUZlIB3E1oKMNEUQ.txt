I was really surprised to find this little gem just a few blocks from the "Fremont Street Experience" - it is actually just across from El Cortez. The Yuca was amazing, as was my Cuban sandwich with huge hunks of meat. Beer was pricey for my taste - $5 bottles - especially when you can find $1 bottles down at the casinos (but I'm cheap). Love the atmosphere too. Definitely check this place out!
