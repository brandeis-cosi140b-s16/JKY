This is a nice place to go.  I was here around 3 en la manana, was the only party there.  Everything was clean.  

They are cash only.

From what I remember the carne asada fries were very very large.  They don't come with salsa, which I guess is common for non Los Angeles mexican restaurants from which I order carne fries from, but nevertheless you can add from salsa bar.  Comes with fries carne asada, cheese, gwak, sour cream, and a hint of refried beans (those are the mashed ones, not the whole beans).  

The rest of my party ordered: taco, tostada, and chimichanga.  All of these looked delicious as well.  Too bad I didn't get a bite.


Also tried the lingua tacos (cow tongue) that I did not order but was offered a bite.  They were pretty decent, for being tongue and for never trying them before.  Had the texture of soft beef brisket and tofu, but tasted like turkey.    

If you feed them to you cat you can say, "Cat got your tongue?"
