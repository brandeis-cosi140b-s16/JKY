This is my fav place to go eat mexican when I do not want to spend too much money. Food is cheap and beer is cheap on weekdays. They serve it in an ice cold glass. So refreshing!

I always get the veg tamales. SO good. Always have left overs and eat it for breakfast. Service is pretty good. Got to try the salsa verde, Got a great kick to it.
