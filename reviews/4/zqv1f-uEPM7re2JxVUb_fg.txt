Hostess was like a young model - I was stunned/caught off guard by her  looks - she asked "How many?" and I said "two adults and four kids" - problem is I only have two. LOL. Promptly seated and then Eddie, our server took over. Love their chips and salsa - the chips are like half taco shell size! The chicken taco salad and my onion and cheese enchiliada platter were both only $7.99 each. Huge portions and very good. Love their black beans with queso blanco. Parker turned five so we had the waiter gather his crew for a Birthday Song. Apparently you have to stand up and swirl a red napkin shouting "Toro, Toro!" He was brought a complementary brownie sundae. The waiter wanted to make sure that Parker wouldn't be too shy or embarassed before they did their thing; that was a nice touch. Our glasses never went empty. Solid food and effort from a chain restaurant.
