We were told to go here from the guys that work down the street. The place is one of those small hole in the wall places, but the food was decent. My hubby got the chorizo burrito and I the bacon. His burrito was really good, but my bacon was crispy and I hate crispy bacon...but I didn't tell them so I ate it anyway. I also wasn't too crazy about my eggs but I like well done scrambled, so not docking for that either. I think it just may be the owners working, cute nice older people...of course she was cooking :). Probably try something on their menu when in the area again.
