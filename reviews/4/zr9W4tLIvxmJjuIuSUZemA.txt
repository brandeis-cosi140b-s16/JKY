On a recent vacation to Mexico, my mom asked Jared and I where the best Mexican food in Phoenix was... This place immediately came to mind for us both!

When you walk into the door of Mariscos Playa Hermosa, you feel like you very well may be in Mexico.  It feels extremely authentic, with a festive atmosphere, a staff that doesn't speak too much English, and food that is delicioso!  It's nothing like the Americanized Mexican / Latin places  you've been to before. 

Don't load up on the chips and salsa as the portions are big and you'll want to save room for what is to come.  Their house iced tea is very good if you want something other than a cold cerveza.

As Annie D said in her review, I highly recommend going with the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce. You can't go wrong with that!  I ordered something else and ate off of Jared's Molcajete Caliente along with my own.  That sauce is incredible!

Note that this place closes early during the week.  We met some friends there at 7pm and at 8:20 we were the last ones in there and we could tell the staff was ready to go home.  

I can't wait to return to this local gem of a restauran for another memorable meal very soon.
