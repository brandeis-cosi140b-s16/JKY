The Mr. and Mrs., along with their children, first started eating at this restaurant when they were the El Vallarta (on Main Street in Pineville).  We have always been pleased with them, not only for their food and service, but for the general atmosphere of friendliness.  When they changed their name and ownership from El Vallarta to El Veracruz, we stayed with them, as not much changed.  When they moved from Main Street to their present location, we stayed with them.  The food is consistently good.  The Mr. recommends the enchiladas verdes and the quesadilla Veracruz.  The Mr. says the torta was good, but contains too many jalapenos.  He says next time he will request they leave them out.  The Mrs. finds that they are willing to accommodate alterations to her order, and very willingly too!  This makes her very happy.  Younger Son loves this restaurant. This is usually his first "go-to" choice.  When you are seated, a generous basket of chips and salsa is served.  The Mrs. finds the salsa too hot.  Unfortunately, the only alternative is something that tastes like thin marinara sauce, not quite what she has in mind when she requests "mild" salsa.  This means she winds up ordering either the cheese dip or the queso fundido (woe to her waistline).  Get the queso fundido!  A bowlful of yummy heaven-on-earth for your mouth.
The service is excellent; the servers always remember you; the owner is always  friendly.  It is good value for your money.
The Mr. and Mrs. (and Younger Son) highly recommend El Veracruz.
