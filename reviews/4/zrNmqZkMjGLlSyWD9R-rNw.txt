One day my hubs and I was looking for something different.  We are big fans of Mexican food in general and had this place bookmarked.  It's located in a strip mall plaza visible from the street.  Parking may be difficult during daylight hours, but we came towards closing hours.

My first impression of this place is wow, this place is modern and open.  It's not what you'd expect from a hole in a wall joint, which this is not.

I ordered the rib eye tacos and it did not disappoint.  Ample meat, perfectly moist, and those tortillas ...just amazing!  There's a condiment/sauce bar too.  I loved the red sauce because it was  not too hot.  Also, the fountain drink machine is located outside so that's another plus.

There are some flat LCD TVs too for your viewing pleasure.  For dessert, we shared a mango paleta (Mexican juice bars) and it was divine!!  They have a lot of other flavors too and they also sell ice cream.  When we come back, I hope to try some more.  Very good prices and great atmosphere.
