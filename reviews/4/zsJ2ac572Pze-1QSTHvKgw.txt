What a cool spot with an incredible view of the city! I have not had a chance to eat here yet but i did have the pleasure of drinking two delicious and perfectly made chamucos margaritas. Ill tell you, i am a true tequila lover and it is hard to find a good selection of tequila, let alone a good margarita and this place has both! 

Plus, the chips and salsa and dip they bring out are incredible!
