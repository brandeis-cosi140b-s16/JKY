The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The food was delicious. We started with the hummus appetizer. The pesto and blue cheese accompaniment was fantastic. The chipotle hummus  was average.  I had the rice noodles with scallops that was absolutely delicious. It was enough for two. My husband had the shrimp étouffée with collard greens he thought rivaled what we get in Louisiana. The manager dropped by our table to check on us and seemed really appreciative when we complemented his staff. We ended our 2+ hour dinner with dessert. The "banana foster" was delicious but it is made of apples just f.y.i. It does have a hint of banana in the sauce. It's more of a crisp and absolutely delicious. I had a flourless chile brownie. I like deep intense expresso flavors with a spicy kick so this one missed the mark for me but if you have a liking for a light airy brownie cake..this is a nice dessert.
