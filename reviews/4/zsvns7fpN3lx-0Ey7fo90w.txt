Really, really kinda diggin' this place!  Great, great location in Boca Park which I seem to drive by 5 times/day and closer to 15 on the weekends.  It sits in the same shopping area as Target, Starbucks, Justice (yes, I have two daughters), Total Wine, Tilly's and many other great places.  

The family dined here and though kids are not allowed on the patio (which looks waaaay cool and comfortable given the right temperature and no summer winds), the inside is very cool, SoCal and beachy!  I love it!  There are TVs scattered throughout for my sports loving husband so that's always a bonus too. 

We had the chicken tacos and Wahoo salad.  The Wahoo salad was great - not amazing, but I'd definitely have it again.  Hubby had the chicken tacos which he said were really good.  No real complaints -- the menu is pretty diverse, you can order a cheeseburger if that's what your tummy desires! My daughter had the kids quesadilla which she devoured, but quesadillas aren't exactly a trick to make. We also had the chips n salsa which also was fine, not the best, but it was fresh and not bottled which is always nice. 

One thing - thus the less one star . . . . this is Vegas and the place is not air conditioned!!  Ceiling fans abound, but cmon, its 100 degrees outside.  Hubby was sweating as he ate his tacos!!  Maybe it makes for more beer drinking, I'm not sure, but A/C would've earned the 5th star Wahoo!
