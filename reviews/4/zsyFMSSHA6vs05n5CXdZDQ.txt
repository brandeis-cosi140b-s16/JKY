What a beer for $3!  Yep, at Sir Veza's.  The help started by asking us if we wanted a quiet location which we did.  That's important because there's karaoke here.  We ordered a mix of drinks from wine to beer to margaritas.  All were good.  For dinner, I ordered a burrito covered in red sauce.  It was excellent and really too much for one person.  My wife had a pulled pork taco and a veggie taco.  Both tacos were good.  We choose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel but glad we found it.  We'll be back during the next Spring Training.
