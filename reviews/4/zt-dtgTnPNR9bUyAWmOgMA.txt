prices are a little too much for me, but the food flavors are definitely worth it.  I've enjoyed their food truckside, but this location is nice since it's close to work!  

I've had their lengua tacos which was done very softly since tongue can be very tough meat to cook, had their chicken papas verde and the thai chicken quesadilla.  All the food has been awesome and so delicious.  The guava/strawberry 'rita is my favorite and I've tried and have been unsuccessful at replicating it at home :(  Oh well, guess I'll have to stop by here to get my Luncha Fix.  

Chips are crunch and just the right amount of salt, and the salsa although not spicy, is still very tasty.
