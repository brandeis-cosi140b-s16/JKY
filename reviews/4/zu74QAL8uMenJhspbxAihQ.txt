Really have nothing but good things to say about this Rubio's or any for that matter. Their burritos are probably my favorite in the "fast casual" scene, especially the "Burrito especial" (with chicken) for me. They changed the recipe a year or so ago so I ask for it to be done the with the old recipe and with avocado instead of guacamole. Service is quick, quality is good (I've never gotten sick after eating anything there). They have a huge menu for those who are picky eaters and a large self serve salsa bar. I wish the salsa was a bit chunkier but I really can't complain otherwise. Only wish there were more Rubio's locations to be honest.
