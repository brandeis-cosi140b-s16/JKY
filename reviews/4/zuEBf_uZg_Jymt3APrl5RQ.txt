It's always a good sign when you want to eat at the same place twice in one week. 

Excited for a new Mexican restaurant in Surprise, my husband and I tried Las Fuentes twice this past week. The first time we were lured in with a coupon and I tried the Tostada Grande. It was more like a taco salad lax on the lettuce. It had a fried flour tortilla, a layer of beans, shredded beef, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream. It was indeed "grande" and hit the spot. Fast forward a few nights later and I sent the hubby out to get something to bring back for dinner. We decided to try their "Grande platter for two" and we were not disappointed. Once again the servings were large and the food was tasty. We were particularly impressed with the enchiladas and the chicken tostada. 

The salsa tastes very similar to Macayos, but other than that the food definitely has a little bit more love put into it that some of the other choices around town.
