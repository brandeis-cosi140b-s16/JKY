Love that they serve ceviche and chips as a complimentary appetizer. Guacamole is really fresh and phenomenal. I had grilled shrimp and steak tacos. Can't really go wrong with those. The down side is my friend had the camarones a la plancha and the shrimp were over cooked. I've been there other times and the food has always been great. I would go again.
