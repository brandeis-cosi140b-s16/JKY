I've been here a number of times for both burgers and tacos.  Both offerings are delicious and the old school burger stand feel is on-point.   Recently we discovered Mondays for burgers and complimentary fries, which is an awesome bonus considering the prices aren't exactly the cheapest in town.  The burgers are bomb but the tacos are the unsung hero of this menu (both in value and tastiness).  Try them - you'll be happy you did.
