This has become one of my go to lunch spots. I love how everything is fresh and made to order right in front of you. The homemade tortillas are delicious. There are many different combinations of items you can get from burritos, enchiladas, salads, tacos, all the usual mexican favorites. 

I usually go with a salad or tostada. The house dressing is a creamy tomatillo that is totally addicting. They also have some of the best nachos I've ever had. Completely covered in cheese and then piled with beans, sour cream and guac. Mmmmmm. I also get the salsa fresca which I could just drink! 

Don't forget dessert. The coconut flan and tres leches are awesome. They top them with whipped cream and strawberries, are you hungry yet??

They also have a large drink bar with sodas, horchata and the famous mint limeade. The food and service is almost always consistent. Try to avoid the lunch hour (1200-1) but even then they get you through pretty quickly.
