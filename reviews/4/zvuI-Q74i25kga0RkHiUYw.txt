I went here for dinner since my friend said the the location in Cave Creek was one of her favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley. However, living in Phoenix and Scottsdale, we decided to go to the Fountain Hills location. Plus, another friend lives there so it was a more central location for all of us. 

We arrived around 7 and it wasn't crowded at all, we got a table right away. We got chips and salsa to start which was perfect since I was really hungry with it being way past my dinner time. One of the girls got a pomegranate margarita and she said that it was really sweet but good. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious. Probably the best fish taco I've had. I was expecting some sort of fried fish, probably cod. I was pleasantly surprised that it was grilled and the two tacos came wrapped up in the foil pouch they were cooked in. It also had this really good sauce. The hard shell tacos that my friends got also looked really good. The shell looks homemade, fried, and super crispy. My friend asked for extra cheese which they brought out in a small dipping bowl. She was also charged extra for this. The tacos didn't come with that much cheese to begin with, so that's kind of a rip-off. The price isn't that cheap either, I would definitely say it's on the pricey side.  

The atmosphere was just okay. I was reading how it's the most romantic location, etc. but maybe they're just referring to the Cave Creek location. All of the employees were nice and even took a group photo of us at the end since my friends were visiting from all over. I definitely want to go to the Cave Creek location in the future to see what all the fuss is about, but it'll definitely be more of a special occasion thing since it's definitely a hike from Scottsdale. In the mean time, I'll stick to my other local favorites for tacos.
