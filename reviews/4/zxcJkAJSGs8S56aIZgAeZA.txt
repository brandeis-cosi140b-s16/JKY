We decided to give Rosita's a second chance and I'm glad we did!  

The chips and salsa are excellent here. 

I ordered the Monday night special - chicken fajitas burro and it was delicious. Much better than anything I've ever ordered in the past. It came with rice and beans that were.....fine. The rice could use some help.

One person in our party ordered the green corn tamales - she did not care for them. My husband said the fajitas beef burro was good. My daughter inhaled her kid's grande plate that was fill of mini tacos, tostada, rolled tacos, etc.  My son ordered the beef chimi. He said it was good, but soggy. 

I definitely agree with other reviewers - this place needs a major face lift and deep cleaning. The restrooms are a disaster. 

Very casual atmosphere. The service was fine, but not great.  Nothing to compliment but nothing do big as to complain.
