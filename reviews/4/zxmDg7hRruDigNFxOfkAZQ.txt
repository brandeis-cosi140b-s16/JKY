Good food and excellent service. They have an extensive vegetarian menu which is a nice break from the typical "side salad solution" at most restaurants. I thought the food was very flavorful and the restaurant looks clean enough. That said, the recent 95.0 sanitation rating leaves a little to be desired. Good lunch choice - particularly for the "meat averse".

While maybe not the most authentic or the absolute best Mexican you're ever going to find, the food is good and it's an excellent choice for lunch and an alternative that's sorely needed in Mint Hill. I really hope this restaurant works out where so many others have failed in the same space.
