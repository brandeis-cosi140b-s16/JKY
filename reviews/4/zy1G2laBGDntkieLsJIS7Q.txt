pool time, sun, munchies....pull out phone, tap Yelp app....Rubios! Rubios is coincidentally, a  usual freebie at Yelp events so we knew we could get reliable, tasty food there. 

the wife and i both ordered fish tacos....i had the blackened mahi. the tacos were tasty and small enough to be just right and not too much food. the fish was tender and juicy, and with the many small cups of the variety of sauces they offer for free, a gringo taste explosion was limited only by one's imagination. 

thanks for good, quick food Rubios!
