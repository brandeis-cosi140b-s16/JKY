Top notch, from the soup and chips to the shrimp seafood platter for two, food was great. Machine tortillas was my only complaint, so that ain't too bad.

They make a solid michelada too.

Banda live music is badass, loud,so not much of a place for a family get together or intimate meal...

37 minutes drive for me and I would gladly do it again.
