Taco & Tequila Cantina Grill is new to Matthews. I think this location used to be an Italian restaurant, then a different Mexican restaurant, and is now home to Taco & Tequila Cantina Grill. It is right next to the Matthews Post Office, and across the street from Finz. The parking lot is small, but there is additional parking around the back of the building. Inside, they have a bar that you can sit at to enjoy some food, drinks, and tv, along with large seating areas. The service was efficient and friendly. The menu is not too big, unlike a lot of Americanized Mexican restaurants. When I go to a new place I like to know what the staff's favorite menu item is, usually their pick entices me to stray from my "norms" and pick something different. I asked the waitress what her pick of the menu was and she had no answer for me, she did not know. We started off with the bean and cheese dip, then, since the waitress did not have a favorite, I went with what I knew, the two enchilada and one taco combination. This came with refried beans and rice. The bean and cheese dip had great flavor, and was very addicting; the basket of chips disappeared before my eyes! The meal came out quickly, hot, flavorful, and generously portioned. My boytoy said the enchiladas were some of the best he's had around town. The beef had a lot of flavor and wasn't dry, and the enchilada sauce had all the right flavors. The service was friendly, food good, and prices fair. If you are in the area, stop in and check it out! We'll be back!
