We always ask for Gloria when we visit. She is a sweet, Hispanic lady who loves to call everyone "baby."

Of course, you get free chips and salsa. I love the salsa in the squeeze tube. It is freakin' addicting. The beef tacos, as well as, the sonoran enchiladas are my favorites. Beef taco is straight up yummy and on the greasy side, good amount of beef and cheese. The sonoran enchilada is a gordita with enchilada sauce, cheese, and green olives. Their rice and beans are pretty good. When we are all in a drinking mood we will grab a pitcher of Marg's. 

Inside it is your typical Mexican decor - bright colors, Mexican pots and pictures, and that kinda thing.
