Why am I reviewing Taco Bell of all places? It's because I patronize them more than all restaurants combined. It's my go to place for dinner on fly, the quick, "I'm STARVING to death, I need to eat NOW!" place. Sure they are certainly not the only place around us for fast food but they are the cheapest and most convenient (and IMHO the tastiest!)

As of this moment they have brought back the Chicken Flatbread Sandwich. Chicken, melty cheese, chipotle sauce and flat bread - Yum. It's got just a bit of a kick, but it sure satisfies those evening munchies. I'm a big bread and cheese fan so I like the Nacho Cheese Chalupas. Yeah, I can go cheapo processed cheese and at the same time still like Camembert as well! Ah, and as far as cheese goes I am still waiting for them to bring back the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito. I think out of all their concoctions, that one is probably my favorite.

This particular Taco Bell is very fast, has only messed up one of our orders once in the entire two years we've gone there and they are very cheerful. You will never want for condiments.
