Wait staff very friendly.  Food good.  Portions small but that's okay because they gave us plenty of chips and salsa to fill up on.  Kinda of slow to bring the check which is fine if you feel like relaxing for a bit. Overall not too bad.  Very nice and clean restaurant.  Great location. Was happy to spend time with family.  Dog friendly patio was a plus.
