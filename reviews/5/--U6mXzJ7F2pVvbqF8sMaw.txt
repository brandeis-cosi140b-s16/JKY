It's a Taco Bell so if your expecting a detailed review on their menu look elsewhere. It's the same shit they are serving at all the other locations. 
Review is on the customer service.
Super nice and friendly staff that goes above and beyond. I come here occasionally but always drive thru. Is it only me that seems to always get their drive thru order wrong?? This is the only place that has always got it right.
