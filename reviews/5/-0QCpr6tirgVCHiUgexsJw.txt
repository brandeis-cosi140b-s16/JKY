Great Mexican on Park St! We tried the pollo, asada, and carnitas with flour tortillas, beans, and veggies, and all of them were seasoned perfectly and very tasty. You get to pick the ingredients laid out right in front of you, and they don't skimp on the quantity. Chips and guacamole was also well done. The place isn't fancy, but the food is great and very inexpensive. Don't miss this one!
