This by far is one of the best Mexican restaurants. I've eaten lunch and dinner at Azteca numerous times. I would recommend anyone to try it. I can guarantee you'll love it. There are a variety of choices on the menu, but may I also add the wait staff provides outstanding service. I eat here at least once a week. I wish this place got more recognition. I've had chalupas and deluxe burrito. Both plates are under $10, yet have more than enough food.
