In what is a struggle for many of my fellow Arizonan's who live on the West Side , its an eternal struggle finding an abundance of solid cuisine west of the I-17. Speaking from the perspective of a gringo married to a Mexican wife with no need to go out for mexican food because it gets cooked for me every night, look no further then La Perla's for your Mexican Food fix. 

As with any other review, I think its only fitting to get straight to the point and lead you in the right direction so you dont even need to look at the menu. ORDER THE MOLE ORDER THE MOLE. Did I mention the Mole was delicious? If you wanna switch things up, close your eyes and let your finger dive bomb into the menu. Wherever your finger lands, you're assured to order something delicious. ENJOY!!

P.S.: DEEP FRIED ICE CREAM!!!!!!
