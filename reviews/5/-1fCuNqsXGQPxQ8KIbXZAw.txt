I love this location! The girl taking my orders was super nice and really helpful. The manger was great too.

I used a birthday coupon and the order was made to perfection. I got the veggie burrito with no rice and more veggies! No extra charge and they really stuffed it with the veggies.

This is the best Rubios experience I've had - recommend this location in the future!
