We decided to check out this new restaurant and we were happy !! My wife loves island food and she was so pleased ! The crew was extremely friendly and very helpful they gave us samples to try and explained how the meals work !! We met Josh the general Manger and he was so nice ! The food is fresh and friendly and soooooo good ! We found our new go to spot !! If you like Hawaiian food, this is the place to go.
