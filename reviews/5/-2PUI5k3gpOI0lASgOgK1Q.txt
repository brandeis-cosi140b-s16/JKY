Great food and the people are friendly.  Seems like a family affair which I like.  It looks like the place is newly re-decorated.  The kitchen and the dining area are very clean.  They have hit sauce in bottles if you dine in, which I really like.  The bean and cheese burrito is fantastic! They actually add some flavor ro their beans.  The potato egg and cheese is great also.  They use real potatoes instead of chopped up french fries.  The family lives this place and its a regular spot for us.  I would definitely give it a try.  Dont let the size of the place or location scare you off.
