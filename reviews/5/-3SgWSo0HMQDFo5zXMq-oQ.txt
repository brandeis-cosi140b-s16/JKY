Only positive to say about this place! (Okay maybe one mild negative, if you can call it that.) 
Their food is delightful, very spicy but definitely authentic. I went on a search after finding out what a tlacoyo was and found this gem. It's in a mini "strip mall" not really but that's all I got, next to a 7-11. You go for the food not the ambiance. 
Only downside was I am trying to learn Spanish and went in a spoke to the women on Spanish...not Spanglish, Spanish...and she would only respond to me on English. I wasn't trying to offend, I really just want to practice my skillz!
Check this place out if you're on the area, have a taste for spicy food and want real Mexican, not that chipotle filibertos garbage. Yum.
