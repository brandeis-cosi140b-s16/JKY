Well, what a different review this is going to be from the one I wrote about Paradise Bakery on Friday. The quality of our food was excellent even if it was only "fast food". Our order was a little slow coming out, but we didn't mind as my husband & I were not in any hurry.  They were a little under staffed. When we got our food, it was hot and delicious. I'd like to commend the general manager who was such a nice young man. He made a point to come by our table and chat with us. He also gave us a voucher to use next time we visit because of our wait. He certainly has a bright future involving any aspect of customer service. I hope he gets promoted to corporate. I've spent much more money at expensive restaurants and not received the type of good service this young man provided. I'm only sorry I don't know his name to write it in my review.
