We also checked yelp for Mexican. I filtered for 5 star and Jefe's came up. My Mom and I drove to the Sinclair to check it out. Just as stated before,  they ask you your name and if you want to be a regular. The staff was courteous and Ben, the manager,  was on his A game with customer service!  The food is excellent, and we'll definitely be back! ! Try it for yourself and see what you think!
