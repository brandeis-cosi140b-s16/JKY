When I review a restaurant, I start with the food and work down (service, decor, etc. come AFTER food when making my review.)

The food here is OFF THE CHARTS.  The staff was friendly, and the decor was nice with outdoor seating available.  

I will be returning here whenever I am in Phoenix area...heck, if I am in New Mexico I might have to make it happen.
