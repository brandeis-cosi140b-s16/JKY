Came all the way from Socal to hopefully watch the Rams beat the Cardinals tomorrow.  

Glad we found this place on yelp. We ordered the asada plate, asada and pastor tacos, birria, chicken quesadilla and Mexican sushi roll. The meats are very flavorful and the house sauce is amazing.  The combination of asada/fried rice/sushi works really well. Definitely one of the best mexican food my family has had.

Drinks wise, we had the limon, pina and of course the bottled coke. Can't beat good ole pina

The male cashier and the lady who brought us the food are very friendly.

The family and I will definitely drop by again when in the Phoenix/Glendale area
