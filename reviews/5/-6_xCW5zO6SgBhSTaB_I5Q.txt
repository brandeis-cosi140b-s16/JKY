How can you not like this place?  It is in a great location in downtown Mesa.  It has inside and outside seating.  It has a diverse menu.  The service is great in the form it is delivered - you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  My experience was a bit different.  I ordered a Killer Burrito and took it home and put it in the refrigerator for consumption the next morning before participating in the Tour de Mesa - a 72 mile bike ride north and east of Mesa.  Even the next morning, the burrito was tasty, fresh and filled with all kinds of delicious goodies.  I got chicken for the meat choice and it was grilled just right and was of high quality.  The staff at Mango's are very friendly and seem to welcome everyone as if they had been there 100 times.  Of particular note was the number of single diners above 50 years of age.  This indicates to me that the food is healthy and reasonably priced and the restaurant provides a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.
