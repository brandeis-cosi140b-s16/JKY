I think the shopping center this is located in goes unnoticed.

Braddah's has so much potential! They just need a steady crowd to keep the food running out. The location by UNLV is always busy and they kill it!

The staff here is awesome and so friendly.

I did notice however that when I come in there's always one or more dirty tables, like they forget to wipe them down- but I know they aren't too busy so pick it up kids!

Any ways, I'll keep coming back if you keep making those pig tacos & bark!!!
