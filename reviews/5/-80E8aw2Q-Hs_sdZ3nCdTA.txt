Habanero's has excellent food and outstanding prices, making it one of my very favorite stops in Madison for a quick and delicious bite to eat. Service is friendly and Chipotle-style, and if you're like me you'll need some of pretty much EVERYTHING on your burrito! I love that Habanero's offers a local alternative to Chipotle (shop local eat local people!) and I love LOVE that they use local and organic ingredients in their food. If I were an octopus, I'd give Habanero's eight tentacles up... but alas, I am a mere human with cravings for good Mexican food, so I'll have to settle with two thumbs up. ;)
