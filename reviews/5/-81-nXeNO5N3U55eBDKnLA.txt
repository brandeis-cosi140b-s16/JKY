TOP NOTCH CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! While at the counter, Manny was speaking with other customers and he quickly replied "sir, I'll be right with you in a moment." This is good customer service right here and the acknowledgment goes a long way. I ended up getting the carne asada/pollo asada tacos and the rolled tacos. They are generous with their portions, fair with their prices and the food is absolutely delicious. 

Manny also took the time to offer me one of their beverages and discussed a brief history of the business. They really care about their customers and go out of their way to make you feel at home. The location is inside a gas station so don't let that deter you from giving them a try. I have found my FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Vegas and I'll definitely be returning. Thank you Manny!
