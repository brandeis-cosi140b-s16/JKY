This is in the space that used to be Diego's in the MGM grand. We were impressed by the service (knowledgeable and friendly), flavors (traditional Sonoran) and overall value. It's hard to find a family meal in a strip hotel these days that's good quality but doesn't set you back well over $100. Hecho is just opening and so they are working a few kinks out, but don't miss the table-side prepared guacamole and / or their ginormous nachos!
