If you don't rate this place 5-stars then you haven't actually experienced this place.

First, I'm a lover of all things beer. Second, I'm a lover of all things Tex-Mex. Third, they got it right all the way down the line.

I went in first just to have some beers. Adrian (spelling? Ack!) served me and was laid back and didn't say much but was quick on the draw when he saw my beer go low. Thanks! ;)

I left and then went back again to finish what I started. Whew, bad idea. Sort of. I said I'd need to sleep there after all the beer and food I was about to consume and Adrian so generously offered up a hammock hanging behind me, what a pal!

I ordered some more beer (Belgian) and told Adrian that I loved all things Belgian. While commiserating with me he asked if I'd ever tried a Japanese beer (I believe) or another Belgian, I believe. I hadn't, but they looked so good that I promised I'd be back to try them again soon. I trust this man implicitly. 

I asked about food and he highly recommended I try the carne asada tacos. Well, okay! I asked if they made guac and he said they did. I wanted thick and chunky and he said 'whatever you want.' Well, whatever I wanted was exactly what I got. 

The carne asada had a spicy bite to it, but was still chunky and slightly chewy in the fabulous corn tortillas. I got four and that was almost too much (for like $6 -- with guac!!). I couldn't stop eating the chips they served with my meal. I almost started dunking them in my beer. I'm positive they would have tasted great that way too!

All I know is that I walked out of that place thinking 'damn, I hope they don't get sick of me because I'm coming back and may never leave.' 

Whatever you do, ask for Adrian. Great guy. Beer smart, food smart, super awesome smart. I took his advice on everything and he came through with flying colors. You are the best!

The food, the beer, the atmosphere - don't miss it. Really.
