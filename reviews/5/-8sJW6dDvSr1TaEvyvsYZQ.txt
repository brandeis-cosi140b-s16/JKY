I've lived in the area for 4 months and I decided tonight that I wanted to try Brushfire Tacos y Tapas and I am glad that I did.  I had the Grilled Marinaded Chicken Burrito and I made it a "Flight".  A Flight is when you add chips, salsa, a drink and a Tapa.  The Tapa I chose was the chicken empanada.  They have 5 choices of salsas.  I went with the Brushfire which was their second most hottest.  

The service was quick and the food was absolutely excellent!!  

I highly recommend it.  And when you go, try the Horchata.  That was a first for me to.  I think that I am hooked.
