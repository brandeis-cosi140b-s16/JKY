This little place is AMAZING! The food is cooked fresh as you order, I had the chicken adobada burrito, with guacamole and pico de gallo. Got to say the burrito not only tasted amazing, but the chicken was so tender and juicy that it left me begging for more. 

Their salsa bar has 4 different types of salsa, pickled carrots and jalapenos, lemon and some othher stuff. I tried the green and chuncky red salsa, they were really good. 

My only complaint is that I didn't find this place sooner...
