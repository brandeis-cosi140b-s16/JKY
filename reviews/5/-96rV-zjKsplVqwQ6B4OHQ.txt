You know what I love?!  Walking into a place not expecting much and getting blown the heck away.  I mean, BLOWN AWAY.

I yelp for places like this.  A mile and a half away from me, how on earth didn't my spidey senses kick in and draw me to the tacos?!

Okay, seriously.... Sabor is 100%, hands down, the absolutely best taco place I have ever been.  Mind blown, mouth blown, stomach blown... all of it.

Disclaimer: this place looks like a run of the mill grill on the outside.  I was seriously considering going across the street to get pizza because I totally judged a book by the cover.  Man am I glad I didn't get pizza.

First perk, they have a full bar - surprise surprise!  And an alarming number of delicious craft brews + a cocktail menu.  

Second perk, the food.  Wow woo wee wah.  I got the autenticos taco with shredded chicken and the Arepa.  

Third perk, the pineapple habanero salsa.  This salsa was literal heaven in a cup.  Creamy and sweet with a hint of spice.  I mean I wanted to make love to this salsa... and put it on all of the things for the rest of my life.

Fourth - it's quick, it's easy and it's really, really affordable.  I got a taco, the arepa and guac for about $11 and it was more food than I could eat.

Overall Sabor was an absolute delight.  And my diet is not happy about it.
