I'ts Comfort! I'm back once again this time writing on this resturant that is another hidden gem in Las Vegas!!! This was the first time that I had been at this location and I had passed it up a few times because wasn't quite sure what to expect but I was suprised and really enjoyed the cleanliness of this small yet homey resturant.

I was able to taste the meats before I purchased a "Taco Salad"that was excellent!!!! (I love taco salad's) so this was a treat for me it had just enough combined fresh igredents that the flavors complemented each other and it wasn't overpowering. 

I would recommend the "Super Burrito" as well so if you are driving down Eastern Avenue before you get to the freeway underpass on Pebble check out the "SUPER BURRITO" you will get your monies worth and leave with a full stomach.

Tell em' Comfort sent ya!

Say hello to Henry for me (Manager) He's cool, honest and very courteous!!!
