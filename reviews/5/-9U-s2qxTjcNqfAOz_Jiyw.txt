The service was amazing- and not solely due to not being as busy.  They were accommodating and attentitive in addition to having amazing soup and salsa to start out the meal.  I would recommend the hotter salsa due to better flavor than the regular just ask the server for the hotter stuff.  We did the 3 item combo definitely recommend the cheese enchilada and chili verde burrito.  They smother the cheese enchilada with cheese.
