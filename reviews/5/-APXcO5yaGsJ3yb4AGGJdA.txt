For my wife and I, this is our favorite place to eat in all of Charlotte. 
The food is authentic mexican and is so delicious!  

I feel that you can usually get a feel for the quality of the restaurant as soon as they bring you the chips and salsa.  Many other places in town bring watery salsa and so-so chips.  Not Maria's.  Excellent fresh made chips and delicious, spicy salsa that seems to have been made that day and has some chunkiness, not just a watery cup. 

All of the food is great!  My wife loves the tacos and fajitas.  I can't get enough of the Chile Rellenos.  Taco bowls are excellent.  There is really nothing bad on the menu.  
They usually have a special on mexican beers on the weekend also.  

We visit Maria's almost every week.
