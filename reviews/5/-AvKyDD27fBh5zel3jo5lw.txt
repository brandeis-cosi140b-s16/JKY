Always good take-away Mexican food!  

We come here all the time and on this particular visit I got a grilled shrimp salad with avocados, onions, tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers.  My husband got a huge bean and cheese burrito and our young daughter got the carne asada fries; crisp french fries smothered in delicious carne asada, cheddar cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  (Shhh...don't tell anyone, the carne asada fries were really for mommy, that healthy salad was just a ruse..)

Everything was hot and delicious, as usual.  We love this place!
