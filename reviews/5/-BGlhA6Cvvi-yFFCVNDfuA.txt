Oh my god! The closest to authentic moms Mexican food I've ever tasted! I had a chicken & pork enchilada with salsa verse drizzled all over just like I like it. & surprisingly the beans which are bland at most Mexican restaurants, were very tasty. Five stars for really yummy not your average Mexican food!
