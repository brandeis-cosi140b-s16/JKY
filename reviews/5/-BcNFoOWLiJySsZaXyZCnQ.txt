This second incarnation is terrific.  We love the original, but the new place has an open, bright atmosphere that is comfortable and inviting.  The food is the same great quality as the original, and the service is great and the location is very convenient for those of us in North Scottsdale.  You just can't beat a Boss after work.  If you don't know what that means, come by for Happy Hour!
