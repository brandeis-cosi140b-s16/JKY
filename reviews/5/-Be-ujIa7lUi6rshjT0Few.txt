Had an awesome lunch on the patio. My friend had the chicken bowl and I had the steak bowl. Very tasty, lots of flavor and pretty good size servings. The patio was amazing this time of year and everyone of the staff was pleasant and polite. 
Our server was on point without being to overbearing. They discounted my bill a little because they were out of something I ordered. Hey... I'll take that as a trade. Lol. 
Had a great time and thought the place had a very unique atmosphere. Highly recommended.
