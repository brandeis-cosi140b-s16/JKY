I went back for lunch on Sunday. The meal in general and in particular the flan received approval from a visiting friend who grew up in northern Mexico. 

Their soups that day - caldo de res (beef), menudo, and caldo de camaron (shrimp) - were so good, and they even had freshly made ceviche - precisely salted and limed. There was whole fried fish, with which my friend proceeded to make fish tacos. 

Good soup and fried fish are two of my favorite things to eat in the world, so yeah, I'ma b back.
