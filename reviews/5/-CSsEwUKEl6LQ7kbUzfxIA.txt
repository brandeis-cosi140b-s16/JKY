This is my new taco Tuesday place to go!! $2 tacos is super cheap! I got a strawberry margarita and that was really cheap too! It's a nice and relaxing environment to go to after work for sure! My boyfriend loves this place because they have $2 dos xx drafts on Tuesdays!  And there is sand on the patio! Love it! I'll be back!!
