I used Yelp to search for good Mexican food in Phoenix - after a string of disappointing Mexican experiences in Tucscon.  I wasn't disappointed by Carolina's.  To those who gave 3 and 4 stars because it's not shiny clean and chain-like: who cares?  The machaca burrito may be the best burrito anywhere - and I'm from Southern California.  I grew up eating SoCal Mexican 1-2 times a day (and it is still the best in the US on average).  I ordered another one halfway through the first, along with a stack of fresh tortillas to take back to New York.  This place is right by the airport and I almost want to route myself through Phoenix sometime just to go back.
