In scottsdale on a work vacation and lucked upon this place during dinner break. The food was great and the service was fantastic. Our server was engaging and efficient and she steered us towards great choices. She comped us a guac starter upon discovering we were visitors from the north and it really set the mood for a fantastic dinner.
