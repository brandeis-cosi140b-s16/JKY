A friend recommended this place, and my wife and I figured we should check this out. What can I say about this mom and pop spot? Absolutely Fantastic! Overall great service, and great food! I ordered the Carne Asada Plate and you can taste the home cooked meal. We definitely will come back for another meal. Thanks Tony's Cafe! Authentic Mexican Cuisine! Yummy!
