Amazing meal. The location is a little weird but the food was fantastic. We ordered mostly tacos. I tried the chicken, shrimp, fish and carne asada tacos and my husband tried the shredded beef and carne asada tacos and they were all delicious. The corn tortillas were so soft they were like pillows unlike the dry sorta chewy ones some restaurants use. The beans to dip the tortilla chips in were so good that my 2 young kids just devoured them. The prices were also something we were super impressed with. We ordered 9 tacos, carne asada nachos, kids quesadilla and fries and drinks and it was only $37. The service was great even though our server was a little young. He was on point and on top of everything, better than many other servers I have encountered. I can see myself craving this place and we will definitely without a doubt be back again.
