Front door the size of my college dorm room and decor inside as old as the hills. But the food is great. A little hole in the wall that always comes through in taste. My girlfriend is addicted to the carnitas tacos. Tiny street vendor style things, she can't get enough of them. 

I go for red chile and am always happy when I leave. Yeah it's not fancy, Yeah, it's never going to make it into Phoenix magazine. But it's good. period.
