I being Mexican am very picky about my tacos. These by far are the best tacos that I have tasted in Vegas. I tend to compare food to how my mom makes it, and to be honest these tacos are better than the ones my mom makes. You pay for what you get here. Tacos are anywhere from $2-$3 and burritos $8 but they are worth every mouth watering penny. PARKING IS THE ONLY BAD PART, but it is totally worth it. The owner is also very nice and takes care of his patrons.
