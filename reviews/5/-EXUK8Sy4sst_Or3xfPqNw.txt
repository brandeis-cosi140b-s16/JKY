Love 'em. Like you wouldn't go to a fine Mexican restaurant and order nachos, you wouldn't come here and expect a gourmet meal. We come here when we want to gorge ourselves on burritos, nachos, rolled tacos with guacamole (a perennial favorite) and beans (a favorite of the toddler and mine). Their breakfast burritos are great (and HUGE) and everything else is equally delicious. My husband loves the pina (a pineapple flavored drink - I think I'd like it with vodka) and the prices here are fair and best yet, they have a drive through window. I'm in love.
