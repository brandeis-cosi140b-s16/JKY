OMG! I love love love love this place. It is wonderful. Typically when you go for a meal you end up in one of 4 scenarios:

1. Good Food + Good Price (Rubalcabas)
2. Bad Food + Bad Price
3. Bad Food + Good Price
4. Good Food+ Bad Price

Well I have had an opportunity to visit Rubalcabas Taco Shop on just about ten occasions and have found their food in the first category each time. They offer good sized portions at a value. The food is tasty and often leaves me wondering how they do it. I can never finish the chicken burrito and manage to finish it the follow day. Every time, it is fantastic. The service is good and they also have a decent condiment bar with salsa, veggies and limes. 

I would recommend anyone try this place once to see if they can at least agree the food is yummy and the price is fantastic.
