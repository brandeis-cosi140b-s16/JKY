I wanted to give this location the review it deserves.  After reading the other reviews it needs it!!

 I have not been to a Chipotle in probably 10 years.  I have avoided it since they first opened after a bad experience.

I was looking for something to eat while at CSN.  I was a little leery to eat here after reading the reviews for this location, but I was hungry and I love mexican grill type places (Rubio's and Cafe Rio are my favies).  I was welcomed to a loud greeting and the girl was very happy to help me pick as I had not been here in to long!  I went with a pork barbacoa burrito with pinto beans, rice and mild salsa.  Gosh these things are huge, but yumyumyum!!  I also got chips and guacamole.  The guac rocks!!  Well, I finished almost all of my food and walked my happy yet distended belly back to school.

In another review a comment was made about the temperature of the food and I would have to agree that it could be quite a bit warmer-but the taste was still delish! I think this location is great.  All the staff were friendly to the customers as well as each other.  I will be back again, my Chipotle strike is over!!
