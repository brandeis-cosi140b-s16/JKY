I went here for a work meeting and was amazed by the happy staff. I met the owners Jesse and Vickie. They were very personable and inviting. All the ice cream is made on site and the food is great. Even though the breakfast burrito isn't on their 40+ item menu, they made it for me. They are so nice and fun. I would recommend having ice cream for dessert. I had the strawberry and it was bomb! Please visit and you will be a returning customer in no time. 

Low prices, great food. Awesome atmosphere and staff.
