Although I can see the comparison to the feel of Chipotle, I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of Chipotle and their limited menu, though I will admit it's been a long time since I've been there. 

Moving on, I'm a big fan of Zabas, and I eat here often- at one point my husband didn't even have to tell them the order, they would just know when they saw him. I usually get the shredded beef tacos or burritos, though the taquitos they've recently added to the menu are really good as well. 

The staff has always been really friendly, and the cost is reasonable for what you get. Highly recommended.
