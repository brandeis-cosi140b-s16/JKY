Do not let the rough exterior of the building fool you. We received excellent food and service when we went there. 
The menu was quite extensive and even included a vegetarian section. I ordered one of the vegi combos which included a quesadilla , tostada, and enchilada. The quesadilla was good (although thats pretty hard to screw up), the tostada was especially yummy with super fresh and green lettuce, a delightful guacamole, cheese and beans. The sauce over the enchilada was tasty and not too over powering the beans inside which were perfect. I always judge a mexican restaurant by the beans and salsa and this place gets a 5 star on both those fronts. Yum Yum!!!

My husband ordered the veggie Fajitas and it was so huge that we really could have shared it and plan to do that next time. The seasoning was spot on and the veggies were cooked to perfection. Carrots, bell peppers, brocoli, onions, potatoes and more were included in the mix. There was a ton of onions and green peppers but their was also a ton of all the rest of the veggies so that made up for it.

My boys split a kids menu item of a quesadilla and fries and were very happy with it.
The wait staff was all extremely attentive, friendly, and informative. We were going to order just two meals and share with the boys (they are only 1 and 3 years old) but the waiter informed us that kids meals were free on Sundays and urges us to take advantage of the deal. The refilled our drinks and checked several times to make sure we were doing good and had everything we needed. 

I generally felt that they appreciated the business and worked hard to please us, 


Im a happy customer and cant wait to go back and try out the Lunch Menu!!!
I'm really puzzled as to why the other reviews are so poor for this place, maybe the meat options aren't as good but the veggie ones are great!!
