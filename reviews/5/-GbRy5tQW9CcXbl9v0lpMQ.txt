As they say you can never get a second chance on a first impression. With that said I have to say what a great 1st impression! Was greeted in a welcoming manner and was told about the happy hour specials. These specials are incredible! Drafts 2.95 and some excellent food specials to.  Just for checking in to yelp I received a complimentary order of their street corn right on the cobb with the husk still attached. I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. Just a great place for great food, family and friends to hang out.
