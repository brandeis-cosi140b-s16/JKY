Always friendly and the food is always made to order! I LOVE the al pastor tacos, they are the best I've ever had!!!! The salsa and guacamole are the cherries on top! You cannot eat your tacos without those two! 
Yes although this food truck is in a sketchy looking parking lot I have never felt uncomfortable. Definitely give this place a try if your wanting to eat some yummy street tacos.
Oh and it's CASH ONLY. I also always bring my own drink instead of buying from here.
