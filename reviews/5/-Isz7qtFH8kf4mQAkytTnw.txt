Chipotle is my life.i lovvveee chicken bowl.this food is sooo tasty and no spices at all.i didn't imagine before I would like that non spicy food.but when I first tasted it ummm I was in heaven. .so I often take a round to this heaven.only draw back of this place is parking lot.it's a tiny miny parking lot.
