A huge fan of the Fish Taco's but the service was crazy good. (Never experienced this in a fast food restaurant ever.)
The Manager Sean was by far the coolest...not only did he ask what we liked to help us get a better taste of what Rubio's had to offer beside there fish taco's but also made us a special sample to try...(FREE). Never before have I seen or experienced such service.
If you go there, I would ask for Sean....
