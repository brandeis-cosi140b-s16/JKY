Visit this excellent culinary delight! First, make a reservation so you actually get a table. Bring a few bucks cash for the required valet. Okay, the food: loved everything!! We ordered crispy pork belly sushi roll, Suzuki roll, the Korean beef tacos, and lastly the pad thai. Everything was perfection--seriously! Our very favorite that we want to duplicate at home is hands down the Korean beef tacos-incredible! Everything was wonderful and very high quality, not just hype here, so you really can't go wrong. Service was fantastic, wine & beer great, ambiance sublime. Hubs & I got out for $100 with tip and that included drinks, apps, & entree that we shared. We were stuffed. Dress up if you're going on the weekend.
