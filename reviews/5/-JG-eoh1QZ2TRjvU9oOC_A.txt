My wife found this restaurant and we give it 5 stars!!!!! The service and food were excellent... We were served chips and salsa right away and the chips were never ending... Our drinks were never empty... The food came out real quick... We ordered the taco salads and they were awesome... The restaurant is very clean... We were very pleased with this restaurant and highly recommend it...!!!
