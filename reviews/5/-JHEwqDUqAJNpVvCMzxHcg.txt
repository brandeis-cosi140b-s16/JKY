My friend and I stopped in here for margaritas on Thu/15 Nov around midnight.

5-stars because:
- Both the bar & kitchen are now open 24/7 (awesome for late night munchies).
- Margaritas come in three sizes and we each had a "small" for $7.50/ea.  The smalls were a pretty good size, margarita tasted great.  
- Waiter also provided a free basket of chips (with regular and those black nacho chips) with 3 dips (salsa, bean, guacamole).  Even though we weren't ordering any food when my friend asked for a chips & dip refill the waiter happily obliged with bringing us a new batch of chips (both types) and dips (all 3 types).
- So, awesome service.
