A 24hour Mexican place??? A 24hour Mexican place that sells CARNE ASADA FRIES AND CALIFORNIA BURRITOS???? if there were 6 stars, it would get that.

I actually went on a trip to vegas w/ some buddies (one being the guy who first reviewed this place - LJ B.) 

We actually went to this place twice, once being drunk and once sober, and both times it was absolutely amazing.  The meat at Roberto's is delicious.  There aren't a lot of people there at 2am so wouldn't know about the crowd. I ordered a California Burrito both nights. My buddies ordered the Carne Asada fries and all of us really enjoyed it.

When my buddy, LJ B. went to vegas w/ his family, i actually asked him to bring me back some Roberto's. That's how good it was.
