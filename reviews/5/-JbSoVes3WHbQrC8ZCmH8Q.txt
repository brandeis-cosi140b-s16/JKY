Great food and service! I have been eating lupitas since it was at its 1st location that was originally La Fondita. The food is very good and you never have to worry about being different then the time before. There are half tables and booths. ( not all Booths anymore like some one stated before). I like going to a restaurant that is very consistent with great service and never a wait! I think people are always just looking for something to complain about( unsalted chips? Really?) they put salt on the table so if you want to add it do it because I'm sure if they put salt on you would probably complain about there being too much salt. Overall it's a great place to eat. Don't listen to the negative reviews give it a try for yourself!
