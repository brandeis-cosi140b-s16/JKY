I love this place, yes there are many "TACO SHOPS" (that's what we call the @ home) here in Vegas but this location here is the BEST.  What makes this location great? Fast service, nice people: the workers actual extend the conversation past taking your order. Clean at all hours of the day, condiments are always fresh i.e. fresh salsa, crisp-crunchy carrots, peppers, cucumbers, raddishes. Food always comes out piping hot, they did reinvent the wheel here they just keep it SIMPLE. I will pass up 10 different taco shops and drive clear across town to get to this SPECIFIC location to order something as simple as 3-Rolled Tacos w/ guac, cheese and hot carrots. It reminds me of Rolberto's off of El Cajon Blvd/28th in San Diego...oh goodtimes, goodtimes I'm over here cracking up reminiscing. Try it out if you happen to be on THAT side of town.
