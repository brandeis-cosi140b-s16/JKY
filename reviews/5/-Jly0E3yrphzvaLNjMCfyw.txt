Some people compare this place to Chipotle, and they need to stop. As someone who loves Chipotle even more than the proper amount, Gadzooks blows them out of the water.

All of the potential fillings for your enchiladas are flavorful. Like, not that silly chef's kind of flavorful that involves words like "light" and "delicate." These are some serious enchiladas with some serious, robust flavors. The spicy cornbread for example? It's actually spicy, and corny, and sweet. Also, you can get your enchiladas in chiles after 4:00 p.m. or some kind of delicious insanity. You can also add eggs, and they have a huge variety of sauces and toppings. 

Just go here. I don't care if you're a local, native, hipster or old foagie. Ignorance is not bliss. Enchiladas is bliss.
