BRING A JACKET! It's freezing in here, somewhere are 60Â° ...BUT anywho...


THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE! So I've been here like 6 times now and I usually just go with the Venezuelan arepas which are to die for but today I got the tacos, autenticos which are really authentic and yummy! My mom got the saborita, which is two tortillas with a party in between. Love everything about this place (except the freezing temps) also the lady at the register with the NY accent is really sweet. The staff is super friendly :)
