Went with a group of four and initially none of us knew about the restaurant. We saw it and the decor looked good so we went in to give it a shot. The restaurant itself was maybe 1/3 full so we got a table very quick. Afterwards the server was quickly with us asking if we wanted anything to drink. The service was great. The food was delicious as well. Keep in mind that this isn't meant to be a full authentic Mexican restaurant so I wasn't expecting that but either way the food was good. A nice little detail was that the sous chef came out to greet us and have us free shrimp tacos which were delicious. He came by a few more times after that to talk with us. Great experience overall!
