This place is awesome.  We had such a good time watching the game there.  Their food is amazing and they have cheap margaritas during happy hour.  One of the waiters accidentally grazed my head with a drink tray.  He felt so bad that he gave me a free giant margarita!  All in all, we had a great time and we will definitely be coming back.
