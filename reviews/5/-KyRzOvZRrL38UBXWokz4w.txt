Favorite Mexican Restaurant in the world.  

This is about as classy as you can get in East Mesa (I know, not a lot of competition in that category).  They've finished the new location and came out with a whole slew of new recipes.  My favorites include the flying saucer or the chicken mango salad.  I've set a goal to try something new each time I go here and haven't been dissappointed with the new menu items yet.  A bit pricey but with the new decor comes a new price tag.

There's a nice take-out addition too for the lunch crowd.
