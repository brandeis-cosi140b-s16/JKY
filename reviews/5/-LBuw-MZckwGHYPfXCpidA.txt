First timers very impressed with food and service. The enchiladas with red sauce were first rate, full of flavor with rice and beans. Salsa had the right amount of kick and the poco de gallo couldn't have been any fresher. Topped it all off with fried ice cream, likely the best I've had ever here in the valley. The business is family owned with a personal touch in service making it a perfect dining experience. A++ grade for sure.
