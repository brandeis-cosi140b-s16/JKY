We were looking for new places to eat in Queen Creek and stumbled on this amazing place right here on Yelp. I am so glad that I took the advice of everyone on here and didn't go off of my gut feeling based on the name. While it is an ice cream parlor (which I didn't try, but I'm sure is amazing) it also is an OUTSTANDING Mexican restaurant. I got the Carne Asada burro and I split the Escamocha. The burrito was just about as large (if not larger) than Chipotle and it had a much better flavor! It was definitely freshly made and the tortilla had flavor on its own. I will definitely be back to try the tacos that my mother tried and some of their other dishes.

Tl;dr: Amazing. Try it and you won't be disappointed.
