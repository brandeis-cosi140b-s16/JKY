I just have to say that I REALLY like this place, I'm from Mexico City and believe me I've been in many many places of Mexican Food, Tosinos is the real thing!! the quality is fabulous, the  portions are generous, the place is nice and clean, and the owners are very friendly. I'm just very happy that it's just few minutes away from where I leave. Did I say that they close at 11?? Yeah!!
