Bitzee Mama's is a local tradition in old Glendale, and one of my favorite places to be. It is now in capable hands, and never disappoints. If you're expecting trendy and upscale, please don't go there then post a flaming review. The service is personal, and everything is real and unpretentious. It's also very good Mexican food.
