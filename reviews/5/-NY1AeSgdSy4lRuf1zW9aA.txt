A group of 30+ of us wanted somewhere on the strip to gather for dinner. Kori at El Segundo Sol did an AMAZING job of organizing it for us. We had a perfectly sized private room, were able to order off the full menu (every other restaurant wanted us to pick from a $65 per person ++ fixed menu), and paying the check was a breeze. Great service and surprisingly great food-- I expected it to be your typical Mexican cuisine, but it was delicious, and moderately priced for the strip. Huge drinks menu as well, which was a winner for our group. 

I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere to take a group-- and Kori is super helpful!
