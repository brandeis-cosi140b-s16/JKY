We went here for lunch. The staff was friendly and the service was good. They brought us chips and both green and red salsa, which is quite spicy. We devoured both salsas and the chips.  I'd forgotten how flavorful and spicy the food is. I ordered the Garlic Pork Green Chile plate (Daily Special A.) The pork was lean and tender and the green chile was perfect. I'd have preferred refries to pinto beans, but the flavor of the meat more than compensated for it. My wife ordered Shrimp Veracruz. The shrimp they served her were enormous, and perfectly cooked. New Mexico style Mexican food is far better than the local version, but you have got to love spicy food. I could not see giving this place less than 5 stars. They did everything just right.
