I love businesses that don't mind a little hand-to-hand combat.  In the case of Paradise Valley Burger Company, there is a Burger King a stones throw away in the same parking lot, a pizza place a few doors down, and a Jack in the Box across the street.  You better be good if your competition is that close.

They are.

The Princess and I had to check this place out after it was highlighted on the review of the day last Friday, 3/7/14.  Easy to find, just off the 51 at Bell.  Kind of  a non-descript strip mall.  Nice vibe, lots of foot traffic and yet enough room to grab a table and not be elbow to elbow with your neighbor.

We both had the Beach House burger, two patties, smoked mozzella, and pico on an incredible homemade bun.  Loved the burger, very, very good.  You could taste the grill marks on the meat.  Complimented the meal with the sweet potato tots.  These were fantastic!  Some of the best I've had in the valley! (a little pricey but worth it!).  Also had a maple-bacon milkshake.  Wow!  Absolutely incredible.  Real bacon and maple with tasty ice cream, it was delicious!  

Can't wait to go back and try other burgers and some of their tacos.  Service was fantastic, very quick and friendly.  Great prices and excellent food!
