Love ... Love ... Love Chipotle! 

This location is always consistent and have never messed up an order, even a phone in. The food is fresh, flavorful, and reasonably priced for the portions you get. You definitely want to come hungry! I always say, "I'll take some home." It never happens!

My only negative has to do with parking. If you come at lunch or dinner the parking can be a bit of a pain, but I can't blame Chipotle for that one! That just means it's good food :-)

One of the staff members was great the other day... I didn't catch his name but he came around and asked us how the food was. Once he saw me eating the Guac he stopped back by to ask me if I had any pointers to make it better? Good guy and cares about the product he puts out for the customers. 

I'll definitely be back!
