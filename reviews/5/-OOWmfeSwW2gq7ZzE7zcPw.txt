I love Baja Taco, it's so much better than Robertos any day. The drive through feature is so convenient. The prices are so fair because let's face it, Mexican food is cheap and pretty easy to make. The salsas are always fresh. The little gal, who is always at the drive through is very nice and I like her tiny smile. I have gone there many times and each time, it's great.
