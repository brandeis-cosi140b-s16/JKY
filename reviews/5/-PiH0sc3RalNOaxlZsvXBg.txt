Robertos is our go to Mexican fast food whenever we get a craving & no time to fix it homemade. Everything we've had is so good. The neighborhood isnt the safest or nicest in town, which is why i always send my husband, but its always worth it. We always call ahead with our order & are in & out in no time.
