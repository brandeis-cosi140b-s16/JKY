Finally getting around to writing a review after going here so often! 

I always order the standard and the tinga tacos. The black beans are awesome too. My boyfriend gets the fish tacos, which he says are amazing. 

The cocktails are delicious and potent. I usually go for a pineapple mojito or blood orange margarita. 

We just discovered that Joyride has a great deal on Taco Tuesday- $5 margaritas and select $2 tacos. However, they are much busier due to the awesome dinner deal. You have to plan on waiting to get seated, if you can't snag a seat at the bar.
