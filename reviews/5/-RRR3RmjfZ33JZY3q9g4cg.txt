Every so often a man makes a bad decision in life.  He has hopes, dreams, self esteem and a cause. Then he runs into this thing called the real world. The real world don't play. It shows you that you either lack the will or skill set to just run in there to be a MAN. You gotta grow your game. Self assess. Apply and reflect.  Succeed or fail? Doesn't matter. Do it again. Thus, is the gut check known as Diablo's cantina. 

Oh you're going to fail there. Let it be known. From the incredibly cute waitresses (for the most part, but I'm a gentleman and not perfect myself so no judging)who serve with a smile. Well, sometimes a scowl and a "what do you want?" It's gut check time. Are you gonna maintain eye contact and play it smooth? Go college boy and get excited a woman in a low cut shirt is talking to you or go business and ignore everything? I don't know. Doesn't matter. Diablo's like the name exposes the heart of all men with overly large portions of food, alcohol, and lots of TVs. 

Look, if you ask for organic anything you have lost your way. You want Kim the bartender to roll her eyes at you and half smile? Ask if the nachos are gluten free.  You want attentive service, informal atmosphere good eats and to feel full while having a view of the Vegas strip? Then Diablo's aka purgatory for those that need a meal after the walk of shame should go. 

Get the nachos. Demand the bartenders spin the happy hour wheel and land on Don Julio 1942 and accept your fate with no regrets. You ask if the vegetarian tacos are vegans friendly and you'll only get, "sure bro. Whatever you want." And that's from the lady bartenders. 

Know what you get and bask in your indulgence. Diablo's; for the hood sexy only. Enjoy friends.
