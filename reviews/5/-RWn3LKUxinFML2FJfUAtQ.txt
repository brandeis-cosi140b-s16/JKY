My family has been going to La Fonda for over 30 years, since they were at their old location in North Tempe.  It is a family favorite and a place we always look forward to going to!

I love their fresh hot chips, and their 2 different kinds of salsa.   My favorite has always been a bean burrito enchilada style, and even after they moved they have not messed that up.   

Thanks for 30 years of good food & memories La Fonda!!
