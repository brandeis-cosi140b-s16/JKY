Amazing...from the chips to the drinks.  The complimentary chips with three different salsas are so yummy!  We got sweet corn tamales and plantain empanadas and were not disappointed.  One recommendation...their non-alcoholic refresher drinks are to die for.  I had white peach lemonade and was in love!
