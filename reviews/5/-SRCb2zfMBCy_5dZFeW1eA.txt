I was craving for a place with really good tacos and Sombreros came through!! I got 3 flour tortillas tacos with barbacoa and one with chile verde and they were soooo damn tasty!. The pico de Gallo was surprisingly spicy but its because they make it right. I'm taking a bus load of people with me next time!!!
