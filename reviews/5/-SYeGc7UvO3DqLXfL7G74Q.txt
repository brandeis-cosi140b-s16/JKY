I ate here for the first time today, I had some carne asada and carnitas tacos.  They were probably the best tacos I've ever had.  The rice and beans on the side were also really good.  Cheap prices and great friendly service.  I have a feeling I will become a regular at this place!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
