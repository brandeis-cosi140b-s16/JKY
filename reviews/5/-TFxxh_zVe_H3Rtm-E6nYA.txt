ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE!!!!!!!
We were at Ricardos on July12,2014 for a dinner after a wedding and I was truly impressed with both the food and the service. Our Waiter, Freddie was beyond EXCELLENT. This guy has a huge personality and was really engaged with our entire group. You really don't find servers like him in most places. 
The food was excellent. I had the fajitas and being from Texas I can say I was very impressed, they were delicious.

If you get to Vegas, this place is a short trip from the strip and 
WELL WORTH IT

EXCELLENT JOB
