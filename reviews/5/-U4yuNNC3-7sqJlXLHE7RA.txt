Amazing service, amazing food. What can I say?! Super yummy salad bowls... :) yay!! So glad they have vegetarian black beans!! As a vegetarian, being able to eat here is awesome and delicious!!! Not all Mexican places have 100% vegetarian beans. Often the beans have lard, so again, happy for chipotle!!!
