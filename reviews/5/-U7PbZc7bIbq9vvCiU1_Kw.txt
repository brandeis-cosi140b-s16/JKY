I've been back several times since my first visit and the food and service are just as good. Drive-thru is very convenient.  We've tried several more variety of tortas and the hard tacos and nothing has disappointed us. 

We've noticed that the tortas are better if you can eat them there because the bread gets a little soggy on the transport home but they still have the same great taste.
