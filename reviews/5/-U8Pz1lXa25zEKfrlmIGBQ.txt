I can't believe I haven't written a review yet!
This is our last minute, tired, don't know what else to get, save the day kinda spot. 
We can always count on a delicious Super Nacho to hit the spot. The staff knows us and know how we like our Super Nachos and NEVER give us any problems with our unusual requests! Kind of bummed they charge for the Horchata refills now but it's all good. It's understandable since people like my family can down like 3-4 cups each in one sitting. I apologize that I don't know them by name but the two ladies (one elder and one pretty young) and the younger man that usually takes our orders are always so nice! Thanks!
