Let me preface this by saying I'm a vegetarian who loves Mexican food. It's pretty difficult to find a good vegetarian dish that isn't just full of cheese at an authentic Mexican restaurant, but this place was great! It had tons of options, and the food was very tasty! 

The restaurant itself is pretty casual, nothing fancy at all -- pretty typical of most authentic restaurants. We were served Chips, Salsa and this AWESOME bean dip when we got there. The salsa had a nice kick to it too! My Co-worker ordered a margarita that tasted excellent, and I had a glass of Sangria, which was also decent. 

Both of us being huge fans of Guac, we had to order the Guacamole. Our server brought out all of the ingredients, from the whole avocado, to the lime and cilantro, and made the Guacamole right in front us! It doesn't get any fresher than that! He even asked as us how spicy we like it, so he could cut the right amount of jalape√±o for us. 

For dinner, I ordered a vegetarian enchilada and a taco. The enchilada was full of fresh veggies, so it wasn't so cheesy, which was really nice. The meal also came with beans and rice, so you get really good amount for the price. 

If you're in Vegas, you can't leave without coming here!!
