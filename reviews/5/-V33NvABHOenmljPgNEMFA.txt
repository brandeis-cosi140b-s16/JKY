All hail Habanero's! So glad to finally discover a good burrito joint on the west side. Even better that it has great hours, a drive through and so affordable. 
I usually get either a surf and turf(not on the menu) or a chile relleno burrito. Both or legit and they def don't skimp. Along side is usually carne asada fries, plain churro and a horchata. Can I say that none of these fall short of quality? This is as close to the border taste as I can get on the west side of Vegas. And oh, the salsa options are amaze balls. Esp the salsa verde. 
Last words? Buh bye Roberto's!!!!!
