My first bite of carne adovada literally made me interrupt the woman sitting next to me at the bar with an "Oh my GOD" it was so delicious.  I came in for lunch so I didn't have to suffer the long waits this place seems to always have, clearly because their food is so excellent.  Every bite was just wonderful.  A bit pricey and the bar stools were pretty uncomfortable.  I guess they do that so they can turn the table more quickly?
