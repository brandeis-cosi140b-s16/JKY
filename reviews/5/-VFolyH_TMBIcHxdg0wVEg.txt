I have to say that I have enjoyed this place. I found it by accident on the way to work one morning after another place would only take cash. Breakfast burritos are good, fresh tortilla and ingredients. I have been back a few times now, service and food have been great. Besides the bk burrito, I had a steak ranchero lunch special, tasted like home made beef stew in a burrito... Very good.
