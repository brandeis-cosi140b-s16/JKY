It's hard to find the perfect taco place in Pittsburgh, because tacos should be light and tasty...that's what you will going to find when you try Tako..you can chose one of the  deferent tacos, beef, chicken, fish ..( Korean taco the best was my favorite beside the chicken  ) octopus and more..also the place decorated in a unique way..I love the atmosphere ..sure I will try it again & again 
Good luck Tako
