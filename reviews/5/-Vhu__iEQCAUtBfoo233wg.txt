What an experience! Let me start off by mentioning how cute the place is inside. The decor is really sheek and elegant with table cloths and big open windows. And then there's the food.... I got edamame, firecracker jalapeños and the mexican roll. I like spicy food and the sushi chef was more than happy to accommodate. He also told me he could do any traditional roll as well, but im not a traditional type of person so I went with a specialty roll. His roll was beautifully put together with a nice presentation. The firecracker jalapeños were excellent! Whole jalapeños cut in fourths and deep fried with cream cheese with a very nice sauce served on top (and not too much). On the side I was given an excellent mixed ponzu sauce that went great with everything!  My waiter was very attentive and pleasant! Not one complaint with the service! The owner was behind the bar and very friendly as well. Overall it was a great choice to eat!
