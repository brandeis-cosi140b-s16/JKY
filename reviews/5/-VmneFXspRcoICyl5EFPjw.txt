Nando's continues to deliver great food and good times! I had my best friend and his wife and young son in from LA last week and we had a fantastic dinner and the service couldn't have been better! They raved about the food and the portions...there was even enough food leftover for lunch the next day! Thanks Nando's, keep up the great service and fantastic food!
