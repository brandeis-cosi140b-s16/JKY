My husband and I have made hometown dogs a regular lunch spot and we love it! There is no end to the variety of tasty dogs and yummy sides, although the salsa alone makes the place worth stopping by. 
The owner is very passionate about his menu and the service is caring. As the name suggests, there is a community around the shop. Many customers are regulars and with good reason. 
Yummy food, and great people make Hometown dogs a must.
