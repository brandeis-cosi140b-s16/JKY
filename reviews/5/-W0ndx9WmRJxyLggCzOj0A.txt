Ok this place is "on point" the ambiance is super cute and colorful, the service was friendly and responsive :) now lets talk about the food. We just moved here from SoCal so we know good mexican food. We ordered the 3 dips...queso..guac..& bean dip and they were all great. My husband had enchiladas suizas & I did the pick 2 with a chicken taco and chalupa. Everything was super fresh and very tasty (I could believe it if they said their mexican grandmother was cooking in the kitchen) they really nocked it out of the park. We went to Mad Mex as our 1st mexican experience in PBurgh and it was NASTY so we were pleasantly surprised to find this little gem just a few steps away.
