Many of my prayers for the Madison restaurant scene - finally answered

There will probably be some confusion at first as The Isthmus recently mentioned this restaurant, calling it Juquila.  However after chatting with Francisco himself last night, it's going to be called Francisco's Cantina for time being, as that's the name on the liquor license.  Asi es la vida.  

What's not confusing is the food and liquor.  It's a god send.  It's got the freaking trifecta:  (1) delicious (2) cheap (3) likely open after bar time (or your shift if you work in the industry).  Item (3) will become a reality soon when the man gets some more help in the kitchen.

I shared drinks and dinner with a good friend around 10pm last night.  We had the requisite chips and salsa.  A massive (had to weigh 5lbs) steak burrito with house-made mole negro and a plate with assorted, chicken filled, verde/rojo tamales.  We washed down said food with half a dozen shots of Camarena Blanco and cuatro Bohemias.

Total bill:  $41.  Seriously!  Why go anywhere else?  

Now it's time we all thank Francisco and our respective deities for gifting us an amazing restaurant that doesn't close at 9pm.  Go support this guy and his food else I'm gonna be mad at you Madison.
