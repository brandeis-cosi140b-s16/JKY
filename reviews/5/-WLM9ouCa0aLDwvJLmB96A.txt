Great place for a lunch or dinner - with the office or friends.  The lunch menu is full of great options.  I always get the grilled chicken with guac and it's always good.  I can't usually eat it all because they give you so much.  The sweet potatoe fries and salad that come with it are my favorite.  I think I would be happy with just those two items.  Their house salad dressing is different and I love it. I believe they even have their own homemade ketchup if I remember correctly, good!  
For dinner, I only get the Broiled tilapia with chili-honey glaze, sweet corn-cream sauce, and fried rice - WOW. The spice from the tilapia goes great with the corn.  My favorite fish around!  Portions and price are perfect.
