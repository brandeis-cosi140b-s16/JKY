This place has the best food ever, really really good rice and beans and that's how you know!!, shrimp tacos are the shit!! Fish taco's are good but I had better and everything else is awesome , I like the taquitos and how they serve them and the mix tacos that have Asada & pastor mix. Everything else is great and don't forget their deserts the tres leches cake is to die for and their flan is right up there too... Two thumbs up!!!!:-)
