First time customer, in for breakfast and made the drive from across town to enjoy some authentic New Mexican cuisine. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros smothered in red chile and had them add carne adovada to the mix which made it that tastier. I opted for sopapillas instead of the flour tortillas. I totally enjoyed my breakfast and will return! I also appreciated the free desert on check-in. I had the Fried Ice Cream, make sure you save room!
