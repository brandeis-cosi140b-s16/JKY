Revo Burrito is a healthy mexican food option.  I was shocked when reading these reviews and saw the terms tasteless and bland.  It could not be further from the truth.  I read one speaking about Filibertos having superior food and I think what they are mistaking for flavors is the pounds of lard that other mexican food restaurants cooks with.  Revo has a wonderful blend of grilled food and seasoning to make the meal flavorful while still being a healthy option.  I am a foody and love fatty bad food however have eliminated it due to obvious health reasons, Revo is allowing me to eat out WITHOUT the feeling of being deprived.  Several of my co-workers have also eaten there and it has been unanimous that for fresh food that is not weighed down with grease and fat this is beyond favorful and fantastic.   Their price is fair for the amount of food they are serving.  I bought the chicken fajita rice bowl for 6.50 and it was a complete meal.
