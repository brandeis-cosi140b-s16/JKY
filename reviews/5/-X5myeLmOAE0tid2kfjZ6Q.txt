I have been coming here for years.  I used to work at Banner up the street and it was a weekly lunch stop.  Good size, just the right heat, the tamales are soft and melt in your mouth quality.  The owner is awesome and always recognizes me.  The green japilino sauce is a must.  I am very sad I nolonger work close to here so ever time I am in the neighborhood I grab a few dozen and freeze them.  After the micro wave they taste like I am in the store. 5 star for all.
