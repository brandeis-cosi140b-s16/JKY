I visited Phoenix and tried about 5 different Mexican restaurants, and this by far was the best one- fresh, hearty, and reasonably priced.

They had absolutely delicious, freshly squeezed juices- Cantaloupe, Pineapple, and Watermelon- they topped it off all the time, absolutely great.  We also got their guacamole which was good with cheese on top.  Their chips were stone-ground thick and grainy, crunchy chips (not the thin, oily chips I've gotten elsewhere) and their red chipotle and green pico de gallo sauces were thick, creamy, and super fresh (not like I've had at other places).  They all tasted lke they were just made in mortle, pestle, and blender in their kitchen.

I got their Filet Mignon with melted cheese on the bottom of the plate and sauteed veggies on top.   Very good, meat was very soft and cooked perfectly, worked well with a good combo of cheeses and the veggies.  Came with flavorful, soft rice and beans- all worked very well together.

My co-eaters got the duo stews (with chicken and pork) and something else which they both loved.  It's decorated well with lots of festive colors.

Go visit this place and support it!
