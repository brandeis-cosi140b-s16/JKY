I've been enjoying the food and ambiance here for about a year. I usually come for lunch with friends. I have yet to have any negative experiences. The food is succulent, tasty and fresh. Service is stupendous and fun. The ambiance is enjoyable and puts you in the mood for a great time with family or friends.

I give this restaurant a solid 5 stars!
