I'd come back here just for the Queso Flameado - a super tasty mix of cheeses, with a few mushrooms/tomatoes thrown in.. maybe some spicy chilis. Spinach was good, bread pudding dessert was excellent. The two steak entrees were good & excellent, I forget which one was the excellent one.. we were sharing. Man I suck.... but hey my Yelp reviews are more for me to remember where to go than to help you, my dear readers. My friends were impressed with the spunky valet in the hat. Nice decor, and awesome setting at the World Market Trade Center.. feels great to come out of there and see the impressive buildings.
