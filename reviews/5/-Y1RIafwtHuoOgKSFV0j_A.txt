I think it's hilarious that someone would knock off an entire star for this place not having burritos. What we in the U.S. call "burritos" doesn't even exist in Mexico. That's an absurd Americanized thing. 
That being said, I'll get on with the review, starting with the disclaimer that

THIS PLACE DOES NOT SELL MEXICAN-AMERICAN food. 
People that are expecting nachos and burritos--sorry. Go to Taco Bell.

This place sells LEGIT, MEXICAN food that you would only otherwise find in MEXICO CITY, MEXICO. Phew. Okay, there. 

AND, it's some of the best food I've had outside of Mexico City, to boot. 
I haven't found any other place where I can order tortilla soup and get authentic tortilla soup. And where else would I be able to find mole verde?! MOLE VERDE. There is a huge variety of amazing food on the menu. I also saw them (WITH MY OWN EYES) start to make the food only after I had ordered it. I made awesome conversation with the woman who owns the place; sooo friendly, so chatty, always asking if we needed anything else. And at the end of the experience everything was fairly and moderately priced. To be honest, the food was so delicious that I would've paid double what I paid for that tortilla soup. 

I WILL RECOGNIZE that the interior of the place isn't exactly charming. It's a little run down, with that faint layer of grease that usually coats well used restaurants. It's small and the tables are surprisingly close to the ground -- Buuuuuut I couldn't care less. The food makes up for anything that might be aesthetically displeasing as far as seating goes. 

Try this place out. I could rave and rave about it. For days. That's what I'm doing now.
