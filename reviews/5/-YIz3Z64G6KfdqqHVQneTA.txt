We popped into Casa Don Juan for dinner last night. We got our usual carnitas for two and tamale, both were fantastic. The surprise tonight was the salsa and guacamole were also delicious. The salsa was nice and chunky with a little kick and the guac was so fresh and well seasoned. I hope they keep it up.
