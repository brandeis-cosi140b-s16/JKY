First time at Taco Haus. It's got great curb appeal with a large patio. We asked for outdoor seating for a large-ish party and they were more than happy to put some tables together for us. 
We ordered ceviche and a quesadilla for appetizers and the ceviche was incredible. Quesadilla was great but the shrimp ceviche was fresh, crisp, and just right for eating outside on a nice day. 
We ordered a bunch of different tacos and all were great. Pork belly was a stand out and so were the veggie tacos. 
We also ordered the streat corn which we all decided was the best thing we had on the table. A definite must for any meal. 
I love that the water bottles are recycled 40 oz beer bottles. Cool hipster touch. 
We have quite a few food allergies and after asking a few questions the chef came to talk to us. Not only was he accommodating to our issues but he was excited by the opportunity to provide good, clean food to us. What a nice touch. He told us about his chefs table and tasting menu which we'll be back for.
