I never had fish tacos before and the idea of it sounded strange to me so I was a little weary to try them.  I tried the mango jalepeno mahi mahi taco and the original fish taco.  Both were delicious! I liked the mango taco a little more though.  It tasted light and healthy.  Prices are fair.  Rubio's is a mix of fast food and sit down.  You order at the counter and then a worker brings the food to your table, kind of like Chick-fil-A.  I like this because there's no tipping required!  The decor is fun; it's a mexican beachy feel.
