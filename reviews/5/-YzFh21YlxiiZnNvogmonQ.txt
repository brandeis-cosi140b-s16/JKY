I was born and bred in California, with most of my years there spent in America's Finest City -- San Diego.  As such, one could say that I have been exposed to a wide range of taco shops.  One would be correct.

When I moved to Las Vegas in the early 1990s, I was disheartened to find that Sin City did not have any high-quality taco joints.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nada.  Sure, there were a handful scattered about the cityscape that seemingly had nonstop queues out the door, but methinks that was more a function of scarcity of competition than anything else.  Consumers simply didn't have much to choose from.

So over the years I found myself relying on the various Roberto's establishments across the Vegas valley.  

A couple of months ago I came across this specific Roberto's (which is now called Don Tortaco Mexican Grill) whilst in search of a quick bite to eat.  This site happens to be located in a small commercial setup that includes car repair places, a check cashing money lender, and a Taco Bell.  While I was tempted for a brief moment to indulge in the bland, gooey concoction otherwise known as the Burrito Supreme at Taco Bell, I decided to give Roberto's a shot...especially since I was in the mood for some carnitas.

Boy, am I glad I did!

I don't know why this Roberto's (now Don Tortaco) is so much better than every other Roberto's I have ever been to...but it is!  So much better!  Better guacamole.  Better pico de gallo.  Better meat.  Better sauces.  All kinds of better!

I would even say it trumps Cotijas in Point Loma!  And that's saying something.
