Went with the fam tonight and it was just like old times.  Nothing has changed, thank heavens.  Hot sauce and chips: just right, not greasy.  Small, plastic tumblers filled with crushed ice--yes.  Combination #6 is my current favorite.  Enchilada sauce: not too thin not too thick.  Taco: small and crispy, not some huge crazy size.  Shredded cheese:  a nice sprinkling over taco, tostado, and cheese enchilada.  Cash only.  It's back--yea!
