This place is my favorite place for Mexican food in Casa Grande.
There others food could be good...but I love their big and juices BURRO is much I just have to have one.
Then I got a BURRO that was deep fried in error....oh my gosh it was even better for just a little extra charge....
Owners...Bob and Stella are VERY friendly and remember us after being gone for months.
Don't let the appearance of the outside fool you...these people know how to produce flavorful  food....!!!
