So they've eliminated a few menu itms, and raised prices just a touch in hopes of branching off with other locations!! YAY!

So we hadn't been here in a while, the last time we were here, the service provided by the owner. I especially can't stand when small shop owners refuse to accommodate for their guests, but there was a total turnaround this time.

We 1 bulgolgi lettuce wrap and 1 in corn each as well as the combination fried rice (with pork instead of shrimp) and I also decided to try the wonton soup.. in the brink of summer.. 

WHY AREN'T YOU ALL ORDERING THE WONTON SOUP?! The broth was phenomenal, the wontons were huge and full of delicious pork. I'm a wonton soup connoisseur, and this was some of the best I'd ever had in the valley! After 2 spoonfuls of soup, I look up at Jason and tell him this was going to be a winter fave.
