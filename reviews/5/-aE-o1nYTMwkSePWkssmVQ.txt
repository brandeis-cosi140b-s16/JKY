I'm addicted to the queso and chips!   Can't be healthy but very tasty.  Hot, gooey and just the right amount of zest.  Queso is often too salty but this one is just right.  The burrito bowl with salmon is also quite good, as are the burritos, especially with steak.   Parking is a pain sometimes and it can get very crowded, but worth it.  Also very reasonable prices.  

Highly recommended.
