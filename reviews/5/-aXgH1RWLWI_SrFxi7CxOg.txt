The best tortilla soup you will EVER have! Seriously, even though all of their food is delicious, I go just for soup most of the time. 
They also have excellent drinks, a friendly staff, and the ambiance is pretty cool. 
Complimentary chips, beans, and two different kinds of salsa is the cherry on top. I recommend this place very strongly!
