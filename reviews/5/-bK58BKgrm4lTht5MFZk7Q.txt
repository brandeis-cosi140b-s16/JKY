My friends have been bringing this place up all week and I finally let them take me since I've never been to a Hawaiian restaurant. Right when I walked in, I was joyfully greeted by the employees. They'll ask you if it's your first time there and if it is, they let you try all their meats to see what you like. People recommend their pork, but I personally love the chopped steak they provide since it was the sweetest with a hint of ginger. You have a choice of a burrito, taco, or bowl to house your food. They struck up conversation as they prepared my food (it works like Cafe Rio or Chipotle) and were very easy to talk to. After all the social atmosphere seemed to please, the real test was now to taste the prepared meal which I already knew was going to be good since I tried the meat beforehand. In short, The burrito ensemble was delicious! If you want something to drink, they have Coke products and a wonderful pellet ice machine that we all love. If you choose to eat in, you can enjoy the Hawaiian art hung all over the walls. I will definitely go back some time for a great lunch. It is a great replacement to the slider restaurant that used to be there. If you haven't tried it, go there ASAP! It will brighten your day!
