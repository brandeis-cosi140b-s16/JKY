So far, the best Mexican joint in my opinion. Bought a pastor burrito and carne asada fries for right under $12. For its large portions, you can't bargain or argue its size and value. The pastor burrito was delicious. Very stuffing and huge. Not too greasy either(all Mexican food has grease). The asada fries were damn good as well. I was surprised at how cheap yet how much they served for what I paid for. Unbelievably, I finished my meal, resulting in a dying coma. Also had its complimentary bar of condiments consisting of Jalapenos and various hot sauces. The only improvement they need is the guacamole. But I don't take any stars away because I really can't argue its value. Fausto's will definitely be seeing future business from me.

After trying different options in the menu such as the burritos whether it be pollo or asada, I'm sad to say the burritos are very bad... Despite the delicious super fries that they offer, their burritos taste extremely stale. We asked for extra guacamole and didn't get it, but the lack of extra guacamole doesn't explain the stale taste in their burrito. I suggest to stick with super fries.
