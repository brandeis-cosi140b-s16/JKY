Oh Monterrey...you had me at lime margarita pitchers for $11.99!!! Frozen or on the rocks with sugar or salt on the rim...freaking delicious! Oh my Goodness!!! And thank you for making sure I could taste the liquor!!! Really, really appreciated. 

This place was a really great find! But normally the local hole in the walls have the best and most reasonably priced food! 

Okay...probably the best thing thing about this place os that they serve white sauce AND salsa with the chips!!! My friends and I were delighted! You see, coming from Virginia we are used to getting salsa and white sauce whenever we have Mexican but since we have been down here everyone thinks the " white sauce" we speak of is queso...ummm Nooo!!! 

But not here! Every basket of chips we had were hot and the white sauce was spicy and delicious...next time I just need them to leave the container with that sauce on our table. Not even close to joking...it's just that good! 

I ordered the Shrimp Chimichangas with cabbage salad and rice. It was scrumptious!!! Nice large shrimp, seasoned well with veggies then deep fried and topped with queso. Heaven! The rice and cabbage salad were very good as well. 

Overall, this was a very good meal...easily 4 stars but since they have white sauce...and great customer service they deserve the extra star. 

Go...seriously you can thank me later.
