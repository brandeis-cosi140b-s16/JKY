This place is great!  Definitely the best Mexican Food in Madison.  Barbacoa and pastor tacos on corn tortilla shells are the best I have had.  The carnitas were a little dry the last time I went but the other meats made up for it.  The guys that work there are also really friendly and every thing is fast and fresh!
