Excellent! I love, love, love their tacos and the complimentary chips and salsa are perfect.  Drinks are usually on the strong side, but who can complain about that?  The back patio is really charming and they seem to have spruced it up a bit (new tables, greenery, etc).  I don't even feel like I'm in Pittsburgh when I'm out there.  The food and atmosphere are super impressive.  It does get crowded late at night, though, so be prepared for that.  I prefer to go for lunch.  Oh, and I was hoping to get some tres leche cake, but unfortunately, they don't serve any desserts.  I'm still giving it 5 stars - better for my diet!
