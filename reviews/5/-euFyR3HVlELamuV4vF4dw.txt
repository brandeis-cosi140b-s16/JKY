*YUMMY* is all I have to say about this place.  It's your typical cheap Mexican food place that are a dime-a-dozen in Phoenix.  This has always been one of my favorites though.  The carne asada burrito is huge and well worth the $5.25 you'll pay for it.  The place doesn't look so great from the outside and the drive-thru is a little strange, but it's delicious.  It's also never made me sick, so no worries in that department.  Go, eat, and enjoy the place.
