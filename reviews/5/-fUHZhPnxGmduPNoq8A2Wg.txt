I first reviewed Jordan's back in November of 2011, after going there since 2000.  As everyone has stated, many customers are locals who have been going here for decades with their families.  For all of those people who complain about the tomato sauce-based salsa, ASK YOUR FRIENDLY SERVER FOR THE CHUNKY SALSA AND THEY WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO BRING YOU SOME!  Be warned, it's spicy and it's awesome.  For those others who came to Jordan's for the first time or were visiting from out of town and gave them a bad review, fine!  You people don't need to come back here, EVER!  Jordan's has done just fine on local return customers for the past 10+ decades and don't need you here!
