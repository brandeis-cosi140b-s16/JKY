Welp this place trumps most other burrito places by far.  Service was quick and to the point, food was delish and the atmosphere was  just what I would expect from a hole in a wall mexican grille. Totally loved it. Got the red pork and my bro got the carne asada and woofed down. I'll be back for sure!
