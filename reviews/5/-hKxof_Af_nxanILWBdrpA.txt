This is "THE BEST MEXICAN GOURMET" I've ever had! (other than my mom's of course...hehehe). Aria did an excellent job by opening this restaurant!

The food looks and tastes DELICIOUS! Good portions, and authentic Mexican flavors!

...and for those who are Vegetarians like me, I recommend the "Spinach Enchiladas Plate." You are going to love them!

What you'll also love is how friendly and helpful the staff is: from hostesses, to waiters, to the person who is cleaning the bathroom...everyone is friendly!

Can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can eat there again! :)
