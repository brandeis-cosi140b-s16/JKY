We started with fresh chips that were hot to the table and ordered guacamole that was flavorful and creamy.  I posted a pic. 

I ordered a 3 tacos, chicken, Carne and grilled shrimp and all three were amazing, I don't know which one I liked best. Beans and rice came with,  also excellent. I love that they have real Mexican coke (as well as a huge variety of other Mexican sodas). 

My boyfriend got a Chile relleno, and he just kept shaking his head YES, he says it's very good. 

Decor is nice,  bright colors and clean.  Staff is friendly and made great recommendations.  

I'm sure we will be back many times.  Recommend!
