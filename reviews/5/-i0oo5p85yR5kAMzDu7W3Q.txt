Upon being greeted by "Aloha!" as I entered, I knew I was in for a true Hawaiian treat. Being first timers, they let us try all their meats (including the fish). As I perused the step by step ordering process, my Chipotle senses started tingling. I took the burrito route-- my soft spot. Half steak, half Kailua pig, seaweed rice, all 3 salsa's (I know it says choose 1), black beans, lettuce, cheese, cilantro, sour cream, tortilla chips, lime (yes I would love it freshly squeezed into my burrito). And then it was time for the woman to roll my burrito-- how is she going to do it? I don't know, and it still puzzles me to this day. Needless to say, perfectly rolled burro. The concoction was as good as it sounds-- and yes you can use my building strategy, I haven't patented it yet. Did I mention the employees were the nicest people ever? Will be returning here every time I come to Vegas.
