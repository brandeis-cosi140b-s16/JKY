This place is AMAZING. Hands down. One of the best places to get street style tacos and the salsa bar is so diverse that it's almost hard to pick one. But the number one thing that sticks out the most about TC's is the hospitality. Down to the people working the counter, to the chef who will always find a moment to come around to the front to ask you how the dishes are tasting. It's a place to get amazing food, but most importantly amazing service and hospitality. Thank you TC's for being true. Don't change babe.
