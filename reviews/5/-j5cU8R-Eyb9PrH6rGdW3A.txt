Just great!!!!! Great food, great service, and great food again!!!!! The Coamarones Tecolotes is one of my favorite plates....... The very best price for great seafood..... Las islitas is no comparison. Just need to expand a little and it will be the perfect place!!! They have the best server...."Jael"
