Salsa's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The food is great and reasonably priced, the servers are always polite and friendly, everything is clean, and the drink specials are always great. Me and my wife come here about once a week. I've been to several Mexican restaurants in Charlotte and Salsa's is by far my favorite. I highly recommend Salsa's!
