This place is great, from the fresh chips, salsa, bean & guacamole dips the frozen Margarita's as my daughter in law would say "They are the bomb". Service is great our waiter & waitress were very  attentive anyone who had a question they knew the answer, didn't need to check with manager. Differently a must if you want great Mexican food. BTW the refried beans are very, very good.
