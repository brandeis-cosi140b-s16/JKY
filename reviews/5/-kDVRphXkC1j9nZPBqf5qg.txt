Chef Kevin Tubb's (of Eldorado Grill) from Austin and this place pays tribute to it. 
Very casual and fresh food. 
Their Fish tacos are amazing -- my favorites include the Blackened Tilapia, Shrimp, Portabella & Feta. And their Salsas are really good too!

For beverages, their limeades are tasty

For dessert, the Jalapeno key lime pie is yummy (with a kick!)
