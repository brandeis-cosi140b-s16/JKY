Excellent experience all the way around... The service was on point both times I went and the food as well as plate presentation were outstanding. Myself and some friends order small plates to share and we started with the potbelly roll which was out of this world. We then ordered a series of tacos with the highlight being the pastor. This is a must go and would highly recommend them especially in the evening when they have the dance music and high energy atmosphere
