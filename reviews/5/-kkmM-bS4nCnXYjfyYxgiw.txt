My wife and I have been stopping in here several times since they opened. I have to say I am impressed with what they have done. We have been to many other "Mexican" style restaurants in the area and would have to say we really love this place. My favorite is the Blue Corn Enchiladas, with a fried egg on top. thought that was unusual at first but come to find out is normal with "new" Mexican style food. I usually get it with green enchilada sauce because I am told its the spiciest. My wife prefers red which is slightly milder. Adovada Pork is apparently their specialty and I don't know anywhere else that does their pork this way and we love it! If you eat here try it, its spicy and rich, its really unbelievable!!

We do recommend this place, and will more than likely be there next time we go out for Mexican!!
