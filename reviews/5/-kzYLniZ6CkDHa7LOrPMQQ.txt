I could eat here everyday. In fact I do eat here everyday! Chipotle is similar to Subway but with burritos instead of sammiches. When you get there you start out with either a salad, bowl, taco, or burrito and you tell them what you want on it.  I really love their salads the dressing is soo good and their guacamole rocks. If you're on a diet this place isn't for you a burrito is about 1,000 calories!
