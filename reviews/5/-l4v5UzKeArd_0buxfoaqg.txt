This place is awesome!  

I am pretty well-versed in Mexican cuisine and in all these years, I've never found a place this tasty!

The food takes a while to get prepared, but that tells you they actually cook it rather than "assemble" it as they do in most Mexican restaurants.  

Menudo, posole, sopa de res, all variants of camaron.... Unbelievably good.  I've taken some of my employees after work and they ALL agree the food is legit!  

Also, they are open 24 hours!  

Forget Filibertos, Alibertos.. and any other "bertos" and try them out!  You will NOT be disappointed!
