Awesome breakfast burritos. They're huge and have the perfect combination in each bite. We loved how you could pick from multiple hot sauce flavors. My burrito was the bacon, egg, cheese and potato. It's usually my go to choice which gives me a standard in which I use to rate which is best. I ate half and saved the other half for dinner which was the perfect amount.
