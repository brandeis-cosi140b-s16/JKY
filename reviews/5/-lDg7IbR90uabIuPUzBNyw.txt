I think the bad reviews are missing the point of Carolina's. This is a home cooking style of casual restaurant. The rice and beans are just like nana makes. The tacos had real shredded beef and were overstuffed. The chips and salsa are fresh and made on site. It's not meant to be Abuelos or some other high end spot. It's genuine home cooking, fast, fresh, and cheap!  I think the number of people that were there for lunch today would also agree.
