My wife and I walked 5 miles to this location, and it was worth every step! Great food, friendly service and generous servings. So good, we went twice in one day, for lunch and dinner (we drove the second time). The price is also pretty good, around $7 for two good sized tacos, rice, beans and a drink. The food is made to order, which means you might have to wait a little. But when it arrives, it's hot, fresh and served with a smile.
