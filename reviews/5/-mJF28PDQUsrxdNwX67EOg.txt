Its pretty awesome here, they have well priced food that tastes really good. Their red salsa is a little bit on the extra spicy side and that's OK. :) 
They offer everything from breakfast to desert and mid meal treats. 
We had the chorizo breakfast burrito, horchata, 
champurrado and ham and egg plate for breakfast today. Everything we had was good, so we came back for some snacks in the evening.
We ordered some esquites, chamango, and agua fresca and they did not disappoint. 
I recommend this place, and we will be back.
