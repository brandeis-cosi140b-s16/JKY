Sometimes it's the simple things that you remember. I've been here many times and never been disappointed but somehow this little place was forgotten in my mind. I guess it's because I don't make it around here much. Today, I was STARVING! I just happen to be in the area and remembered them. I ordered something off of their menu. A simple bean tostada but asked for shredded beef. I had just worked out and needed the extra protein. This tostada was delivered to my table and the angels where singing. Ahhhhh! It was just what I needed! You know, it wasn't JUST a tostada. He decorated it with a special cheese. It was pretty too, go figure. Well, as famished as I was, I tried not to gobble and managed to slow down to enjoy the flavors. I had a party in my mouth. Who knew... A tostada could be so yummmmy? I totally recommend this little place. Not only are they accommodating, yummy but I enjoyed a clean yet tasteful dinning experience.
