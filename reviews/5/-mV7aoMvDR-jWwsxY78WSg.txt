Had lunch and breakfast here on a 13 day trip to Vegas.  Would've came more often if I'd found it earlier.

Lunch was carne Asada and chorizo burrito smothered Christmas style, with a side of green chile stew and a $1 draft beer (yes, really $1).   Burrito was great, but be prepared for HEAT, esp with the green chile.  Beer was icy cold.

Breakfast was an "everything" breakfast burrito with red chile sauce inside, way less heat and also delicious.
