Wow, what awesome food! Not only is the food great but Josh, the manager, is the most friendly, service-oriented food biz manager I've ever met. He informed me that they use only grass-fed beef, free range chicken, hormone - free pork, and high quality fish; the flavors are awesome and you can feel good about eating it. I will be a lifer.
