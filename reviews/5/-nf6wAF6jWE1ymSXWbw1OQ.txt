While burrito express may not look like the most classy establishments they do make one heck of a great burrito. The tortillas are the best. I don't think they are homemade but thy sure taste that way. I also love their salsa. I think they make big batches and freeze it because it has been a little icy at times but still good. They are quick, polite, and delicious. A weekend repeat for sure.
