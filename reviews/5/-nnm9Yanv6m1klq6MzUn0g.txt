We have gone to their Container Park location several times and we have always walked away feeling full and satisfied. Now that this location is much closer to our house, we will be going here much more frequently. My wife and I dig the combination plate with your choice of 3 Tacos, beans and rice. I recommend the "Gringo" and the Al Pastor. Try it with some Diablo hot sauce and was it down with a cold beer (once they get their liquor license at this location). Thanks for making us feel like friends coming to dinner.
