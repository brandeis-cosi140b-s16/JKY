Upscale Mexican in a beautiful, comfortable environment. The complimentary homemade tortilla chips arrived with 3 sauces plus 2 spices which could be added according to one's taste. The grilled vegetable appetizer with balsamic glaze was perfectly prepared, beautiful and delicious. Fish tacos were Baja-style - no deep frying here. The fish was fresh and flavorful, drizzled with 2 sauces and served with black beans. 
Service was efficient, attentive without being overbearing. I loved the place -- you will too!
