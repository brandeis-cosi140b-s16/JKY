BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!!!
There is a reason the line is out the door and people are willing to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get their order. It's authentic and made to order so if you're short on time call ahead to place your order but it's well worth the wait  Whether it's a burro or chimichanga, red or green, taco or enchilada, it's all amazing.
