We have been going to this place since it opened and we love it. The menu is good and they will bend over backward to accomodate you. It is not fancy but it is good, the portions are big and the service is friendly. We live close by, but we still have to drive so we could go anywhere. When they first opened my husband asked for Scotch which they didn't have, the next time we went int hey had his Chivas and he is happy.Also the food is always tasty, not just a protein thrown in sauce and served . This food is flavorful and well spiced.
