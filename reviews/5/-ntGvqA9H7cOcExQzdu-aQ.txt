Oh my god... 

I used to hate Chipotle. HATE! Hate. When asked why, I said, "Because they offer rice burritos to vegetarians." I thought the burritos were 90 percent rice, 10 percent goodness, even when I asked for light rice. 

I was, as it turns out, save-ably stupid. Because redemption is mine every time I eat here. 

They get it. They "Get It" get it. They GET IT with a capital GET IT. 

Oh, I shall explain. Worry ye not... 

I want the world to stop eating meat. In fact, it is my destiny, my very purpose, to rid the world of Fear (i.e., meat). It's true, all you're eating when you're eating meat is fear. 98 percent of you will have no idea what I mean when I say that but I can promise you it's true. 

But I don't want Chipotle to stop serving meat because people like you would stop going there and it'd go out of business and I would die because there would be nothing left for me to eat, because lately, it's all I eat. Yes. I ate twice today. Both times, Chipotle. If I lose weight, I'll become the next Jared. Gain. Ignominy. Whatevs...

It's delicious.

So here's what they get: 

The freshest ingredients.

The meat, if you care, is straight up not injected with growth hormones or bull shit. 

Portions are huge. Almost too big. 

But the technology OOOOOHHHHHHH the technology! 

Like Chuck R said... YOU CAN ORDER ON YOUR iPhone! It's ridiculous.

And our office orders as an office. ONLINE! Individually! Again, ridiculous! We can order exactly what we want, pay separately. The orders are prepared with love. They'll bring it out to your car. They'll even occasionally call you to make sure everything was amazing. 

It was! It always is. I love you. Smooch.
