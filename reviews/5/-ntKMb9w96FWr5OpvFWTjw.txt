I really enjoyed my time at Barrio Urbano. The Hispanic flared location has an open kitchen area with great artwork accents. I started with the guacamole and chips and finished with the Menudo. All was fresh and very tasty. I am a bit biased because I am a huge fan of urban foods and looks. If in the area and want some Mexican food with a twist this is a must stop. Not a lot of space tho so make sure you have some time if the place is busy.
