Just love, love love it here.  I love the cute beachy decor and the place is always clean.  The menu has a great selection.  I just love the California Burrito - it is yummy.  We get it without onions.  My daughter loves the Cheese Quesadilla.  We always get a side of fries.  They are now selling Hamburgers too - not sure why they added it but if you are trying to please everyone in a group for me it is a great thing to add to the menu.  I love that you can call your order in and it is ready for pick-up.  For a great mexican food - check this out.
