Just tried this new retaurant the last couple of days, once for dinner and once for lunch.  Johnni runs the place all by himself, and the food here is OUTSTANDING.  Real Mexican food with fresh, homemade ingredients, and best of all you don't get all salted out like so many other Mexican Food places.  A modest setting, but you get great chips and a salsa bar where you choose your favorite sauces, all of them are excellent.  The food, and we have tried them all now, is absolutely delicious with both red and green sauces hard to choose which is best.  Fresh ingredients go on everything, and the rellanos stuffed chiles are wrapped in egg roll wrapper and deep fried, which sounds different but turns out to be a brilliant idea.  The owner is a terrific guy who clearly understands food, and his recipes are his family's.  The prices are good, and you can order and take out which makes it easy to take food home for the family.  Nothing here is not excellent.  We are going back at least once a week from now on.  Must give this place a try.
