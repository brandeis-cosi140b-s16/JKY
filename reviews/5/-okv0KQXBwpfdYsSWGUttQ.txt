Wow. How lucky it is that I've found this place. I hate to cook so I always eat out, and by always, I mean two meals a day. I've been going around different restaurants for months that fit my budget and I would pay around $10 ~ $15 for a decent meal at a decent restaurant. Then I came here. I ordered a lunch special for $6.43. I expected a paltry amount but no, I was quite full and the food was delicious! And the food wasn't watered-down Americanized food; it was genuine Mexican food. Since then, I've been coming here EVERYDAY (literally). I don't know how they are able run their business, serving such high quality food while charging so little. I almost fear that they might go out of business. I feel obligated to leave this five-star review because I want them to have a lot of customers. I absolutely love the place. Highly recommended.
