This place only having 3 and 1/2 stars is a joke!!!!  These tacos are awesome, quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had!!  Quality and quantity of food was top notch!!! Service was incredibly good!!!!  We had the chips, salsa, queso, jalape√±o beer, margaritas, fish and chicken tacos and everything was perfect!  We will be back.
