This was my first but definitely not goin to be my last time orderin for here!!!. The chicken burrito was great and so was the chkn quesadilla. I asked for the beans and rice to be on the side and it was done! The delivery was quick and accurate, the driver didn't get lost! Lol I would definitely recommend this place for food!!! I will be back for more!!
