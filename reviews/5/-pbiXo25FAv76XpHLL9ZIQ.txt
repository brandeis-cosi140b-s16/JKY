This is my favorite late night Mexican food place. If you like steak, get the Carne Asada burrito. It's like $6-8 and it's large enough to share. All it is is steak and a bit of a guac mix... what it is - is the best late night dinner ever!
I have used this burrito for many successful bribes with my husband as it makes a great reward. 
My friend loves the fish taco - it's very big too. One of them is plenty to fill you up. The only down side is it's very difficult to eat while driving so plan to be stationary when you order one of these.
The regular taco sauce I would say is pretty mild so if you like it hot be sure to ask for a hot sauce instead of what normally comes with the food.
