Spoiler Alert: This place makes Filibertos look like Taco Bell.

In the West Valley, a name like "Polibertos" doesn't stand out. There are dozens of little taco shops out here, you can't drive more than a mile without seeing one. But this place is anything but generic. In fact, it's AMAZING!

Everything you order here is bigger than you expect for the low prices. If you get anything besides a simple taco or burrito, use the buddy system because you'll NEED help finishing the majority of meals on their menu.


My favorite dish on the menu is the carne asada fries. The meat is thoroughly seasoned, and the whole dish is smothered in guacamole and sour cream. I was excited to see the cook throwing on two freaking handfuls of shredded cheddar to make it all oh-so perfect. It's $8, making it one of the most expensive eats they have, but it takes TWO people to finish it, unless you're Adam Richmond or something. 

The place is always sparkling clean, it doesn't look shady, and the service is kind and quick. After I order, my food is usually out by the time I finish a game on the Ms. Pacman machine in the corner.

Best of all, the lobby (and drive thru!) is open 24 hours. So whether you're craving some chorizo for breakfast, or looking for a nice rich meal after a round of late night drinking, this is going to be your new spot. I extend my apologies to the countless competitors in the west valley--they've been outclassed.
