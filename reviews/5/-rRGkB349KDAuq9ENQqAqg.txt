After living in Phoenix for over four years we finally found a Mexican place we love.  This is a family owned seemingly authentic Mexican hole in the wall recently under new ownership.  We were greeted by the owners son who speaks perfect English. He brought us fresh  chips and spicy salsa which were delicious.  The menu has a ton of sea food options ie shrimp octopus tilapia etc.  The menu also offers beef and chicken items, I noticed beef tongue which I would have ordered but for my dietary restrictions.  I ended up ordering the entire hot red tilapia and my wife ordered chili relleno.  Both entrees came with house salad, rice, vegetarian beans, and a warm flour tortilla.  The fish was absolutely amazing in a perfectly spiced red sauce with grilled onions.  My wife's relleno was fine but she regretted not ordering a fish item.  All that plus a beer for 24$ before tip.  We will be regulars here
