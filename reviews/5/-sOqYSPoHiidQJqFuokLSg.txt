My family and I regularly eat at Juan's Flaming Fajitas.  The food is great, my kids love to see the fire when they light up the fajitas!  We took my brother there last week and he wanted a shrimp burrito. It was not part of their menu, but they made him one anyway and he said it was GREAT!  They are very accommodating here and always friendly.
