Been eating here for years and it doesn't disappoint (well, sometimes). 

I mainly come for the menudo but I also come because of the prices, it's clean and quick service and I know that what I've ordered will be both filling and satisfying. 

One thing:  the salsas are HOT! I cannot eat them out the jar even after all this time. You've been warned:-)
