Absolutely delicious. I work right next to Anita's and ever since a co-worker recommended it, I am a twice to three times a week regular. 

As far as value goes, you can't beat it. For only a few dollars, you will get more food than you can eat. I generally get a burrito, taco and rice and make the burrito "supreme," but it seems you really can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. 

Pro tip: ask for their homemade hot sauce. It's incredible.
