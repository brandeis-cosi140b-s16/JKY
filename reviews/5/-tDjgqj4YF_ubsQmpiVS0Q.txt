My husband and I were in Vegas with some friends, we also have some family who used to live here and they suggested to come here for weekend brunch.  I am glad they did!  We would have never known this place was here and we would have missed out.  It was awesome!!  I had the bottomless mimosas and they were fantastic.  I tried several!  Lol.  We were with a group of people and ordered some dishes "family style" as we got full we then ordered the rest as individuals.  The green corn tamale was to die for!  The lobster pancake was not.  I was glad we only ordered one.  The shrimp and grits were also excellent, husband hates grits and he tried them and I swear he ate half of mine.   I think we must have tried everything on the menu and our sever Rachel was so helpful and patient.  She explained everything and made sure my drink was never empty for long. :) This place is a must when you are in Vegas.  Go here for brunch, order the bottomless mimosas, ask for Rachel, and you will not be disappointed.  ( just don't get the lobster pancake!)
