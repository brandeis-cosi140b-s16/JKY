My family was visiting AZ and we found this restaurant on Yelp.  It was outstanding.  We had lunch where we ordered steak and mahi-mahi taco's with a shrimp salad and guacamole appetizer.  We sat in the outside dining room and received excellent service and excellent food.  The banana foster with peanut butter flavored ice cream was delicious as were the chorizo's .  The food portions were also very good.  When you finished eating you were full but not stuffed.
