damit! this is my favorite hidden gem for mexican food in madison. hands down the best tostadas, margueritas, burrittos and soups i've ever had. authentic and delicious. that being said....its becoming more and more popular, which is great for them- but has made waiting times longer. oh well. they deserve it.
