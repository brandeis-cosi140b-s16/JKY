This family owned, reasonably priced Mexican restaurant is not only a rare find in Vegas but it's also beyond delicious! The young son of the owners, Sam, is the host, server and busser; and does a great job! The chips and salsa are the AMAZING start to a home cooked meal you'll love. My husband got the 5$ special which was 3 fish tacos; inhaled it and ordered it again! I got the huevos Mexicana which I continued to eat after being stuffed. Sam recommended the dish because it's what his mom cooks for them at home for breakfast. Sam's mom is your chef so be patient while she cooks food for you, that's good enough for her family!
