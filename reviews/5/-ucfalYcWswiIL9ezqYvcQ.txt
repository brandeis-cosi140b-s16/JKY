Do not expect to be overwhelmed with a beautiful atmosphere when you walk in Mi Familia Mexican Food Restaurant. Start thinking strip mall, Roberto's or Fredericko's with a Rocky Point type bar attached and you will not be disappointed! We went on a week night and had great service. Our server was very, very attentive and sweet. The food was outstanding! The portion size was very big (took 1/2 home) and had very good prices. Happy hour prices are great! We will definitely go back!
