Okay so I made a review for this place back when they first opened, since then they have really gotten their shit together. 

I went in last night for a 3 item plate. I got a plain carne asada taco, chile relleno, and an enchilada. Everything was excellent except for the enchilada. It was like 3 small taco tortillas in one wrapped up to make it long but it didn't have enough meat in it. Does that make sense? Not enough meat/tortilla ratio.

Anyways the taco was perfect! Can easily compare to the one's you'd find on the east side. The meat was very flavorful. The chile relleno was good too, the sauce has great flavor.

My dislikes are simple peeves not enough to take any stars away.

1. I went right before they closed so they ran out of lemon, I got 3 tiny pieces but I feel like that's my fault for going so late.

2. The red sauce still doesn't do it for me. I prefer the home made salsa's and this one tastes like spicy pace :(


That's it! Everything else has so much flavor, especially the rice! I'm sad it took nearly 2 years for me to go back, but I'm glad I did and I'm glad they've improved.
