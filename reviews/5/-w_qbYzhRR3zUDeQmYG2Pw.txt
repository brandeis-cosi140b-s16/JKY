The best street tacos I've ever had anywhere.  Get the adobada pork for sure.  I also like the carne asada too, but the pork is special.  The chefs who prepare them are also fun to watch as the sling ingredients into the air and make tacos from scratch with such speed that it's amazing.  I would consider moving to Las Vegas just to be near this restaurant.
