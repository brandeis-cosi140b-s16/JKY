First coming in I didn't feel very welcomed and towards the end of the service line I was hoping it would get better and it did. The young lady that was at the register was so very friendly and made my experience so much better. I want to thank her so much for smiling during our quick conversation. Sometimes a smile makes ur whole day. Thank u so much Cassie!!
