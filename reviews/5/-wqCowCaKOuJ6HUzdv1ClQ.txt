Ok, I've passed by this place a number of times now and the parking lot has been packed. So today it was empty so I hopped in and placed a quick order for an asada taco, chicken fajita taco and a desebrada (shredded beef) taco. Add a Mexican Coke and total was $7.01. Fast out to the table. It's a neat concept, build your own street tacos. Pick your tortilla type, I chose flour. I added fresh onion, a little cilantro, fresh pico and the sauce of my choice. Awesome. It's hard to declare a favorite meat, each one was good. And filled my tortillas well. No skimping on the meat at all. Chips also came with my order. Love the sauces. My head is still sweating as I type this. I will be back again and again.
