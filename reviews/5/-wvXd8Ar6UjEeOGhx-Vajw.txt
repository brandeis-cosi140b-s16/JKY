Came here for happy hour after work. I got a beef fajita quesadilla and a couple of beers to was it down. 
The quesadilla was really good. I asked for roasted jalape√±os inside and extra crispy and they hit the mark. I couldn't have been happier. And pints for $2.50 isn't bad either. 
When I got in it was dead and 30 mins later the bar was packed. I felt bad for the only one bartender on duty.
