What a find!  I absolutely love this place!  Don't be scared by the little shack of a building this restaurant is in, the food is some of the freshest, tastiest Mexican I've ever come across!  I highly recommend the carne asada burrito, which is jammed packed with meat and includes guacamole as standard.  It is more then ample in size, even for a hungry customer.  The Rolando's breakfast burrito is outstanding as well and is filled with thick cuts of bacon.  Make sure to get the green sauce to accompany the breakfast burrito or any item on the menu, it is a true gem of this establishment!  Spicier then most green salsas you'll get at these "fast food" Mexican restaurants and WAY better!  Other favorites include the fish tacos, beef taco, and carne asada quesadilla.  The quality of the food here is superior to that of any filbertos or los betos, even though it has the same type of feel.  The staff here churns out delicious food at an incredible pace, even at the busiest of times.  When I lived near Rolando's, I would come here 2-3 time a week for the exceptional value of this amazing food.  Now that I don't live in the area anymore, I find myself making excuses to drop by this special little place!
