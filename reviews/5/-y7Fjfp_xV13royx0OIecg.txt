o.k. it is Pedros, but the baked Friday night fish is the best I had in Madison.  Great texture, spices, the rye bread, chipotle sauce and coleslaw were great too.   Of course the freshly baked tortillas were fattening and awesome.  The atmoshpere is a little off, but a great surpise for Friday fish.
