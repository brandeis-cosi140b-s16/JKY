Awesome!. My husband brought some dinner from this place and he's been telling everyone about how good everything was. So I finally had a chance to go and take some food for lunch. I asked the guy if he had rolled tacos filled with potatoes, He said we can do anything you like. I loved that answer. 
I got 5 potato rolled tacos with rice and beans. Everything was delicious, this is the best Mexican fast food I've eaten in the U.S.
The beans and rice  tasted homemade, the taquitos were crunchy and with enough filling. Next time I will ask with no guacamole or cheese, because I got so full. I was able to eat only 3.My only complaint or comment is that I got the habanero salsa and a regular salsa, and the regular salsa was spicier than the habanero one. Maybe they got mixed. Even the salsas are really good and you can actually taste different flavors on each salsa. ( the others fast food places, all their salsas taste the same or don't have any flavor).
I have to add, the cashier was so nice and friendly and my order was ready in less then 10 minutes.
