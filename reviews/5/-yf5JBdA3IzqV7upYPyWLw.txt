This was such a cute and fun place! Not kitchy cheesy normal mexican restaurant decor-good enough for a date night or couples to share some grub. I'm surprised it wasn't busier! You get to sit around stations where the chefs prepare your food next to the table.  Kind of reminds me of Mexican Benihana?!  But with out a flashy show.  Our server was very nice and attentive but not overly attentive. Perfect!! The chef that prepared our meal was super nice. 
Good salsa and chips.  Very fresh! Started out with the table side guac- they do make it very spicy- so make sure if you like mild to tell them. It was so good but the Serrano that they happened to have that day was particularly hot so we definitely were downing ice tea for awhile. But still really good!! Very fresh and very yummy-next time we will go mild I guess I'm a weenie! we also shared the beef fajitas which were very delicious. Lots of fresh red and yellow bell peppers and onions. Yummy. The only thing that I though was so so was the corn. I've had more tender corn that was a little more flavorful... But it also isn't corn season so maybe that's why. Plus there is groupons for this place??! Yes please!!!! And it's awesome!! Please try it! It fun and it is tasty!  Plus we saw someone order a burrito enchilada style and it looked delish- and enough to feed a 3rd world country! Bring friends to share some Large portioned burritos!!! :) definitely on our date night Mexican place! Loved it!
