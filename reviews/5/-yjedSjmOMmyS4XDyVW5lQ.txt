Went in last night everything was great, we always order the south of the border sampler which has a little bit of everything and plenty to take home...pollo fundido, tostadas, mini chimis, taquitos and beans...yum yum wish they had this at the other one on cave creek but they took it off the menu years ago and changed it up to things we don.t like....miss the turtles in the pond!!
