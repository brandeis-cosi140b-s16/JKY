I was kind of turned off when I pulled into the parking lot, but I decided to try this place after researching and it got amazing reviews on Yelp and other websites.  Although the outside is a little unappealing, the food was so so so good!  The salsa was very spicy, and tastey!  I would definately go back for some good Mexican seafood!
