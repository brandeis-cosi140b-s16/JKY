About once a month I crave their chips/salsas, cheese quesadillas,  pink margaritas, along with their happy hour prices.  

And I'm not even pregnant.

First off, you get two delicious salsas - one red, one green - with a big pail of tortilla chips.  The chips are usually warm and fresh upon arrival.  I'm a chips and salsa gal, so if I do Mexican, I make a mini feast out of that.

They have happy hour almost every day of week (including Sundays), that include half priced appetizers and certain drinks (like the yummy Pink Taco Margarita).  The quesadillas come with guac, sour cream and some kind of sweet brown paste which is delicious.  

If I go during happy hour, my check with the quesadilla and margarita is around $10, which is fine by me.  

The decor inside is pretty cool and they have an outdoor area that's great for people watching.  

There are a couple things about this place that may fool people: the vaguely Hooters-esque vibe of the waitresses, the touristy area and the innuendo regarding the restaurant's name.  

But at he end of a long work day where I'm craving Mexican on the way home, the food is good and the prices are low.  The service is decent too.  

I've taken friends and family from out of town there who also approve.
