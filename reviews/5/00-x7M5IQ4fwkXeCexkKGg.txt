Clean and fresh! This place looks like a hotel lobby but serves up some of the best Mexican food I've enjoyed in a long time. Was at first worried about how fancy the place looked...I prefer my tacos from a more grimy or dingy looking spot...gives it flavor I feel. Ordered the breakfast burrito, ended up with what appeared to be a massive meal that could have easily been shared and kept me full all day, and less than $7! Fresh meat right off the grill, made to order. They'll serve you up some samples if simply ask. They have it all...a wide variety of meats (everything from nose to tail it seems like) and veggies. The salsa bar is easily the most impressive I've ever seen...fresh made salsas, fresh cut veggies, grilled veggies still steaming, and boiling beans. The homemade horchata was unbelievable. Service was a little slow, which is fine considering that they basically build your meal from scratch. Looking forward to going back for more!
