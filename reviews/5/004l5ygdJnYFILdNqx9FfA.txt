I was last week with two friends. From the moment we crossed the door people was always super friendly and smiling. Good impression! Service was impeccable and food excellent! I ordered Tacos Carnita and was delicious! We all shared our food so I tasted a bit of everything. Manager Matt came to the table to ask many time how was everything and even Paco (Chef) explained the desserts we ordered. As I told them I hope they keep fresh food and the good service.
