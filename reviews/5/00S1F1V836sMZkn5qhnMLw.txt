I was reading some of these reviews of COB and I have no idea what these loonies are saying? I went here last night and had a fantastic experience. I got the always amazing #13, Bit of everything plate with a beef tamale, no cheese. It was perfect. This food is like family style food made with love. If you are looking for some hole in the wall, found in the bario, this may not be for you as it is food you bite into and your eyes close and you say,"mmmh". The new place is pretty cool, it had a Blade Runner/Ski Lodge feel to it. I also had a Hornitos margarita, which was the perfect capper on this lovely evening. Can't wait to come back and try the desert. I don't want to forget the service, everyone kept our drinks full, extra napkins, and made sure we were enjoying our meal. Keep up the great work COB. "I'll be back."
