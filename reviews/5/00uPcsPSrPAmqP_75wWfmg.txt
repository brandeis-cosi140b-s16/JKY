Came here for my birthday lunch over the weekend as we were craving Mexican and this was close by. 

The interior was a little bit more causal than I expected; the big menu across the top gave it more of a sit down fast food kind of a vibe.   Regardless, we were greeted promptly and asked if we were dining in or take out. We were handed menus and grabbed a table in the back. The waiter came over shortly with waters and a small thing of chips and salsa. The chip basket they bring out is small unlike most Mexican restaurants I have been too. But I almost prefer this because I usually just keep eating and eating and before you know it, two huge baskets of chips gone and no room for an entree. The smaller serving of chips is nice because I don't feel like I have to keep eating and I actually had room left in my stomach when my entree arrived haha. 


The menu is a little on the smaller side, but everything looked really good. I got the chicken chimichangas and my date got the Milanese chicken torta. I've also never tried horchata, so I ordered a glass. 

The Horchata was out of this world good. I highly recommend you try it. So sweet and delicious with the perfect hint of cinnamon. And while I also have never had a chimichanga before so I don't have anything I compare to, they were good! You get a serving of beans and rice with the entree. Very filling and yummy. It was fresh and hot! 

If you're looking for an affordable authentic Mexican taste, try Los Gemelos! Our waiter was friendly and helpful with suggestions, which is always a plus :)
