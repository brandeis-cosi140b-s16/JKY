The salsa...can I ever say enough good things about the salsa?  I could eat it with a spoon but instead I much on their thin, crispy chips that compliment the salsa perfectly.  

Their sangria is delicious and my hubby and I split a carafe every time we go there.  My only complaint is that you can't get the happy hour price if you are eating at the restaurant - which is just 5 feet away.

We love their enchiladas and there is a fish dish (whose name escapes me right now) that is amazing.

Service is always friendly and excellent.  By far, one of our favorite restaurants!
