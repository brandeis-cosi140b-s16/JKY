For Las Vegas it's great! When I saw that there was a Los Toritos tacos here I was so happy! and sketchy because I wanted to know if they tasted as good as the one here where I used to live. I ate the food and oh man it was real good! Iv'e ate gorditas, taco de asad, buche, carnitas, tortas, burrito. Everything tastes REAL GOOD! Good location, plenty of parking. Close to my HOUSE! The retsaurant is clean and big. It came out to be a whole lot better than the one in my home town! Want to know why? Because went I went back to my home town and ate here, I loved the flavor of the other Los Torritos restaurant! 

  Good prices, I think it is a lot cheaper than the one in L.A. Not so sure on that, but will check it. The food comes out fast so no worries there. Alright amount of people there all the time so you know it's good. Never have gone to the bathroom tho, I avoid that... Now after living in L.A for 21 yrs and to be convinced by another restaurant in the family... Now that's a work out! Eating of course... So I aften came to place whenever I could not find any better mexican food. They place was a real life saver for me and my family lol.
