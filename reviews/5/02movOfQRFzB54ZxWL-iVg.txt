MR C and I loved this little gem in Wickinberg. Stopped for a bite and a beer on our way home from a CA road trip. We got there just before the happy hour (2-6).  Hubby and I both ordered the traditional mexican style tacos, aka taquitos- He carne asada & the marinated pork, me just the asada. Delish! I also had the shredded beef tostada and it was amazing too. The shredded beef was delish.  The Pacifico beers were perfectly ice cold and at $3.75 regular price, also not bad. However, if it were happy hour (again from 2-6) they would have been cheaper. Our waiter asked if he could get us anything else... I asked if I could try the $2.00 happy hour margarita for 2.00 even though it was like 1:40, He said sure.  WOWSA. Im not a huge fan of margs, but this was pretty good. Hubby liked it too.  We will totally go out of our way to return to this little treasure again.   This place is dated, but oh so clean.  

just excellent.
