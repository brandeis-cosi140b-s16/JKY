I grew up 15 min from the TJ border and this franchise is based in Chula Vista... Where I lived . Fast, hot, and authentic Mexican fast food ... Finally a California Burrito and a Machaca Burrito in Las Vegas that doesn't suck. Keep I mind it's fast food.... Not fine dining. This store is much cleaner than others I've been to in to in town
