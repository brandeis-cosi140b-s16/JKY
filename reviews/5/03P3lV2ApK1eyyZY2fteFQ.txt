Had the grilled seasoned fish sandwich, best fish sandwich I have EVER had! The  help yourself Salsa Bar is awesome, homemade chips just the way I love them light and crispy.

When they set down the sandwich they also gave me a whole squeeze container of Baja Sauce, I almost cried. It went on the sandwich, I squeezed some in my salsa and mixed it up.

Service was good, food was speedy, atmo is chillaxin cantina style, great price point. I will be returning a lot!
