This place is amazing. The food is what I would say is very authentic tasting food with the right balance of flavor and heat. I had to order the signature dish and I was not disappointed....The Molcajeta come out ripping hot.. it was explained to me in english and spanish since when I go to spanish speaking establishment they are not to sure which languages to speak... either way is ok with me and the occasional spanglish... The dish will feed two people for sure. The seating was a little tricky it was Sunday and it was packed the mariachi group was playing and families where waiting to be seated but after about ten minutes of waiting I was seated. I am sure if you go early you can avoid this type of situation..The staff was really helpful with getting pople in and out.

If you are in Las Vegas and enjoy venturing out beyond the buffets....This is the place for authentic flavor of Mexico....
