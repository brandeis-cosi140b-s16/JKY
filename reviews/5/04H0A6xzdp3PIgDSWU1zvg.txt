The food here was awesome. We started with the carne asada fries which were incredible. Fries were just crispy enough, and the cheese was nice and gooey. My boyfriend had the shrimp tacos and couldn't stop raving about them. I had the arrachera, and it was cooked perfectly. And the homemade tortillas were delicious. The house margaritas were so good. No premade sour mix! Yay! I'll definitely be back!
