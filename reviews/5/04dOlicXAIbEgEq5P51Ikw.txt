Blown away ! Best ive had outside of Mexico. Old school all the way around. All sorts of options but the steak and spicy pork win my vote for tasty over load. At $2 a taco and super quick service you really cant go wrong. Sit outside and enjoy the sunshine off Las Vegas Blvd. 5 star Ill be back (few times)
