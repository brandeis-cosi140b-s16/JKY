Today I went to chipotle I even called in advance to see if they were open. I waited outside for about 5 minutes I was the first guest in line I ordered my usual salad. Then when it came to check out a very nice young lady who was the manger that morning told me she was sorry for any inconvenience and that she will take care of my lunch today it was very nice! They will always have my business because their is always excellent customer service
