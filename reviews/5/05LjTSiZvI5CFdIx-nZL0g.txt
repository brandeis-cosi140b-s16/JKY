Ok, first let me just remind everyone that this is fast food.  So by giving this 5 stars, I am not saying it's some sort of gourmet restaurant.  As far as fast food goes, I feel like this place is one of the best.  Everything I have eaten here has been excellent.  I especially lik ethe newer burritos.  They have a spicy chipotle burrito that is especially good.  I recommend the chicken nachos, but you should eat in for those because they use a queso cheese that will qucikly make the chips soggy if you take it to go.  They have a salsa bar with this delicious avocado salsa, as well as hot and mild salsas.  I also like the fact that almost every week I get coupons in the mail from El Pollo Loco which helps me save some money.  The chicken is flavorful, the portions are high, and the cost is about the same as anywhere else.  If I had any complaints it would be that the seating in this particular place is a little tight.
