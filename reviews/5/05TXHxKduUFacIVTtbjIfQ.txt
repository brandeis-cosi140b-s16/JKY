I'm picky about Mexican food.

I enjoyed the food here.  A lot.
So much so, that I would like to come back, daily.
But I'm not rich, so I won't

However!
Here is what I loved when I ate here:

1.  Rocky Point Pizza- cheese and shrimp and mango sauce... SO GOOD!!!
2.  Spicy jalapeno sausage slider things.  Really spicy.  For realz.  But they have this delicious spicy mayo on them... OMG.  To die for.
3.  Mini chimis.  Succulent meat and cheese wrapped in a cute pocket and deep fried.  Need I say anything else.

So yes.  I'm a big fan.
