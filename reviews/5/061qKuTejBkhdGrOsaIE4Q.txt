This IS the place I've been dreaming about. Stumble upon this place a year ago and have been thinking of the food since. Every time I get to Phoenix, this is the one must stop. Everything is good, but I recommend getting your enchilada Christmas style (both red and green sauce)! 
Great value, great food and great service.
