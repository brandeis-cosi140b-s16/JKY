Really good, spicy chicken tacos. Guacamole is flavorful. Good tequila selection. Open until 6am, so it is a good late night stop.

They seemed more slammed than normal when I went, which led to the servers providing the best service possible (and the effort showed), but things were a little sluggish. Not faulting them, they did their best with whatever cards they were dealt.

The cilantro on the tacos was fresh and crisp, a big selling point for me and a lot better than shredded cabbage and radish like one place that will not be named.

I wish they had the typical chips & salsa to start out with, but no biggie. Will definitely go back!
