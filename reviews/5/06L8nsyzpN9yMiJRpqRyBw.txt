We took all 4 girls to Dick's for lunch yesterday.  We had a little trouble finding it.   Dick's is very small and was quite busy.  We were lucky and they sat us at the bar without waiting.  

 This was our first visit and we really had no idea what to expect.  I did read the reviews and took a look at the menu so we thought it would be a good fit for us.  

The server brought us menus and took our drink order.  We noticed that the cooking was taking place right in front of us at the bar.  The area is very small but they seemed to make it work.  We couldnt believe how large the servings were that the cooks were preparing.  We ordered and our food came to us about 15 minutes later.  It was VERY good to say the least.  

The atmosphere was great.  The food was great.  It is a little pricey but worth it.

The best way to sum it up is that my wife said "if this place was closer to home we would eat here alot".
