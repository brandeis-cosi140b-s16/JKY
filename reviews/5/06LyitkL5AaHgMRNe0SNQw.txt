Excellent Mexican food, reasonable prices for the portions. This is not Texmex food. Real stone ground yellow corn tortillas. Fresh handmade guacamole. Had the carne' asada which came with grilled plantains, rice, beans (not refried), and salad with avocado, and fresh made green salsa. The salsa was in a small container, but a little went a long way. Friendly service. I ate there two lunches in a row and it would have been more if I was in town longer. My wife had the chimichanga which were huge and filled with lots of meat. She finished 3/4 of one of the two included with the order. This is the real deal Mexican food with Mexican TV on in the background. This is not a place to go for your brightly colored typical Americanized Mexican decor, but a great place for great food.
