Authentic Mexican fast-food chain, WITH cold beer, friendly employees and sustainable, great tasting fish?  YES!!  It's a delight every time I go.  The food is fresh and made to order, the service is always top notch and for me, the commitment to sustainable fishing practices goes a long way.  I recommend Rubio's every time someone from back east comes out to visit.
