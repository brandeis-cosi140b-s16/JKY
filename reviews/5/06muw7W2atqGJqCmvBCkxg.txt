My new favorite "go to" restaurant in the area! Love the food, love the service, love the atmosphere. I have been here a few times already and have left happy and full every time.

This location use to be the old El Jefe's restaurant but newly converted to Sabor. I always describe it as a Mexican infusion - Chilis pricing for Carabas quality. I am suprised this place is not busier than it is. It is never packed when we are there.

I LOVE the queso dip. AMAZING! I seriously lick the bowl. It is so delicious. Their bread plate is so awesome as well filled with breads, tortillas ext. YUMLICIOUS!

My favorite dinner so far is the scallops. OMG - so perfectly cooked and every bite delicious. We finished with the banana foster icecream rum dish....it is so good. I have such a hard time sharing it. Next time...I am getting my own..LOL.

So, if you think you can't make it down to Sabor.....I disagree...You Mexi-
CAN! Go now and thank me later!
