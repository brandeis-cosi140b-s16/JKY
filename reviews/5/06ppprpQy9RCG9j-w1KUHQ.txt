This is, by far, the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.  They were so damn friendly today, they gave us free shots because it was Mexcian's  Independence Day and gave my buddy a free desert because it was his B-day.  Not to mention, the burritos are the best in Pittsburgh.  Really is no competition. California, let's go.
