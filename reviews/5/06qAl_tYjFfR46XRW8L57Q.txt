Gotta  this place!!!!!
    Only my 2nd time here, my husband is a regular he ABSOLUTLY LUVS the El Pastor tacos, he raves about them.....,
     My fist visit I did indulge in taco y taco carnitas tacos & yes quite, quite good on the handmade corn tortillas and all fresh ingredients~this time I decided on a different route........almost went the Gran Taco however opted fo a burrito and MAN O MAN WAS IT DELISHHHHHJ~ again with the carnitas ( oh so good, juicy, flavorful, not to spicy for this Gringa! )  also LUV that they offer 2 different bean selections & 2 different guacamole options!!!!! She steamed my flour tortilla, added my options then rolled it and placed it in a grill so it was slightly crispy & warm~ just heavenly to me. 
    Another nice feature is the full bar , I ordered a margarita, accepted an upgraded tequila recommendation from the bartender and it was possibly the BEST margarita I have EVER had!!! REALLY & only $7 bucks a total DEAL, in my opinion  
    I also like the decor of Taco y Taco. Clearly it is a restaurant, however it does have a clubby vibe, as I believe it was some sort of nightclub in a previous life.
   If your on Eastern near 215 check Taco y Taco it will make you feel Muy Bueno
