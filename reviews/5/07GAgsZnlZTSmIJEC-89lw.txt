What can I say, be prepared to wait, and be prepared for a taco experience like no other! The place is a old school Vegas institution in a not so good of a location. But I've been coming down to this area for years to find places just like this! Yes, it's straight out of South L.A. with all the questionable characters walking around. Be aware of your surroundings, and mind your own business, and enjoy some damn good tacos! The place occupies a old Wendy's and you have three lines to which to decide to get in. There's a line for Asada and Chorizo tacos, one for pastor and variations of it, and another for beef tongue and tripa. Pick one and get in line and the lines are long! It's worth it, and when you get up there you can always ask for something from the other line. The flour and corn tortillas are hand made and pressed before your eyes! The Asada was flame grilled before your eyes and lathered with a guacamole spread and salsa! Knock you out with the first bite! The spicy pork was equally as impressive, and this all left me thinking. Why aren't our good neighbors from the south of us just mass producing such great goodness as this!! This southern gentleman left thinking when you find a taco joint like this, and there's not many, appreciate it and find your way back again!!
