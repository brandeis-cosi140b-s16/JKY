I'm confused as to how this place is getting great written reviews but only four stars. What do yall want, little dancing chilis with your meal?
This is some of the best Mexican food in a rather wide radius. It's not typical when compared with a lot of the fake bs Mexican restaurants we have. The only way it can be construed as typical is that it's real. If you want something beyond that (which would completely ruin it) then this isn't your place. If you want the good stuff at good prices, don't miss this place.
