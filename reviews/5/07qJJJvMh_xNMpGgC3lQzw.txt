This place is delicious!  It's located off and away from the madness of the strip.  The atmosphere here is what you'd expect of a nicer cantina.  The decor and lighting is great for a place to relax and have a drink or to head out and have a great meal.  The food here is excellent!  Freshly made salsas and warm tortilla chips complimentary.  All of the sauces taste authentic and house made.  Take advantage of the free Flan offer for checking in!  Seriously THE BEST FLAN EVER! You won't be disappointed.
