My wife and I eat here on a regular basis.  The atmosphere is cool and different than most places in Phoenix.  The prices are higher than a typical Phoenix restaurant, but the food is exponentially better!  I always get something with seafood at Barrio and a margarita.  You also need to try the table-side guacamole with pomegranates.  It's great.
