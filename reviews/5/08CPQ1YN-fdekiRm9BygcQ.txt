As mentioned in my Yelp profile I'm a big fan of the Mexican cuisine so when I heard of this place it was immediately bookmarked. I have to say this is on my top 3 list of places to go for Mexican food. Their ingredients are incredibly fresh, flavors are on point, service is friendly and quick, but most of all food is AUTHENTIC and that can be something hard to find on the Las Vegas strip. Last but not least parking can be a hassle on the strip, but these guys got the perfect location. No hassle whatsoever. Can't wait to bring all my friends after drunken fun nights.
