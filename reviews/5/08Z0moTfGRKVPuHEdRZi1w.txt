Fabulous!  Gotta go here.

1.  Ambiance - Great, traditional, can seat large or small parties.  Date, friends, or business, it is great.

2.  Appetizers - the salsa, the home made fresh made tortillas and the bean dip are great and never ending. Just ask for more and there it is.

3.  Food - So good, so much to choose from. If you are eating American style, they have lunch specials with all your popular dishes like Enchiladas, Burritos, Tacos, Taco Salad, and they have more interesting things such as tongue, pork chops and shrimp dishes.  The fish is great, the lunch specials are nice, but my all time favorite is the Caldo de Res.  How many places in NV can  you get this?  It is SOOOOOO GOOOD.

4.  Food part 2.  Forgot about the Menudo, and the tongue.  Lengua a michoacan or tacos de lengua, the beef tongue is great here. You know you gotta have a lot of people coming here to serve the more exotic things.   And, try not to order the burrito, mi amigo. That is like going to a steak restaurant and ordering a PBJ Sandwich. Tasty , but not what you order eating out!

5.  This place may be better than the new on on Carnegie and Horizon Ridge in Henderson.

A must to go.
