Went here for the 1st time today after reading all the positive Yelp reviews. Had a potatoe, egg & cheese burrito and it was perfect. I'm a sucker for a fresh flour tortilla and this place definitely had me at first bite. I've tried a few Mexican places around town and this is my new favorite. Breakfast burros from Fiesta Burrito in North Tempe usually have bits of eggshells in them, Los Faves in south Tempe usually has a long wait, but this place had no wait and no eggshells! Also can't go wrong with the free chips and salsa bar & the friendly staff.
