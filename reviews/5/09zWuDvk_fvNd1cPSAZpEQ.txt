Our family loves great Mexican food and supporting local business. We enjoyed a delicious meal and were impressed with the friendly and polite service. John was our server and was helpful in choosing our entrees and was perceptive in pacing our meal--especially important when eating out with kids on a Saturday night. The staff attitude on the whole was cheerful and welcoming--something missing in many establishments these days. We'll be back. I'll also include a plug for the Serrano Family's neighboring restaurant, Brunchie's. Also delicious, friendly, great sized portions.
