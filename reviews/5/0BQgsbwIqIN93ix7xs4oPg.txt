This is an excellent little find in Wickenberg with a traditional atmosphere, friendly service, and excellent food at reasonable prices. The chips and salsa are excellent as they are crispy and greasless with a fiery salsa. Since it was going to be a late lunch and we were saving room for Golden Corral, I ordered the six rolled tacos (tacitos) which are crispy and greasless with tender shredded chicken and topped with the best caso fresco I have ever had. Round it all off with a cold Dosekes and you will not be disappointed. So, for excellent Mexican food at reasonable prices with friendly service in a traditional atmosphere, Anita's cannot be beat. Keep up the good work guys.!
