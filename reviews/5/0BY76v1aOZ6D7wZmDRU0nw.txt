The food is delicious and it's the only place that I've tried a few times who has never changed their salsa/hot sauce recipe. It's always on point and the service is great. A pretty small place and looks grungy on the outside, but the inside looks like a 5 star restaurant. The patio has fire-pits and it's a great place to bring friends and family for a taste of Mexico.
