Excellent service! Food was delicious. My date and I shared the tortilla soup and the server graciously brought out an additional small bowl without us even asking. The enchilada con mole was fantastic! The side of beans that came with it reminded me of my Mexican grandfather's recipe and brought back great memories. We will most definitely be going back very soon! Highly recommend!!!
