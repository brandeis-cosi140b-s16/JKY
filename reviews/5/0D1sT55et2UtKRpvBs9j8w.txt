Hands down best Mexican in town. We are from utah and when we travel we look for off the beaten path for places like this.  The bbq chili wings and blue cheese dressing are the absolute bomb!  If I had to choose between oxygen and the wings I may opt to hold my breath and eat the wings.  The mole is superb and chef paco knows what he is doing with this stuff we call food. Service was fast, polite and we will be back again.  Even with a nasty strip club next door this place comes out clean and fine. Thank you
