This place is the "BOMB".
First time eating here when we moved to Arizona from California and by far beats many of the So.Cal. fast food Mexican joints!
Carne Asada meat is flavorful and delicious. The burritos are good size for the price. The chicken enchiladas are so good, sauce is a little greasy.
Rolled tacos super crunchy with sour cream, real avocado quac. & shredded cheese on top!
Restaurant is very clean.
Love the salsa bar and my absolute "awesome sauce" is the thick green one. They offer about 3-4 hot sauces, carrots, & pickled onions.
We love this place and will be back on a regular occasion to try out more of the menu!
Stayed tuned for more reviews-
