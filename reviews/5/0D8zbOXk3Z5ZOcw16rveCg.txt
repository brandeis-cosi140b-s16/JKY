Best Mexican food I've had in a long time! I'm a native to Las Vegas and have tried many different places from here to Arizona, California, and New Mexico and this place is awesome! I came here with 3 other people and we all had positive things to say about our meals. The green chile and cheese tamale is amazing!! The rice is moist and not hard and crunchy like some places. Our service was great. No complaints from this bunch! Definitely recommend and we will definitely be back.
