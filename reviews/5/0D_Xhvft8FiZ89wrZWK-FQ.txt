My must go to place whenever I'm in Vegas! It's fast, fresh, easy & affordable. Adobada tacos, fries, errthang! It's the meat I only and always get ... I've just recently discovered you can request pineapples on your tacos; tried it & it was delish :p  -don't forget the grilled jalapeno & iced horchataaaaa
