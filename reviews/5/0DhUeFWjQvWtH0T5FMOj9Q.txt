Why the change in stars?  I think the food got better than the last time I was here...maybe it is in my head...dunno.

Either way, I ordered the bulgogi fries again, but this time without the kim chi.  I love kim chi, but these were WAY better without the KC...

Went with a bulgogi burrito...WAY better than the tacos IMO.  I had a few tacos this time, as well as remembering last time, and it is way better in the burrito fashion to me.

I also tried some fish tacos...the regular fish taco was ok, not bad at all, but I prob won't order it again.  However, the calamari taco comes with a different sauce, and it was super good.  Very tender meat, and the sauce pulls it all together.  Bravo!

I'll be back again :)
