What a find!  Very unassuming atmosphere. Obviously a local favorite, and for good reason. Six of us ate WAY too much for under fifty bucks. Jerk chicken is beyond compare, and the machaca is among the best I've tasted. Don't expect to be blown away by the decor, but the food more than makes up for that.
