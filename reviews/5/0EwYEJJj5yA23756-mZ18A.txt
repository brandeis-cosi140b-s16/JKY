The best burritos I've ever had.

My fave is a steak fajita burrito- no rice, with grilled veggies, fresh salsa, lettuce and sour cream. Too awesome.

I know some Mexican food snobs who turn their nose up at this place because it's "not authentic". Well, I've had plenty of great authentic Mexican food all over the country and in Mexico too- but authentic or not, Chipotle's burritos are the best.
