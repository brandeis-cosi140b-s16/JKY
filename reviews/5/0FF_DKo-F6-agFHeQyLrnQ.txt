These are seriously the best tacos in Pittsburgh.  Prepare for mind to be blown.

Although they're not really an order ahead kind of place, their little street stand graciously packs everything up whenever our office descends upon them for lunch, tupperware containers in hand for ladling out salsa.  My personal favorite is the lengua taco with guacamole.

I haven't really shopped in the store much since it's kind of out of the way for me, but I'm told the tortillas are top notch, and judging by the tacos, I'm a believer.

All your tacos are belong to us!
