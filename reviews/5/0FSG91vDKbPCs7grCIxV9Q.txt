I do believe that I ate one of the best Mahi Mahi tacos in Vegas.... And when I said best! Is because we don't have any close place to the ocean, we also try the house made guacamole and it was outstanding, CHEF Paco came out out of the kitchen and stared talking about the GMO products proudly, which I totally agree with this new option as a healthy food, we also got the churros and one flan, all this flavor totally reminded me of my beautiful Mexico !!
