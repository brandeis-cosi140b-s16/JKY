I have been looking for a delicious taco place since I moved back from California in June.I've tried a few places that friends recommended around in the valley, but they were no good.They didn't taste like authentic home made tacos. In California, I used to eat at taco mexico all the time, so to find one out here is super exciting. In my opinion they have the best tacos ever! (Although, I must say I am a picky eater.) Now, They do have a few locations, I went to the one located on 16th street and McDowell. Also,just FYI the workers all pretty much speak Spanish so if your not ok with that, tough $h!t. You will miss out on some good Mexican food!
