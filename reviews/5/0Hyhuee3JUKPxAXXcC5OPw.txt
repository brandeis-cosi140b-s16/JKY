I came here after three coworkers recommended it. Ben was friendly and really concerned with our happiness with the food he served. I got the chicken rolled tacos combo and my wife got the chicken tamale and chicken taco combo. This was the best quick Mexican food I've ever had here in Vegas. Highly recommend. We will be back!
