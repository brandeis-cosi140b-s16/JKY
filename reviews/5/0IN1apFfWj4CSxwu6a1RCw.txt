My boyfriend and I came here on a friday night for the first time and were extremely pleased with our service and food. Arnoldo went above and beyond with his recomendations and overall knowledge of the menu. Arnoldo helped us to decide on every item and we devoured everything! We loved our experience and definitely will be back.
