For delicious, hot, quick Mexican food, you can't be Don Jose's. It's a Phoenix staple. No-frills, just simple food, cheap, and service with a smile. Bring cash only, no credit cards accepted, although there is an ATM  on-site. My favorite dishes are the nachos and bean & cheese tostadas--the pile it with cheese!
