While my friends were in Rocky Point for spring break (yes, this still happens after college), me and my man were having some serious taco stand cravings.  There's this place I have been meaning to try forever, I tell him.  As soon as I said "Hole in the wall mex joint" he was enthusiastically driving in their direction.  As soon as we stepped in and we were the only gringos in there, I knew we were in for a treat.  The senoras who were working were so sweet to us, brought us out the complimentary chips and salsa, and guided us on what tacos were the best.  We each got 3 different ones to try, and my favorite that day was the cabeza (who would have thought!).  After an order of guac, 2 drinks, I was almost embarrassed that the bill was so cheap - like I was getting away with some kind of crime by not paying more.  It was more than reasonable.  

The man was so impressed that he went back the following weekend to surprise me with takeout breakfast in bed.  The senoras recognized him and made him feel so welcome and special.  On weekends, they serve this lamb soup, in fact I saw a few familias feasting on the soup the prior weekend, and she sat him down and gave him a hefty sampling complete with all the fixings on the side, along with chips and salsa while he waited for his takeout order.  He brought me chilaquiles which were awesome, and he had a breakfast burrito which was not as fat as your typical drive by, but I thought that the ingredients tasted fresher.  Either way, this has become a place in the rotation for sure.
