Paz Cantina is by far one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  The food is exquisite & thoughtfully prepared, and the service is amazing. I feel like I have been frequenting Paz for years due to the feeling of home that the staff imparts,  however November will mark their one year anniversary.  Today,  while enjoying the fabulous brunch, it occurred to me that we have never had a bad customer service experience. In fact, the service has consistently been impeccable. The owner, Michael, is often onsite, and his pride & obvious care for the restaurant can be witnessed in a simple short conversation.  I wish the team at Paz much luck as they move into their second year; I know that other fans will agree.  Here's to another great year Michael & team!
