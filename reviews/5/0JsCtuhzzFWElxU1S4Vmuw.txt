Possibly the best Mexican Restaurant. Everything I have ever tried was nothing short of amazing, but I usually got the Taco Salad. Who thought salads could be so filling?
Anyway, the food is authentic and they often have bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar which is also amazing. The prices are also great and the service is great. I always feel welcome when I'm there.
Definately put this place on your list if you're looking for a new Mexican restaurant.
