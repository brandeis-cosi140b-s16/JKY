Man oh man oh man!  This place is good!  Open 24 hours!  The food really tastes like socal San Diego.  I ordered a number 11 (3 rolled tacos with rice and beans) and it was delicious!  I tried the green and red salsa and both were bomb!  Granny ordered a machaca burrito.  She said it was better than the normal place she goes to as they use tiny little strips of meat but Robertos meat was way better.  She saved me a lil piece and it was good.  Sis got carne asada burrito and i didn't hear any complaints so it must've been good! Definitely coming here again when I'm in the area!
