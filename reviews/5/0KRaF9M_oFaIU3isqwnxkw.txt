This place has great specials each day. I was here in a Tuesday so the special was only $5 for 3 carne asada tacos, beans and rice. The tacos were very good and so were the beans. I'm not a huge rice guy but maybe white rice from time to time so I didn't try the rice here. I will next time ask for extra beans. Not their fault it's just my own preference. The server was nice and checked on us often. She brought us some complimentary chips and salsa and the salsa had a slight heat to it and good flavor. My wife had a side of chips and guacamole and liked it a lot along with her carne asada tacos. I can't believe we got all the food we did for what it cost. I just wish they were closer to my side of town however when I am in the area and hungry I will stop by.
