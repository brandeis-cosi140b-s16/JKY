We have been eating here for the past few months about 2 times a week.  We always have the BEST service from Nancy who goes above and beyond to refill our drinks and get our food to us fast since we have to get back to the office. I love the burritos that are HUGE and all the ingredients are FRESH.  My husband loves Fajita Thursday for $9.99...The steak is so tender and flavorful and they pile on the goodies with fresh peppers and onions that I love to pick off his plate :)  YUM!  Did I mention how clean the restaurant is?  It is consistently SPOTLESS and everything is made FRESH!  I tried the Navajo taco last week...WOW!!  AMAZING!!!  If you want a great meal with a clean and enjoyable atmosphere and FANTASTIC SERVICE then come and try Bibiano's...you'll be happy you did!!!
