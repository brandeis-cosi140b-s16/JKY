Fantastic food, loved it, as a self proclaimed taco snob from San Diego, I have tried tacos from Mazatlan, Baja, along our border on both sides. This was a real treat from the beans to the tacos, from the fresh chips to the colorado sauce. A great family restaurant for nearly thirty years. Good job to the family and their crews. Wish they were closer to Anthem up north. Mucho gusto
