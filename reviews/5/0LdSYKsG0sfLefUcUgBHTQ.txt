Took a few years break as El Con had moved but I recently found out they moved back closer to where we live and we are BACK!

Like a best friend you've not seen in a long time only to find out they are just as great as they had been, that's what it's like eating at El Conquistador again. The owners even remembered my favorite item on the menu! Maria's guacamole, chili relleno soup, El Con burrito (currently best value in Arizona) and flan all deserve every bit of my wife's and my gratitude. Come Tuesday we hope to return for the Mole - it's amazing. If you are looking for fastfood....this is not the place for that, but if you have the time to relax......go.
