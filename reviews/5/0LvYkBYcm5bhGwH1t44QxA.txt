Sometimes I find it difficult to eat Mexican food because I am such a picky eater. I do love tacos and nachos, but it has to be made simple. Unfortunately, I don't like beans, tomatoes, onions, jalape√±os, hot sauce, etc. For this reason, Chipotle is GREAT! I can order anything on their menu, just the way I want it! I like their fresh ingredients and watching the employees make my food. So far my favorites are the soft tacos and salad. Very delicious! Usually, I need at least a small amount of dressing on my salads, but I can eat this one without it! 

I have only ordered take out at this location, but the restaurant has always been very clean and organized. The employees are very friendly as well. During my last visit, I ordered the chicken soft tacos. Although it looked like they had enough chicken to fill up my tacos, they kindly asked if I wanted to wait another 2 minutes for a fresh batch and I agreed. 

I'm not sure how much healthier the food is here, but it sure is a better alternative to Taco Bell or Del Taco!
