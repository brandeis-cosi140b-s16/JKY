We just moved in the area and were trying out the local restaurants and gave this place a shot. It is always seems fairly busy and has a good amount of available seating, the situation parking is okay considering its in a higher traffic area. 

Anywho- I had the torta Paquime which was damn awesome (fyi: the sauce topping was very spicy so a side of horchata is definitely recommended!). The boyfriend got soup (I forget which but they all sounded delish) and he really enjoyed it- surprising bc he can be finicky lol. The torta was garnished with homemade style potato chips- at first you'd might assume that they're being skimpy with them but the sandwiches are usually more than plenty by themselves. 
They had a salsa bar too which was much appreciated- gotta have my side of grilled jalape√±o!
The pan dulce here looks off the charts tasty but I've yet to try them out :-) Can't wait to sample their breakfast!
