We get to Vegas about once every 3 years or so. We always go out to W&J for dinner. Went there on Monday night to watch the 49ers win. Sat at the bar, had all you can eat tacos, beer and margaritas. Reuben, he bartender was attentive and very friendly. Kept our drinks full while taking care of everyone else. Our tacos were very good, one of us had ground beef and one had chicken. The meat in the tacos was plentiful and flavorful. My margaritas were good and the beer was nice and cold. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. Was able to watch the laser and water show from the bar. Had a wonderful night and will go again next time we in Vegas.
