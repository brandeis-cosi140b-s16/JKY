So I've just returned from lunch and realized I've never reviewed Braddah's. The more I eat here, the more I love it. I've had their bowls and burritos, and of course, the coconut bark. I love the Kalua Pig and normally get that, but I've also tried their steak and chicken. I seriously just love getting the bowl because they can fit much more in the bowl than they can in that tortilla! 

Customer service is always on point and everyone appears to truly enjoy working here. 

Please note, that it's "just like Chipotle" in the sense that you go through the line picking what you want on or in your entr√©e item, but it's in no way "just like Chipotle" in the flavor sense. There are countless variations of their menu and it's all yours for the taking. I'm so excited to keep on coming back here and am even more excited that there will be one coming soon to Henderson (right??!!).
