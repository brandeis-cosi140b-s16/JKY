The drive through line was very busy since there were likr 5 cars in front of me. But I only waited like 1 minute and the employee was SUPER friendly. I could tell when I got to the window why it had been so fast, the emplpyee was totally compitent and fast, all while being super polite and very friendly. The kind of employee that makes you feel valued as a customer. My order was correct, the food tatsed good. 5 Star Experience all around.
