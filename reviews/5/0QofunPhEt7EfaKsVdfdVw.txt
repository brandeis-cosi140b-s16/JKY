I am a huge fan of OTBs!  The food and atmosphere is top notch as far as chain restaurants go.  Like many mexican restaurants, the chips and salsa are free.  Free is always nice but their salsa recipe is what sets it above the rest.  Every time I go here, I order an appetizer.  I have yet to order the actual entree courses.  Haha.  From 4-6pm the apps are half off.  Can you really blame me?? Get the Nachos.  They make them just the way I like it.  Each large individual nacho is made with precision and loaded with cheese and steak/chicken/bean.  Do it!  Enjoy!  Oh yeah, a live mariachi band started playing on our way out.. Cool!

Beers on tap:  Dos Equis (Amber and Lager), BL-lime, Blue Moon, Coors. 

Ps.  I had to stop here so I wouldn't miss the opening pitch of the Phillies game.  Just so happen that Roy Halladay went on to pitch a NO HITTER in his postseason debut.  Great sign!! Thanks OTB!
