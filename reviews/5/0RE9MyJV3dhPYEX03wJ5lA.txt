I consider myself an expert on Mexican food and all I can say is Carolinas is the BOMB!!! If not the best, one of the best Mexican joints in PHX. The bean and cheese burrito was awesome and the machaca tacos were off the hook. It's the first time I've had machaca and it is fantastic. Carolinas is a must visit Valley establishment.
