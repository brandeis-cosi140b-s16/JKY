We drove a bit out of our way to get this restaurant based on the reviews and it was totally worth it! The staff were amazingly friendly, the margaritas were deliciously fresh and and the food was probably some of the best Mexican I've had recently. The location is a little sketchy, but look past the first impression of the vacated strip mall to experience everything that is good about th√Æs place. We'll head there again before we leave Arizona, for sure.
