Hands down best Chili Verde I have ever had!!  This place is a hole in the wall, somewhat seedy area, but it has been there forever and for good reason.  

Home made salsa, quick service, delicious home made mexican food, serioulsy comparable to food in Mexico.  I have not tried the menudo but I hear it is also amazing, again my go to is a bowl of chili verde for $8 you really can't beat it!! 

Despite the negative reviews the service there has always been quick and attentive, give this place a try it's delicious!!
