You can't go wrong with the chile relleno, chicken, or breakfast burritos. I can't believe there isn't a review of this place up yet. The horchata isn't as good as La Tolteca's, but you can't walk to La Tolteca from Palo Verde at 2 in the morning, and it wouldn't even be open anyhow. My 5 stars take into consideration the price (extremely cheap), service (always solid, not exceptional, but generally friendly at a minimum), and cleanliness (may look grubby, but I've never gotten sick). 

I don't think the jukebox works.

The chips with guacamole are decent (they come with a mountain of shredded cheddar) but only if you add some red salsa.

LITTLE KNOWN SECRET ALERT: free chips at lunchtime (could be weekdays only). Do it.
