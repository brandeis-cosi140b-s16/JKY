Yes.

Gracias a dios que hay una restaurante semiautentico en Champaign!

I wasn't disappointed by my delicious Milanesa torta, and the staff was friendly and helpful, they didn't mind our loudness, and they had real Mexican coke.

Only offering Manzana Lift would make things better.  Plenty of spice staples are available, and you can even get a nice selection of nopales (cactus), if you're so inclined.

Great place, one I'll be visiting quite often.
