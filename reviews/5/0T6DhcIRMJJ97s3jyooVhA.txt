I come to this location often because it is right next to my work. Julie and staff are very friendly. Most of them know what I'm going to order because I get the same thing every time. I love how they have potatoes/sweet potatoes as an option. One thing it's big chain competitor doesn't have. The flamingo location is the best Zaba's in town. I've ate at a few other locations and the service has always been good the food sometimes isn't the same. I also like my bowl made a certain way and it seems this location is the only one who makes it exactly how I like it. Chicken salad, no rice/bean, extra sweet potatoes, hot sauce, cheese, fajita veggies, and guacamole is the magic combination. You can make it a combo with a drink and the lime salt chips for $2.99 more.
