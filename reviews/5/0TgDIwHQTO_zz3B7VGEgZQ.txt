First time in Phoenix, the Hyatt Regency recommended us to go here for some great Mexican food and that we had - along with some great 2-limit margaritas! Our server Frederica was so great! We told her about how we were going to drive all over the state and site see in the days to come, we pulled out a map and she gave us the best routes to drive, best scenic views, she said if we needed more information she'd call her dad and we could ask him questions. I'm glad we had her as a server and we're so glad we listened to her advice!
