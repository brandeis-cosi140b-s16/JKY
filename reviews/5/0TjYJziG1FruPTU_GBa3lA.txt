We finally had a chance to try some tacos today, after passing the cart several times over the past year. There is always a line with others standing around eating tortillas topped with chicken, pork, steak, pico, fresh cilantro and lime, and at least 6 different salsas ranging in spiciness. And these tacos are down right delicious!  Very authentic and totally worth the wait. Highly recommend!
