If you're looking for more authentic taste like home Mexican food, this is your place! When you seated they bring out bottomless chips with salsa and bean dip, they also bring out Fideo all complimentary. The food proportions are huge and the food is amazing. You definitely won't leave this place hungry. Not to mention the excellent staff & customer service. Been coming here for years.
