EXCELLENT service from our waiter, Adam. Fajita chicken salad was THE BEST I've ever had!   Hubby had the recommendation from Adam, which was basically a burrito with a white sauce over it....he really enjoyed it.  Inside of the restaurant was very nice and the outside covered patio was beautiful with the pond. Highly recommended this restaurant.
