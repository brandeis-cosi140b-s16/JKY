I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place!!  I've been here so many times, you know I love my mariscos.  Playa Hermosa has never disappointed me.  There quality is very consistent and I would be soooo sad if they ever stop their business.  Let me give them 10 stars out of 5.  They are that good!

Please don't be discouraged because of the area it's in.  I know some people would never come to this part of town...they are missing out!  

I love walking into the restaurant to their colorful decors.  Once you are seated, you will get a generous portion of freshly made warm tortilla chips with a red and a green salsa, no questions asked.  They don't care if you're going to order later on...here, have some chips and salsa!  They have a full bar and a TV with sports playing all the time.  Now you can have some drinks with free chips and salsa while watching a game.  Once you order, they will bring you a tostada with ceviche.  It's on the house.  Their ceviche is fresh and flavorful without being overpowered by excessive lime.

As for entrees, I would recommend....
- shrimp culichi
- fish tacos
- grilled shrimp
- fried fish in garlic sauce
- molcajete
- any types of ceviche

Most dishes come with a side of beans, rice, salad, and flour/corn tortillas.  Be prepared to walk out with a full belly plus some to take home.
