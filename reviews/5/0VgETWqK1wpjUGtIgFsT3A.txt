Food was great! PJ and Barbara were fun, witty, and fantastic!  We (3 gals from Minnesota and Wisconsin) were in town for a fun girls week. We went to happy hour from 3-6 for the 3$ margaritas. They were great and the appetizers were delicious!  I would definitely come back again! A cute atmosphere as well. Inexpensive and worth the drive into Apache Junction. Right across from Walmart
