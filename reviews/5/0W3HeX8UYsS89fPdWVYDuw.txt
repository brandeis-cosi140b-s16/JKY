Wow! We were introduced to Jorges the first morning we arrived in Tempe by a friend who lived there. It was so awesome that we came in a second time the next morning! I had the Spanish Fly scramble the first time and then jumped into a chorizo and egg with a waffle the second time. My buddy slammed down the chicken with egg the first time and devoured a waffle and egg breakfast the second time. Each time we were greeted by Dave, the owner, and I always enjoy good service and hospitable servers, but it adds that extra bit of special when the owner greets you personally! The scenery of the restaurant looks inviting, with the future music scene adding to the excitement! The main focus of my reviews is how the service is delivered and when the restaurant has service that is beyond the beyond, you're bound to find a restaurant that you'll become a local at. Jorges would be my local spot if I was a resident in Tempe, but since my residence is 800 miles, I can only hope to get a taste of awesomeness every once in a blue moon.
