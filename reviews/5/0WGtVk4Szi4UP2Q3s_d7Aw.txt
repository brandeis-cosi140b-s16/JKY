I have been here several times in the past few months, both with my kids and without.  On Monday nights kids eat free (with purchase of adult meal), which is handy for families but if you want a kid-free night Monday may not be the night to go.  The service was consistently outstanding, even during a very busy lunch time.  The servers explained the salsa bar (loved the flavors) and brought drinks out right away.  On our last visit, my youngest daughter asked for "just grapes" as her side dish before I could stop her - fruit or fries are offered on the kids' menu.  Sure enough, a little dish with only grapes came out on her plate.
