As a fellow Mexican I hold Mexican food to a very high standard. 
This restaurant is both very traditional and as well  Americanized not a fan of there salsa that they give you with a chips. Feels like you're eating Tostitos salsa  just tomatoes but if you ask for something with more a little more and flavor they're very happy to do so and it is very good salsa. 

We gone there a few times and try to try something new. But some items like I mentioned before are not so traditional. 
Wait staff very very nice always try to see how they can make the experience better. 
Margaritas are good I build my own with not a problem. Great size in portions both in food and cocktails. 

Ordered  carne asada  very flavorful beans very delicious not like any restaurant. Very traditional ordered nachos not a fan kind of kind of greasy cheese not really melted.
