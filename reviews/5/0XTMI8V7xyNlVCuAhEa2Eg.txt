So I'm not too big in Mexican food especially not so early in the morning. but my boyfriend LOVES Mexican food. So when we saw this place that had both pancakes and Mexican food we jumped on it.

Let's start talking about the food first. I got the pancakes. He got the breakfast burrito, chicken soup. Irma came out with chips and salsa and they were HELLA good. You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes and the chips were perfectly crisp with a sprinkle of salt on top. My bf didn't take too long to finish it and Irma got him seconds. The chicken soup was also amazing, the chicken was tender and the broth was also very flavorful. I thought the burrito was amazing too but my bf thought it was a little too salty (I just think he was too full to enjoy it fully). I don't think I've ever wanted to praise a tortilla before. It was cheesy and every bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I think my American breakfast was ok, not too memorable. I would definitely go for the Mexican stuff next time we're here. Although I don't know when that'll be since we're not from here :(

The place is small and clean and you'll be greeted with a smile by Irma. There's a tv in the background that's not too loud. There was people coming in and Irma greeted everyone like family. Eating here just made me feel all fuzzy and warm. Probably how you feel when gma is making amazing food just for you. 

The price is ridiculously cheap. The total for us was about $16. We got three dishes and a coffee. Even with a generous tip that's less than $25. They also take card (they even take Amex). 

Give this place a try if you like Mexican food or even if you don't like Mexican food. You'll leave the place stuffed feeling all warm and fuzzy.
