I'm a strip local and this is one of my favorite Mexican joints. I'm here at least a couple times per week.

The food here is less expensive but of equal quality to other Mexican restaurants on the strip (e.g. Javier's @ Aria, Diegos @ MGM).

The counter servers are fantastic. Dave and Torrey in particular provide consistently excellent service.

Only downside is that unlike most Mexican joints, they charge for chips and salsa.

Highly recommended!
