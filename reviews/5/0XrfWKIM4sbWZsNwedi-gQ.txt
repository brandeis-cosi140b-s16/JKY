The food is very good and reasonably priced. It was a little difficult to find but worth the trouble.  It was very clean and airconditioned, which is important to me. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  It also didn't hurt that the guy at the register, Paul, was really cute.  

Overall, I say this place is a must try.
