Best. Mexican. In. Phoenix.

Having grown up in LA, I've had a lot of Mexican food. I was impressed with Phoenix's abundant Mexican offerings, but none stood out as spectacular (excepting Barrio Cafe, which I don't consider a traditional "Mexican Restaurant"). I was advised by nearly everyone I asked to go check out Dos Molinos, so I did, and it was good... fiery good.

And I don't mean that metaphorically - Dos Molinos is the kind of place that doesn't ask you "how spicy?" They just bring you your dish, and it's unabashedly spicy, the way it was meant to be, and I can't imagine they could consider doing it any other way.

All of us were spicy veterans - having all ordered the *level 10 spice level* at [insert any ethnic restaurant name here], and we were all sweating. Bullets. 

I had the Red Chili Enchilada combo plate, and the enchilada's were fantastic. It was the THICK handmade corn tortillas, combined with the shamelessly spicy red chili sauce on top. All the sides were terrific (the beans had a kick of their own).

Their margarita was also pretty ridiculously large, and tasty. 

Dos Molinos is my go-to Mexican joint in Phoenix now.
