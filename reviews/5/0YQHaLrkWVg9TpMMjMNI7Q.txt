Great find a hidden gem! Packed for dinner, service was good, drinks well mixed and the peach sangria is the very best I have ever drank!! All 4 dinners where good, even our picky eater that did  a custom dinner not listed on menu ( server did not blink & dinner was delicious). Appetizer of calamari was really the best I have ever eaten. Desert was made from scratch @ the blue Adobe & again delicious.
I can not find one fault. I would highly recommend!
