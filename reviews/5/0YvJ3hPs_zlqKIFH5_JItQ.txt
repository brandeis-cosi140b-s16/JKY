We go to a lot of fast food places, but this one is awesome! The customer service is always spot on. They smile at you, talk with you, joke with you, and overall have a positive attitude. We've been there MANY times and not once have they even slightly messed up our order at all. 

Compared to other Taco Bells in the area, this one has the best service and best tasting food!
