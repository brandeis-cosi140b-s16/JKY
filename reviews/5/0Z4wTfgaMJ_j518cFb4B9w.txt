My hubby and I were first timers to this place and it won't be the last time. The complementary chips and salsa and been dip is very yummy. We irdered chicken fajitas and they quick to the table and very good. Our waters were never empty the service was great. We had a server named John and he was so dedicated  about his work and you could tell. Super friendly and attentitive!
