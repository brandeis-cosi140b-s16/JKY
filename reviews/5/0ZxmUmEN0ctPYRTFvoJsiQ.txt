I've gotta say, I'm really happy about this place.  I'm a Mexican guy from SoCal, who's also spent a bunch of time in San Diego, so I've seen my share of taquerias.  This place, though not world class, does several things right.

First of all, the service here is good. It's easy to get neglected/ignored in some taquerias - it just part of the deal.  Second, and this is big for me, the refried beans are very good. Most places don't get them right, but these are excellent. I had the carnitas (fried pork roast)  plate. The carnitas were moist and tender and not fatty at all. My wife had tacos which were meaty and tasty (and cheap).  The asada was solid. The real winner was our teenage son, who had the suizo burrito.  It's a gigantic burrito stuffed with meat, beans and rice (but mostly meat) smothered in cheese sauce and sour cream.  Kind of like a mammoth Mexican cheesesteak. It even had more cheese inside of it.  He was giddy. He went into a crazed feeding frenzy and said it was one the best things ever.  They also had horchata, a creamy rice drink, which is delicious and not all places have it.

I rate restaurants by whether I'd go there if they were in L.A.  I wouldn't drive very far to get to El Jalape√±o in L.A., but now I live in Madison. I may go again tomorrow.
