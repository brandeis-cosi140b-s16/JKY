Literally couldn't have said it any better Henry. However I think you're rating doesn't exactly portray the level of deliciousness in one meal I mean DAMN. This Taco Bell is the only one I'll ever go to. Top notch customer service. TOP. NOTCH. So the pals wouldn't let us jeep with them. THATS LIFE. I'm rather upset that they wouldn't let us play catch with them. So I actually blame the Taco Bell employees for not coming outside and telling them to involve everyone in their foolery. But they were too busy denying us access into the building. So what it was 12:30am? What are they trying to be, safe or something?! Overrated. 
After it is all said and done...I think I'll
Make this my go-to TBell. 
P.S...
Henry...please do your very best to escape from azkaban tonight.
