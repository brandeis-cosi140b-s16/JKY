Roberto's NEVER disappoints. Always good, always fast, always open. The staff is very pleasant. I love the spicy carrots. 

Not gonna hear a peep out ta me. I am very curious about the mural painted on the counter...one day I will ask....one day.
Today, I wonder if the man in the doorway holding the rather large knife is just um...going outside to chop down some cactus......not decapitate the woman walking by to meet another fella .....foods ready!
