The most amazing carne asada tacos...

Seriously, there's a sign on the door to this place warning you of its addictiveness and it's TRUE!! For the longest time, the only thing I had was carne asada tacos because they were just that good. Since, I've also fallen in love with the HUGE portion of nachos (chicken or carne asada), rolled tacos, and jamaica. They're open 24 hours a day 7 days a week so sometimes it's the only thing my late night shift boyfriend and I can get to eat. Totally fine by me though. Prices are reasonable. I usually eat for less than $10. Decor is nothing fancy, just some booths, tables, and Univision. Oh, and the green sauce. Gotta try that. I hated green sauce then I had Amigos green sauce and my world hasn't been the same since. There's also a location on Rainbow north of the 215, but I haven't been so I can't put my stamp of approval on it.
