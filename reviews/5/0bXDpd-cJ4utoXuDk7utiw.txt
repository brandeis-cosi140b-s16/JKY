I got a Groupon for this place and we decided to try it last night. YUM! 

We had the Shrimp Cocktail, Seafood Empanadas and the Fish Tacos. The food was excellent. Flavorful and Fresh (Although I didn't eat my rice and beans, so I can't say if they are good or not. My experience with rice and beans is my friends Mexican mother makes the only really good authentic ones.) 

The service we had was great, the Margaritas were excellent and decently priced. Overall I really good experience. I would definitely come back.
