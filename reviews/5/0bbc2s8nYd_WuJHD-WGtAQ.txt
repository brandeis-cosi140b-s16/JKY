I've had a lot of airport food, most of it sucks and lower your expectations. This place is excellent. Arizona burrito with fries was delicious, soft pork with just enough sauce to make your mouth water. Be warned the catsup is spicy, a nice kick of hot sweet and salty fries to balance the all meat burrito. 

Will come back again
