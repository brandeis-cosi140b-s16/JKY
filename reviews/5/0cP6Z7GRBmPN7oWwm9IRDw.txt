Give me a chimmy!! I have been a fan of Mi Amigo Ricardo's since they opened. I have had Mexican food from all over the world. Germany (yes they have it), Nebraska (arrg! it was awful), DC (not much better than Nebraska) Texas (yeah, that's not Mexican) All over Mexico: Jalisco, Veracruz, Chihuahua, Sonora, Baja, Oaxaca, Guanajuato. Also all over Arizona, California, New Mexico and other places like Costa Rica and Brazil. (Brazil and New Mexico were somewhat lacking interpretations.) With that said, the other reviews that complain about the hot sauce and chips. Well let me just say if they can't tell the difference between hot sauce and salsa, well there you have your answer.  Most people from other areas have a very commercial taste as to what they think Mexican food is. Arizona has Sonoran style. Our green chilies are fire roasted and have a deep rich flavor to them. Unlike Hatch that are just trying to burn your tongue out of your head and give you little flavor. If I wanted that I would just eat a raw Jalapeno. Mi Amigo's is NOT Taco Bell, or Chipotle. If you want an onion and corn sandwich go to the Czech Republic. Mi Amigo's offers a lot of southwestern style food. You can find a little TexMex and some Baja on the menu as well as typical American fare. I'm not sure how they could improve, maybe get Coke Zero, build another dining room or location, offer salsa as well as hot sauce with the chips.   We here in Casa Grande call Mi Amigo Ricardo simply Mi Amigo's, because they are just that.
