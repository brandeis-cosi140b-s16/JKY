El Panzon is soliddddddd. I had a lengua taco, a pastor taco, and an asada burrito for about $9 bucks and I was crazzyyy full.

The meats are all rich and well seasoned while the portions of rice, beans, sour cream, and cheese were so good they just made me miss California. Of the mexican joints I tried in vegas, so far Panzon is my favorite
