I eat here at least once a week. Yes, im one of THOSE people...the service here has always been really great and they never argue when I ask for extra of any ingredient (im a triple serving of sour cream kind of girl...). I never have had to wait in line for more than five minutes either. Super speedy, never crowded, and the staff all seems to work well as a team.
