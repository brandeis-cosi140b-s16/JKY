My boss is from New Mexico and is super picky about green chile and has been raving about this place.  I finally went a bit ago and this is definitely one of my new favorite places!  I've been now a total of 3 times in the last month and I think it gets better each time I go.  

First off, the dips that come with the chips are so yummy!  The green chile stuff and the spicy white sauce are my fav.  I am really picky about chicken from restaurants since most chicken ends up being super slimy or fake tasting.  Their chicken is incredible, literally melts in your mouth.  

After your meal everyone gets a sopapilla (sp?) for dessert and those are the icing on the cake.  Just the perfect little treat after a great meal.

I'm so shocked by the bad reviews on here, either those people are crazy or there was something out of the ordinary happening that night.
