This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.

I always get the 2 chicken tacos (shredded chicken) and with all rice (orange color) and no beans. I've never actually tried anything else on the menu. After the 2 chicken tacos I had.. I've been hooked ever since. 

The staff is very attentive and quick. 

They give you free chips and salsa. The salsa does not come with pico.
