I heard about this place from a TV episode on tacos on the Food Network.  It's also highly rated on Trip Advisor. This place is amazing!  Definitely worth a visit.  I'll be stopping here on all future Vegas trips. I had a question about the mole dish I ordered, which was excellent, and Chef Paco himself came out!
