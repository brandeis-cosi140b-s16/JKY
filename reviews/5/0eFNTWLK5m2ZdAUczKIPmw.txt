Drove by a couple days and was very intrigued. We came here for dinner tonight to try out this new locally owned Hawaiian-Mex fusion restaurant that has very similar layout to chipotle . As you walk in you are greeted aloha and asked if you have ever eaten at this restaurant. We said no they give us a couple samples of the 3 meats to choose from Kailua pork, steak, and chicken if you don't eat meat there are veg and fish options. But all three meats were amazing!! The pork and steak were my favorite. You can choose burrito, bowl, salad, or 3 tacos. I got a bowl since I love rice and I don't care for tortillas. I got the seaweed rice, half Kailua pork and steak, roasted corn salsa, pineapple verde salsa, cabbage, bean sprouts, sour cream, jalape√±os, couple squeezes of lime and cheese. And drizzled pineapple hot sauce it's was delicious and I really didn't need the cheese for next time. The customer service was amazing everyone was so nice and friendly. We will definitely be back.
