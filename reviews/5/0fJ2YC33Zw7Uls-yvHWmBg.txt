First of all, holy crap, they are up front and personal with everyone in the best way. They put customer service first and I really respect the energy here. Everything feels so personal, 10/10 would 10 again.

Not to mention the food is pretty well done too. There's a lot of care put into this place. It feels like this is one of those starting out family restaurants.

I highly recommend it. I hope this place gets big.
