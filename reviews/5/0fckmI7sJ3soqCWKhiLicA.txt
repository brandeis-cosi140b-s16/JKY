I eat lunch here once a week and occasionally twice. Prices can't be beat - particularly the lunch specials - and the quality is always excellent. Great service and excellent value for the money. Azteca's food is always delicious - I don't think I've ever had a bad meal in the 5+ years I've been frequenting the place.
