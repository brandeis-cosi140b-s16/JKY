This place is FANTASTIC!  We hardly go out for Mexican food anymore, since we started buying carnita meat here!  Just go to the meat counter, and tell them you would like some Carnitas. We usually get a pound or 1 1/2 if we want leftovers. The meat is fantastic, juicy and doesn't have skin or bones, which I have run into in the past at other places. 
We also get queso fresco, a pound of freshly made/still warm torillas, and at the register ask for pico di gallo, an avocado (they are always ripe), and a bag of chopped onion and cilantro. They also have sauces here, but I haven't tried them yet. 
The prices are fantastic, come home and make some tacos!
The place is very clean, no weird smell, the staff is very sweet and helpful. It doesn't get any better than this!
