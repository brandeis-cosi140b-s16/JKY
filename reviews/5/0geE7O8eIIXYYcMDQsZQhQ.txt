I love their breakfast burritos and the shredded beef tacos.  Always delicious and fresh tasting.  The prices are very reasonable.  I live out of state and I always stop in here when I am visiting.  I do recommend calling in your order because they are very popular and you may have a long wait to get your food...it's worth the wait though!   
Warning on the shredded beef tacos:  
They are a bit greasy.  That can be a plus or minus depending on your personal taste.  I think they are PERFECT!  If you are one of the low-fat, heath food only crowd, you probably should not be eating here anyway.
