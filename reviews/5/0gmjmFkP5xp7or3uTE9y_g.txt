Went there the other week on a Sunday and learned it was under new ownership.  My husband and I both loved the new menu and creative drinks.  The tacos were amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  The green chili mac and cheese appetizer was to die for - I could have licked the dish.  We both had margaritas and my husband especially enjoyed his as he doesn't like them on the sweet side and these were perfect.  Trust me, if you want some unique and delicious Mexican food, this is the place to go.
