Hands down the best Mexican food on the west side of Vegas.  Loved the cucumber agua fresca!!!  Chicken Tacos tasted hot off the grill and were packed with flavor. Red salsa on the table was my favorite. 

My kids loved the cheese quesadillas and nachos. Plate was big enough for all to share.

Good vibe, tasty food and a great place for families. I'll be back.
