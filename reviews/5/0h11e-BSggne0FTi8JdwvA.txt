My wife and I loved this restaurant. The food was delicious. And the Cuban atmosphere was completely authentic. Servers were wonderful and kind. Plus, most of our servers and employees that we encountered were actually Cuban which I really appreciated. Speed of service was also timed ideally.

I lived in Miami for two years and I've missed this sort of a restaurant since then (5 years ago). The Ropa Vieja tasted like it was made by a Cuban abuelita.

We plan to go there next week to check out the live music and I will update this review then.
