I hear Mr. Hseih is building one downtown and I've been wanting to try it for some time.  I've stayed away until now because the restaurant was put into the building that once was El Jefe's which was my favorite and I am still mourning the loss of both the El Jefe's and the owner.  However, I digress . . . 

I will say the 5 stars is directly related to the service from Chelsea who was amazingly knowledgeable about the menu.  She was a rockstar, which is not necessarily a rating given regularly from my partner, who was formerly a Director of Operations for a restaurant conglomerate.  He is a tough critic.

Things Chelsea did to make us love her . . .
- talked directly to my 4 year old (which he LOVED) and recommended he try the Cactus Juice -- he couldn't wait to tell her "that was my favorite drink ever"
- recommendations overall were great - I loved the Lychee Marg she recommended when I decided the skinny girl margs were not cutting it 
- She was obviously working "kids corner" for that evening - and she was still maintaining a good attitude
(parents you are all familiar with this, everyone dining with kids gets sat in the same corner - which generally equates to the same section, which then customarily means the server handling kids corner gets ran ragged, has to clean up 10x the mess of a regular table and has to deal with screaming, crying, running, complaining, etc. and sometimes gets screwed on tips because many parents are so used to having toddlers they don't realize what a pain it is to serve them and clean up after them when you didn't give birth to them)

Now to the food -- for me Spicy Shrimp Nachos entree - magnificent - i loved the flavors together - the salsa seemed smokey which went well with the cilantro, white cheese and shrimpies  Delicious with a couple margs.  For my man - Burger and Beer for $10, a Blue Moon and a Cheeseburger with a huge burger patty, he seemed pleased.  For the little guy - a cheese quesadilla - perfectly plain just how he likes it.

We'll go back - looking forward to the downtown venue right outside my office window :)
