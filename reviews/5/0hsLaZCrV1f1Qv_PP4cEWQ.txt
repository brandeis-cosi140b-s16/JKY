I eat at El Molino an average of once a week for lunch, if that tells you anything.  I like it!  The food is consistently good, the prices are fair, and people who run the place are very nice (Gloria, Lupe, and Richard).  They very thoughtfully have a selection of daily news papers (Wall Street Journal, AZ Republic, etc...) for you to read while waiting for food or while eating.  And, they have free refills on soft drinks.

Warning, if you are super sensitive to spicy food, be very careful when ordering.  Their food can get hot (try the chips and salsa).  And, boy is it good.  I usually split a delicious chicken chimichanga with my wife.  We try to avoid fried food, but their chimis rock!  We occasionally get enchiladas, which are also very tasty.  Probably the only thing I've tried and won't order again (although one of friends does) is their hard shell taco.  It's too oily or greesey for my taste.  But hey, you might like it.

Overall, I highly recommend El Molino.  Enjoy!
