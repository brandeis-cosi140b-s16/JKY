So ran across one of the owners Joseph passing out flyers for this place right before opening and was intrigued by the menus simplicity and price point. This morning (1 pm) after a long night at some local dance and drink spots we made a point to go check this place out. Pleasantly pleased. Home cooked food with a comfortable new and hip feel to it. Break the chain habit and go eat here. I got the chicken and tried the pork and its as good as I make. YUMMM
