I too was at the work training with Ayesha (see very first review) and like her I wanted something different than the usual fast food places nearby.  

I'm an incredibly picky person when it comes to authentic Mexican food.  Growing up in San Diego, I grew up with some of the best tasting food around.  When I moved here I was unimpressed over and over again with the places I kept trying around the west valley and even the east valley.  At one point, I even swore off trying any new Mexican style restaurant altogether.  No more gross, greasy, no flavor Mexican food for me!  The Sonoran style food here just doesn't jive with me and my taste for flavorful Baja style food.  Yep, that's right...there's a difference.  Baja style is tastier with a lot more flavor per bite.  I have found that Sonoran is more bland and greasier.

I was pretty skeptical when we walked into Jalapenos (Tio Freddy's).  But then I picked up their menu and saw they had Carne Asada Fries...a San Diego favorite!  Forget everything else on the menu, that is what I ordered.  It was delicious!  Not only was the food flavorful but Tio Freddy and his wife were amazing.  Even though it is a place where you order at the counter, they brought me my food, offered me sauce from the sauce bar, and came by more than once to check on how I was enjoying my food!  

It is a small place in a strip mall and I have never noticed it before, and I know others haven't.  If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!
