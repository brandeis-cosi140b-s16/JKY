Leaps and bounds over its predecessor, The Salted Lime is a welcome addition to the new Aliente.  My wife and I decided to dine here with some reluctance since we did not care for the former restaurant "Cabo" very much at all. But we are glad we took the chance. The new menu is pretty cheap and relatively simple with your normal American-Mexican fare such as burritos, tacos, chimichangas, flautas, etc... When we sat down they have us a basket of chips and three salsas. A salsa verde, a picante, and refried beans (ok not really a salsa). All were quite good. For dinner  I had the beef chimichanga and let me tell you, it may be the best chimi I've ever had. They didn't use typical beef but birria which if you don't know, is beef that slow cooks in a broth with peppers, onions, cilantro, etc for 4 hours or so which makes the beef very savory and tender.  The chimichanga was fried perfectly. Usually it's a big greasy mess but here it was very lightly friend and added a nice crispness to it. My chimi was accompanied with beans and rice which were fine, about as good as beans and rice can be I suppose.  

To drink I had a big ol 36oz beer. My wife however, first ordered a margarita which was pretty tasty. It seems like here in Vegas they tend to go a little heavy on the triple sec but not this one was nicely done. Her next drink was a Coconut Lime Margarita that was innovated in house by one of their bartenders. I was skeptical as I don't care for sweet drinks but this was good! Not sweet at all! 

So overall we had an excellent experience here and we'll be sure to come back often. I give it 5 stars cause it was excellent service, great prices, and surprisingly good food. Tip- Sit in the bar area and you can order off the restaurant menu as well as the bar menu which includes super cheap little apps.
