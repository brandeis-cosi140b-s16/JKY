Holy guacamole this place is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  Talk about authentic Mexican food.  Perfect flavor, awesome service, restaurant was clean.  They had a great variety of items.  Everything is fresh and made to order.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  I tell EVERYONE about it.  Best in the valley by far.
