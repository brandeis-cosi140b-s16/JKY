my fiance and i found this place by absolute accident. we were visiting scottsdale and wanted authentic mexican food. by god, we got it! we both had enchiladas (i had cheese, he had chicken) doused in a VERY spicy (we were both sweating, but in a good way) and delicious green sauce. both came with rice and the smoothest, most delightful refried beans ever. the salsa was amazing, and the tortilla chips are super-thick and crunchy and fried on site. they also gave us both complimentary bowls of a wonderful vegetable beef soup as an appetizer. all of this, plus 2 beers, for a total of $23! the service was also great. the decor is kinda schmaltzy, but i think it added to the charm of the whole affair. it's not a high-end fusion-mexican restaurant like those found in NYC, no, but that's not what we wanted. i'm only sorry i ran out of room and couldn't clean my plate!
