Oh my gosh... Why is it that I've lived in Vegas for almost two years and have never tried Rubio's?  This morning we wanted to try something new but stay fairly close to home.  We searched on yelp for nearby restaurants and decided upon Rubio's.

We both ordered the gourmet steak taco plate.  Yeah yeah, I know they're famous for fish tacos.  I'm not a fish fan.  So sue me.  My tacos were a-mazing.  Soft tortillas, tender steak, GREAT salsa.  The staff were friendly and the place was spotless.  My favorite were the pinto beans... I loved the cotija cheese on top... Gave the beans a little extra zip.  

We used to frequent Chipotle and Baja Fresh, but I don't see us going back there as often now that we found Rubio's.  Maybe, just maybe, I will try a fish taco someday...

*EDIT:  Now I've officially tried the cajun fish taco.  I'm in love!
