My significant other and I initially went to Central Bristo but decided to just order a couple drunks and go eat at Mex 32. Best decision EVER!! Not only do they the best chips and salsa (they were thick chips and came out hot) with three salsas but they also have this really good sweet cream corn rice (addicting). Our server, Chico, really was the cherry on top to make it a perfect restaurant experience. It was refreshing to have a server as passionate about the restaurant and their commitment to quality. If you go in ask for Chico... You will be impressed!
