Great Mexican food can be hard to find, we found it here last Sunday on a trip to Wickenburg Ranch!  The service was wonderful and very fast!  The waitress was perfect, very attentive and helpful.  Our late lunch was huge...I ordered a chicken burrito and my husband had a shredded  beef Chimichanga.  I would definitely recommend Anita's!  I know we will be back the next time we're in the area!
