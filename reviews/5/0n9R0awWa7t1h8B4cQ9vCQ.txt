This is a hole-in-the-wall.  It's a Taco Wagon taken out of the wagon and put into a restaurant that looks like it came straight off the side of a highway in Mexico.  I love it.  The food is authentic, there's always a soccer game on the TV, and I'm usually the only person speaking English in the restaurant.  I always get the enchiladas, because, well, I really like enchiladas.  I can't vouch for anything else on the menu (I'm sure it's good), but the enchiladas are the bomb.

Do yourself a favor and eat at Taco Mich instead of at the popular chain across the street.  Your intestines will thank you.
