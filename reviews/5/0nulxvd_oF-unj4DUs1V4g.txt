Amazing little spot, hidden in the small town of Tolleson. The guacamole is awesome! Perfect amount of spice and obviously made from scratch unlike some places. It reminds me of my own home made guac, so I must be doing something right!

Cheap and delicious food all around, it is my new favorite local mexican joint to grab lunch at.
