We eat here often and love the food, especially the bean dip. This past summer, we attended a STAYcation at San Marcos and the dining was a tequila dinner at Serrano's. Janet Thebarge, sales manager, promoted the experience at the Chandler Chamber and WOW what a fun night. The food was extraordinary, the company lively and the tequila--delish! Thanks for a great experience...do it again soon!
