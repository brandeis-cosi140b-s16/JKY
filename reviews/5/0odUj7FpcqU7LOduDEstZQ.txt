This is my idea of fast food. Clean, quick and not greasy and friendly quick service. The food is as good as it was years ago when I was in college. This is a different location and the menu has expanded but their main item the Mexican fire broiled chicken, flour tortillas and pinto beans are consistent. So is the salsa and pico de gallo.
