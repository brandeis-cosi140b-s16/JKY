Free Fresh Made Chips & Salsa! My first time here and I ordered 2 Enchiladas one Shredded Beef w/ Roja or Red Sauce and one Chicken w/ Verde (little spicy kick) that comes with Beans, Rice, Lettuce, and Sour Cream. I also ordered a Fish Taco since a lot of people talked and order it on Yelp. All of my food was excellent! waitresses also sweet and friendly. This place is very casual seat yourself at one of the booths and the waitress will be right with you! I'll definitely be back food was delicious!
