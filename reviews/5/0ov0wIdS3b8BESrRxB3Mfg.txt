I feel Spanish Fly is one of the best things that has happened in Scottsdale in terms of adult entertainment for quite some time - especially during the hot summer months.  In the past if you wanted to go to a pool during the day you would need to get a hotel room at the Valley Ho, W, etc.  Spanish Fly offers: Typically no cover, great house music, quaint but beautiful grounds and lots of people from all walks of life  just having a good time.  I have just as good of a time here at the pool parties as I do at the larger local hotels or Vegas resorts - often even better as it's so convenient.  Nights. too, can be enjoyable but more chill - feels like you're at some small club in the Mediterranean.  Can't wait for the summer pool season to start...
