Talk about amazing... I can't say enough good about The Stand. I've been here several times, and the staff is always so bright, happy, and passionate about their food. My favorite thing is the Mexican Corn... I have an obsession with it. It's perfect in every way with the onions, cilantro, cheese, mayo, lime deliciousness! My only wish is that it wasn't seasonal. ;) Everything is made fresh, which does mean a wait sometimes, especially when it's busy... but I tell you, you won't be disappointed if you've got the time! I also recommend the banana shake, and this coming from someone who hates bananas... It's delicious, creamy, and entirely refreshing! Burgers are flavorful and delicious... Fries delicious and also flavorful... The best horchata I've had in town, perfect balance of sugar and cinnamon. YUM!... Next on my list is the salted dulce de leche shake.

Oh, and GET THE STAND SAUCE!
