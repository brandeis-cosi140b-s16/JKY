probably one of the best mexican restaurants i have ever ate. the food is pretty awesome, close to authentic but not quite. Their burritos are pretty big, so trust me it will be more than enough. and the best thing is their PRICES, yes their prices are super cheap. You could get a mesquite grilled half chicken(w/guac, ranchero beans, salsa, cucumbers and lettuce on the side) for $6.24. its enough chicken to feed two people. they also have 1/4 chicken, and whole chicken for more people. my favorite meat here is the Al Pastor(marinated pork). its probably the most authentic flavor of Al Pastor that comes closest to tacos in mexico. 

with tacos and combo meals you get the choice of corn or flour tortillas. Take it from me and trust me on this, get the flour tortillas. their corn tortillas seem to be the buy at the grocery store type. nothing special. If i had something negative to say, it would be that their corn tortillas really suck.

overall still 5 stars
