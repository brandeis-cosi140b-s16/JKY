Seriously AMAZING!!!! Linda is my new favorite server in Vegas......Friendly, knowledgeable! The foood was OUTSTANDING! And the whole staff came out to sing "Happy Birthday" (much to the embarassment to my 15 year old daughter!!!) Will for sure go back....the food, YES....But just to be around the people that work there..HELL YEAH!!! 
Nice job, Macayo's for having the BEST service and staff I have seen in a long time!!!!
