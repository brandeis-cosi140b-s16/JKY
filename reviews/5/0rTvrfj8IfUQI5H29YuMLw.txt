So far best mexican in pittsburgh. recently moved to the area from chicago where you can get quality mexican food down the street. The rolled tacos keep me coming back for more! They have a delicious green sauce over top of them and are nice and crispy. The nice thing about this place is the staff are friendly and the prices are good. Their fish tacos, also amazing.
