Ajo Al's is the benchmark for us, that all other Mexican Food establishments are measured.  We have been regular customers since their inception at 90th street; and since being transferred out of state, every return to the valley includes a dining experience at Ajo Al's.

I think the notable differences for us, is the quality of white chicken they use in their dishes; it's not canned, nor mixed with dark meat.  The shredded beef tacos are superb, and guess what, cheese crisps are pretty much unknown beyond the state of Arizona!  So if you are a first time guest, you can expect more of a Tex/Mex flavor, and would recommend a combo plate letter F, or anything with Chicken!
