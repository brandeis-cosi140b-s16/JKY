Delicious. We shared the combination plates for the red jade chicken, pollo diablo and the jerk chicken and the carnitas. Staff is very friendly and helpful and the food lived up to the hype. This is truly a 5 star, 300+ review place and you can't beat the price. Throw on a t-shirt and jeans and enjoy delicious food.
