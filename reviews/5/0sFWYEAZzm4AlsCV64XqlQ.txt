The food in this place is great, but even more than that the customer service of the owner/manager and all the people there was superb. I had a difficult order on a busy Friday afternoon because I needed food that didn't have any salt.  They were so helpful and even got me the exact kind of food I needed, and did it very quickly. They made our day go so much easier. I would definitely go back to this place.
