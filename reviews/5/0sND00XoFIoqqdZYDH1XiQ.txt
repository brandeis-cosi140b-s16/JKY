It is an amazing place. The food is incredibly delicious and the staff is so very friendly. the only downfall to phat franks is that its In Vegas and I'm Cali :-)  I won't visit Vegas without coming here love love love it.. We specifically travel to Vegas around the times this place is open. The Tortas and Fish tacos are absolutely amazing, as well as, all the other menu items. You can't go wrong, the owner is a wonderful person and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Looking forward to are next visit...
