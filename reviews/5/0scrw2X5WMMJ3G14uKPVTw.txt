This place is fast, but the food is not fast food quality at all. The portions are pretty big and the prices are reasonable. The re-fried beans at this place are epic. I actually heard they put butter in them. The only other beans that are this good are my sister's homemade ones. 

The parking is horrible, but that is because this place is busy all the time. 

I don't bother calling in a take out order because for my order the longest I have ever waited was 10 minutes, and the restaurant was packed. 

The chips are perfect too.
