Was working here all today and decided to eat here. let me say this place is clean! 

I tried the crispy chili rejeno combo and boy it was delicious. Full of cheese, green chili sauce and gauc wrapped in a tortilla shell for that crunch. The plate they brought it out on was bigger then a basketball! Also the beans and rice were good which I always eat first cause that usually will tell me how the rest of the meal is gonna go.  I approve!

Our waitress/ assistant manager hope was very friendly telling us about dishes, checking up on us and talkative when she came by. She is great

It's far away from my house but I would give it another go if I was in the neighborhood.
