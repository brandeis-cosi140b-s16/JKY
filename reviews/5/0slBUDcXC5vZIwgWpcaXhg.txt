Im a hard guy to please when it comes to food. When they brought my burrito the first thing i could smell was the masa (dough for making tortillas. For you non spanish speaking people) on that tortilla. I dig home made tortillas, so i knew this was gonna be a great burrito. It was. Oh and they serve beer, what more could i ask for ;)
