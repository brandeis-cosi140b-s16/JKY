The red and green sauces have a gravy taste that complements the food, as opposed to being saucy, covering the food.  I had tamales carnitas in red sauce. The maza to meat ratio was perfect.  I actually ate the beans and rice that came with the meal.  They put cabbage on the top instead of lettuce, which made a nice crunch feel in the meal, and not just garnish.  
Do not expect a beautiful sitting area.  It's a restaurant grocery bakery place in downtown Phoenix, right.  

Wonderful.
