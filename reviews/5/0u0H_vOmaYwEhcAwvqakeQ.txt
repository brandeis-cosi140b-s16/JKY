This place is great!! Their food is excellent!!!  

Some of my favs are the Red Chili Burrito enchilada style, Green Chili, Shredded Beef Tacos, Cheese enchiladas and their Cheeseburgers!!!  They also make these awesome Cheesecrisps with Red or Green Chili (open or closed) that are YUMMY!

You have to stop by this restaurant and try it out!  It's in the downtown area of Buckeye but worth stopping by!
