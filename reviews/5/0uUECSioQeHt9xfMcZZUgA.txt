Are you kidding?! My first visit to Carolina's was divine! I live most of the year in Seattle dreaming about great Mexican food... This trip, I found what I was looking for at Carolinas. I'd read about the restaurants in several magazines and finally made it to the west location. 

My family and I sampled several dishes. The highlight being the enchilada sauce and tamales (red and green). I also enjoyed the taco and refried beans. All of the dishes satisfied my craving for authentic mexican food.

Carolina's has rocketed to the top of my Arizona "must do" list. I will visit often!
