I came her with a friend who enjoyed the seafood. I'm not much for shrimp or oysters but thought why not try a new place. I was really disappointed to be honest. We were the only ones there and it took forever to get our food. I ordered a chile relleno with chicken and after a few minutes was told they were out of it. I didn't really see anything else on the menu I wanted so I went for the standard chicken quesadilla. It was very greasy and the cheese tasted like the one you get at Taco Bell. Not impressed and probably won't go back. Lack of service and the food wasn't anything special.
