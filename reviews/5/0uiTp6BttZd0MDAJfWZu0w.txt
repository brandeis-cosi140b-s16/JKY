Great restaurant! We have been going there for several years now and have tried most of the menu and nothing disappoints. They have several items like the diabolo burro and the shrimp enchiladas that are like nothing anywhere else.  The grilled salmon and vegetables is healthy and delicious.  If you want something a bit out of the ordinary try something new at Don Reubens!
