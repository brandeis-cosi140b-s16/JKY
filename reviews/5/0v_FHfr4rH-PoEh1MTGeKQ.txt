This newly opened (7/12/2015) location is a much needed "quick eat" addition to the area, with so many office buildings nearby and limited places to squeeze in a lunch hour during the work week.

I ordered online for 3 people, and it was ready to pickup within 20 minutes with each individual order labeled with names. The parking lot is fairly small, but they have 15 minute limited "Burrito Loading Only" for pick-up orders, which is AWESOME. 

The staff is energetic, friendly (much friendlier than some neighboring restaurants) and the food is great!!
