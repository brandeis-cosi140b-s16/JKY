I LOVE this place.  My boyfriend lives very nearby so we end up here pretty frequently.  It's a small place but we've never had trouble getting a table and we have gone at various times and on various days.  The staff is very friendly and we have always had excellent service.  The menu is very creative.  The flavor combinations are unique and sometimes unexpected but always delicious.  Their drinks are also exceptional.  They recently had a watermelon margarita that tasted like you were biting into a fresh watermelon, very summery and yummy.  We are usually so full that we can't possibly think of dessert but our past couple visits we decided to indulge.  Last night they had homemade churros with homemade chocolate ice cream and a caramel sauce, it was incredible.  Just writing this review is making me hungry!  If you're in the south side looking for a great meal and delicious drinks, I highly recommend stopping by.
