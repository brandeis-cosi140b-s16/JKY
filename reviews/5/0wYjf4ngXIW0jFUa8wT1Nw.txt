Ordered two carne asade tacos, and two al pastor. Both were awesome! The carne asade with everything came with beans which is different, but quite enjoyable. The al pastor came with slices of pineapple with gave the tacos a great sweet flavor. The salsa bar is on point and comes with grilled onions and chiles. Very great place. Will definitely come back when in Vegas!
