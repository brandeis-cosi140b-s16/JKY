Yum-a-thon!

I had a vegetarian, black bean burrito that was good and the side of corn on the cob is fantastico (I'd come back just for that) and also the FLAN - OMG!

I like the environment here too. Cozy and chic at the same time. Servers are friendly. The prices are a little on the high side, but not too bad for the quality and NON-GMO menu. It's a great late night stop after a night of partying or a great date night.
