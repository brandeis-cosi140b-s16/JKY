For a taco shop, this seems about an authentic as it gets.  The quality of the ingredients seems to be a step up from your standard *bertos fare.

I have had both the chorizo breakfast burrito and the carne asada burrito and they were both fantastic.  I look forward to trying the more unique items on the menu.

On top of great food, you can expect service with a smile and self-serve hot carrots and peppers while you wait.  What more can you ask for?
