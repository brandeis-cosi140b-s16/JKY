I have been here three times now:

First time I had the carne Assad tacos, they were good and very filling

Second time I had the tilapia tacos, they were very good and also filling

The third time today I had the shredded beef burrito which I usually do not like, it was very good and filling

I must add that I am a 200 pound guy with a big appetite 

All of the above come with rice, beans, chips, salsa and a drink for a total price of 5$.
