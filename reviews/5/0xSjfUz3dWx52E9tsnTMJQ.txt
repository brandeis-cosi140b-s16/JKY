My daughter's school recently had a fundraiser here.  For the amount of people they had and the line nearly out the door, they did a great job of keeping it moving!  

I love Chipotle.  The burrito bowl is filling and delicious!  It's a great idea.  I always find I feel over stuffed with a regular burrito but the bowl is perfect.  Their chips are fresh and their guacamole is delicious!  It has just the right amount of zip for me.  The kids meal is a good deal.  My daughter gets her favorite cheese quesadilla and rice and beans along with a drink.  

This location is clean and friendly.  No matter if the line is long or short, they do a great job with good service and good food.
