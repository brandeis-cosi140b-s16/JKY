Love love love Xavier's!
We moved to TX almost 4 years ago and boy do we miss Xavier's Casa Reynoso. It's the real deal Mexican food, not TexMex. We go to Xavier's every time we return to visit AZ.
The restaurant is small and occasionally so busy you can't find a place to sit but the food is so amazing that I will wait for a seat to open up.
Their food is the best in town. They have a bunch of other family members that own restaurants around the Valley and throughout AZ (Globe, Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler) and are all very similar in taste but Xavier's seems to be better than his relatives; though I'd never pass up a meal at any of his other family members restaurants.
