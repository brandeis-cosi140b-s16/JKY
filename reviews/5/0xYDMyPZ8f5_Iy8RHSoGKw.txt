Best in town!

This place is great! I tried both the chicken and beef tacos and found them to be perfectly seasoned and unbelievably fresh tasting. Service was pretty fast, but this is not fast food type of Mexican food - not by a long shot. The quality and taste of the food has now ruined me for the typical Mexican fast food joints.

Clean, bright, and a great atmosphere. I am really pleased that this place is not just another clone type restaurant that is the same boring place and has the same boring food everywhere you go.

I have been telling all my friends about this place and can't wait to go back.
