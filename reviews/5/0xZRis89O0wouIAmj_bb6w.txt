These could be the best tamales I have ever eaten!

Let me start off by saying this...  I grew up in Los Angeles and I found that great tamales are hard to come by.  Good tamales and mediocre tamales were much easier to find.  As I sat watching the crap on TV on turkey night, I thought back to the tamales I used to have to have in LA after thanksgiving night.  So I pulled out my trusty laptop and found Old El Paso.

I made the 5 mile drive over there and could smell the tamales as soon as I opened the front door.

There is no menu, but there were several dozen assorted tamales in steam racks I could see.  There were business cards beside the cash register that stated they had tamales, burritos and menudo, but as I said there is no menu.  The young lady that was working there was pleasant and very quick.  I had already called my order in, so I was just watching while she helped the lady in front of me.

I quickly paid for my order and raced the 5 miles home, hoping that the tamales would still be hot when I arrived.  They were!

The masa (my favorite part) was just the right consistency.  Not too moist, not too dry.  I pulled the husks back, careful not to drop any bits of masa.  Ummm the smell waifted all the way to my nose and I almost melted.  This was going to be good.

I placed two on my plate, splashed a tad of salsa on them and took my first bite.

Full of flavor, perfect texture, this tamale felt and tasted like it had been made by someones grandmother.  I felt as if I were back home again.

Some people have complained that they were small in size, but for bought tamales, this is a good size.  I originally thought that the price was a bit steep, but considering the quality, I think they are worth it!
