Margaritas were refreshing and delicious! Beef Chimichanga and Chicken chimichanga were really delicious! Made note of the Sunday Buffet. We were there about the time it ended but looked like it might have been a good option earlier! The tamales are decent sized and they make maza like I do , with chili in the dough!!!
How good was this place? Good enough that hubby asked me to book mark it!
