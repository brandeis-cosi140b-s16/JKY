Got there right at 10:00 and a man named Ruben greeted me, I felt bad being the first customer and coming in so early but he didn't mind at all, extremely polite and took my order, I got my food very fast, and everything was great. Easily the best Rubio's I've been to, and one of the best customer service experience in a long time, thanks Ruben!
