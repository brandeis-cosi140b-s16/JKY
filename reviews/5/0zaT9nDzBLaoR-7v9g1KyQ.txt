I grew up on Taco Bell, I absolutely love Taco Bell. That said, I have never reviewed a Taco Bell on yelp before. But this Taco Bell is just exceptional and warrants a five star review. Not only does this Taco Bell deliver the best tacos and burritos I've ever had at a Taco Bell, it is also beautifully decorated inside, always perfectly clean, and most important of all - the people that work at this Taco Bell are just so, so nice. Customer service at this location is excellent - whether I walk in, or go through the drive-through, the people working take the time to ask me how my day is, they always have a smile on their face and are pleasant - I really appreciate this :-) so I just wanted to say, keep up the great work - thank you for all of the delicious meals, I always look forward to going to this Taco Bell, and will drive out of my way to get there even when there are other Taco Bell's closer.
