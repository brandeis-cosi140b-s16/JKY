Chipotle is always crazy busy, no matter which one you go to. This one always stays stocked up and clean! The quality is always amazing...I've been to some that were hit and miss...

They were in a rush today with a large to go order and added a little too much hot sauce on my salad bowl. I asked if they could take some odd, they did, and gave it to me for free. Wasn't even expecting that! Never had more amazing customer service at any chipotle as I do here, thank you!!!!
