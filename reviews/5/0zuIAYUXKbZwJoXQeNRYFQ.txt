Today while I waited in line there was a little tiff between a couple of employees behind the line.  It was kind of awkward but it reminded me that I've been meaning to write a review about this Chipotle location.  Chipotle employees are always pretty cheerful but these guys are commendable.  They're dealing with out-the-door lines every day at this location and are always smiling when I finally get to the front.  

Even today with what could have become an "incident", the manager handled the situation immediately and the cashier gracefully stepped in to finish my order.  I love Chipotle in general but enjoy this location particularly.  Nice job, all around!
