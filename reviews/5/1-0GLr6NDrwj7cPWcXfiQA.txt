This place has the best tacos in the valley. 
I've tried so many places only to be disappointed... Finally found the best carne asada tacos. Everything is fresh to order right in front of you. The service is great, staff is friendly. It's a small place but there's plenty of outside seating. Sometimes I wish they were open after 10pm for a late night meal. 
This place is totally worth the drive of you are not in the west valley. You will not regret it.
