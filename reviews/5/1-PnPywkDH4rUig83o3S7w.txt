Blissfully full. That's what I am right now, as I just finished my meal, my first ever from No Qu√® No. Where do I even begin? I guess from the beginning.
The interior - spacious and cozy at the same time. I instantly felt comfortable walking through the door.
The staff - so nice, helpful, and very attentive. Your water will never go empty and you won't want it to, it's the most clean and crisp water you can get in a restaurant. Really.  No tap water here.
Chips and salsa - the freshest, most flavorful chips I've have in forever and OMG the salsa. Forget the usual salsa that tastes like it was out of a jar, this stuff is legit. Smoky with a little heat to go along with the lovely savory tomato taste. Delicious.
Dinner - I ordered the shrimp fajitas, which comes with a side of beans and the extras you'd want: guacamole, pico de gallo, and crema. This place does not know the word stingy!  18 whole pieces of shrimp, a ton of yummy veggies (sweet onion, red and green bell peppers) and three small flour tortillas. I would recommend getting an extra order of tortillas because you're going to want to eat it all!  I know I did. Blissfully full, remember?  Oh and the rice!!  Definitely a family recipe and it's very very tasty, unlike the usual rice you get elsewhere.  As for the guac, pico, and crema?  Delicious. Fresh. Wonderful. In my tummy. Yep. If it goes in my tummy you know it's gotta be good. 
Dessert - Flan. Freaking fabulous flan. Seriously some of the best flan I have ever had. It's this silky thick custard texture on top of what I can only describe as a dense sponge cake. So different and so decadent. Poured over was a sugary reduced sauce that I think included a touch of espresso liqueur?  Whatever it was, there wasn't a drop left as I didn't want to leave any behind.
Everyone, I urge you to visit this establishment. You will be not be disappointed, but in a state of euphoric satisfaction as I am now. Thank you for the most excellent food!
