-Chipolte is like the Subway of quick Mexican grill style food. Made to order burrito bowls(no tortillas), giant million calorie burritos, tacos (crunchy or soft), etc. Scoot down the line towards the register to pay and sit down to eat.

-They have grilled chicken, beef steak, barbacoa, and carnitas. White or brown rice. Bean choices are black or pinto. Select shredded romaine lettuce, jack cheese, sour cream, fajita veggies, and salsa choices. Guacamole is $1.95 extra. Extra meat is a few bucks! You can even order two kinds of meat for half & half style. Pile it on! Yum!

-If you have celiac disease, let them know and they have to change out the serving utensils in case anything comes in contact with a flour tortilla. 

-Clean place. The line moved quickly during peak lunch time.

-Extra scoop of rice is available at no charge, just ask if you like rice. I like their rice!

-There is a glass shield between patrons and the food for a reason. Why do people think it's OK to reach their arms over the glass to point to the food or hang their arms over the glass within inches of the food? Knock it off, buddy!

-Employees were friendly.

-Plentiful parking.
