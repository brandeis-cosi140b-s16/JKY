Good Food

I have been to roberto's at different locations but the food at this location stands out to be the best of all. its simply mouth watering.
i like there Shrimp & Chicken Burrito. its hot and tasty. special mention about the size of the shrimp, they are big :)
Even though i dont understand the language, I enjoy the Mexican music. 
Good Quality food.
Clean Restaurant.
