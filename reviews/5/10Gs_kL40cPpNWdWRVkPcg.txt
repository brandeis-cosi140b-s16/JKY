I always order the California Burrito without pico. The carne asana in the burrito tastes a bit dry sometimes but overall it is usually very yummy. 

Also, the service is great. One particular time my friends & I came here after the club & one of the workers gave us a free drink & free chips because one of the girls in our group was borderline puking & looked like she was going to pass out.

Because this place is 24 hours, has friendly staff, cheap & affordable, & gives huge portions, I give it 5-stars!
