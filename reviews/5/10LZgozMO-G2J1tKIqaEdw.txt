All that hype and all that talk is definitely worth the 1 hour wait! The BEST tacos I've had in so long. I wouldn't recommend going here if you're a vegetarian, if you wait in that big line for a quesadilla be ready to see the cow brains slowly sizzling in some pot. haha 
And for all you meat lovers don't miss out on these tacos, I had basic Asada tacos and a quesadilla with meat and it was amazing. Great taco spot and reasonably priced!
