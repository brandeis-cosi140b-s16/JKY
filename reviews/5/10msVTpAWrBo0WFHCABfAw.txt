While I live on the east side, I have a co-worker that lives on the west side and we decided to meet here for lunch today.

I had the fry bread taco with red chili beef.  Simple, and excellent.  While they have a full service menu that all looks worth trying, my co-worker and I both stuck with the fry bread taco.

The food was presented well, arranged with care, and very prompt service.  These people have a very clean establishment, and know how to do food service by paying close attention to their customers.  Good service doesn't mean coming up to the table and interrupting the conversation to ask if everything is ok - good service is paying attention to the diners and recognizing when attention is needed.  This place does that better than any restaurant I've been in over the past few years.

If you're in the neighborhood (nw corner of 51st Ave and Olive), give them a shot, you will not be disappointed.  Proprietors that get it right are few and far between.
