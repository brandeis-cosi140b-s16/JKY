Great place to eat. I was looking for a Mexican restaurant that I had gone to for years only to find out it had closed down.. As I drove away I found this place. La Comida turned it to be really good. You have to order the Corn for an appetizer it was tasty. You should also try the tres leches cake it was also a good treat.
