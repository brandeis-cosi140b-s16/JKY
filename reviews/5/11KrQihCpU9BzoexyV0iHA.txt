Great location, delicious food and fabulous service. I had lunch there today with a friend. We tried five of the different tacos - pork, 3 different seafood, and mushroom - and we loved them all. The chips and salsa were good. The frosted chocolate cake was delicious - even more so with the ice cream. The great service was what pushed my rating up to the fifth star. Everyone was friendly and helpful and cheerful (let's hope working with the general public doesn't try that attitude!). We will definitely go back again.
