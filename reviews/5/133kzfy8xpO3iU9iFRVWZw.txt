I love this taco shop. You could even say I'm a little obsessed. It's cheap (tacos being about $1.99), has a relaxed atmosphere, and the tacos are bomb.

Let me clarify a few things though: Their Baja-style tacos are killer. Each one starts with a layer of Mexican blend cheese, meat (more than 2 tbsp.), lettuce, tomatoes, and feta cheese that goes all the way to the top. This is not your 1/3 full Taco Bell taco. However; their breakfast-style tacos aren't as full. They don't have the lettuce and extra cheese like the Baja ones. 
Rice has good flavor but can be crunchy depending on the day. Black beans are seasoned well, but the refried ones could use a little TLC in the kitchen. 
Drunken Pig soup is better than I thought it'd be- there's a lot of meat in one little bowl.
Quesadillas are huge. As in cut the moon in half and there's your quesadilla. Rarely do I see people finish a whole one. But there are those who workout 24/7 and can eat a whole whale if that were legal, so they can probably down one all by themselves. For the rest of us however, you can share it and be fine. 

Out of everything I've had there, the Baja-style grilled fish, chicken, and spicy pork tacos are my favorite. I like to order two tacos and a side of rice which usually keeps me full for the rest of the night. It's a definitely a place to go to if you're looking for good, cheap Mexican.
