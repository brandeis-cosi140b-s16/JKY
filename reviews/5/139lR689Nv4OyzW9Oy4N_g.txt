This place is great!! I had pupusas and tamales and the taste was delicious !! Really nice staff, really cozy ambiance. The staff was awesome and  the owner very friendly and enthusiastic. It seems that they love what they're doing and it shows.

The whole place just has a good vibe--I think it is all emanating from the The owner and his food. I definitely will be back at Comalapa Family Restaurant.
