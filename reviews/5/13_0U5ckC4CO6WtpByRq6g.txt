Great service and amazing food. Best chips and salsa! Fast place to eat lunch if you only have a short lunch break. Amazing desserts; flan, fried ice-cream, sopapillas and hot apple pie Ala mode. The hot apple pie Ala mode is probably the best dessert they serve; it comes with this sizzling sweet butter rum sauce and a huge scoop of vanilla ice-cream. Absolutely to die for!!
