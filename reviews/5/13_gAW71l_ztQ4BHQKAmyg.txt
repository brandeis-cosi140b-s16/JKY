We were looking for something a little different to do for a Baptism party for our son and nephew, so after enjoying these tacos at my husband's Christmas party, we decided to have a taco cart at our party. We stopped by the Taqueria Guadalajara off Van Buren and 26th Avenue one morning to put in our order about a month prior to the event. The restaurant was clean and bright and it wasn't lunchtime yet, so no one was in there eating. The lady at the front counter was pleasant and helpful as we asked questions about how the cart worked for a party and what our options would be. You had to have at least a 50 person party for the cart. They had a list of at least ten different meats we could choose from. We went with the carnitas, azada, pollo and pastor. You also get a big jug of juice, so we chose the Horchata. For the cart to be at our house and for two people to set up and cook the meat and serve the food, we were quoted $300 for our selections. A deposit of $100 was needed at the order time and the remainder the day of the party.
On the day of the party, the two gals from Taqueria Guadalajara arrived on time and started setting up the grill and the toppings bar. There was a guacamole sauce, a red and green salsa, plus the usual veggies at the toppings bar: Cucumbers, carrots, onions, cilantro, etc.
When the food was ready, they served us quickly and explained the different meats. We had two porks, one beef and chicken. One of the pork selections was redder from spices and they were kinda sweet. Forgive my gringo-ness, but I don't know what they were, but they were good! The corn tortillas were delicious and fresh and heated just right on the grill.
The taco cart and toppings bar were a hit at the party. My sister, who lived in Mexico for two years said that the food reminded her of her times there. If you want something authentic and delicious, try it out!
