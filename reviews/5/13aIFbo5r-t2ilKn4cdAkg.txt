By far my favorite causal place to eat!! Between my husband and myself we have tried at least 3/4 of the menu as this was a weekly date night spot for years. 

I can't say enough about the service. The staff is so nice and as a regular they remember what we like to get even if we haven't been in in awhile. There is almost never a wait unless you are going Friday or Saturday evening, and even then the wait time in minimal.

One thing to keep in mind when ordering is that a few of their appetizers are quite large and should be split among large groups ( nachos or any of their Mexican pizzas). My personal favorite though is the Chili con Queso dip. Another ordering tip is that they will bring you regular salsa with your chips but they actually have spicier ones if you ask your server. 

I could go on and on about what I like about each dish but you just need to go there and try them for yourself.
