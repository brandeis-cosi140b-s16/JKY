This place deserves huge kudos for the service and food quality excellence they provided my party on Saturday October 17th, 2015.
We were in a rush to get served because we lost track of time waiting for the table at the bar. We had Jimmy Buffet concert tickets and asked for help to get our quickly. Instead of getting a bunch of excuses the staff was extremely accommodating and did such an awesome job making us feel like we were VIP's. They guided us towards the best food to order to get it quickly. Our server even gave us waters to take with us. Place was jamming with people, but you felt things were always under control and everyone was having a good time. Bar staff was very accommodating as well during our wait for table, even though we were in their way because the place was so busy.
I had the special "street Tacos", which were amazing and piping hot, just like you want food to be. 
I will always make this my preferred location when visiting Vegas, its not every day that you find a restaurant that's run this well. You could tell people really cared about us and enjoyed the work.
Thank you to the entire  DIablo's team for making our Jimmy Buffet experience much more amazing!! We appreciate your efforts and they did not go unnoticed.
