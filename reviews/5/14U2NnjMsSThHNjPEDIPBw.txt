Spanish fly opened where the old Drift was, and I gotta say that the minute you walk in you feel like you are on vacation. The palm trees, the colorful mosaic tiles, fruity cocktails and pool area complete with a water fall take you away from  your day to day routine. There are a few tables set up, as well as ample seating in the bar areas, and lets not forget the cabanas! 

My friends and I received great customer service from the bartenders, and when we moved over to check out the pool area the servers were just as attentive. The menu provided an array of cocktails that were both tempting and seemingly refreshing, as well as a variety of food items. Im sure this place will be busy for the summer pool party season.
