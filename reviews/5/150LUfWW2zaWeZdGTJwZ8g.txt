Do you like the movie "Nacho Libre" with actor Jack Black? Do you love authentic Mexican food... and real Mexican music... and the creative world of Mexican wrestling? If yes, then follow this advice: Go to the corner of Miller Rd. and McKellips Rd. in Scottsdale, AZ. Next to the Circle K there is a "Filibertos" sign. The Mexican cook who took over the space, calls his new restaurant "Santos Lucha Libre Taco Shop". The food is fresh and the recipes and sauces are very good. I've had a burrito and a protein salad... I loved them both. I'd recommend to anyone that likes real-and-fresh Mexican food.
