The food here is super delicious and the staff is always friendly! The enchiladas are spot on. I definitely recommend the pastor on pretty much anything. If you can, try to come in on Tuesdays. There are $1 tacos and 1/2 off margaritas. I had a mango margarita and it was the best one I have had by far. Tasted fresh and was almost too easy to drink! On top of that, the owner is really personable and really cares about his customers' experiences. Highly recommend Don Juan!
