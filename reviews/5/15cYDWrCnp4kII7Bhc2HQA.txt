My favorite tacos and favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.

To drink try a firestarter. A spicy marg that is delicious. All pretty pricey specialty drinks but all the ones I have had are good.

I only get queso, salsa, and guacamole and tacos here but I've been with people who get other things and they all like what they get as well.

All the tacos I have had are very tasty but my personal favorite is the Pacos Taco
which is a beef brisket taco slightly spicy a 10 hour slow roasted chili rubbed beef brisket with caramelized onions and chipotle BBQ sauce.

I have also had the Al Pastor, Chicken Milanesa, and Chicken Fried Steak makes me drool just thinking about these.
