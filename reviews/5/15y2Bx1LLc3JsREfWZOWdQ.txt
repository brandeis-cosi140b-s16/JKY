People are really nice here. I'm glad to checking out this place. I didn't know that they own the once from San Diego. So it's cool that eat the same place just different states. 
Miscka is very nice and took care of me when I was there. She would make sure that I was happy with the food served and would recommend the food and drink that they offer. That's what I like about this place.
