This place has a little bit of a sentimental value for me since I have been eating at this establishment since I was sixteen years old.  Adrian's is a tiny little piece of Mexican food haven right off Main St. in downtown Mesa and if you're driving to fast you might just miss it.  You walk in and there is maybe eight tables to choose from but well worth the wait if there is one.  I used to go in on Saturday mornings after a rough Friday night and have their chorizo burrito to make me feel all better.   The service is fantastic and the owner is a true artist in the kitchen.  Sadly a little while back I moved far away from Adrian's but I still catch myself dreaming of their amazing green chili and Mexican coke-colas.  Adrian's is an inexpensive treat and I miss it so much just writing this review makes me want to travel across the Valley to go get some.
