Hands down one of the most authentic tasting places I've been to in the Phoenix valley. 

To anyone who has never been to Hidalgo, this is as close as you can get to having their kind of food without having to book a flight out. During my first visit, we ordered the tortilla soup, ceviche tostadas, and the Tlacoyo (which is what their restaurant is named after) 

Everything tastes AMAZING! If you get the tortilla soup, I recommend asking for the tortilla strips on the side so it can cool off a bit before you mix them in. (Nobody has time for soggy tortilla strips haha) and also WATCH OUT FOR THE CHIPOTLE CHILE on the soup - incredibly hot if you eat it. The ceviche was fresh and had a very clean taste to it. The Tlacoyo was probably my favorite. Will definitely be coming back!
