Have you ever dreamed about tacos?  you will.  When you do, it will be Tacos el Gordos.  You will see them making tortillas from scratch, laying them on the flat grill, slicing that succulent pork into them, and catching that green sauce in them.  Then you shove them in your face and your life feels complete.  Are you dreaming?  If yes, order more.  If no, order more.  Win win.  Also try their beef tongue tacos.  I have had beef tongue at some very fine dining establishments, but never had it as tender as they do it here.  If they keep doing what they are doing, they are going to take over the taco scene everywhere.
