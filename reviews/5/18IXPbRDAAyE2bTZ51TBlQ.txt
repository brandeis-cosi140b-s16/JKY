Burrito Express is the best place for burritos. It doesn't look that great inside with the plastic chairs but the food is outstanding.

Even the tortillas alone are tasty - they make them there. I peel the tortilla bit by bit off the burrito and eat that until I can peel anymore without the burrito falling apart.

You get a choice of red and/or green sauce to go with your burritos.

A long time ago they charged for using a credit card. It was a hassle always paying cash but the quality of the food made it worth it. Thankfully they stopped making you pay a transaction fee.
