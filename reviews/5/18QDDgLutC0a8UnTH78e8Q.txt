This place off 7th Ave north of Van Buren is my favorite Mexican food place for lunch since its the closest one to Downtown Phx that offers some delicious Mexican treats. 

I have tried several things on their menu and hijole, todo esta bien rico, everything tastes yummy. My co-workers and I always recommend different plates from here to each others and each one of them has been a delight.

Let me start off with the fact that their flour tortillas are the best ones I have had in ALL OF PHX. They taste homemade and you can taste the authenticity of its flour mix, its just simply the best. Lets continue our tour of the food menu with the CARNE ASADA BURRITO, wow! The meat is seasoned to perfection and their lettuce is always fresh and so is their guacamole. I am NOT  a fan of burritos but this is one of the few places in which I WILL order a burrito because of its deliciousness.

The flautas plate is also yummy, the flautas are long and deep fried with shredded beef and they are delish. 

A co-worker recommended that I try the Green Chile w Pork Quesadilla and add lime to it, and WOW, man, no words can describe the explosion of flavor that invades your tongue, its SO GOOD. 

Furthermore, this place always feels warm and welcoming. The two girls that basically run the place always seem to know who their repeat customers are and they spoil us with our requests for more salsa and guacamole and one of them even has our drinks ready for us as soo as she sees us walk through the door.
