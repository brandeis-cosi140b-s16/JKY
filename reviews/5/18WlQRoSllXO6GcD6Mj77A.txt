You have eluded me...I had you once and I remember it was good. But my last outing to Vegas you escaped me. 

I'm going to go to that Gas Station in which you hide and I'm going to get me one of your carne asada burritos, an order of carne asada fries AND a taco...ALL AT ONCE!!!

Next time...NEXT TIME for damn sure!

****NOTE TO THE SBC****
DO IT!!!!
