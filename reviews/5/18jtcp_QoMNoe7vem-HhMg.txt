BREAKFAST!

We planned on eating at Hash House A Go Go, but the 45-minute wasn't appealing.  We walked by Chayo and were warmly greeted by three nicely dressed hostesses.  Certain we were underdressed, we asked about breakfast and if there was a dress code.  "No, of course not.  Come on in!" 

After being promptly seated, Christina made her way to our table and rocked our socks off.  SO friendly, quick, professional and accommodating.  "Rice on the side?  No problem!"  "It's your anniversary?  Congratulations, my loves!" Yep.  She was awesome.

I had the huevos rancheros and my husband had the breakfast burrito.  LOVED the homemade corn tortillas for the huevos.  The bacon/chirizo combo in his burrito was smokey and not at all greasy like you might expect.

Bloody Mary was spot on!

Skip the line and eat at Chayo.  

A perfect way to start our anniversary celebration in Las Vegas!
