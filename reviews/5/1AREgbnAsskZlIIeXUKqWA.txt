Having grown up in this neighborhood I always try to frequent the businesses in the area. Don Jose has always been my favorite for stopping in while visiting my mom's home nearby.  The food is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable.  When I go in the employees are very friendly and always on their toes with water or tea refills.  If you like a place that is inexpensive with great service and delicious Mexican food, I highly recommend it.  I like the lettuce and tomato burrito smothered with green chile sauce it's not on the menu but they make it up for me because I am vegetarian.
