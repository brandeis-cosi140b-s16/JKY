Amazing!! Service was great and the food was delicious. Manuel was extremely helpful with describing what each dish was. This place is perhaps even better than Cocina Real! I don't know what Deborah ordered but it must have been off the sides menu because everything we got at my table came with all the sides! Cannot wait to go again! Delicious!
