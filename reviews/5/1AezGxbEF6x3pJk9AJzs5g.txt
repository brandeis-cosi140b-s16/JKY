I come here everytime I am go to Las Vegas.  I heard about this place from one of my friends, and it was worth the short drive off the strip.  First thing I noticed was the parking lot is a bit compact, if you go during peek hours, good luck finding a spot, I usually just park In the back on the side of the road.  Inside is typically clean when I go and the staff is very friendly.  

I always get the Bulgogi burrito, and Bulgogi fries,  My friends opt out for the tacos.  Can't be the price for the food here.  Its a nice little Asian/Mexican fusion place that I would highly recommend
