Since we are from Orange County, the birthplace of Javier's, it was odd that we had not been to the Las Vegas location yet so we made sure to try it out on Saturday night and it did not disappoint.  We sat at the bar, had dinner and the margaritas were excellent.  The bartender we had, Mike was engaging and made sure that we got our food promptly.  He also made a great Casamigos Margarita.  We only stayed for an hour but enjoyed our time and will return next time we are in town.
