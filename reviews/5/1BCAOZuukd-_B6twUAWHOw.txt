Me and my boyfriend LOVE this place. So far we have had the banging chicken burritos and tostados (which have a bit of a kick to it), chicken taco salad, black bean and veggie quesadilla, guacamole and nachos (I love their nachos they also topped them off when we were leaving), side of black beans and rice (best I have ever had even attempted to go home and make it myself).

The staff here are always welcoming and curteous I love the new location  closer to our home. I will of course be back!
