I came to Charlotte a year ago by way of Phoenix, California, and Texas. So I didn't have much hope of finding a great Mexican restaurant in town. I spent a year searching for a great taco, tostada, or margarita that I could easily find out West. I couldn't find anything here for a whole year. So missing good Mexican food was one of the toughest things in my move here. 

A few weeks ago I just stumbled onto Bakersfield by accident. I've been here a number of times since. It is definitely the best authentic Mexican I've had in the city. The food is just on point and every time. It's not pretentious but it's a very nice place as well - the decor is great, the service is great, and it fits right into the Dilworth neighborhood.

The servers and bartenders have all been totally cool. One of the bartenders in particular, Karl, has been great. He's very attentive and has been really welcoming to me and my friends. 

I think I've finally found my neighborhood Mexican joint in the neighborhood - finally a piece of the West in Charlotte. I definitely recommend it!
