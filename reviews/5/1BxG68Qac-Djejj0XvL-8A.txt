One of the biggest things I have missed since moving to Scottsdale.  Roberto's has plenty of locations in Vegas, but this one is easily the best.  The food is always fresh and good.  Staff is on top of things.  Was even better it was five minutes from my house.  I have been to plenty of these in town and this is in my top two (Rainbow and Vegas) is also pretty solid.
