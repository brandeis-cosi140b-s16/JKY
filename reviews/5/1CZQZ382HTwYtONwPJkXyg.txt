Had a great time for Cinco de Mayo with great ladies.  Margarita's were good and food was yummy.  I had enough left overs for two more meals. I had fajitas,  taste was good but I was sad it didn't come sizzling to me! Chips and salsa are yummy! The guacamole was fair. I think the young man making it table side was new at it. Our server Carlos was very hospitable and gracious.
