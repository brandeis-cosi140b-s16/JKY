Is it cheap?  Yes.  Are the chips fresh, and the salsas free?  Yes and yes.  Is the food delicious?  Yeeeeesssss.

Whenever I'm back in Arizona, I hit up Rosa's for some authentic, Baja deliciousness.  Their Baja platter with fish and shrimp tacos is my go-to staple, but their chimichongas and enchiladas are also great.

(Oh, I also forgot.  Are their beans addictive?  Yes...!)
