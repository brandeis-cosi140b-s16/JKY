My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Gil's.  When we walked in the owner greeted us warmly and took the time to walk is through the menu and make some great recommendations. We enjoyed some of the natural fruit juices (I had guava in milk, yum! and my wife the guanabana). 
The beef and the chicken empanadas were super tasty. Lots of flavorful filling, and the sauce served with it complemented the dishes perfectly.
We wanted to try a lot of different things so we shared the picada which had morsels of plantains, sausages, chicharron, yucca, and grilled beef. Super flavorful.
For dessert we enjoyed a piece of passion fruit cake (torta de maracuy√°). It was super moist and delicious.  Service was great and prices very reasonable.  We can't wait to try some of the other dishes on the menu.  
BTW the online menu is just a small sampling of what's in store.
