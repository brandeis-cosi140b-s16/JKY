I'll preface this review by saying that I love tacos so much that I embroidered one onto the back of my hoodie that I wear all the time. I emblazoned an item of my clothing with a taco... a hand stitched taco... yeah.

When I heard that a new Mexican restaurant was opening in my neighborhood I was so stoked I did a little dance. (Just as an fyi: the dance usually involves me shaking my butt and jumping up and down from one leg to the other. If you want to picture it please enjoy yourself at my expense.)

My first experience with them wasn't so stellar though. I stopped on my way home and picked up two shredded chicken burritos and a single beef taco. I walk everywhere and by the time I got home with my food purchases: 1. The awful giant styrofoam containers were all broken and sauce like liquid was leaking out of them. & 2. The burritos were sort of... squishy? I don't know if that's the right word. They were... mushy. That's it. They had just been too drenched with sauce. They still tasted great though and both my boyfriend and I loved it. Not to mention they're so big they're two meals for me.

My second/third/fourth (you get the idea) trips have been great. We've been trying different burritos and I'm about ready to move onto some combo plates, horchata, and tacos.

The girl working the front is (beautiful) always incredibly friendly and the interior is cheerful, bright, and clean. My only disappointment is that they're not open Sundays for my Mexican brunch fix.
