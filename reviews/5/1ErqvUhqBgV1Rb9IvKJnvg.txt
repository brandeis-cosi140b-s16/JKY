Ellie's is solid.  Basic and great Sonoran cuisine with a definite Native American flair.  The portions here are large, the prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and delicious.  Solid.

As Monica S said in her review, the ambiance is minimal but despite that Ellie's rocks!  The first time we ate here we knew we had stumbled onto a gem.

If you order your lunch or dinner on the fry bread it is incredibly filling...my wife and I are going to share one dish next time we go.

The little bar with a variety of fresh salsa and sour cream jalepeno sauce and fresh tortilla chips is worth the visit by itself.
