Make sure to try samples of all the meat if it's your first time but beware, you're gonna want more! I suggest going with the tacos, soft or hard, in which you'll get three and you should go with: Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, and Pulehu Steak. Doing this will help you know which meat you'll want the most for future visits, trust me you'll want to make future visits. My favorite was the Pulehu Steak. Also get a 1/4 lb. of the coconut bark. BOMB!
