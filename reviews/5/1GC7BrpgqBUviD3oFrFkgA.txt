This place was great! We got there for a late lunch and cocktails. Enjoyed $5 margaritas, a delish stuffed beef poblano and queso fundido.  We were plenty satisfied with the food and our waitress was friendly and spirited. We sat in three different locations during our 4 hour stay. It was comfortable, approachable and fun! There was a mariachi band playing which rocked! We will return!
