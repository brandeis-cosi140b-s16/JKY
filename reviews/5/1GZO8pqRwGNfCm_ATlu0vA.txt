RECOMMENDED - North Scottsdale finally has a legit taco and burritos shop!  

Located conveniently off Pima Road / 101 access road next to Dunkin Donuts just across from Walmart, Señor Tacos rocks!  There is plenty of parking in a private lot directly out front, as well as an abundance of parking overflow across the street in the Walmart parking lot. 

Immediately upon walking in the door, guests are greeted with a spotless restaurant and friendly smiling faces of the staff. Everyone is very warm and cordial. 

The menu looks delicious and if my breakfast is any indication as to the rest of the offerings, this place will be well received by the locals. 

SMART PHONE users are notoriously looking for power outlets to top off our battery hungry devices.  Well, the cool folks at Señor Tacos have  hooked us up big time. Each booth has a power outlet readily available to power up, which includes a standard plug in plus dual USB ports!  

Ok, I digress...  Back to the food!  It's delicious. I enjoyed a custom designed breakfast burrito. It was super yummy. They have several flavors at the salsa bar to choose from. In addition, they have pickled jalapeños and carrots to add some extra heat to your taste buds. 

We will be back OFTEN!
