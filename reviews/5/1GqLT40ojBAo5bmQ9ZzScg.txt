Finally made it here!  I've had this place book marked for several months when another yelper saw my  reviews for fish tacos and sent me a note to try this place out. What a great find. We started off with chips and salsa. They asked if we wanted the habanero sauce, and we tried it - let me tell you HOT!

I tried the fish taco and the calamari taco. The fish was deep fried, which I like, a good portion. It didn't have too much cabbage and was it topped with tarter sauce, again a nice portion. The calamari taco also had fried calamari, topped with a little bit of cabbage and a chipotle sauce. Both were very good. I have to say I would have preferred another sauce over the tarter sauce, so next time I will order the fish with the chipotle sauce. They also offer a blackened fish (grilled) and shrimp tacos (grilled), which I want to try as well. of course, I don't go anywhere without trying Dave's, so I took a bite of his beef burrito, and it was good. It needed a little of the Cholula Chipotle Flavored hot sauce, but otherwise, good flavor. of course we washed all this down with a couple of DOS EQUIS XX.

We had the opportunity to speak to one of the owners because it was late on a Monday night. He is an extremely nice guy. They just opened another location on Scottsdale and Shea, and both are family run. They take a great deal of pride in their food and service, and you can tell.
