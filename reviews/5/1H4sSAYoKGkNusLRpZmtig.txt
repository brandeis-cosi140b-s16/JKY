Loooove Vida. Consistently good quality food and great great service. Came this afternoon for margaritas and our awesome server got us a second round for free!

Best skinny margaritas in town let's me indulge in just the right amount of basicness. 

Vida is the only place in the epicenter with quality food/drinks at reasonable prices.
