Thank the Lord (and the people who run this place/franchise) that Roberto's exists. Especially after a drunken night at the Strip, nothing hits the spot like some greasy Mexican food that'll do work on your digestive system the next morning. 

OK, so I originally had another location in my bookmarks, but my friends and I stumbled upon this location, and yes folks, this location is also 24 hours. The first night here, I ordered some carne asada fries while my buddies ordered California burritos. Came out to roughly 7 bucks, which is normal. they had chile verde salsa at the salsa bar so I took filled up a bunch of mini containers and took it to go. 

From a drunken standpoint, hands down one of the best carne asada fries I've tasted, besides what I've had in San Diego. I thought Taqueria Chavez in Hayward was good, but holy crap this place took carne asada fries to another level. They use skinny fries, a fair balance of sour cream, guacamole, and shredded cheese. As far as the meat, the carne asada tasted like seasoned steak. I love steak, so that's pretty awesome of them to do it. OK, I know the last couple sentences sounded weird because carne asada is steak, but the flavor just comes out with each bite. 

The next night, I ordered a carne asada burrito with beans and rice. Usually taquerias only include meat, guac, and onions in the burrito, which I think is kinda boring. The burrito came out to under 6 bucks, and it was pretty damn good too. Add the chile verde and its over. Oh, I tried the burrito after recovering from a buzz, so I was essentially sober when I ate it. 

If you have a car and you're craving good food after a drunken evening, hit up any of the many locations Roberto's has. So worth it.
