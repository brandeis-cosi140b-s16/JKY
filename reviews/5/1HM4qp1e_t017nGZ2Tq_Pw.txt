I love Blue Adobe Grille  when I'm in the Mesa area.  Yes the outside is pretty scary looking with real estate for sale signs everywhere and most things closed in the vicinity. Once you get into the place however it's nice and relaxing.  The chips and salsa they serve are very fresh, and they also had a couple of good micro brews on tap which is better than at most Mexican places.  The people behind the bar area are super nice and don't rush you.  I'm one of those people who order things differently than what they offer on the menu, and this place does a great job of accommodating me. One of my favorites is their veggie enchilada, but what I have them do is stack them on blue corn and have them come with the spicy red sauce.  I also get their side spinach salad which is a small extra fee.  The dish also comes with whole beens and rice.  All I can say is the flavors of spices they use make the dish really good.  I know there are as good places if you go to Santa Fe, NM, but as far as in AZ and In CA this place is tops.
