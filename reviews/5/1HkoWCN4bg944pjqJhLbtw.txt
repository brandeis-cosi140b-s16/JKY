First and foremost, the food was great.  It really was authentic Mexican cuisine.  And you can tell that they use fresh high quality ingredients.  You can't make good food without good ingredients, no matter what the recipe.  I love they way they prepare their carnitas!  I love their fresh chips too.

The service was great.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  I'll be back for sure.
