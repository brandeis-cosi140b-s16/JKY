I've only been to other locations around the valley, but finally had a chance to visit during my lunch break with my family. I must say the line looked pretty long as we pulled in to find parking, and we almost left thinking it would take forever. Luckily we didn't leave and to my surprise the line zipped by and everything we ordered was delicious. 

Besides their good food, I was pleased with their customer service and speed. Everyone was friendly even though the place was crowded with students and business people on their lunch break. The manager (?) came around and asked how everything was and gave my family children vouchers for free meals the next time they visited. We were happily surprised with the service and thoughtfulness and a little later when leaving another employee asked if we had a good meal. 

I would definitely come back to this location again:)
