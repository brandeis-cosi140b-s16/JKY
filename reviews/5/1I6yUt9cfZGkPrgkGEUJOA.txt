It's back, baby. And unlike most sequels, this one's as good as the original. In fact, the new Don Jose is so perfectly recreated that it's like they never left. The new owners are incredibly nice, and most importantly, they loved Don Jose as much as we did, and took great pains to get it right--including partnering with the original owner and family to make sure everything lived up to the name. I've eaten there twice since the reopen and it was like coming home again. I gained five pounds in a week, sure, but that's a problem for another day. 

Sure, foodie hipsters might not like the place--oh, they didn't redecorate! Waah, they didn't have huitlacoche or cochinita! Insufficiently complex notes in the salsa! Not enough bacon and bacon-related accessories! Egads, cold beef sandwiches!--Boo frickin' hoo. If you care about that stuff, this is likely not the kind of place you'll dig. I totally get that. I feel the same way when I go to a Mexican place that serves squid. Here's the purely objective truth: It's a little bit of a dive but that's just how we like it. It isn't "foodie", it's actual food. It's not trying to be anything it's not. No new frontiers or exotic taste adventures here. Just simple, tasty comfort food--classic Arizona Sonoran, with enough vintage American diner-style items to keep the grandparents happy--at a low price, in a warm, clean, classic, friendly old-school environment. If you dig that, you'll love it. If you need more, you'll find it elsewhere. Here the salsa's still tangy, the chips are just right, the beans--delicious. Tacos, burritos, enchiladas, combos, the works--just as it was. All is right with the universe.
