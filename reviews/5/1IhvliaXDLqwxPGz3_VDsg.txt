Ooooh I understand how this place gets packed very easily! For the price, the tacos were very good and satisfying! Very worth standing in line for. They are only $1!


The only downside is that they only offer chicken or carne asada for the tacos. It might be the same for burritos too, I'm not sure on that. It was really good! They are even open til 4am on weekends! Another plus for taking debit cards! In Cali, these places are usually cash only
