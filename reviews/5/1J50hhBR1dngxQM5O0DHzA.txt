Intro- I really love this place!

PROS- Nice food, authentic cuisine, Perfect decorations, friendly service. What more could I ask for? First visit, I was seated. I got chips and salsa for free, the chips were hot and the salsa was spicy, just the way I like it! I got an iced tea, and Albondigas, Grandmother got a tea and Ensalada Grande. It was great! Then at the end we got pumpkin flan, which was very nice!

CONS- Just a little 2 pricey for my grandmothers taste.

CONCLUSION- This place is great, just be careful of what you spend. Kids are welcomed and adored here. Staff are friendly and if you know Spanish you are most likely to get into a 15-minute conversation :)
