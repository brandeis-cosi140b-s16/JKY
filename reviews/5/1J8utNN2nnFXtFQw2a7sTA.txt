When you walk in to Container Park you get hit with the smell of the BBQ place but this place is a hidden Las Vegas gem. The margaritas and tacos are incredible! I am not one for spicy food but this hit the spot. Service and atmosphere are excellent! I had a burrito with guacamole onions and salsa. Amazing. My sister had the tortilla soup which was a bit like curry and delicious. My peach margarita paired great with my meal. Can't wait to come back and try something new!
