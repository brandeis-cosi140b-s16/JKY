Delicious flavorful food. They are known for their green chile burritos and reviews don't lie! Small dining room with a few tables and a small menu. It's all done right. Everything here tastes great. This is our regular place when we're craving real Mexican food. The only downside is they are closed Sunday and Monday and they close at 6PM.
