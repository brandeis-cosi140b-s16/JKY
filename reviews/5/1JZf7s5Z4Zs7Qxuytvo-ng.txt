WE LOVE THIS PLACE
Las Cazuelas  is so very consistent with their food and service.  The food is reasonably priced and soooo flavorful.  I had the stuffed shrimp.  Couldn't eat them all.  They were stuffed with jalape√±o and cheese and wrapped with bacon.  YUMMY.  My wife had her usual.  Shrimp burrito with white cream sauce.  Her burrito was loaded with shrimp...as usual...inside and out.  She couldn't eat all hers either so we get to bring the white boxes home to enjoy the meal again.  We really appreciate this quaint out of the way restaurant.  Betty our hostess makes our visits there always special.  Always first class.  THANK YOU BETTY.  We will be back again and again.
