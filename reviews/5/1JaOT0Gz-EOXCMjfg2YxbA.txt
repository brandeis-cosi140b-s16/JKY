Though unlike much of Fountain Hills, Senor Taco is also a stop that no cullinary tour of fountain hills should be without.  Their salsa bar delights, especially the salsa verde.  Not a ton of ambiance inside--hence the drive-thru is a popular option.  Many swear by the Shrimp Burrito; I think their quesadillas are equally enjoyable and substantial!
