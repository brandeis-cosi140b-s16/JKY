It's called "most wanted tacos" now so it was difficult to find it but I may say it was worth the journey.  Best tacos I've had in arizona. Great seasoned meat and the staff was awesome. It was my first time there and the nice lady let me and some other customers try all the different types of meat before we made a selection.  Like others have said the 5 tacos is a great choice.  Got that with a side of beans and rice with an apple soda for 11 dollars.  Great price and great food!!!
