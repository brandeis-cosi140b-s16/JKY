Everything went better than expected!

We went here for lunch the other day after the original place we picked was too busy. By the looks of it I thought it would be a fast food style Mexican restaurant similar to el pollo loco or something like that so my expectations were not high. I was presently surprised. 

Walking in there was lots of room but not very busy. The menu was well displayed. I went with the Achiote chicken salad which was quite good. I spiced it up a little with some salsa from their well equipped salsa bar. Although the salad was good I soon regretted my decision as I sampled my friend's baja fish tacos. I love fish tacos. I REALLY love fish tacos. If my life was a video game their would definitely be a side mission that entailed trying fish tacos at every restaurant in the game. Anyway, the fish tacos were delicious. Everything I could've hoped for. A very classic fried fish taco. 

Now I can't stop thinking about fish tacos. Review over. I'm going to lunch.
