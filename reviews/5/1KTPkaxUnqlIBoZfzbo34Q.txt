This place is fabulous. Happy Cinco de Mayo! Come early and ready to wait. Trust me- its worth it. First and foremost the entire staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating.. Allowing us to come inside when it got dark/cold. the servers hand-make their own drinks, which are strong an delicious! We sampled the margarita, sangria, daiquiri, and mojitos. 

As soon as we sat down, they delivered homemade nachos and perfect salsa- fresh & spicy!! Our server, Edgar, recommended the enchilada suiza which was amazing and cheesy and oh, so, good! Truly authentic and great-tasting food. And a very enjoyable experience. We will be back soon!!
