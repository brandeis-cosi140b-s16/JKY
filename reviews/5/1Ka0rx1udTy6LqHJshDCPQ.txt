On a rainy night in Casa Grande, treated ourselves to a scrumptious "monsoon" margarita, pomegranate and mango. If that wasn't enough, we went for one of tonight's specials, sweet & spicy carnitas torta, OMG! Melt-in-your-mouth slow cooked pork with apple notes lightly topped with guacamole on Mexican bread.  A winner!!!
