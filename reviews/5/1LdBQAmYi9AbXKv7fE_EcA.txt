I grew up eating at Macayo's.  Birthdays, holiday's, any big event, my family went here.  They are always laid back and let you do what you want.  If your a loud group(which my family is) they will put you more away from people.  At 22 years old they let me color my picture and then we fold them up into paper planes and toss them around the room!

It is great.  Now that I'm old enough to drink, their drinks are amazingly strong!  Gotta lot a little extra Tequila for your Margarita!  Food is always the best and their fresh chips and salsa keep me coming back!  The staff can be a little......slow, but everything else makes up for that.

Plus......they are located in the best shopping complex, so I work off all the food I ate by shopping.
