When I'm eating the ethnic specialties of a foreign culture, I try to just shut up and let the natives tell me how to eat it - what condiments I should use, the mechanicals of eating it, what temperatures and tastes are best. Well, Paradise Valley Burger Company's cooks are natives of Burger Country and we are just visiting, so you should shut up and let them tell you how to eat their burgers. These guys are friggin burger wizards and I am completely enthralled by their flavor magic. Always ask about the weekly special. One time I came in and the weekly special was two thin patties, battered and fried, bacon on top and bottom, collard greens with garlic, and a maple-bacon-sriracha aioli on top of waffles.  WAFFLES.  Good God.  I almost wish I had died because I'm never going to eat anything that good ever again.

The one thing I could complain about is that their seasoned fries are way too salty.
