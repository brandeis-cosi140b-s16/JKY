This restaurant has an awesome fusion concept of Chinese-Mexican dishes... Mmm Consistently flavorful and delicious food.  I haven't been here in 2 years and the food still tastes as delicious as it did back then. My favorite dish is the 2 entree plate with jerk chicken and jade red chicken with rice and beans.The black beans are out of this world good!  To top off the meal, they give you a homemade snicker doodle cookie. All of this for $7.95... You can't beat this quality meal value anywhere in town.
