I found this place looking for a Roberto's Taco Shop. Apparently some of them have changed to Don Tortaco's.

This place is open 24hrs, 365 days a year! I went on Christmas morning around 4am after a visit to the strip and found they were the only place open for miles!

The food was phenomenal, cheap and big servings! I had a lengua burrito that was fairly big and my wife had a chicken enchilada plate with beans and rice. All of their food is fresh, and super tasty.

I highly recommend them even if it's in the middle of the night on a holiday, chances are they will be open.
