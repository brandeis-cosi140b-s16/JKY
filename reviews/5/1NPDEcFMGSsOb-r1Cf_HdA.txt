A while back all phoenix AZ residents probably recall the e coli outbreak, well my friend you are about to hear the story about how i almost shit myself to death. A young 13 year old Hispanic boy and my 16 Year old cousin accompanied me into this wonderful looking restaurant. Astonished by the cheap high end looking Mexican food we were persuaded into buying each of us $0.99 Burritos that were very massive. Well, we were starving after our hiking trip and not one of us did not finish the burrito that had weighed a good 2 1/2 pounds. About an hour later we were chilling in my crib my Hispanic friend Jorge said he was not feeling it. He went to the bathroom and left a trail of molten hot bloody shit behind him he let out a sound that only a terrified Hispanic man could let out "ARIBA". My cousin Ronan looked at me with a pale white face i asked him if he was okay liquid shit trickled down his nostrils. I called an ambulance before acidic shit spewed out of my asshole and burned through the chair. Months later we woke up and we had to buy another crib due to the fact our acidic shit burned our house down and is now used to make atomic bombs. So in conclusion you should buy the massive $0.99 Burrito at Federico's.
