Guy Fieri seems to never let us down. We crave this place now, but being that it is a few hundreds miles away makes me want to take another trip to AZ. We came here on a slow night and didn't really get much since we ate a big lunch. Thank goodness we got the tacos because they are arguably the best tacos we have tasted. Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos hit the spot! Crunchy, juicy and small enough to devour in a few minutes. By my description you can only imagine how much we dream about this place.

There isn't really more to say but to try this place. Food was top notch, service was friendly and the place isn't too pricey. My only regret was not ordering more tacos to take with us home.
