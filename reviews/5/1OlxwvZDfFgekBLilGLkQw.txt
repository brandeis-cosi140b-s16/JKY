Great chips and Salsa - Great free ice cream at end of meal.

Nice down home feel - been in Queen Creek for over two decades.

I love the chicken enchiladas with green sauce -

But also there hamburgers and fries are a huge portion you can share with  a friend for fairly cheap.

Meet there regular with folks.
