I LOVE THIS PLACE.

So yum!! First of all, the food is DELICIOUS! And its reasonably priced! I've had tacos and al pastor fries (the small size is HUGE) and was so happy with both.

Place is large and brightly lit, workers are friendly and salsa bar is great!! SO many salsas to choose from and a good selection of spicy ones!
