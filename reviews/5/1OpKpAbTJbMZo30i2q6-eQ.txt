Luv,luv,luv this place!!!! Food like this at a fast food place, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!!!!!! I'd rather eat here then any other Mexican place in Vegas, period. Great food, cheap, big portions, great service. Did I say DELISH? Yep!!!
We live way up by Centennial, takes 15 to 20 minutes to get there. So worth the drive.
Come to think of it, I think I'll head there right now.
Try it!
