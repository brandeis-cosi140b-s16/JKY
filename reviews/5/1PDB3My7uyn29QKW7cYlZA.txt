Now this is what I'm talking about. Authentic food, located right in the thick of working class neighborhood. Lucha Libre & DÃ­a de los Muertos artwork give me something cool to look at as I devoured a killer GOURMET HANDMADE CORN QUESA ! The owner was super cool & chatted with me about the unique salsa selection. If you want authentic regional Mexican food, then go here or go die.
