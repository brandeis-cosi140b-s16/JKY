Welcome to CentPho Los Taquitos....

Been wanting to check out Los Taquitos other location for a while, then I saw they opened up at 16th/Glendale.

Went for the street tacos. Had 1 carne asada, 2 carnitas, and one each of the other pork varieties. All were excellent, very fresh, crispy fresh double-tortillas. The hot sauce is delicious, and they brought a squeeze bottle to the table for me which is a big plus. I also tried the Habanero sauce - not too insanely hot at first, but the kind of heat that creeps up. The whole lunch was $8 so I will be back.

BOTTOM LINE: Welcome to PHX, I will be a regular
