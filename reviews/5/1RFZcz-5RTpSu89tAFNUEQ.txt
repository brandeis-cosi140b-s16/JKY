I've been wanting to try Tacos Atoyac forever but we were just never nearby.  We stopped in the other day for lunch and, judging by the long line and the numerous construction crews and firefighters eating there, we could tell it would be good.  We ordered tacos (camaron, al pastor, pescado) and I ordered a bean burrito as well.  I have to say that the bean burrito was one of the best I have ever had in my life.  I don't know what they use in their tortillas but they are perfectly translucent and chewy.  The three salsas that came with the meal were out of this world.  None of them were very spicy, but I loved the variety and the smokiness of them.  I also loved that you could get a side of grilled jalapenos and onions.  Don't judge a restaurant by its exterior.  This place may look a little rough from the outside, but inside, it's taco heaven!
