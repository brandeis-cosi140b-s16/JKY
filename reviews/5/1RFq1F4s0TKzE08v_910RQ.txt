If you are craving some authentic mexican, go to Plaza Bonita! We went late on a tuesday and they were busy - always a good sign. Sat at the bar, and had easy conversation with the bartender Gracie (she turned out to be one of owners). 

The chips were warm and tasted homemade. Salsa is thin, but had a nice little kick to it. She even brought out a free bean dip for us to try while we waited for our food.  I ordered the snapper veracruz and it was delicious. Huge portion of snapper, covered in a seasoned tomato sauce with diced potatoes in it. My husband got the tacos carbon. I love that they came topped with cotija cheese, and I kept sneaking bits of the steak off his plate when he was distracted. Yummy! Both dishes came out so hot we could barely eat them right away. Hot food, not just a warmed plate :) 

I can't think of anything I didn't like. The decor is bright, but not gaudy. Gracie even mentioned that they have a ton of orders for their barstools and benches!
