Came here for brunch and had the flapjacks. It came with 2 and they were good and pretty large. Had a mimosa and tasted good and just the right amount of alcohol. The atmosphere was nice. It was busy when we got here and had to wait a few mins to be seated which was fine. The hostess was nice and informed us of our wait time and we were seated in less time then she stated originally. Good place for food and to relax.
