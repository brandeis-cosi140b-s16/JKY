I go to Chipotle at least twice a month. Today I took my mom in for lunch, for her first Chipotle experience! The food, as always, was great. The service however, is what will keep me coming back to this particular location. In all my years of going to Chipotle, I have never had a reason to write a review until now! Tom, was the cashier at the time and he was just the sweetest person. I don't think I have ever received such kindness, my mom was even impressed, and that says something. So, thank you Tom - you made both of our days :)
