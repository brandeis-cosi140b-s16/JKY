I work evenings, so when I stop for lunch at Chipotle, it's technically breakfast and it starts my day.  Chipotle has always had the upmost quality and awesome employees.  Ive never had any complaints what so ever from all of the yesrs that I've been giving them my monthly paycheck. (I est Chipotle more than I should). 

So, my day follows suit with the size of the burrito.  Some days, it's more filled than others.  I'll let other reviews complain about the taste because we all have our taste buds fine tuned to what we like and base everything off of that. Today has been the smallest that I've seen so, writing a review about it and will update through check-ins. 

3/27/15- not quite the typical size that I'm used to, but bigger than a taquito at least, but not quite up to their standards.
