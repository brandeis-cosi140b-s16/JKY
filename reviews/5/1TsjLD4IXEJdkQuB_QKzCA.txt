I found this restaurant thanks to Groupons and so glad I came.  Its a small colorful restaurant with delightful Mexican music playing in the background.  I was greeted immediately when I came.  I went to the order counter, checked out the menu ( affordable but limited to normal Mexican favorites) and selected the shredded chicken soft tacos a'la carte.  Zac, my waiter seated me with an option of seating inside or on the outside patio.  The outside area equally charming and colorful with misters, which are great on this hot day.  In less than 2 minutes, Zac brought me my drink ( a soda)  and fresh chips with hot & mild salsa. Though I think on my next visit I may need to bring a friend (driver), to have one of their skinny margarita, which sounded great. Ten minutes later he brought me my tacos. Which were fantastic.  Yes taco can be fantastic, fresh, moist, and flavorful. Not that Im a taco expert by any means but I know what I like. The staff was friendly, personable and consistently showed a sense of urgency with every table. I will be definitely back and can't wait to try other items on the menu.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone.
