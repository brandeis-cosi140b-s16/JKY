Los Reyes de la Torta has watermelon aguas frescas as big as your head, and gigantic platters of carne asada that put any other establishment to shame. (The waitstaff also have impeccably teased hairstyles which I adore.) 

If you go, it's a table service type of place. When you bring your check to the cashier to pay, you have the opportunity to pick your very own Dum-Dum lollipop as a parting gift. (Please leave me a Cherry Vanilla, they are my fave.)

I was holding off on reviewing one of my favorite neighborhood establishments in hopes of keeping the hungry hoardes away. But, as I heard the 'Slope's best torta place is being featured on Man vs. Food show on the Travel Network tonight, I figured it was time to finally toss my hat in the ring. See you there.
