Delicious. I have now tried their beach house burger as well as the brulee burger. Opposite ends of the taste spectrum but both were exceptionally well made. The tots surprised me being made of sweet potatoes, but were well worth eating. The strawberry shake was a work of art. Counter service only, but friendly and helpfull. And all this for around the same price as a meal at the Burger King accross the parking lot.
