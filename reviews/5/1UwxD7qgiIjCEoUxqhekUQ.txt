I absolutely love this place near my wife and I are staying at the Luxor and discovered a Mexican food restaurant down in the lobby. The food taste so fresh and delicious everything was so satisfying! I had the number one combo it was not too heavy just when I needed from lunch! 

They play really good remixes here that was made from a local DJ! Cara  was our  waitress, she took care of us and was awesome!
