I am lovin' El Pollo Loco. Muuuuuch better than the local colonel imho. All of their salads are very good. My food has always been fresh, including the salads. Service could have been a little tighter at times, but it seems like most people like working there and working with each other which shows in the quality of the food. Overall I am pleased with this restaurant.
