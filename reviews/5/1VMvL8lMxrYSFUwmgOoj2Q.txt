I love SuperMex! I go here for either lunch or dinner and I seem to always get the same waitress who is super nice and friendly!! The food comes out hot and I recommend the beef or chicken flautas! MMM!!!! It's nothing fancy which is totally fine to me! I mean, come on, it's next to a gas station, it's going to be casual! 

Only complaint is the size of the bean and carne asada burrito I got to go for my parents....I thought it would be a big one like Roberto's burritos...but...it was the size of the tip of my middle finger to the end of my palm. But she also gave me tortilla "chips" and salsa to go! 

Always look forward to my flautas! lol
