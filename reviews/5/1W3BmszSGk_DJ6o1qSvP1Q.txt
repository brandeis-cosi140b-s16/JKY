Great food, prices are very decent for a seafood place. Awesome spot!!!! They have smoothies that they serve right from the fruit, different flavor that your traditional Mexican seafood, and I love the preparadas (of course) try the empanadas. And the camarones al puerto very lemony and citrusy taste lots of flavor.
