Being from Jalisco this place comes in pretty close! First time I came I ordered a torta Ahogada (wet sandwich) with a side of rice and beans. It tasted like the one back home. I don't get how ppl can give this place bad reviews if anything it's underrated!  We don't have many restaurants here in Vegas based of (estilo Guadalajara) besides the torta Ahogada place down on Charleston, today my grandma was craving some birria and we brought here here, now my grandma is known for judging Mexican eateries since she has that (I can make this better at home attitude) she thought food was amazing! Enough said! Don't judge on your first visit come down again! Try a casuela the infamous Guadalajara tequila beverage. In posting pictures from today's visit and the one from a couple of months ago. food is bomb dot com! If you're from Jalisco Mexico this place comes in 1st place for a restaurant based in Vegas! (My abuela said to type that)
