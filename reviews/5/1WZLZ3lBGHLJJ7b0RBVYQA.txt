I found this restaurant on yelp while in Vegas. I have to tell you that if you are looking for great salvadoran food, look no further!  The best yucca con chiccarone I've had in 25 years. The papusas were extraordinary. The plantains were perfection!  
Prices are great, servers friendly. Las Papusas is the real deal!  Can't wait to visit again!!
