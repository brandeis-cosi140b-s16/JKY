Is Regio's "authentic" Mexican food? I don't know. I don't care. 

This is my favorite place to get Mexican food. It's close to mi casa (that's Spanish for my casa) and its consistently good. I could ride a bicycle here if I actually rode a bicycle, but I don't because I'm a grown ass man with a car... and I'm lazy. 

I actually find myself craving Regio's on a regular basis. I want it right now, but it's 2 am and they're closed. This is my life.
