This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Charlotte area. I like the enchiladas, tortas, tacos and can't wait to try more! This is a small restaurant in a strip mall but it has a small patio section on the side and probably the reason I'm so partial to this place is the small bar with maybe six taps that always have my favorite local breweries on tap! (Noda & Birdsong) I'm working up the courage to request a half coco loco & jalape√±o ale, let me stop. The staff is really pleasant and they have some good meal and drink specials every day of the week. I'm pretty sure this falls on the owners of the strip mall but the sidewalk and parking spaces could use a pressure washing as I've encountered a few messes on the way in. Other then that I plan on spending several fall evenings on that patio so keep up the good work three amigos!
