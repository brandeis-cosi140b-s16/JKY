Been in Maricopa since Nov 2012. Finally a very nice place to have dinner 5 minutes from the house. Anyone who had bad service in this restaurant must have a bad attitude problem. Been here 2 times for dinner with my wife and service could not have been any friendlier or more prompt. No one bothers you , sit have a drink or water, no pushing you for anything. We've had steak chicken and fish dinners always gigantic portions and enough for a second dinner at home . Cooked it up days later and excellent. Are the second half of the fried ice cream we put in a container many days after excellent. To me this is the best restaurant in Maricopa hands down price, portions, service and quality. No it's not the best MEXICAN I EVER ATE. It's a great place to sit and eat and talk drink or not drink and 5 minutes to drive home. As good as any of the after work Mexican restaurants in lower Manhattan NY which the decor and drinks and atmosphere remind me of. If you are looking for gourmet Mexican, good luck.if your looking for a very good dinner or lunch that when you are done you enjoyed what you ate and you are not an attitude person but laid back and friendly. There's no reason if you live in Maricopa not to eat your Mexican food here, absolutely none.make up your own mind and don't listen to negative reviews unless you are perfect!
