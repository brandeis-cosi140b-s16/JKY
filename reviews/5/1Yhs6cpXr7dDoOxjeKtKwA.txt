This is as good as gets. I have dubbed this place my new go to for mexican food. Although all they serve is enchiladas and soup. Because you build your own the combinations are endless. The Bison is fricken delicious! I would have never thought that it tastes so good and they almost always sell out of it. There chicken tortilla soup is sublime. The best I have ever tasted hands down. Keep up the good work!
