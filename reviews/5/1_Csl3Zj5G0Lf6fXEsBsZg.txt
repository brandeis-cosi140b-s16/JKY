I love Fausto,s. I have been eating here for years!  I get upset when people compare it to Roberto's.  The food is way better!  Place is way cleaner. The service model resembles that other taco shop but Fausto's food is leaps and bounds better!  Horizon Ridge is the best location, but I have eaten at them all.  One of my very favorites. Cheap and delicious.
