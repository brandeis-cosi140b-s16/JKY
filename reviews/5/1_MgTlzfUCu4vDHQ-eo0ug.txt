It's NOT boring - it's INCREDIBLE!  The Arizona 24 hour Mexican restaurant bean tostada is seriously one of my favorite foods, and Federico's has one of the best.  Add their hot sauce and WOW!  They offer both red and green salsas and just a few drops of each magic liquid make every bite simply outstanding.  You can get a happy mouth and a full belly for just over $2. You've gotta try this place.
