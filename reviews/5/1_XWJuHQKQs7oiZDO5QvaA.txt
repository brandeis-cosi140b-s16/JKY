This is my favorite place to go when I'm in a hurry for lunch. Ordering ahead on the app saves a ridiculous amount of time. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I wish they had a tip jar, because the customer service has always been exceptional here. The Greyhawk Chipotle is now my go to place to relax and read during my lunch hour.

Be warned, though- if you don't use the app, the lines get pretty long.
