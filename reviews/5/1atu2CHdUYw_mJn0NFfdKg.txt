This was my first trip to Los Dos Molinos and it was muy sabroso!! I have wanted to eat here for awhile but was scared it would be too hot for me. However, after eating here, I would recommend this place for those who like it hotter than hell but also those who don't like it too spicy. 

First off, the chips and salsa are delicious. The red salsa was pretty hot but the verde salsa was less hot and was just right for me. The margarita was really stiff and got me buzzed before dinner even came. I had one of the less hot items the los dos flautas dinner. The flautas were cooked perfect and I like that the beans are the whole pinto beans. My husband had the red chili. He said it was very flavorful and had just the right amount of heat.
