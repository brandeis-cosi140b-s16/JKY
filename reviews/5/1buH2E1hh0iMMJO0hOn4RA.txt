I had been looking for this type of restaurant, the only one i found was "pollo supremo" but it isn't even close to this "pollo picante" i loved it and I am there on a regular basis. I highly recommend it. Place is very clean, delicious and GREAT service. If you ever consider in getting chicken, you DEFINITELY have fo try this one.
