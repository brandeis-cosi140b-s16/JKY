I've been coming here for as long as I can remember, since I was a kid. I've always loved it. I moved out of Arizona but whenever I'm in town I always try to make it to chino. Always get the jade red chicken and black beans, and their Snickerdoodles are always big and super soft. 

Can't wait to come back to Phoenix, and back here.
