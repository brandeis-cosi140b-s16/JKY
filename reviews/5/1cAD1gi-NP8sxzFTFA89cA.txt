Just moved to the area and my boyfriend and I just found this place this morning. Our new breakfast burrito spot. We just got a basic breakfast burrito with, eggs, potatoes, bacon, and cheese. Our burritos weren't greasy at all, which is a big plus. Their red salsa was spicy and addicting. Glad I found this place, for a tasty breakfast burrito on a nice weekend morning.
