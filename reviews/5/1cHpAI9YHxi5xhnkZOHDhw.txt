I love this place. Food is delicious, I love their tacos. Have tried pretty much them all at this point and haven't disliked any of them. Good margaritas and delicious corn on the cob! The ceviche is fresh and the guac is good. The atmosphere is especially cool. Looks like an old church that was converted to a Mexican food restaurant. Stained glass, funky furniture and art, and  cool dishes! They also have a great private back room that I've used for a company dinner. Worked really well! Fits around 20 people.
