Wow. What a find.  We had dinner here last night and it was fantastic. The food was expertly seasoned and flavorful, the service was spot on, and the prices were (quite frankly) probably too low for the value received. 

I can't wait to go back as I have already identified several other dishes I need to try. 

They have everything from breakfast to dinner - and it all looks good.
