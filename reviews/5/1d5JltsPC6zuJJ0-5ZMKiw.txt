What a great ambiance!  Came here for dinner on Saturday night.  They had the mariachis playing sappy songs.  You have a lady sitting behind a glass window, making fresh tortillas, patting them down back and forth between her hands.  It was a very interesting atmosphere.

I had ordered the mole (pronounced molli).  It was an interesting concoction of spices.  And to end the meal, I had their deep-fried ice cream.  I know...talk about calorie-city.  

But love, love, love this place.
