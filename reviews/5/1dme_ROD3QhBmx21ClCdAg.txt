Fantastic tacos, best tacos in Madison. Tacos have a blend of flavors, doubled up toasted corn tortilla, tangy guac, and the meat is plenty and flavorful. The owners are extremely friendly and make sure that the food is great. Also, the chorizo tacos are currently my favorite on the menu. They make the chorizo in house, versus using a dried up sausage. Everything is fresh and high quality. If you haven't been here yet, you gotta try it out.
