Ok in my review you will see the use of "great flavor" over and over because that was about all that came to mind. 

This is a great mom and pop place where you feel like family. One of the owners talked with our table like he knew us for years even though he just met us. The salsa tastes fresh and flavorful and chips were nice and crisp, very much home made. I ordered the soft taco Carne Asada plate with rice and beans. Rice and beans tasted very authentic with great flavor. Carne Asada wasn't dried out like most places and had a nice flavor as well. 

We'll definitely be back!
