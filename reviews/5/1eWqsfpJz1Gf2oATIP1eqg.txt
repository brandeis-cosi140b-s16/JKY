If you come here don't complain about having to pay cash. Deal with it. Most places have a few specialty items on their menu and Guedo's is their Shrimp Tacos. By far the best I've ever had. The rest of the selections are good or okay. Don't order the chicken, if you order the chicken and give the place a bad review that's your own fault. It's like going to steak house and ordering the chicken and then being offended that the chicken sucks. The quesadillas are great. The shrimp anything is amazing. If you get anything else then it's probably not going to meet your standards. Just get Shrimp tacos, shrimp quesadillas, or anything else with Shrimp. If you want chicken or pork go to Chipotle.
