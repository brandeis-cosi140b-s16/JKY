Hooray for Juan's!!   We've now visited twice.   Once for lunch and once for a busy Friday night dinner.   

On both visits, we were greeted immediately.  They have great customer service here.  The waitstaff and hostesses do an amazing job!  Chips, bean dip, salsa and sautéed toppings are brought out with seconds of sitting down.   Fabulous!  The sautéed toppings include onions, jalapeños and red hot peppers.   Yummy!  

With the dinner entrees, their soup is brought out for the table.   It's delicious!  Great flavor!  Honestly I was almost full after the chips and soup! It seemed as if it were 2 seconds after I finished my soup were our entrees delivered.   On our first visit, we had to order the flaming fajitas of course!   What a show!!    The mound of meat and veggies on this are sure to fill anyone's appetite.   They were absolutely delicious and would highly recommend them!   On my second visit I wanted to try the shrimp tacos.  Again, fabulous flavor and filled with a lot of shrimp!  On both occasions I ordered the grilled vegetables instead of the rice and beans.  It's a great side item that compliments any meal.  

Our drinks never went empty and our stomachs were filled to the brim!  A fabulous restaurant!  Thanks Juan's!
