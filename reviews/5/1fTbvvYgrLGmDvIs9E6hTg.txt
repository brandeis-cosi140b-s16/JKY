I've been here 5 times since it opened. That means this place is great. I come here for their carne asada. It is tender, flavorful and clean. No stringy and greasy stuff here. The salsa bar is clean, well supplied. I especially like the pickled red onions. There is usually a line, but it moves fairly quick. Cashiers are prompt and courteous. Welcome to the valley, GÃ¼ero Canelo!
