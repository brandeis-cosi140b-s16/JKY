I love this place. I like that it is family friendly. The service is great. The food is amazing. Everything I've tasted here was delicious. On Saturday nights they have a DJ who always plays great music and makes the atmosphere even more enjoyable. DJ shorty is the best. I will recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great Mexican food.
