I've only had one experience here, so I'm going off of that. The service was a bit slow, however surprisingly, the food made up for it. They give you a trio of salsas to try - and they were varied, great tasting, and interesting. I would complain that the chips should have been served warm - they were cold. Moving on... I had a chile soup for an appetizer that was pretty amazing. Then, a chicken tamale that was out of this world. The spiciness contrasting with the sweetness of the corn was amazing. I really look forward to my next visit. This has the potential to be the best mexican(esque) food in Vegas. ;-)

(Update!) - I went again and again the service was much quicker - and the food was even more spectacular! GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!
