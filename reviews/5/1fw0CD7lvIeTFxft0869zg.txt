Have been coming here for years, mostly for takeout and bakery items.  Went  for lunch the other day and ate there for the first time in many years.  Service was outstanding as always and the food was fantastic!  Had the shredded chicken chimi platter and it was perfect.  Also, as many of you already know, they make the best salsa in the state!  Paired with their homemade chips, the salsa even outshines their burrito's.  We get their salsa at the local Costco usually every week and it's truly the best.  Oh.... and their empanada's are excellent as well.
