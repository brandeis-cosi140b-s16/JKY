Great location, fresh food, service with a smile! I like hot food hot and cold food cold. Today I got the perfect burrito bowl at Salsarita's. All of the staff is very friendly and the dining room is clean, spacious and bright. Finally the ingredients are fresh and blended together for a tasty lunch.
