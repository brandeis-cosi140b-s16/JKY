Great authentic yummy food! Coming from the east coast where there's more options for Latin Caribbean food, this is your best bet for Las Vegas. I recommend the Pollo a la plancha (grilled chicken breast) with arroz blanco con abucheas rojas And maduros.   The severs are friendly and they also have take out which is convenient. Best Cuban spot in Las Vegas!
