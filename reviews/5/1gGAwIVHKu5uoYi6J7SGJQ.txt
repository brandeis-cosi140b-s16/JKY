Taxco is amazing. You wouldn't know it from looking at the shopping center it is in with an Aldi, Fred's, and Dollar Tree, but the food is great. The servers are very polite and keep your drinks filled. Speaking of drinks, the specials are amazing. You have to come in for their draft specials. Although they don't have much on draft, they have some great Mexican beers. If you want Mexican in Belmont, this is the place to go.
