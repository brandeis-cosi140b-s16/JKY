Went here for the first time based on a friend's suggestion and I have to say they were right!  The food was great...I got to have breakfast for dinner, which I always enjoy (steak and eggs).  The drinks are also very good.  As an added bonus, we took our drinks up to the rooftop and enjoyed the view.  I have no hesitation in recommending this place to any of my friends.
