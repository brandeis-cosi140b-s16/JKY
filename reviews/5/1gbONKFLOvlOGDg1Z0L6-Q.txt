Crazy...We ended up at this restaurant after a little change of plans. since my favorite seafood restaurant was packed because it was Mother's Day, we decided to try a less popular place just to find it also packed.....because it was Mother's Day.
As soon as I saw a table being cleaned we passed the wait to be seated sign and sat  ourselves, we needed no menus, most Mexican seafood restaurants serve the usual 
entrees so all we had to do is order from the menus embedded in our minds and if they ever say "we don't have that", then that would be a sign of not being authentic.
We started with raw oysters and a bucket of modelos, we also ordered ceviche for appetizers. For entree  we ordered camarones a la diabla. (very spicy shrimp) camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) and also camarones empanizados (fried breaded shrimp). Everything we ordered was very good and very authentic.
 It was Mother's Day so there were two bands playing very loud music, Banda and mariachi adding to the authenticity of a real Mexican Restaurant were all your senses are fed. Service was good, food was good, ambiance was good ....life was good at la mojarra loca.
