I love this place! It's fast food in a healthier Mexican style, not fast greasy Filiberto's style (but let's be honest, that style is still delicious) food.

Two key highlights to my five star review (1) self serve Salsa Bar (2) Full Bar! Yes, my friends, you can order your healthy Mexican food and then completely ignore the health of your liver and indulge in an alcoholic beverage, WIN! 

The lady taking our order at the counter was really nice. The food was ready really quickly and the salsa bar was well kept! I got the fajita burrito that was cooked and wrapped to perfection! There are plenty of tables to sit at inside as well as outside on the patio.
