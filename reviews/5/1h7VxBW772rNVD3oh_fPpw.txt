I just had the best birthday brunch here ever! 

I am a fan of trying several tasty things on the menu, and their brunch for $34.99 a person allows you to have a tapas style brunch! It's as many small plates as you like, and let me tell you. They're all amazing!!  

For $10 per person you can also add bottomless mimosas. But they have delightful flavored like prickly pear, raspberry cucumber and blood orange! 

Carmie B. Was our waitress. She was just an absolute delight. Besides being so sweet and tolerating out silly jokes, she was very prompt and anticipated all our needs. She really made this experience beyond incredible. I'd give 10 stars just for her!! Ask for her section. 

Best birthday and Vegas brunch I've ever had. Absolutely will be back!!!
