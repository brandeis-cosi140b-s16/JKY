Hookah lounges are all over Las Vegas but this one is the best in my opinion. 

To the point:
1. The service is fantastic.
2. There is plenty of parking.
3. It is super easy to find.
4. The quality of tobacco/hookah products is excellent. 
5. Knowledgeable staff.

I noticed the flavors and aromas were more robust than I have experienced in the past at the other places. I commented on this and found out that my observation was not insignificant.  This place  owned by a local smoke shop owner who obviously has access to many flavors and the highest quality product.  They always have fresh product. This is an excellent hookah lounge that is a must try if you are in Silverado Ranch.
