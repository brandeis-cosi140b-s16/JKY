I don't give out 5 star ratings lightly. Less that 30% of my reviews are 5 star, but Sol deserves it. It is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant.

I have been here a few times and being a new restaurant in the area, have endevored to try different things on the menu. I have yet to find something that wasn't perfect in taste, temperature or presentation. The food on the menu surpasses any typical Mexican cuisine by a wide margin. The unusual pairing of ingredients is sheer culinary genius. I would not have expected goat cheese to be something in guacamole, but I don't think I can have guacamole any other way now.

Their variety of tacos focusing on seafood more than meat is more than welcome. Each is full of flavor that has your mouth watering before it reaches your mouth. The ability to order them a la carte or in a combo should satisfy anyone.

The Ceviche de Coco "Cabo" was incredible. Coconut, fuit, lime, avocado all coming together for a spectacular combination.

The staff is very knowledgable and made great suggestions when overwhelmed with what to try. 

The Calamari is some of the best with a unique hint of orange.
