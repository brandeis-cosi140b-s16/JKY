By far, the best kept secret in the North Central Corridor!  Wow!  

My wife and I had such a great time having dinner here tonight. Once inside, the ambience makes you feel like you're part of a special club... a secret society, if you will.  I love everything about this place!  From the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time to the incredibly talented (and friendly) staff... There's so much to enjoy at Dick's Hideaway.  This is my new favorite place.
