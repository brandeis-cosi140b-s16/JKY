The best breakfast I have had for a long while. My husband was practically licking the plate after polishing off the huevos rancheros. The name is a bit misleading as they offer much more than burros. While we didn't try them, the pancakes looked amazing. While it doesn't look like much from the outside, the awesome food and surprisingly low prices make this place worth the trip.
