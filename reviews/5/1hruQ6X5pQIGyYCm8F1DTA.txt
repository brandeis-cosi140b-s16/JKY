El Milagro, which means "The miracle" in Spanish, is literally a miracle in Beechview. 

Every time I eat there I am made to feel as if I were a guest in the owners' home. The meals are homemade quality and super-delicious. The food is decidedly not oily and the full meals on the inside of the menu and the tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and sopes listed on the back are the real thing. No beer or wine but feel free to bring alcohol in from the bar next door, from the one around the corner (which is open on Sundays) or from home!

Prices are reasonable. Service is friendly and attentive. The mostly Mexican or other latin crowd and the TV showing Mexican shows lends to a feeling that I have hopped a plane for Monterrey! I love El Milagro! Highly recommended.
