This has now changed ownership and is a JULIOBERTO'S. It  has been for about 6 months. 

You might not have guessed it by looking at the drive-thru menu board because it's the same (as is the phone number) and the sign almost looks the same BUT you can tell a big BIG difference in the taste of food.

I've heard all the stories about all the different  "-berto" restaurants being owned by relatives from the same family. I don't know if that's true or not. It would seem that way because all the menus are almost identical. I do know that even if it is true the various "-bertos chains" all seem to have their unique recipes which are consistent within their group. For example, I can go to an Eriberto's in one end of town and the hot sauce tastes the same as another Eriberto's located elsewhere but the sauce is totally different from what's served at Humbertos. This particular Filiberto's (when it was a Filiberto's) was the best of all the "Berto's" and the best within all the Filibertos...maybe the ingredients were fresher or the cooks took special care to make sure everything was cooked perfectly but whatever it was led me to drive passed 2 other Filiberto's closer to my home just to go to this one.

Now it's gone and it's pointless to make the longer drive because the food is just not good anymore now that it's a Julioberto's. This Berto's will be missed.
