I adore this Salsarita's. The food is consistent, it represents the brand well, and to top it all off the staff is fantastic. They have a greeter at the door almost every day and the staff will fulfill any request. I'm a salsa addict, and they will ad as much salsa as I want. Good food, fantastic staff.
