We stop at this Filibertos at least once a month, sometimes more. The Country Burrito for breakfast is great: diced potatoes, eggs, and cheese. The Chili Rellano Burrito for lunch or dinner is another good choice: mild Anaheim chili filled with cheese, with guacamole inside the tortilla. Fish tacos have deep fried fish, but they still are good, we also like the chicken enchiladas, although the enchilada sauce is not memorable. The staff is willing to make substitutions, example: the Texas burrito comes with French fries inside, but will put diced potatoes instead. This will continue as a regular stop as we pass through Wickenburg.
