After passing the billboard above this location countless times my family and I finally gave in and gave Chipotle a try. After going over the menu for a few minutes we knew what we wanted. The menu is simple. 

You choose from one of the following, either a burrito, burrito bowl, three crispy tacos, three soft tacos or a salad. For ingredients you can choose from the following:

Grilled Chicken or Grilled Steak (both marinated in smoky chipotle chili adobo.), 

Barbacoa (spicy, shredded beef, braised with chipotle chilies, garlic, oregano, cumin, 
and cloves.) 

Carnitas (pork braised with thyme, bay, juniper berries and cracked black pepper.) 

Fajita Vegetables(Bell peppers and sweet red onion sautéed with fresh oregano.) 

Four different salsas:

Fresh Tomato Salsa (Mild) (Diced tomatoes with sweet red onions, jalapeños, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.

Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa (Medium) (Sweet white corn, roasted poblano peppers, sweet red onions, jalapeño, cilantro, and fresh lemon and lime.)

Tomatillo Green Chili Salsa (Medium) (Fire-roasted tomatillos, tomatoes, jalapeño peppers, sweet red onion, cilantro, garlic, cumin and oregano.)

Tomatillo-Red Chili Salsa (Hot) (Chile de arbol, tomatillo, garlic, cumin and Tabasco sauce.

Pinto beans, Black beans, Cilantro Lime Rice, White Cheddar and Jack Cheese, Guacamole, Lettuce, Sour Cream . They also offer chips & guacamole and a kid's menu as well.

I went with a steak burrito with black beans, fajita veges, roasted chili corn salsa, lettuce, cilantro lime rice and cheese. It was spectacular. My wife went with a barbacoa burrito and our daughter went with the steak tacos. They both loved their food as well.

Yes the line can be long at times but, it goes fast. There is also a small patio outside to enjoy the warm summer weather while it lasts.
