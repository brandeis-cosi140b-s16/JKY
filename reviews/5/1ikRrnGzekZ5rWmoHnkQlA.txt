This place is where everyone knows your name. The food is fantastic and the servers have all been working there for years. I've been coming here for 30+ years and go at least once a week. 

What you need to know:
Service: is it the fastest? No, but if you get to know the servers and owner they become family. They are all so nice and friendly.

Salsa: sure there main salsa might look like tomato paste but it is so good and made fresh. If you want chunky salsa the just ask for it, but beware sometimes it is really spicy. 

This is a family owned business so support them and other locally owned businesses.
