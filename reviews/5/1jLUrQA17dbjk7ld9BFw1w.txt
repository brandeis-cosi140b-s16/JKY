We came here again for dinner. We do really like it. It was a cold night, but they had the restaurant  nice and warm.  We got our favorite booth,without even asking.  The food was wonderful as always, Makes us happy that we chose such a good place. Fish here is really good as well as the shrimp and bean dip. All very tasty!!
