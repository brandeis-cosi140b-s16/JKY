As a native of Las Vegas, I can say that El Burrito has the best Mexican food in the valley.  I've been going there for the past 31 years when the original location was on Fremont Street.  I live 30 miles from the location in Summerlin, but it is well worth the drive!!!!!  You won't be disappointed.
