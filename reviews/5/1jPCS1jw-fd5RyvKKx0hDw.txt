Just found this place and my coworkers and I have officially placed it into our weekly rotation.  The owner is awesome.  He is so passionate about his food and its authenticity.  As soon as we sat down, he brought out homemade chips with 3 different kinds of salsa - including a very spicy habanero (my favorite by far).  He then brought out some kind of soup with lentils and barley, which was great.

The menu is very simple, which is ALWAYS a good sign.  Food was perfect. The atmosphere is so authentic, I kept having to remind myself that I WASN'T in Cancun on vacation.
