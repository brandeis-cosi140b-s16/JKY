Excellent! My wife and I went for the happy hour $1 tacos & $3 margaritas and we were not disappointed! Go for the soft shell tacos and order some guac on the side and Enjoy! Staff was friendly and quick and the price was right. Family friendly and has a little patio with about four tables if you like to sit outside. Definitely going back!!
