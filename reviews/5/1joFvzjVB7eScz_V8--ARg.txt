Very small place, but cranked out amazing food. Probably one of the best mini hardshell tacos I've had in a while. Super crispy, not greasy at all. The flauta was the same, and the cheese enchilada was to die for. I give the rice and refried beans two big thumbs up. My bf had the chille reanos, and he was very pleased. Real diamond in the rough, and the prices were reasonable, especially considering the quality.  Good stuff, good service, great food.
