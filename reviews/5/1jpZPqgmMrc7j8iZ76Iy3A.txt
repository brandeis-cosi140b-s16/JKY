Growing up around Chilangos, I got to experience legit Mexico City food first hand. After driving past this place a couple times, I decided to finally give it a shot. None of that "mango salsa, gourmet" bullshit, this is the real deal food you'd find in a Mexican's kitchen. The atmosphere is what you would expect of a family-owned Mexican restaurant. The server greeted us warmly and provided chips and salsa after seating us promptly. I ordered the Torta Cubana, which came in a very generous portion wish fresh ingredients.  The bread was nice and soft with a light, buttery toast. The milanesa had a nice crunch, but was still juicy on the inside, and the avocado was bright green and perfectly matured. Cheese was melted and you could tell my food had just been prepared.

The food was authentic, the server paid consistent attention to us, and the people who cooked my meal genuinely cared about making sure I was satisfied.

This place is my go-to joint for Tortas.
