Me and my husband love this place.. this is our go to place after 9pm since they open till late. Love their service and the lady at the counter tries to teach us spanish, which is hilarious when I get it all wrong. But they always ready to add, delete and customise the dish as per your whims n fancies. .for the price, freshness, good service and taste, this place is better then the fancy, expensive restaurants. It's a small mom n pop shop, not much of an ambience here, so think b4 you decide to have a dinner date here ;)
