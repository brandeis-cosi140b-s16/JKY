I had the Chicken Enchilada Verde and a side order of refried beans.  My husband had the Chicken and a side order of the corn on the cob.  All I can say was the food was excellent.....a touch of spice and loads of flavor.  All white meat was used for the chicken.  I only tasted the corn but I will order it next time.....thought it was heavenly.  Refried Beans were excellent.  The food came fast and was serving was plentiful.  The price was far lower than I expected.  No Margaritas but I'll just make one at home.
