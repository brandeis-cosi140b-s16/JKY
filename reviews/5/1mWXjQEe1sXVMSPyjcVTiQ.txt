This is a fantastic, inexpensive casual place to have delicious mexican food. It is almost a "hole-in-the-wall" kind of joint except the food is exceptionally good. I was a student in Glendale and Carambas was the only place where I not only got great tasting food but also could manage on a tight student's budget.

This is place is always crowded so you might have to wait for a table to become available. They have a GRRREAT salsa bar and awesome vegetarin options on their menu like the spinach enchiladas etc. Chains like Baja Fresh are based on small family owned restaurants like these. The charm at Carambas was it did not have a "chain" like feeling to it at all. It felt festive and fun and the team there were always friendly and inviting.
