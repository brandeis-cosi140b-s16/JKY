LOVE me some Someburros!! Where else can you get an AMAZING, fresh, tasty, filling breakfast burro (burrito) at all hours of the day? Someburros I say!

I am always greeted by a friendly face and smile when I arrive at Someburros and they are always super helpful when it comes to making menu selections. Did I mention the breakfast burros yet?? SO GOOD.

Also, they have some of the best green chile tamales I have had anywhere (and they sell them by the dozen!!), the cheese enchiladas are the perfect blend of red chile sauce and yummy cheesy corn tortilla goodness. The beans and rice are fantastic...and the breakfast burros...GET ONE! For real!

Love this place, the drive thru is convenient for phone or online orders and makes getting in and out with your Someburro loot even easier.
