Ya know...for a fast food chain, this place has permalove written on it from me.

Maybe it's due to their fish tacos...and their loverly (yes, loverly!) shrimp burritos...or their refried peppery bean goodness.

I always have had consistently good food at Rubio's - no matter where I've been - Las Vegas, Mesa, Chandler, San Jose, etc. It's a chain, but mercifully it's no Long John Silver. Everytime I've eaten at Long John Silver, well...loosie pewps and we'll leave it at that.  TMI, sorry.

Hubby usually goes for the chopped chicken salad bowl, but I've noticed the size varies from place to place and state to state.

If I ever have a craving for a shrimp burrito I usually head on out to Rubio's - it's cheaper and far yummier than some of the sit down restaurants.
