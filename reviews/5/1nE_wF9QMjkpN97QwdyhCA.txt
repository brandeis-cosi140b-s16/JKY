I am a little embarrassed to admit this but since my first visit on 8/16/11 when my son brought me here for dinner I have eaten here 7 times with several different people. We love this place for of their awesome house margaritas, the festive decorations and atmosphere, and the friendly and attentive staff. The wide selection of flavorful food doesn't hurt either. I am a 25+ year vegetarian and appreciate that there are multiple food selections even for me besides a salad. My meat eating family and friends rave about the fajitas, the pollo fundido and especially the shrimp dishes. Their salsa's are absolutely excellent, especially the verde, which is something I've never cared for until I tried theirs and this one I would be content to eat with a spoon! 

This cheerful little place has been busy every evening I've been here. If they keep taking such good care of their customers and the kitchen keeps pushing out that awesome food I know of a dozen or so people who are going to have to join the gym or buy the next size up! (Or we could just order salads, but what's the fun in that?) I am so grateful to have such good food so close to home.

Thank you Plaza Bonita for being you!
