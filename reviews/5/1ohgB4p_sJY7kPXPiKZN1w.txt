Far and away better than....Garcia's, Top Shelf, Valle Luna Etc... The salsa is a little sweet with just the right amount of spicy "bite" to it. The best part is the "pollo especial" a chicken chimi covered in a spicy cream cheese sauce! My only gripe is that there isnt a location closer to me in the far west valley!
