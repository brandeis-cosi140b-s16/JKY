I'm a Chicago native that visited Phoenix and people raged about Carolina's when I asked them where I should eat. All in all it was a pretty good experience... this was the only place where the food was good and I didn't spend $30+. I paid around $10 for a huge meal and stuffed myself.

I would avoid their new chicken, it was something new we saw on their menu and figured we would all try. It was really bland and tasted like crap. I think you would be fine with anything not chicken. Their beans/rice were pretty good, and they definitely loaded you with everything. If I had to go back I would stick with steak/beef/pork, and I would definitely go back. Check it out!
