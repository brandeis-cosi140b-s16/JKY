The poster child for hole in the wall Mexican food. Amazing food for amazing prices. The breakfast burritos are the highlight of the menu. Their hot sauce they provide is lights out. Not too spicy but just enough kick. 

If you're looking for a step up from the Filibertos of the world, this is your place.
