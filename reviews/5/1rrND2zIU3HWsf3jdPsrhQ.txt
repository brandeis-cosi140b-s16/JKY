Tried this place while visiting Phoenix for work.

Great spot for lunch. I got the chorizo burrito enchilada style. It was huge, but ingredients were so flavorful I had to clean my plate.

Price was a bargain and the owner even gave me one of their famous empanadas to go since it was my first time visiting.

I highly recommend.
