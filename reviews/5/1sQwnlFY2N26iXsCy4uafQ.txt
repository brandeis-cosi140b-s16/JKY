How is this the first time I've tried this place in the 10+ years that I have lived in Ahwatukee? SO GOOD!! Best breakfast burrito I have ever had, by a long shot. Their green salsa is pretty amazing too. The lady up front was so cute and witty and definitely made the experience complete.  Can't wait to come back again :)
