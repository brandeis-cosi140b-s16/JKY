When anyone asks about Mexican food in the city and someone starts to say Mad M--smack them (unless you're just trying to get a bigazz marg!). And then bring them here.

This place is that So-Cal Mex done perfectly, filling my rather pathetic size self with a burrito larger than any (and have been doing so for at least the last five years). I used to even trek here from the South Hills for my shredded chicken before moving to the East End. A pilgrimage from a south 'burgher is rare. Between the family running the place that is constantly here with sincere, friendly service, and the enchilada sauce (yes, seriously, just this sauce by itself), you can't get better.

Enchilada sauce. I could live off this stuff. I've had enchiladas elsewhere and been like, cool, tomatoes. But this! Red gold. It covers the huge, tender shredded chicken burrito that shares its huge shell with corn, lil' peps, rice, green beans, and is totally finished by me every time.. and these are massive. Those shredded burritos are under the radar it seems.  Everyone else gets the beefy Pittsburgh burrito, which I have to salute if only for the use of french fries.

You also get to begin your meal with their salsa and chips, and while free, are also some of the best. I do think they make everything themselves and will not believe any word otherwise. My only draw back is trying to stop by for late night, and they are often already closed before the listed hour. Maybe I just like the chase.. The elusive burrito. Good to note a few of the local food delivery services will also drop off your puppy sized lunch to the surrounding neighborhoods.

I can't compare it to others anywhere in the area (maybe a joint or two while living in AZ, but that's a given). Not saying Western PA is a hot spot for Mexi, but we hit a gold mine here. This is a Penn Ave sauce covered gem.
