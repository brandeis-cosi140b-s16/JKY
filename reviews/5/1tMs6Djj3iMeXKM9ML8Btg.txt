I was very excited when I learned we were finally going to get an El Pollo Loco on this side of town. I Visited this location during its first week of operation and was more than impressed with the speed and quality of service. The food was cooked just right and came out almost immediately even though the place was packed. I've been back several times since they opened and every time I am left beyond satisfied with the service. When your food is ready it is brought out to you. When you are finished someone comes and picks up your tray for you. Even the lunch time cashier, Kimberly seems to do a far above average job of taking your order correctly the first time and keeping the line moving regardless of its length. This is doubtlessly my favorite El Pollo Loco location in town and it is perhaps my favorite restaurant in town because of the high level of attention to detail and friendliness that comes out of what one would expect to be just another fast food location.
