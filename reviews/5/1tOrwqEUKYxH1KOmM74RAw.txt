Ok, so this place is so much more than nachos!! They have an enormous 7 page menu with everything from crazy nachos, "lighter" menu items, to a sopapilla breakfast, and their happy hour 'aint half bad. They have a self serve draft beer area and 150 different tequilas to select from. I think they would benefit from a late night happy hour menu and/or a live acoustic night. They have the space and atmosphere for it, and there are limited places that offer it in Summerlin (for your 30 something crowd). I'm just sayin'
