Delicious!! The food is excellent.  The quality is good, the temperature is right, and the flavor is on point.  I live in the neighborhood, but I won't be able to come here often if I still want to fit into my clothes!! It's evident that the chips are freshly fried and the salsa is made in-house from excellent ingredients.  I ordered he chicken and steak fajitas, and I was super satisfied with my order and service.  If it's slow enough, the owner/chef will come out and talk to you and thank you for coming.  I am really critical when it comes to paying for food at a restaurant because I usually think I can make it better myself. Casa Layla serves tasty food at a tremendously reasonable price.
