Trying to find a pair of pants and skipped dinner. After seeing my other options and reading Dwayne's review I choose Tony's.

I was not disappointed. Great customer service, great tasting and very flavorful dishes. I was not expecting good Mexican dishes at a food court. 

I even went back and tipped them. Im not cheap by any means but outside of the coins in my change I never tip at food courts thinking its more fast food than sit down but these guys earned my extra tip.
