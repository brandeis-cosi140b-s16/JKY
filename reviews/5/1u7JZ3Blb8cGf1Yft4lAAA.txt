Authentic, just like having breakfast at my Nana's house growing up. Had chorizo plate with beans and potatoes. The tortilla alone was something I don't get back on the east coast. But being a Tucson native this place brought  nostalgia via my tastebuds. Glad j read these reviews, from the exterior I would have driven right past. Truly a hidden gem.
