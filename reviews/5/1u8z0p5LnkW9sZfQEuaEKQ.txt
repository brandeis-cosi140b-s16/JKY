Okay so Los Cabos is amazing for staying open as late as it does #1.

I came in at around 1:45 with my friend hoping that they wouldn't have started locking up as most places do when its starts to drag toward the end of the night. I waved in at the guy inside he said the were open (YAY)

The menu is a little overwhelming but there are tons of options to choose from. I don't even remember what I had because I told him to surprise me and then I covered my ears when my friend ordered the same thing. 

Ill post a picture of that monstrous delicious burrito. With C.A. written on in sour cream.

It was soooooo good.

Definitely stop by if you're a late night person like me or just hungry from a long night of bar hopping.
