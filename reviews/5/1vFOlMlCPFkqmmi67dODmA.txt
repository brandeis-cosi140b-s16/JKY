We order pickup from Susie's often. My bf is a fan of their fajita chicken (& they've always been super accommodating to his specific, custom burrito order) and I am a habitual bean, cheese, & rice burrito consumer. Their tortillas are delicious and their rice is great,  as well as the hot salsa and fresh chips that come with every order. We've also enjoyed their carnitas and quesidillas, also great. Our favorite reason to keep coming back is the horchata - A+++
