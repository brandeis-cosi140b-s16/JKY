Extremely generous servings of meat and super-tasty salsa bar made the detour from 396 en route from Virginia to Michigan completely worth it.  Lomo and carnitas tacos stole the show.  Fast, friendly service and the perfect setting at outdoor tables on a warm Saturday night was a food highlight of our trip.
