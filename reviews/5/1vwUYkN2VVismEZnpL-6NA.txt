Food is made to order and delightful.  Gal at the counter seems miserable, with evil glares, and poor conversation skills.  If I didn't know any better I would think she was human trafficked and forced to serve my gringo self delicious rolled tacos three or four times a week.  Watch your back after dark and expect to be "le me ax you sump tin man"-ed by a chap holding a weed-waker.  Great food though, even if the neon green guacamole sets you off.
