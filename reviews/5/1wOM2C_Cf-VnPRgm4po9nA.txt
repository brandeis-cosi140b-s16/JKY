Excellent! Another bookmark down.

This review is long overdue. I had lunch here almost a month ago and I could not stop raving about it to coworkers when I got back. The experience is still fresh in my mind. I had the daily special Fish Tacos, but I asked for flour tortillas instead of corn. Everything was made fresh, and the slaw on my tacos was TO DIE FOR. The creamy sauce was perfectly seasoned and the fish was fresh and tasty. The rice wasn't mushy - it was cooked perfectly. My husband had a chicken burrito and he could not get over the salsa - he said it was the best salsa he had in his life.

Nestled behind a gas station and some heavy road construction, Phat Phrank's is a jewel in the rough. It's perfect for a power lunch, or maybe picking some to-go food when you just don't feel like cooking. 

As I sat there one random Friday afternoon, I had seen people from all walks of life come in and out happy. There were suits, construction workers, Louis Vuitton ladies, and families either dining in or picking up to go orders.

Frank was there during my visit and couldn't have been nicer. He made sure to talk to every customer and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. He's super helpful when you're trying to figure out what you should order. I asked him why they weren't open on weekends and he had said they were once, but business wasn't worth a 7 day schedule. He did say once the construction on sunset was completed, they would definitely be open Saturdays again. 

Fresh food, great service, reasonable pricing - this place is an easy 5 stars.
As the unfortunate duchess of a certain Roberto's, I can proudly tell you that this place is definitely worth stopping by and checking it out !
