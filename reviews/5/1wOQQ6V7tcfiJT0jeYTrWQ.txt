I used to  love this place when it was big Daddys.  I tried Gs  once it was OK I recently had a car accident and it was right in front ofGs they were amazingly helpful with making sure everyone was OK.  While waiting to finish everything up I was hungry and tried their burger it actually was not that bad I liked it the price for all their food is really good and I think they've changed management because the food was different than beforeoverall I will definitely try again
