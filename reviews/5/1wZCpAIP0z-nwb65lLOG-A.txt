I lived in California for 7 years, and this is the best Mexican food I've eaten since leaving in 1999. The moment you walk in the door you are greeted by warm and friendly staff, you're quickly shown to a table, and you're quickly brought warm chips, salsa and pico de gallo ( the salsa is surpurb!) 

I have had quite a variety of food from there over the last couple of months, and everything has been absolutely delicious!
