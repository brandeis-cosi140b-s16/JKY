Pretty no frills interior when you walk in, but a very helpful and friendly staff greets you. I'm also pretty sure The Fresh Prince of Bel Air was playing when I walked in. After ordering, it only took a few minutes to get everything out. The fries were dusted with this delicious seasoning and tasted absolutely fresh. I ordered the brioche burger I believe, and it was incredible. Everything tasted fresh and hand made. The bun had a coating of brown sugar which gave it a little sweetness, but not overpowering. 
The cheese, meat, egg and ingredients were paired extremely well, and unlike major chains and other burger places, it didn't feel overly greasy or sloppy- perfect. There's so many unique burgers on the menu, so when I'm in the area I'll definitely be back. 
My first experience overall was excellent, probably one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.
