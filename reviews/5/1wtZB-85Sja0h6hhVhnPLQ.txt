I am so excited to have found this place thanks to Yelp!
One of the greatest pleasures in life is being able to eat a torta ahogada. Its spicy, to the point that your face will feel tingly and you start sweating, yet you can't stop eating it. Filled with delicious pierna (pork leg) and covered in a super spicy but also super delicious sauce all inside a roll that is crusty outside but soft on the inside.
If you are not into self torture, as my kids describe my love for the torta ahogada, they have many other foods that are equally delicious.
Torta de Milanesa, burritos, enchiladas, caldos breakfast and many more things. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the place. The owners and all the employees are very friendly and kind. Also, skip the chips and salsa and order an empanada as an appetizer.
