Great salsas and bean dip.  If you like salsa be sure to ask for the roasted and hot options they have upon request.

The food was fresh and the service was great.  Very great price points and good happy hour.  

I think most of the comments and ratings were given during opening weekend when that has to be expected at a new restaurant.  Definitely give it a try.  Like the other review pointed out, this place is much much better than Tee Pee.
