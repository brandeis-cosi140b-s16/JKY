So far so good! Mario was an amazing bartender! Margaritas were on point! We were greated right away (by who we think might be the owners) they explained how everything works and Mario did the same for us as well. We only got the margaritas today along with the warm chips and salsa bar. Very friendly staff, good atmosphere... We will definitely be back and Mario has a lot to do with it!
