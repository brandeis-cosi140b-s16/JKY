This is a new favorite place! The bf and I came here last night with my little brother and sister at the coaxing of my little brother for some bomb a** Mexican food. And boy was he right. 

Upon pulling up and seeing the parking lot was packed I got a little worried we would have to wait for a table but...NOPE. We were happily greeted by two pretty hostesses and taken to our table for 4. Our server arrived promptly, took our drink order, and even gave us a little free cup of their homemade guacamole (delicious!!!) after our chips and salsa arrived. It seemed we had multiple people waiting on us and making sure our drinks & chips were full. I appreciated that, a lot. Pretty cool that they were all having each others backs and truly their focus was on the guests dining experience. 

We ordered different varieties of the usual Mexican flare so I won't go into details describing it all. Everything was delicious and we were all happy with our food. 

One thing that I thought was pretty awesome and makes me want to go back for my birthday....they had a few people with birthdays while we were there. They make a HUGE spectacle with singing to you, complete with a sombrero and a free shot of tequila down the hatch!  Oh my gosh it was sooooo loud but ya know I didn't mind it, even though it wasn't for anyone at our table it was still fun to watch and even other guests joined in on singing the happy birthday. Pretty awesome!!! 

Will definitely be back here :)
