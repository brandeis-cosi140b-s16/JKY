Omigod, the the food is absolutely fabulous, I eat til I hurt. 

You need a reservation! Period. 

But its totally worth it. I tried it last year and literally thought about it ALL YEAR, finally returned and just as awesome as before. Nothing like it, yes there is good Mexican food in AZ (and in SF, CA).... its just not like this place. 

Would be hurting all the time if this place was local to me!
