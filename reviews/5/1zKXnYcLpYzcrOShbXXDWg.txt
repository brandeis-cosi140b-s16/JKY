Not only is the food delicious and a good value, the customer service is excellent. I called ahead and asked if they would be able to bring it to my car since I was returning from the vet with my dog in the car. I did not want to leave her in the car on a hot Vegas afternoon. They were more than willing to do so. This will be a regular go to spot when I need a quick and yummy meal.
