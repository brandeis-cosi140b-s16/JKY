Everything I've had here has been amazing! They have something for everyone on their well-sized menu. To start, the chips and salsa are top notch. The salsa has flavors that I would get from my Nana's kitchen. But don't fill up on chips alone, the best is yet to come. My mom tried the grilled fish in a spicy yet creamy red sauce, the flavor was amazing. And she is a very tough critic to please. My favorite dish is Aguachile De Camar√≥n, do yourself a favor and ask for fresh avocado on top. This dish has such a perfect balance of flavor, heat, and acidity. It has that wonderful taste of the ocean without even a hint of fishiness. The addition of avocado is just a bonus and not necessary but it does add a silky almost sweet flair. I've eaten this elsewhere and it's always been lacking flavor in one area or another, but not here! It's so delicious that I find myself craving it the very next day and wanting go back. Paired with a Michelada, and you're set. It takes me back to eating Mariscos in Mexico overlooking the ocean. Just soo damn good!
