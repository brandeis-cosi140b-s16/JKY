Rubios fills that niche of I need to get my kid from after school care to the Tuesday swim lesson in one hour or less with food in her belly.  I've been exploring different options; at least I was until I found Rubio's.  The first thing you notice is the great service.  As I'm not a regular quite yet, I usually spend a few minutes studying the menu.  The staff at Rubio's has perfected the art of not starring me down during my minutes of quiet contemplation, which seems to be a lost art at other establishments.  After ordering, the staff brings you your order.  Casual dining with wait staff service.

Tip #1.  Sit near the salsa bar when with child.  It makes getting extra napkins easy.

The wait is short.  I've measured this based on my daughter's behavior after we sit down and she immediately says, "I'm hungry and I want my food NOW!!" Although saying, "We just ORDERDED!!" doesn't help; we've never gotten to the melt down stage.  The food has always made it with time to spare.

Tip #2. You can never have enough napkins.  So, save the Earth by just getting a few and more as needed.  You sat next to the salsa bar, right?

The food is good for the price and there are many options.  So you don't have to order the same thing each week.

Tip #3. Mixing the onion cilantro with one of the salsas is a good combination.

Comparatively speaking, I like that my daughter and I can eat something on the healthy side of the casual dining spectrum.  Usually, a bean and cheese burrito for her and fish tacos for me.  The quality seems appropriate for casual dining, although I could do with some more sauce in my tacos.

Tip #4. The churro makes a good incentive to finish the growing food for you and your kid, but you have to get a kids meal.

The Churro is the real bonus.  On Thursday, my daughter suggested that we go to Rubios.  Telling her that we go every Tuesday didn't seem to make a difference.  We take the churro to go and my daughter eats it on the way to swim.
