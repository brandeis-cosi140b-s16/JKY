Best latin food ever and really cheap. It's a hole in the wall kinda feel, barely speaks english servers but with the big and extensive menu you can never go wrong, tried over 25 dishes for less than $10 and each one is done good. You don't have to speak spanish just point the picture on the menu and you are set. Definitely worth a try and brought over 40 different friends not one said a bad thing.
