Now that I'm a vegan, there aren't quite as many eating choices for me when I'm on the go.  Fortunately,  Taco Bell has added vegan (no meat, no dairy) options. They call it Fresco style and I've had really tasty tacos and burritos with zero animal products.  I am happy to have this eating option if I'm on the road or just feel like a taco or a burrito.
