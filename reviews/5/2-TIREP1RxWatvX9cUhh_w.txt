The food here is absolutely amazing and very reasonably priced.  The nachos are a must have.  Don't be put off by the location and/or setting of the restaurant, this is the "hole in the wall" place.  Worth the drive and trying to find a parking spot.  Just be advised that they are not open on Monday.
