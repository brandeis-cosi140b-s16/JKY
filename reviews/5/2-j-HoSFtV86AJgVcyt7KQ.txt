The best kept secret in Henderson! Moderately expensive and definitely worth every penny you spend. If you are looking for typical Mexican food you have come to the wrong place. This is reasonably priced fare for a slightly more sophisticated palate. Sabor provides you with culinary masterpieces that create a whole new experience for your taste buds. I have been five times in two months and have thoroughly enjoyed each entree I've tried. While I have my favorites (the Chicken Poblano has an amazing flavor that you simply cannot forget)  my wife prefers the Blackened Arrachera. The food at Sabor creates more of a dining experience, one that you will cherish, rather than just satisfying your appetite. The chef, Scott, definitely knows what he is doing and the waiters and other staff are both efficient and friendly. Do yourself a favor, this is a dining experience that you will usually have to travel to a five star resort restaurant  and it's tucked  away in a quiet corner of Henderson.
