This is one of our absolute favorite places for Mexican food.  We generally take people here from out of town as one of our "go-to" places.  I can say the shrimp molcajete is one of my favorite dishes around.  I've yet to see it replicated at another restaurant.  It's a soupy, cheesy, bowl of shrimp goodness.  It comes served in a hot lava bowl that is still bubbly 15 -20 minutes after it's been served.  It is on the spicy side.  My husband and I always share a bowl and use the last of the tortillas to sop of every last drop.  Enjoy!
