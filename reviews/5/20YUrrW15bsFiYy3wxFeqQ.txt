A friend and I stumbled onto Gallo Blanco after shopping in the area and a woman in a store was raving about it. It was a Tuesday which meant all day happy hour! The restaurant itself had a cool vibe, very open and lively. We also checked out the Clarendon hotel it's attached to as well and it was very cool, we would definitely stay at the hotel.

As for food and drinks, we split the pitcher of sangria (fantastic) and the large guacamole ( great and on happy hour). My friend had the salad with chicken (can't remember the name) but it was unique and flavorful for a salad.  I had a shrimp and fish taco since they are street style. I preferred the shrimp, but both were great, and only $5 for both!! I will definitely be back and recommend it to anyone!
