Idk how this place doesn't have a higher rating than three stars. It isn't the best food I've ever had but I must say I find it to be satisfying and quite delicious. Since being exposed to this restaurant by a coworker I have eaten here like five times in the last month. It's fairly wholesome if you get the grilled options and it fills me for under ten bucks. 

The service is personable and the store is always in great shape. If you haven't already, you should try Rubio's!
