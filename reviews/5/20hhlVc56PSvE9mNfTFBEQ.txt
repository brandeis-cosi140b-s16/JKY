ASK & YOU SHALL RECIEVE!!

Another Roberto's that meets my standards when I ask for what I want!! After having a hard morning & my annoying body had to satisfy my empty stomach after some exercises at PT. My stomach wanted some stinky queso!

As we walked in... all the chairs were on top of the tables & we thought the place was closing or something but they were only keeping the place spotless which I LOVE. The lady invited us in when we were hesitant & said "don't worry its ok" as we really didn't want to step on her hard worked mopped floors. Our cashier took our order he just had one facial expression but i assume he means we'll as his ACTION showed it much better. He HOOKED IT UP!

5 ROLLED TACOS - my goto as I like it unhealthy & order it w/ no lettuce & extra cheddar & ENCHELADO that stinky one! The Bleu cheese of mexican cheese. They make their rolled tacos like the meat squished in more so it's juicer & there's that extra tortilla all crispy like chips at the ends! =]  also comes with a fountain drink for $6.50 

The mama was what made our day as we were dead tired she made us laugh... also my man was in a better mood when he saw the officer's facial expression (sitting across from me on another table) had a smirk when he caught me lickin my plate clean as my eyes came above the plate & made contact w/ his O_O *BLUSH* x2 forgot I wasn't at home.
