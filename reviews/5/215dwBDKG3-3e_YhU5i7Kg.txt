Vegan, gluten-free, spicy decadence. It's like True Food Kitchen meets Los Dos Molinos. I'm not sure Phoenix deserves a restaurant of this quality!! This is someplace you'd find on Malibu beach...not next to Carly's.

It's definitely geared toward the young, hip crowd, but my husband, 2 yr old and I got there right around 8, so the late crowd hadn't arrived yet.  Loved all the food and especially the dessert.  I had the no whey jose tacos...so yummy...and filling! the desert was a gluten free tiramisu cupcake with turtle ice cream and chocolate sauce...we almost all died and went to heaven!

The service needs improvement for sure.  There's one guy behind the bar doing order taking and serving food and altho' we were one of two groups in there, he was hard to find at times during our meal!  (it's spicy, so hey, pour me some more water bro!)  when he saw i was taking pics, i could have sworn his service got better...lol.  The food was sooooooo good though, that I just can't take away a star for the service.  I hope it gets better tho'!
