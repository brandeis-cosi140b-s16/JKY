Javier and company have it down to a science!  You just don't get bad food, service or a view here.  Sure the food is pricey but worth every penny!  I have enjoyed the original location for years but this location is the king!  Home made salsa. guacamole, and the most extensive menu in Vegas make choices difficult because everything is SO good!  I like the fact that Javier has also done a lot for the community.  I see the same workers there so it tells me he demands perfection but there's a reason they stay. I am sure they are tipped well, because I do and I have never had to wait or ask for anything there.  I love the food, and the way I am treated so it keeps me wanting to return again and again!
