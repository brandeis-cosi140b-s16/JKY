This place is the Oyster Bar inside Sunset Station. Alot of parking outside and inside garage.
Service was fast and got great service from Julian at the bar. Anthony is them man. 
Sit at the bar just say how you want it and magic happens. Food was great on this visit and portions were right on. 
Plus cocktails right there no wait.
Reasonable prices and great portions of food with great quality and taste.
Have fun and enjoy.
