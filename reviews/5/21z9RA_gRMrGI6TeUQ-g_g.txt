This may sound crazy, but Doce Taqueria is the best place to eat in the Southside.  Allow me to explain.

QUALITY:
First and foremost, the food taste and quality is top notch.  Even better, they provide both traditional Mexican style tacos (which is the way to go in my opinion), an Americanized version, and even a revolving vegan option, served on your choice of a flour or corn tortilla.  Because most of us have no idea what the hell half the traditional style Mexican ingredients are, let alone how to combine them in a tasty way, Doce Taqueria took the liberty of creating a simple menu with all the work done for you already.  Just pick 1, or several, and eat away!

PRICE:
For the nice quality of food you're getting, Doce Taqueria is very reasonably priced. Tacos are $3, a much better than expected side of black beans is $2, $5 Nachos, and a Mexican or throwback style glass bottle soda from the cooler is $2.

CONVENEINCE:
Doce is open for lunch until late into the night for some great grub after the bars close.  And when you eat here, don't expect to wait long for your food.  Even when they're busy it's not uncommon to receive your order in under 5min.  

ATMOSPHERE:
There is generally a very small staff of just 1 or 2 people, but everybody I have encountered has been very friendly and inviting.  All the seating is bar style, and the room is adorned with a multitude of decorations that gives it a pleasing southwest yet modern vibe.  Accompanying the decoration there is often Mexican style music (at a reasonable volume) coming over the speakers that helps tie the whole experience together.  

In conclusion, Doce Taqueria has great food that is served quickly, for a great price, is convenient at many hours of the day (and night), and is a cool little place to chill!
