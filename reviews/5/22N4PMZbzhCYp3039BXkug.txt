We visit here about once every few months. Love this place. Ambiance is fabulous. Hours are late. Service excellent. Our favorites are the chips and two salsas, the new mexican potstickers, and the machaca red chile chimichunga. We've deviated from getting this exact thing once in awhile but keep going back to this combo. LOVE IT! I, personally, cannot say enough about the potstickers. It's the strangest combination and it shouldn't work, but it DOES! I crave them. I crave them NOW. I keep trying to remember to order them after my entree, as they would be a perfect compliment after the machaca which can sometimes be very spicy. But, the sopapillas are also a perfect meal ender after spiciness. We once had an issue with the salsa being bitter, but found that they forgot to add sugar when mixing it. The owner/manager was right on top of it and comped it - so no complaint there, in the end. Service is always exceptional. We always just show up, without a reservation and never have an issue getting a table - even when it looks to be packed. I love this place! Wish we would go more often but it really is something special and we want to keep it that way. You're bat crazy (HA!) if you don't visit this place at least once. And, get those potstickers!!!
