This is the second time we have been here and everything from the cleanliness to the service was fantastic . Obviously the food was amazing too. We've had Tacos and quesadillas of a couple varieties and the polzole and menudo. Btw they serve menudo and pozole every day! I would recommend to everyone. I would even take an Andrew zimmern or Anthony bourdain if I ever got the opportunity
