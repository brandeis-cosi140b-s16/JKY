After finally ridding myself of the heartburn that I've had for the last 2 days, I decided to venture off on another food adventure to a place called "Abuela's tacos". I was surprised to see an older female at the stove tending to whatever was in the pot. Another woman appeared and took my order. She was very pleasant and informative when I asked her what they put in the tacos. The first thing she said was that the tacos are not spicy and they don't put sauce in them.  What a relief ! !! Anywho, I got the number one which is your choice of any two tacos, plus a side of rice and beans, and a drink.  This meal only set me back 7 dollars. The corn tortillas are home made and they are the best tortillas you will ever eat. I got a fish taco and a taco de asada.  After picking off the cilantro, I dug in. Both tacos were delicious!  The fish and asada were perfectly seasoned(not salty), the rice was not soggy, and the beans were so fresh. I checked in on Yelp so that I could get a free churro with my combo meal. My only complaint is that they don't make their own juices. If you want authentic Mexican food, go to Abuela's Tacos. I promise you won't be disappointed. The food is just like how grandma used to make it. Not my grandma, but somebody's grandma
