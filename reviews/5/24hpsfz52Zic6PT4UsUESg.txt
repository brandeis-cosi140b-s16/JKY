Hands down to this place! I ended up by coincidence just yelping a place to eat for lunch in my way to a meeting in Phoenix. 5 stars sounded good and 5 stars it was. I had the RED super burro for I was told by the server the green salsa is their spicier one. Unfortunately I have to avoid too spicy food. Wow, what a delicious choice. Flavor, size, and look was amazing. Highly recommended. Lucky those who live around this little Mexican restaurant. Beware it is the ultimate hole in the wall, don't let it fool you!
