My favorite New Mexican Restaurant has always been Los Dos Molinos in Mesa, which I still like a lot.  However, since I live in Chandler and this restaurant is only 2 miles from my house, it has become our new favorite.  We love the fresh "help yourself" salsa bar which has some of the best and most flavorful sauces I have ever tasted.  The food portions are very large, so we have started ordering off of the a la cart menu.  Everything seems to be made from scratch, and if you love tacos - be sure and try their machaca beef taco or their shredded chicken taco.   This location is very, very clean and you can tell management really cares about you as a customer.
