If Ranch Market is not your thing-- then you are missing out on some really great things.  

1.  Chips  (as in chips and salsa)-- they make their own tortilla chips that are only 99cents for a bag.  I brought them to a work party and everyone liked me more than the day before.

2. Birthday cakes for kiddies--- wow- talk about a frickin' cool Dora the Explorer cake, or a Spongebob cake-- it put Costco and Aunt Cindy to shame.

3.  Meat-- this meat case is LOADED, even if you don't want to buy fresh meat, just go there to look at it. 

4.  The affordabiltiy-- C&H Sugar was $1.19 at Ranch Market and $2.99 at any other grocery (non sale priced).  

It's like a party in this place, the last time I was there was right before the holidays and I found myself just having a good ol' time grabbing the chips for a work party.  I even stopped by the jewelry counter and contemplated purchasing a 3 inch gold cross, but decided against it.  :o)
