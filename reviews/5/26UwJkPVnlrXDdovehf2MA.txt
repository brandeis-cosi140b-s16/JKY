We love this place! Everything on the menu is great! The homemade guacamole and pico de  gallo  are delicious. I particularly love the shrimp enchiladas in red sauce. Their presentation of the food is also very nice and well thought out. The young waiter and waitress are very attentive and personable. And the prices are very reasonable.
