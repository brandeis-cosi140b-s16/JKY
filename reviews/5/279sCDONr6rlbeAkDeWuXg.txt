Bottom Line: Manuel's has the best chips and salsa.  Compare to any Mexican food in the Phoenix area and you will find a unique slightly sweet, yet spicy and perfectly textured salsa.  They have been making it for years and never faltered.

Beyond the salsa, the fejitas ("for one" is enough to split, at least for us), the green corn tamale and the chimis are all top notch.  I would recommend any of these without hesitation.  Also, try the spinach queso and ask for the flour chips (instead of standard corn), they add a special element to the dish that I've never found anywhere else.

Recommendation: Ask for Luis, he's usually serving in the bar and will add a personal touch to the service.  We always feel welcome when we find him there and even plan to go when we figure he's working!
