In the 7 years since I moved from my home of Los Angeles I have NEVER found good mexican good.  The east coast just doesn't bring it the way I hoped.

Enter Las Margaritas! It's like being home again with authentic hole in the wall mexican joints that are as easy to find as a Subway in Southern California.  

We eat here now about 1-2 times a week and love it every single time.  

I'm happy we stumbled into this unassuming little place as it makes Charlotte feel even more like home.
