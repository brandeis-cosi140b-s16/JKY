I like to consider myself a Mexican food connoisseur, and Javier's ranks at the top of my list. Being born and raised in Las Vegas, I have checked out nearly every Mexican spot in town. The chips and salsa here are second to none. I have yet to try the guacamole, but based on the little side that comes with the dishes it is incredible. 

The carnitas are the best I've had. Ever. Anywhere. It is a must try. The Enchiladas poblanas are incredible. I am not generally a big fan of mole sauce, but this one hits the spot. The chicken fajitas are amazing too. I've had a number of other dishes as well (seafood enchiladas, chile verde..) all of which are well above average, but those 3 dishes are my favorite. I'm yet to try dessert because there's never any room left by the end of my meal, but I'm sure those are amazing too.

You're going to pay more than the average Mexican joint, with most entrees being around $25, but you get what you pay for. One last thing, the atmosphere here is great. Decor is unique, the booths are large and comfortable.
