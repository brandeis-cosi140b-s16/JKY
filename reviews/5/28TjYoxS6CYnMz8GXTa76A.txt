Chipotle model, but food is consistently better for the same price. You choose a burrito, tacos, or some other main dish, then choose your meat and toppings. My wife and I had pastor; mine had habanero salsa and hers had salsa verde. Both were phenomenal. Nice attention to small details, too: the tortillas are warm and nicely browned, there are lots of fresh seasonings in the toppings, etc. Help was friendly. It's a great addition to the North Side. We'll be back.
