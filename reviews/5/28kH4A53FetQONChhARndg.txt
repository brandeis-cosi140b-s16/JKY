We went looking for the great dives in VEGAS. Although this is not a dive, its in a divie  neighborhood and we took a cab from the strip it was 60 dollars both ways, but what the heck the baggage guy at Flamingo sent us here.  Dishes around 11 to 14 dollars that were the same size as the meals we had last night at Ruth Chris for about 1/3 of the price.  The waitress did not speak much english but the menu is in english so we pointed.  What I really want to tell is the FRIED ICE CREAM DESERT IS supper delicio  delicous special  amazing  incredible...great night and the place is super packed and has a juke box to play a bunch of music we could not understand, but still fun.
