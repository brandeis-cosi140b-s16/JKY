Everything was great! The server, Daniel, was one of the best servers I've ever had at any restaurant. He was friendly, passionate, and knowledgable. He seems to know everything about each dish. All the employees we met were nice and we will request Daniel in the future.

As for the food, huge portions that are delicious. We got the jalape√±os with shrimp and chorizo as well as a four item combo. The four item combo was massive. Had to box up half of it. My dad got the fried fish and they let him try multiple sauces. One of the sauces had strawberry in it and was the only thing I didn't like that I tried. The fish was great though and the garlic sauce was amazing if you're a garlic lover.

We wanted to try desert (they have fried ice cream) but got too full. We will be back!
