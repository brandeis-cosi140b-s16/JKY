Really getting to love this place. I have been here about 6 times now. So it is time for a review.
Good location, because, it is close to my house. Great food, very fresh and I love the Fish Tacos. I love that they are not breaded.  The veg is fresh and the sauses are really good. all sorts of differant kinds... You can have as much as you like as well.
 Weather you eat in there or take it to go,it is fresh , fine and of course oh so good.
 Another thing if you join the club on line you great lots of good coupons as well.
