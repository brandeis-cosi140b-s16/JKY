I wasn't sure what to expect with some of the negative reviews I read but my actual experience was that it was the perfect breakfast.  Good atmosphere with a view overlooking the civic center plaza. The food was delicious. We had the huevos rancheros and torrijas (french toast).  We shared each others plate since we both enjoyed both dishes.  I will want to come back for lunch or dinner.
