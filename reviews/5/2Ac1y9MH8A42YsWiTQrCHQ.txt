The best Mexican food in the country as far as I'm concerned..homemade tortillas . We had the Arrachera Estilo Sonora.. a great taste of everything including then best skirt steak ever prepared. The refried beans to die for, guacamole and salsa incredible.. The cucumber margaritas are amazing and Arturo is bartender extraordinaire.. Loved it and can't recommend it enough!!!
