We were tight on time so we stopped here for a late lunch after stumbling along Rt 88 for several hours.

We sat on the patio. A very vibrant lunch crowd.  We were greeted immediately and drinks came quickly. Order was taken by a very polite, young man.  Our 3 orders of Diablo Enchiladas arrived. Excellent!

A very nice oasis on a dusty trail. Being from NH, we don't get the greatest of Mexican cuisine. This was very good and memorable!
