Went here on a craving for good Mexican food, and I managed to convince my sister to give a new establishment a try - one I bookmarked from others' reviews. 
Have to admit that the people that gave this place 4 or more stars were right... This place is pretty good. 
Going in, we were greeted right away from the server/cashier/bus person. Friendly guy that made us feel welcome and didn't rush us to order. Even though we ordered our food to go, he checked up on us to see if we needed anything else while we waited. Towards the end, the chef came out and talked to us with him, promoting their Happy Hour from 5-6PM on Fridays... Mariachi band and all! Still didn't feel pressured, so it's impressive the way they're able to connect to their patrons that way. 
Honestly, if I didn't have plans tonight, I would totally hit that place back up! 
Back to the food... 
It was awesome! I had the Cilantro Steak Fries and my sister had the Carne Asada Burrito, and we had to share 'cause it was a huge portion on both. I actually didn't have the other half of my sister's burrito, and I couldn't finish my fries. Awesome salsas, and fresh avocado. The fries were definitely steak fries, and was loaded with cheese. They definitely don't skimp on ingredients, so everything was proportional.
