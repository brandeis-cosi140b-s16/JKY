I have been here twice and I have loved it both times! The decor is super cool, the staff are super friendly and the drinks are delish! My fav. Is the Mexican Trail Mix Salad sooo yummy and the Brussel sprout nacho thing is out of this world crazy but ultra delicious- you have to try it! 

Parking is convenient! Will be going back soon!
