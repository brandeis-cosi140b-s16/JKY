I was surprised to read the not so complimented reviews for this place. My husband and I never heard about the place when we moved near the Tolleson area, but decided to try it out when we were driving by it. Granted, I was extremely hungry from the move which the thought came to my mind on why the food was so good. My husband and I decided to go back for another try. The food was still AMAZING! The sauces have a great flavor along with the meats. Especially the sweet pork. The price could be a little less, but it's so good that I will continue to go back. I suggest for you to try it if you are in the area.
