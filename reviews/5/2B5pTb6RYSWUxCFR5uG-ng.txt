Ok, ok, ok... so Ben is pretty much my best friend and I have worked for him at the Clarendon for a good portion of my life, but his past restaurants have definitely been hit-and-miss (to say the very least). C4 had a good thing going with the unique flair, but honest-to-god, Clarendon Kitchen ROCKS.

I will say this, too. When visiting, another friend asked Ben where we would eat when I was here. I'm so brutal on him and his work that he told the other person that he'd rather keep his soul intact than let me tear another of his restaurants apart. True story.

C4 was imaginative. Camus was a pretty scam. Clarendon Kitchen really does freaking rock. The chimichanga was intense, the guacamole incredible, and the chips nice and fresh. The copious margarita consumption and subsequent heartburn are honest testaments to the truthfulness of their recipe.

Lalo's art is totally at home here, too. 

Love, love, love.
