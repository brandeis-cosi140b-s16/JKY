My boyfriend and I come here frequently since we live less than a 1/4 mile away. We always sit in the bar area/at the bar. Bri seems to always serve us and she is FANTASTIC. She is always helpful, sweet, on point and gives OUTSTANDING service. We have both worked in the service industry for YEARS so we know great service when we receive it. The food is always delicious and fast. We are always impressed and satisfied when we leave.
