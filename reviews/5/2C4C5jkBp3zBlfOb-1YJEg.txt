Holy Guacamole!  Best tacos in Vegas!  Now I've eaten Mexican food all over town.  From Roberto's to the "high end" spots.  Hands down this tiny little spot tastes like homemade Mexican food!  

We stopped in for a "snack" so Cesar Q and I each ordered 2 tacos.  For me, I had a fish taco and a carnitas (pork) taco.  Both were incredible and I honestly can't say which one I liked better!  The fish taco was so good and huge too!  It was dressed with fresh pico style salsa and a "chipotlesque" sauce. I added some of there fresh green sauce from the salsa cart for added spice.  The carnitas taco was incredible!  It was dresses with guacamole and fresh chopped onion and cilantro.  I added more of the spicy green sauce and ol√®!  The guac was fresh and great!  

I am sold on this place.  The hubs and I are considering an evening run to this little gem.  Prices are beyond reasonable.  They offer everything you can imagine!  Even tongue!  No, not an option for me but I am sure my dad would enjoy!

It's a guarantee we will hit this spot up again and again.  You can't beat the prices and the service is great.  The man who cooked and served us was friendly and genuine.

This tiny spot doesn't have much seating but that doesn't matter.  There was seating for 4 and a few tables for 2.  The location couldn't be any better as its on the SW corner of Sahara and Ft. Apache just passed the gas station.

We need more restaurants like this in Las Vegas!  Family run and quality ingredients with reasonable prices!
