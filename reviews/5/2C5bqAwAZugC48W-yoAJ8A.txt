I don't understand the poor reviews.   I've been here 4 times now and everything I've had was good.  The singing thing is goofy and it looks like some of the staff enjoy it and some dont...but it has zero impact on my dining experience. 

I've had a salad, a burrito, nachos and enchiladas. ..each was good and plenty of food.  The restaurant is clean and I love that they have a wide selection of drinks you can refill yourself. 

Any adjustments to my food were handled perfectly by the line staff,  just had to ask.

I'm sitting here right now at lunch rush on a Friday and the line is moving just fine.  

I wonder sometimes if people have ridiculous expectations for a buffet style eatery.
