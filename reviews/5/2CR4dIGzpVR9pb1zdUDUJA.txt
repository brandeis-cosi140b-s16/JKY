I have only been to this location so I can't review what the other location are like. I love this place. They are friendly, fast, and willing to make changes and substitutions. The price is good, higher than Taco Bell or Del Taco but the food is always much better. I love the carne asada fries and beef tacos. You get a lot of food for the price so that is a good thing.
