I came here from a friend's recommendation to try their Colitas de Pavo. Now I'm reaching out to all of you saying "Try it!" You will not be disappointed. 

Besides that, the restaurant is pretty clean. The only problem I had was the wait. I was standing at the cash register for quite some time before someone came to help me. 

Can't wait to come back for some more!
