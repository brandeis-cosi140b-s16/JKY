My favorite Madison mexican restaurant.  The decor is vibrant and traditional and the food is very authentic and colorful with lots of fresh veggies.  Great chips and salsa.  All-in-all, a nice fresh take on a cuisine that can get very predictable.  A little more expensive than say, Casa de Lara, but I always look forward to eating here. 5 stars.
