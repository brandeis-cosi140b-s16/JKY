Cafe Rio was a must stop for me when in Flagstaff - so having them close by now  makes me happy.  The food is super flavorful with some great combinations. True, building and training the staff at this location has been a little challenging - but everyone is nice.  Chile Roast Beef is my fave - but have tried and enjoyed most the meats.  Try substituting the salsa fresca instead of the pico - super fresh and flavorful. The queso is amazing too!
