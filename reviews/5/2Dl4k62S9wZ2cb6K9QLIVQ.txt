This place is really good. There isn't anything here on the menu that I didn't like.  My fav at this place is of course, the fajitas.  I mean, what Mexican restaurant wouldn't be good if their fajitas sucked??  Def not this one!!  I had the steak fajitas TWICE in my Vegas trip ( I mean, there are only so many meals you can have in your weekend trip to Vegas, right?).   

My only complaint is that the waiters could have checked up on us a little bit more...I had to run over to the cabinet area to fetch my own water (boo to that)...but otherwise this place is awesome.
