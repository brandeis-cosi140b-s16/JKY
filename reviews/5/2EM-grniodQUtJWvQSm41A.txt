I always call in my orders and they are always ready to go and on point. 

Staff is very friendly, salsa bar is always fresh. Even when I don't call in my orders there is never a very long wait time. 

Personally I have always been a fan of Faustos more than Roberto's  I find it to be more authentic and have better recipes. Some would say they are the same but I beg to differ.

Convenient location. Recommended
