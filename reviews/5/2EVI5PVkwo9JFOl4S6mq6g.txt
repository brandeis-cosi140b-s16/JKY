Yum, tasty and fresh. Great selection. If you like spice, they will give you spice. I joked that the salsa wasn't that spicy. Our waitress had them whip us up some, we didn't ask, she just did it. She brings it out and it was HOT, but so good. Everyone friendly, nice, helpful. We love it. And the nights we order ahead and pick up the food is just as good.
