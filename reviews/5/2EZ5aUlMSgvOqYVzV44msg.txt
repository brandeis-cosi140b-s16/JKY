Don't let the size of this place fool you.  The tacos are insanely good.  The use of fresh cuts of meat and the care in preparation make these the best tacos you will ever have.  I tried the carnitas and the el pastor.  They were so good I went back the next day and had the carne asada.  They are all great.  Make an effort to try this place you will not be disappointed
