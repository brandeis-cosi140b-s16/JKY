After the last couple of weeks and then the Street Food Throwdown... this needs updating... Jo has more than earned that extra star.

Mac n' Cheese, not usually something you will find me eating... until this. Not to take away from the base mac n' cheese which is tender, cheesy, gooey, and flavorful all by itself, but Jo has specials. The one I had included hatch green chiles and andouille sausage. Probably the best mac n' cheese I have *ever* tasted... add to that amazing creaminess a roasted meatiness and a deep spiciness?

Holy. Foodgasm. Batman.

Then, the throwdown! Food trucks in Vegas are just this side of gourmet already, so you hear often of various sandwiches, dogs, desserts and drinks... but what about frog's legs?

"Ribbit!" (Translation: Wowza! Frog's legs on a food truck?!)

They were a tad on the salty side which, in my opinion, would be the only reason she didn't win. I have to think it was an extremely tough decision (see my thoughts on the winner here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/lulus-on-the-move-las-vegas#hrid:iNMumhPDcmOmHIbcE_eRAg ) because Jo's frog's leg dish was meaty and tender, spiced just right (aside from aforementioned salt on some of them), breaded perfectly, and amazingly well executed.

Add to our shared meal a signature Sloppi Jo... Food truck heaven in little paper dishes.

Sloppi Jo's continues to prove, time after time, why they deserve to be part of Vegas' food truck royalty! Huzzah!
