I have avoided Taco Bell for years but was stuck with no other options in this neighborhood. I was shocked!

Great food!!! Great service!!! The Doritos Fiery Taco was FANTASTIC! This is the best Taco Bell I've been in literally in 20 years!!

Teresa was super friendly and the service workers in the back were friendly too. When I'm back in this neighborhood I'll definitely be back :-)
