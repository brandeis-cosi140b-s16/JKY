It has been only opened for about 3 months now and I have gone almost every week now. This place is amazing. 

I would consider myself a connoisseur of chips and salsa, and Chuy's currently ranks #1. They are so addicting. Im almost never have the appetite anymore once the food comes out. :D

A MUST GO
