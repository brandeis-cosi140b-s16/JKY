I drove by this place a ton of times, and we finally went in, and I was not disappointed!!! The food was great, I had the al pastor pork Big Burrito it was delicious not over cooked or overstuffed with fixings, the owner was super helpful. My girlfriend had the Carne asada taco and a grilled chicken taco. We also had a side of rice and beans. Chips and their specialty salsas. All for less then twenty bucks!!! very filling great price. I was diggin the decor, simple but cool loved the pictures on the wall!!! A great experiance I will definately be a return customer. I highly reccomend the Jalapeno Ranch Sauce...yup I said Jalapeno Ranch Sauce...delicious abd they are not stingey with the sauces and salsas!!! The beans and rice were delicious definately a winner!!! If you are looking for a great meal and a great deal stop in, fresh ingredients and a great price!!
