as a proud native northern new mexican, i have to admit, this place gives MOST santa fe and albq traditional new mexican restaurants a run for it's money.  the wait can be a bit long, but the food and service is delightfully spicy.  fun atmosphere and great food.  if you dont like spicy hot, this is not the place for you.  definitely a favorite for me and my family (who still live back home) since i moved here over 6 years ago.
