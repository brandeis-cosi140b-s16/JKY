I mean, it's Taco Bell!!!! All Taco Bells are great and this location is not the exception. Fast, always a prompt service, amazing customer service and awesome associates. This is by far my favorite Taco Bell in all of North LV. It's never too crowded and its in a great location- got a Walmart Neighborhood market and a 7 eleven across the street, as well as a post office and an Albertson's in the upcoming corner.!!!!!!!! 10 star review!!!!
