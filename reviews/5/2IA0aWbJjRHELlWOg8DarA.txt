Our server, Mike, made an excellent recommendation, and  I highly recommend 'Carne Machaca Dinner' which is served with their home made flour tortillas - outstanding!  We nearly licked the plate after finishing the flan; some of the best ever. Friendly service, welcoming atmosphere. Family-friendly too. We'll be back, and hope to take advantage of their happy hour specials!
