Irma's is one of those rare places where I not only go for the delicious food but because I want to support the awesome people who make it! Very friendly customer service and the food portions are extremely generous for the pricing. I'll continue to come here for the breakfast burrito, which is the best I've had in the Valley. Everything is cooked to order and comes out piping hot!

I love that Irma is always making suggestions about adding ingredients to a dish or offering samples of new items. It keeps things interesting and I've never had a bad tasting dish here. Hope they keep getting business and stick around for a long time!

Just FYI - Seating space is small, so parties of 5 or more may have to split up. Max table size is 4 people from what I've seen.
