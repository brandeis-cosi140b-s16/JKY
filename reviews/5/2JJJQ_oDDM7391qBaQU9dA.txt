I'm actually responding to a previous post about parking in the area.  If you read through reviews of America's Taco Shop, you note that not only is the food AMAZING but parking is difficult.  America's Taco Shop is within their right to have cars parked illegally in their lot towed so that their paying customers have access to their business.  And the author of that post is inaccurate on several points.  Monster Towing and Charity Towing are two completely separate companies.   In addition, the lot is clearly marked at no less than six places around the lot.  The owners have at some point tried to block the lot, but people such as Karen ignore this and move structures to suit their needs.  Charity did not tow 15 cars that day as she suggests, but the only ones who complain are those who did something wrong and don't want the consequences.  And if you noticed the lot  you were parked in being "cleaned out in record time", wouldn't you investigate further at the time?  It's unfortunate that America's Taco Shop and Charity Towing customers have to deal with reviewers like her.
