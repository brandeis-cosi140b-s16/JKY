La tortotota is one of the few restaurants I know that serves authentic Mexican food it  is the only one I go to because is close to home and is affordable, I recognized the owner from Los Reyes de la torta ( tortas la presa) now on this new great adventure in my opinion this new restaurant is way better on so many levels, not to mention Los Reyes fell bellow my expectations since he left, I really like the attention he gives to everyone that goes in there, I  hope more people try this place, the food is great the service is awesome, but I really miss the tacos de canasta and the taco stand he used to put outside in the weekends
