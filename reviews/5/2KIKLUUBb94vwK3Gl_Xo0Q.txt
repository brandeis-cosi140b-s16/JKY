We have been customers of this restaurant since it opened years and years ago. The owners are locals who have stayed consistent with quality of food and service through all this time. 

The guacamole is fresh made as are hot chips that come to you right away. When you order the meals with shrimp in them, as my mother in law does regularly, there are loads of nice sized shrimp that taste like shrimp. I enjoy green corn tamales and the ones at Valle Luna see delicious. 

Families with little ones are welcome as they have clean high chairs as well as bumper seats. Your drinks are in generous size and the refills are free. If you want to substitute grilled vegetables for rice or beans-- no problem--  It is clean. Many of the staff have been there for eons. 

My sons grew up eating at this restaurant. Now in their mid thirties with families of their own, when they fly home for a visit we always try to "work in" a lunch or dinner. 

You can made a meal out if the generous sized appetizers. If you have room for dessert it is hard to pick between the soppellias and the fried ice cream. 

The owners offer special Internet coupons regularly and they offer discounts for seniors on certain days. I believe there are discounts for military families. You can call in for "take out food". Cinco de Mayo is a blast here but boy is it crowded.
