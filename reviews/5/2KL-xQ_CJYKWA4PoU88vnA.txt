First, it smells great just walking up to the restaurant. My sever tells me that it is the mesquite and pecan wood on the grill. It smells really good. 

Sitting on the patio and it is about 85 degrees so perfect day. The place is really busy - surprisingly so. Even though it is in the lobby of a small hotel it looks like most diners are local.

I had the carna asada burrito and it was excellent.  The meat was really flavorful and tasty. The avocado gave it nice texture. It was just good. 

They served two sauces - a green tomatillo sauce and a red chile sauce. Both were good. The heat from the red sauce, though, tended to hide the taste of the burrito which was unfortunate because the burrito was so good so I stuck mostly with the tomatillo sauce. 

One pet peeve - the serve soda in cans and not fountain. I don't know why restaurants do this. Fountain soda tastes so much fresher and is a better compliment to the food than tinny canned soda. 

I'm looking forward to conning back from either fish tacos or when it's cooler the tortilla soup.
