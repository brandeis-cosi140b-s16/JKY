Unexpected surprise in a strip mall! Set up like Chipotle but with more authentic flavors and options. Everything is super fresh and homemade. You can tell that the people who own the restaurant take a lot of pride in what they do. Best of all if you like spicy food...I mean really spicy! They have a few things there that will melt your face off.
