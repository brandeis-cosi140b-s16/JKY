My friend and I came here for an early dinner. They were very accommodating to us being short on time (45 minutes to eat) and also my gluten free diet. I was highly impressed with the service, the location, the taste and quality of the food, and the overall atmosphere. My friend ordered the steak fajitas and I ordered the tres tacos. Both were excellent! I hope I can come back here.
