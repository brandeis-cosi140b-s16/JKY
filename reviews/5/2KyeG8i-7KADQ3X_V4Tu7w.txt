Always extremely fresh.  I don't eat meat and they are always willing to prepare a vegan option whether it be a salad or veggie fajitas (on Wednesday fajita day).  Willing to work with you on portions too, ie  more beans, less rice etc.  My wife who is "particular" about chicken loves the hatch chile chicken.  Neighborhood gem.
