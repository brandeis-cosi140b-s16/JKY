I have always really enjoyed this restaurant. Three different Salsa's with fresh chips are brought out before you order. Everything tastes as if it is made from scratch. The service has always been great and the prices are good value. I've been to nearly every restaurant in Fountain Hills and this is the one I'm sticking with whenever I'm in that area.
