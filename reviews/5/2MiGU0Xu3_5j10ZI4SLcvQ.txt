This place is very good. It's very casual and relaxed. I would say the business is family and friends run which you can tell by how comfortable the employees. It should still be run slightly more professional. I have it 5 stars because the food was off the charts including Sopaipillas with a little honey were so spot on. I enjoy coming here and trying new things everytime. I had the burrito last time looking through the menu to see what I'm gonna get for dinner tonight. Oh also you have to try the fried ice cream which is made with rice crispies instead of corn flakes this really makes a great fried ice cream so much better. Definitely try this place out and I look forward to this place being around for many dinners to come.
