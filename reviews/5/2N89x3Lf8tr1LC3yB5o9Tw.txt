WOW!! What an amazing establishment.  I had the pleasure of sitting downstairs, as I entered through the kitchen.  This is my second time dining here, and since I entered this way the first time, I ended up doing it again. The martinis are absolutly amazing and the food is spectacular.  I had a dirty martini with amazing blue cheese stuffed olives, shaken violently, with that frothy layer of ice on top - outstanding.  Then I ordered up the enchiladas and tamales - which came with both red and green sauce.  Let me warn you the red sauce is NO JOKE! WHOA! Hot, but super yummy.  Everything was prepared perfectly and I could not be happier.  My date had the sliders and scallops - I don't think I have had a better prepared scallop.  The service is perfect, staff is happy, food is amazing and I will dine there again!
