Came to fat boy for the very first time like two days ago and the service was amazing I seriously give the lady a 5 star ! We didn't know exactly what to order and she recommended the most popular.. We had questions and she answered them really nicely and patiently! I was seriously satisfied.. The food is good as well I had chencho fries and they were delicious our hot wings were very good too.. I don't eat much and I ate everything because it was good.. The prices are fair and we will definitely be going back... My bf liked his food as well and we would like to try other things
