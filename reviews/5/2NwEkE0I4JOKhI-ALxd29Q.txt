Great food. If you want authentic food this is a good place to go to. Since the moment you get there until you leave you can sense the great customer service. Something the east side of the valley definitely needed. The food is simply amazing. I mean if you are gonna go and want to judge the food try some REAL food. Chicken, steak, shrimp. Don't go to have regular red enchiladas or steak fries and knock the place. The drinks are really good there's a particular one that sells a lot called "la michoacana" mango margarita with mexican chamoy and  tajun around the rim . They have two musicians not "mariachi" and they are amazing, courtesy of the restaurant all you have to do is tip the gentlemen if you want to. The ceviche is made at your table which isn't seen anywhere else. Check it out and you be the judge
