Love this Mexican restaurant! One of the best that is in the east valley. The people there are SO friendly. Always attentive. Their lunch specials are priced very well. They also serve really quick. When my husband and I get a chance, we always try to eat there. The atmosphere is so nice and unexpected too. In the middle of no where down power road between chandler heights and Riggs, it's a hidden gem.
