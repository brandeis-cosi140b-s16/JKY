I love Modern Margarita!  I stumbled upon this gem on High Street looking for a new place to eat.  I have two words: fish tacos.  I cant describe how good they are, you just have to try them.  Every day of the week they have different specials and the tostadas are also great from the appetizers menu.  Unfortunately they dont allow dogs and I would normally take away a star for that but that's how great this place is.  it's a little bit trendy at night so if you're into that then great.  If you prefer a more relaxed atmosphere I'd say come in the day time.
