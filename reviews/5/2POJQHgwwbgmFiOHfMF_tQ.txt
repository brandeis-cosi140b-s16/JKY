Stopped in while at the Arizona grand resort for lunch. Lucked out and was taco Tuesday ! Basic menu literally fish and tortillas. Awesome battered fish that you create into spectacular specimens of goodness via the condiment bar. We had the fish, chicken, and our favorite the shrimp. I'll be back! Great service as well.
