Food was awesome. The staff was great in taking our order amd getting our food out quickly. We had a group of 25 adults, teen and kids and we all enjoyed our food. As soon as we arrived our table was ready and when they took our order our food was out in a few minutes. Food was great and fresh. The complimentary chips are freaking good. Don't fill up on them because you will not be able to enjoy the food. The Bulgogi nachos rocked! The Kimchi Rice rocked! All the food that we ordered rocked. Sometimes going off the strip you find a great place to eat. Easy parking, no fussing with the casino and getting lost and for the cost of a buffet you can actually order a wide variety of their food and still have change!
