This is a really lovely little spot sandwiched between Harbor Freight and Food 4 Less. Don't let the name fool you, this isn't your average grab and go taqueria. Their dine-in meals are served on proper plates, not in styrofoam boxes, and are brought to you at your table. The free refills on the horchata were a welcome surprise. Take that, Roberto's!
Serrano's is a mom and pop establishment in it's 9th year, according to the friendly young man who served us. The place was impeccably clean and looked freshly painted, (including the restroom,) and the decor is fun with lots of personality.  The food isn't gourmet, but it's solid, freshly prepared, and not greasy and heavy like most taco shops. It tastes like a casual, home cooked meal. I had a small steak, a chile relleno, and a cheese enchilada. The chile had a bright fresh flavor, and the enchilada was tasty. The rice and beans weren't as out of this world as some of the reviews say, but definitely above average. They have a very nice salsa bar, but most of them were a bit watery and could have used a little more oomph. The charred red salsa was an exception! Yum!  (I'll be the first to admit that I'm spoiled by my roommate's fantastic Mexican home cooking, and my boyfriend's epic salsa, so the bar is set pretty high in my world. Haha!) We finished off our meal with an exceptionally good fried ice cream on the house. (Thanks, guys!) For food, I'd rate Serrano's at 4 stars. For the excellent service, friendliness, pride, and love these folks clearly put in to their establishment? A solid 5 and then some! I'll be back for sure!
