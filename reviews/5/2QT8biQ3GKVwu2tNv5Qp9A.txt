This place is fabulous!! Despite being kind of out in the open at the Luxor, it had great atmosphere. Rockin' mashups of great songs, comfortable seats and a good crowd. The food was outstanding!! Chips and salsa were perfectly crisp and you get 2 different kinds of salsa (smoky chipotle and verde) complimentary with any purchase. The server was very friendly and knowledgable. Margs were outstanding and nicely sized. Best chicken enchiladas I've ever had! (And I effing know my enchiladas!) Overall a great place for a relatively inexpensive but quality meal in Vegas.
