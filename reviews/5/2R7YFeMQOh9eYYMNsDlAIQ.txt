By Far, the best  Mexican Restaurant WEDDING
I live in Orange County California and love vegas,       
My husband and I had our reception here and it was the best thing we could have done!!     We arrived at 7pm, they had live music 2 singers interracting with my entire family, grandma, uncle, mom , kids..etc....     when the food was brought ... they had Baile Folklorico it was a great show, after that they had the mariachi......      we all had the best time. We even did the dollar dance and  the waiters were on top of it.....       THE FOOD  " DELICIOUS" we ordered     2 types of plates people could choose from .. .either     chicken or beef....        people are still talk about the food how delicious it was... the chicken had this sauce that ...   i cannot even explain.       The cake was set up nicely and we did a toast aswell...  they brought the cups ....         OMG it was the best time of my life               I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT      
Veronica was one of the waiters..... and she was GREAT! told me not to worry.... she would handle it.... and she sure did!
