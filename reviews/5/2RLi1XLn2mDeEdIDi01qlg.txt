This is the second time here within a month.  We were referred by a friend in the area.  We sometimes travel to have good eats!  This restaurant is in a cozy area that kind of resembles the beginnings of an Old Pasadena.  It was busy just like the last time.  There were a lot of staff.  Everyone of them, friendly.  Particularly Dulce and Walter.  We had five in the party, so we had a lot to order.  The food arrived promptly, was very tasty and eye pleasing like last time.  Check out my photos.  The atmosphere was lively and the restrooms clean and in order.  When I checked into Yelp there was an offer to purchase a coupon that would save $10.  I purchased it on my cell phone and Dulce redeemed it for this receipt all within 5 minutes!  Also what was cool is that the owner came around and talked to us and other patrons throughout our dinner experience.  
  We will definitely be back for more and tell a lot of friends!!
