I stop by here everytime I'm in Scottsdale. Guac is fantastic. I'm not a big chicken fan ( and it's always recommended to me) so the enchiladas and blackened shrimp are my go to. Atmosphere is nothing fancy, service has always been super friendly and fast. If only we could get rid of the styrofoam cups. I guess you could just order alcohol:)
