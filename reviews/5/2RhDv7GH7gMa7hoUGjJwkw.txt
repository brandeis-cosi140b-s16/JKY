This is my favorite place to come to when I am home sick. I love their flautas they are the best. Anytime I miss El Paso, TX I just come here to bring back the memories. Another great quality about this place is their staff, I've been here numerous of times and they are always so nice and joyful, and never have an attitude. They make it feel the way it is back home.
