Was introduced to this wonderful place soon after it moved to this location.  Great food!  Korean family style cooking (plates of great food brought to your table) Fusion Mexican entree's that combine great ingredients and flavors to provide spicy tasty Taco's, Burrito's and salsa's.  They have renovated the location, removing the space limiting booths and now boast more places to sit and eat this awesome food.
My only issue, they don't do a BiBimBap... Owner says, "everybody does that."  I wish... :-) Because they are close and I know theirs would be great. :-)
