This is the best Chipotle I've been to. The employees recognize you by face if you've only been in once before and their food always tastes fresh. Their cilantro-lime rice is something other Chipotles have recently been messing up on, but their rice is always nice and lime-y and the service is great, not to mention the place is always clean.
