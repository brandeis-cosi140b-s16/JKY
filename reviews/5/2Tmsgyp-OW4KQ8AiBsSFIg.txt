This place is awesome. Definitely go around back and sit in the patio. The atmosphere is great, especially on a warm night. The staff is friendly and the skinny margaritas are delicious. Go with pitchers.  I had Lupe's enchiladas which are really like huevos rancheros and I was not disappointed - the food is delicious. The price is right and it's authentic. Highly recommended.
