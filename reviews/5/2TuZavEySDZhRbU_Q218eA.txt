Correction, I went back again and the salsa is pretty good.   This place is  A LOT better than Raul and Theresa's.    Don't get me wrong, they are good too but this place is without a doubt the real place.    Check it out for yourself, real authentic.    I ordered the green chili burrito along with a cheese enchilada.........beans and rice are awesome as well.
