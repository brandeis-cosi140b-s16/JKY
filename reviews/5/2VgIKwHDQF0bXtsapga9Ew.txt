Ricardo's has some good food. I work from home and this is right around the corner from my house so I eat here about once a week. The enchilada sauce is not your typical enchilada sauce from the can. I don't know what it is but Ricardo's keeps me coming back! The staff is shy which doesn't bother me, and this place gets packed during lunchtime so beware!
