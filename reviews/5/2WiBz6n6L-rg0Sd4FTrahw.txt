My review is for the walk up T&T counter just across from the T&T restaurant.

We just had to get a huge slushy cup of goodness!  We happened to be in Vegas during the worst heat wave ever...  120 degree in the afternoon and still over 100 at midnight.  whew!!

So, I got the big 48oz boot filled with pina colada for $21 and he got the awesome option they call "Chongas."

It's 34oz of margarita with two 7oz bottles of beer placed upside down in the oversized maragarita glass.  This was definitely a crowd pleaser.  Everywhere we went people asked about his drink.  Even people who work and live in Vegas were shocked by it!

The best part though... the REALLY great part... is that you can keep coming back to the counter for refills!  So, if you're in Vegas for a few days you just cruise by the counter with you big a$$ cup.  Refills were only $6.50!!

what?!!  48oz for $6.50?!!

Seriously... definitely as good as it gets!
