I'm honestly not sure why anyone would have anything bad to say about this restaurant. I'm shocked at some of the negative reviews this place has! 

Anyway, my lady friend and I went to this Serrano's a few nights ago for a quiet night out and that's exactly what we got. Everyone on staff from the hostess to the busser was more than helpful: 

The hostess got us seated immediately and our server, Jason, was kind, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Even the busser, Miguel, was fantastic! He kept the chips and salsa flowing all night and even gave us some insight into the menu. 

The food was totally affordable and we had a fantastic overall experience. We will definitely be back!!!
