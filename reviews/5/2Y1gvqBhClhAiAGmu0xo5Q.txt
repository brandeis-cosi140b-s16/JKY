Food is authentic and flavors are awesome.  For appetizers we shared the Tamel and the chips and 4 cheese dip.  The tamel was so tasty and the house made chips were practically impossible to stop munching on.  Next I had the flautas de barbacoa and it was almost as good as eating dessert.  The meat was tender and flavorful and the flautas was crispy and crunchy.  Simply delectable.  My suggestion: ask for a side of cr√®me fraiche for dipping.  My BF had the local braised beef tongue which was also delicious from the few tastes that I had.  He was also very pleased. Sad that I wasn't able to order a margarita or a beer, but I will remember to bring my own booze next...and there will definitely be a next time.
