Came for dinner with my husband & parents because my mom wanted Mexican food. I checked Yelp, & we decided to give Mexico Lindo a try. The parking lot was empty when we arrived, & we weren't sure what to make of that.

But, the food here is excellent; it's very flavorful, & the dishes all had a distinct taste. We had the chicken mole, Alhambres (not sure, but it's a combo meat dish over peppers & onions), & Huaraches (it's like a tostada but instead of a tortilla base it's a corn cake type base. In other Mexican restaurants where I've had them, they were called sopes).

The salsas & guacamole they brought to the table were fresh & tasty. The chips were freshly fried & a tad greasy, but all in all, it was a great meal at a good price. We would come again. My dad said that he would come back just for the guacamole.

They are also a bakery, & their dinner was so good I'm tempted to go back just for bakery!
