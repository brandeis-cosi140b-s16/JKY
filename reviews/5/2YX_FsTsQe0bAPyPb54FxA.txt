Yummy home style food served in a very relaxed setting with warm & caring (not fake) service. Sorry all you chain loving, precooked, processed & canned food lovers this place is not for you. Very kid friendly with room to run & play outside underneath large trees with adjacent green belt next door. Not big or fancy, small menu limited to produce quality food done very well.
