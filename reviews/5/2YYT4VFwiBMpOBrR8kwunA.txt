I thought this was just going to be standard take out mexican, but it turned out to be pretty darn good. Went there for breakfast (served till 2pm on weekends, which was awesome), it was just what I needed. Had a huevos rancheros type special. It had a jalapeno sauce instead of ranchero sauce. It came with rice and beans. The portion was perfect and man was it tasty. Even the rice and beans were great. My mom had the acapulco omlette, which was also super good and a great sized portion. The staff was so friendly and the chef came out to talk to diners. The salsa bar had a great selection of fresh salsas. I really liked the flavorful avocado salsa. I was impressed! Everything was great, inexpensive, and great portions. I also really appreciated their use of real silverwhere, cups, and plates. No styrofoam unless you get it to go. That little extra really made me like this place even more. Great place to go if you find yourself in the stratosphere after a late night of partying!
