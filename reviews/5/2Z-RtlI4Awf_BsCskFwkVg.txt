AMAAAAAZING zing to everything they serve! Fresh margaritas, HOT food, not the kind that sits under the lights until the server is ready to serve  you. This food is FRESH! After living in East LA for 27 years I was doubtful I would ever find anything "authentic" Well, I was wrong! This far surpassed any expectations I had! 
I stayed at the Clarendon and it was just too hot to go venturing far. Lucky me!!! I just wish I could have packed up food to go and teased everyone on the plane. 
And this is not just about the food, the service was top notch, you could tell the staff was happy to see me. I wasn't just another check in the crowd. The table was well set, the serveware sparlking, the glasses spotless. Above and beyond is all I can say
Just such a cool place!!!
