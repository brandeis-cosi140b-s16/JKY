This is a great Chipotle. The staff is very friendly and courteous. Ive never had a bad experience here and the polite staff keep the place clean and they often pick up my tray for me and are always cleaning. Which I like. I love being able to sit at a clean table, even when they are busy. Kutos Chipotle!
