We went for dinner on a Saturday night.  We sat inside and we loved the environment.  The chips were thin and delicious and the green and (fire roasted) red salsas were both very good.  We had the Carne Asada and the chicken and steak Fajitas.  They were both fabulous along with the beans and rice.  We also had an on-tap IPA and the Flirtini, both of which were quite good.  The price was reasonable and the service was great.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant!
