I have two regrets: not coming to Tacos El Gordo until today.And finally coming to Tacos El Gordo. Why the latter, you ask? Because these tacos are dangerously craveable and I give myself a maximum of two days before I have a craving for tacos that can only be met by Tacos El Gordo.

I've been to Los Tacos next door and while I nearly lost my mind over their delicious tacos, I'm not really sure I can make a comparison between the two because they're two different kind of taco establishments. Tacos El Gordo is straight up street tacos-small and packed with amazing flavor. At only $2 each you're really getting your money's worth quality-wise.

I got the adobada (with pineapple) and carne asada tacos and while both were tasty, I think I prefer the carne asada because it was hands down the best carne asada I've ever had. The meat was SO tender and chopped perfectly so you didn't have these awkward bites with bit chunks of non-bite size meat hanging around. The adobada had great flavor and wasn't as spicy as I anticipated (however I pour hot sauce on everything, so my taste buds are primed for fire). I absolutely recommend getting it with the pineapple! It totally adds this unique flavor and they serve just enough with the taco to give it this perfect balance of sweet and savory-I've never had anything like it!

These are street tacos, so for the average overeating American, they are small, but I felt satisfied off of three, but out of pure greed could've eaten three more. The staff was nice and helpful and it's nice to be able to see your taco assembled from start to finish.

If you're worried about the neighborhood, don't be. I had the same experience as another viewer-the place was packed with families and it's very well lit. This place is definitely worth a visit, but beware, when your next taco craving strikes, you won't want to go anywhere else!
