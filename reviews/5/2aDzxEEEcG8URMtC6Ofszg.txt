Newly opened in Spinatos old location.  This is not typical Mexican food. I don't know what region it's from but it's definitely different - in a good way.  I lean vegetarian so chose the quesadillas stuffed with mashed potatoes and WOW they were good.  The menu looks very intriguing so I'll be back
 I love to support local family owned businesses so I've got my fingers crossed for these folks!
