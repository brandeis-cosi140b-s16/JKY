Best (casual) Mexican Restaurant in the Valley. 
Here are the highlights:
1. Salsa bar during the week 
2. On the weekends, the free chips and salsa are accompanied by an AMAZING warm bean dip (praying it's vegetarian... or that I remain ignorant).
3. The spinach enchiladas are so good, it's crazy. Fresh spinach, cheese and a delicious verde sause.
4. The staff is always friendly and efficient.
5. the horchada

The only complaint I have is that the restaurant is often filled with families and kids who are messy... but what can you do? It's cheap, friendly and incredibly tasty, so families would be foolish to pass it up. 

Salud!
