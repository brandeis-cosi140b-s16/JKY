I ate here with my mom because we were hungry and looking for something on mc85. I got a quesadilla with shredded beef and it was the biggest quesadilla I've ever seen. There was more meat than cheese and it was big enough that a fork and knife were required. I was really hungry when we got there and was feeling full after I finished the first slice. I also had a churro and it was the best.
