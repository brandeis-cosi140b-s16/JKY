Best breakfast in town. Carne Adovada is amazing, I could live off of the green chili potato, the rellenos are still my favorite.. Big, fat and strong mimosas (you know how a mimosa should be). You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

I recently tried the posole and bought another bowl to take home. 

It's just that good!
