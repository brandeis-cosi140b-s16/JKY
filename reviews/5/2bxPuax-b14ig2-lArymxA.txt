EXCELLENT TACOS!! My first vist, this place is friendly and the food was great. They even have a fountain outside that keeps the atmosphere under the tent cool. Good location next to a Coffee shop that has great coffee and the help speaks great english and doesn't get mad becuase you're white. Drive thru so yea I love this place already!!
