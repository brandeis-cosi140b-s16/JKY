The food is excellent! I had the spinach con queso enchiladas and my husband had the ground beef enchiladas with green sauce. Our kids had chicken strips and an open face cheese crisp. Happy hour 2-6 with $1 off beer. The service was fast but there was only one other table full at the time we went. We like this place for a change of our normal mexican restaurant. Try it out but get here early.
