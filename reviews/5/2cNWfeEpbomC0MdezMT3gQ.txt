Burrito Drive, I've been there once and loved it.  Its just off of Willy Street on Brearly, not the best location in the world and I fear it will get overlooked for that reason.  Regardless they're food is great.  Its not authentic Mexican, but it doesn't pretend to be - this is new Mexican food in all its glorious well combined tastiness.  I had a sweet potato burrito that was phenomenal.  They serve beer as well and have a nice little dining room.  You gotta check out Burrito Drive when you get a chance, maybe next time you're doing laundry since the laundromat is right next door.
