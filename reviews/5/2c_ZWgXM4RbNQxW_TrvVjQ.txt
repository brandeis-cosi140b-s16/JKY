Awesome meal, as usual, at PV Burger. The spouse had a Beach House "burger" with a portobello mushroom instead of beef with a side of the house made BBQ chips. It was so good, she said that she "didn't miss the beef." I had the Pulled Veggie with a side of seasoned fries. I have to say this had to be one of the tastiest and most satisfying vegetarian meals I've ever had. We've been to PVB several times before and love it. Tonight's meals were just another reason to come back and continue to eat our way through the menu.
