This place simply gets a 5 star in my book for their compassion and outstanding customer service! I was in there on my lunch having issues with my bank card and trying to hash out the situation with my bank over the phone. With my bank being uncooperative and me having to leave to go to the bank to actually pull out money to pay for my lunch, I was extremely frustrated. As I was walking out the staff stopped me and offered me my lunch for free simply because I was having so much trouble with my bank and they felt bad for me. That right there made my day and made me a fan of Manuel's. It's not many places that would take a loss on their end just to make things easier for the customer. And for that reason I will be coming back to this restaurant because of the over the top customer service! I would especially like to thank Jen, Kelly and Colin for being so amazing. I owe you guys!

PS the food was good too!! Especially the hot salsa.
