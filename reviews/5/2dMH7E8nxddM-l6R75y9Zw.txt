Maria's has recently limited their hours to a more normal schedule, which is quite a bummer for me because I tended to go there a little bit later. However, the adobada is still the absolute best meat option at any Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. And I love Mexican food!! Do yourself a favor next time you're up for Mexican food...
Step 1 - go to Maria's!
Step 2 - order tacos, a burrito, a torta, breakfast burrito, whatever...with adobada!!! I get the #5 combo that's on the wall (two tacos with rice and beans, substitute adobada for the meat).
Step 3 - sit down and prepare yourself for the most delicious meal of your life.
You're welcome.
