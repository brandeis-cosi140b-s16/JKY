If you blink, you may miss it but some of the sweetest finds are hidden! Once you find it...congratulations you have found the best Mexican food in Vegas! The decor is very rustic/sexy/sheik. Mexico meets Vegas! Great place to unwind, grab some amazing food and try a few tequilas (they have 100 choices). I came from Texas where you have authentic Mexican food served everywhere but here in Vegas, there was nada till now. It started with the chips and salsa. I know that's small stuff but you can see and taste the attention to detail right from the start. Beware of the red salsa, I'm just saying. They also serve fresh made juices! Such a unique and wonderful addition to an already amazing menu. Taquitos, queso fundido and shrimp tacos are the tasty dishes I tried. If I wasn't as full as I was I wouldn't have stopped there. How could I forget table side guacamole! I'm dying to go back and try this shrimp with cilantro cream sauce dish that made my mouth water. They use all non-GMO products and hormone free meat which I so appreciate since my new obsession with food documentaries on netflix. Their menu is delightful for offering such healthy options. I'm so impressed by this place that I am already anticipating my next visit. Please go try El Dorado Cantina Yelpers, it's a foodie's paradise!
