I learned of this place through a hispanic friend. We went here twice and tried 4 different dishes. They were all very good. The service was attentive. The food is not the usual Mexican style and includes a good number of seafood dishes. We went before 9/21/11. The review by Gloria K saying they are closed saddens us. BUT THEY ARE (WERE) EXCELLENT !
