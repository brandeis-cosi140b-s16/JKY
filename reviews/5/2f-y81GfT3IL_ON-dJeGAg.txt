Very rarely do I ever [EVER] make multiple stops at a place within a span of 5 days.  The first drink we had on vacation was here, along with Chips and guaca-Holy-mole.  Seriously though, The guacamole was some of the best I have ever had.  We had the Blue Lemonade margaritas after being able to sample different ones, which was an amazing choice.  On our second visit, we recommended it to other tourists and they were pleased as well.

This place set the bar for Margaritas in Vegas.  No other place touched them.  It was almost unfair to the others we had since we had it here first...

...and for multiple days!!!



Cheers
