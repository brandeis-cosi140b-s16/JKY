I don't know why I haven't Yelped about Baja Loco.

I've been eating at this restaurant since it was Chuy's, at different locations starting in 2000. They got into trouble I guess, and then disbanded and now a few of the old Chuy's are different restaurants.

Baja Loco on 32nd and Camelback is the absolute best. My boyfriend and I eat here an awful lot. I think one week we went 4 times! It's a neat kind of restaurant as far as decor goes, and they've usually got a few different games playing on the number of TV's they have. 

Why are we repeat customers?

In short, whatever they grill their seafood in is highly addictive.

The food is insanely cheap. On average, we usually spend $20 total (plus tip) with two meals and two alcoholic drinks. Make sure the manager pours your drinks, he's the best there. But regardless of who pours, they are not by any means light-handed. My favorite drinks are their Baja on the Rocks (which is basically a Mai Thai) or a Mudslide. I got it with I think smores vodka once and it was sooo good. They carry an assortment of beers too, and their house lemonade (non-alcoholic) is nice as well.

The food is awesome. My boyfriend almost always orders the whitefish skewers. Last time, he ordered the chicken wings. I've probably eaten everything there. The tri-tip sandwich is one of my favorites, followed by the shrimp fajitas.

My family eats there sometimes, though nowhere near as often as we do. My brother swears by the veggie burrito, which is probably bigger than his vegetarian arms.

Now that I've moved out of Arizona and into a place that seriously lacks any kind of dining, I really miss Baja Loco.
