Like every Friday, I went to Chipotle with my coworkers. We love it so much, we order online at 8 am as soon as we get to the office. My burrito bowl's ALWAYS perfect but  today it had beans and I have an extreme aversion to beans so I had to go back and tell them to prepare a different one... 

Well, I hadn't even arrived to the to go window when the manager saw me waiting with my burrito bowl on my hands and asked if everything was OK. I explained what happened and gave him the receipt for my online order and he, himself, got in the kitchen and made me a new burrito bowl! This guy rocks! He always takes really good care of me and he stops by our table and asks if everything's ok. No need to do this at a "fast food" restaurant but he delivers and this is why I keep coming every single week. 

The food's great and so are the prices but the customer service at this location's outstanding, specially at noon when the restaurant's packed, he still found the time fix me another bowl.

I'm telling you, he rocks!!

See you next Friday!!
