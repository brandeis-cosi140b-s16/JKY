Who doesn't love Chipotle?!  I am a creature of habit, i like the same thing when i come here, rice, beans and steak. We both can eat for under $20, that's with us sharing a large drink and chips & salsa.  I would love it if they had a drive-thru for the times one of us is pickin up. 
There is generally a long line, but it moves pretty fast.  We go to this location fairly often and I notice that the staff seems to turn over a lot, just mentioning that. I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Food is consistently good.
 I have read some reviews where they say their burrito was made wrong, how is that possible when you are standing right there watching them make it right in front of you. They would have fixed it for you. They are always generous with their portions too.  
We will be back :)
