Our food was delicious! We started with the tortilla chips (which were warm, just made) and salsa, which was a wonderful thing to munch on while we were waiting for our appetizer to come out. For the appetizer, we had the cheese wedges, which were the perfect blend of crunch and spice. The breading was delicious, and provided a great shell for the melty pepperjack cheese inside. Silvi's Big Burrito (I think that's what it was called) was SO delicious, and just as good the next day! My mom had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which she raved about. For dessert we tried the Choco-Flan, which was the perfect end to the meal. All of the food was very fresh and tasted home-cooked. I highly recommend Silvi's Southside Kitchen and will make it a point to eat there every time I am in town!
