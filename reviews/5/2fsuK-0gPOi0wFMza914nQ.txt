Wow, this place impressed me.

I LOVE good Mexican food, and unfortunately for us 'Burghers, we are at a terrible shortage of excellent Mexican options here in the Steel City. However, after a visit to El Toro Loco, my opinion has changed.

I've been meaning to try this place out for a while, frequently passing it and going to Patron instead. Sorry Patron, you've been kicked to the curb.

So the reason I went here was because I heard they had a Taco Tuesday special all day, as well as Thursday. 99 cent Beef soft or hard.

The tacos were filled with perfectly seasoned ground beef, and topped with fresh lettuce, diced tomato and shredded Americanized cheddar. I would have preferred a Mexican style cheese but I'll take an authentic taco shell over cheese any day.

The reason I like this place better than patron is simple - they actually season their meat. That, and the complimentary chips were hot and fresh, and the salsa was spicy, home made , and had lots of cilantro. 

Soft drinks were super sized and had free refills. (Coke products). TV scenario is excellent at the bar and the specials are ridiculous every day. See posted pictures.

Awesome tacos, great service, cheap, and worth a stop. Will definitely bring friends here to watch a penguins game.
