if you like tequila then go here. what a great selection!   chips great. salsa  really nice. tomatillo sauce outstanding. the very best tortilla soup I have ever had. delish. 
fish tacos were really good.  good feel in the restaurant and the servers / bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful. check it out.
