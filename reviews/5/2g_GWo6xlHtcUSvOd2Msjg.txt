Get beyond the super high hipster factor and treat yourself to Joyride. The food is varied and delicious, the prices are just right. Full of flavor, my carne asada and chicken street tacos were awesome- loaded with meat and veggies. The "white magic" sauce was super tasty too. There's a great kids menu to order from if you bring the family. There's plenty of seating, even for larger groups- and the decor is as you'd expect from Upward Projects (Postino, Windsor, Federal Pizza). The staff is great, they seem to play more of a "zoned" game wherein many servers will cover each other's tables to ensure the customer is being treated right. Don't worry about empty drink glasses or missing food, that didn't happen for us at Joyride. The place was busy, don't let a small wait time scare you away. There's competition at the other end of Gilbert road (So Cal Fish Taco Company) but I'd have to give Joyride the 5th star when comparing. If you're craving good mexican food (tacos, burritos, ensaladas, etc.) do yourself a favor and head over to Joyride. Sign up for their email list and you'll get offers for free food, etc. We didn't order drinks but they offer a full bar and plety of room to huddle around it and enjoy your cervezas or margaritas.
