Pedros is a staple in the community.  A great place where you can bring family and friends to have a really good time.  The food is all made fresh, which is great.  For the price and the selection, you really can't beat it.

One other thing to mention...  Have had a group event at Pedro's - and also a couple events catered.  The catering menu is great - and they make it really easy.
