Been to Angelina's once since they've opened... I was more than pleasantly surprised..! I ordered Fry Bread and it was pipping hot and ready to eat in less than 4 minutes, I could not have asked for a better Fry Bread... it was exactly what I had hoped for, amazingly fresh and there was enough that I could have split it with my lady and been satisfied...instead I ate it all and was stuffed.._  I also had a large Horchata de Arroz (Rice Drink) that was made from scratch (not a mix) that was extraordinarily good, so good I went for a refill and to my surprise refills of Horchata's are gratis..! I will be going back very soon... btw, this Joint is a no frills kinda place, not fancy, and at the same time very clean...which makes it my kinda Joint...
