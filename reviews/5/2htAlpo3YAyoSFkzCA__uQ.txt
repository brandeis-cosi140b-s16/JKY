Came here for the first time today with a co-worker. Margaritas is so great!  For a $7.25 lunch plate, I got 2 shrimp enchiladas, rice, beans and THE DRINK INCLUDED! Thank you for not charging me $2 for something that costs you $0.14!! The food was delicious, and I'm typically not a fan of green sauce. But I loved Margarita's sauce.
 
For such great prices, you'd expect this place to be a little divey or "Mom and Pop"-ish (I.e. like Mango's Mexican restaurant that's just a few doors down). But this place is totally posh and hip. Really cool, modern art on the walls. Clean simple lines in the decor, chic black and white color scheme. I loved it! Can't wait to come in for a date night and hit that bar! :)
