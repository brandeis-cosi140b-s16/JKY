I first discovered Taqueria El Chino while at its original location in Hermosillo, Mexico and was ecstatic to see that they had expanded into the US.  Its the only place I have found to get famous "head" taco, tacos made from head meat and the prices can't be beat. The cachete (cheek) is my absolute favorite. A little off of the beaten path though, and not in the best neighborhood, but worth the drive.
