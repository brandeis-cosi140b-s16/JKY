It's amazing that Del Taco & Taco Bell even exist in this area with authentic cuisine like this.  An open flame mesquite grill welcomes you on first sight along with the delicious smell of open fire and smoke flavors.  I can see why this place is always packed, but the food does come fast.  I had 3 tacos on corn tortillas, carne asada, chicken, and pork.  The house homemade salsa is deep smoky flavored with a kick.  The fixings bar has orange hot salsa, plus green guacamole, pico Del Gallo, cucumbers, pickled red onions, sliced radishes. Etc.  OMG.  Best Tex-Mex since I have been in Mesa/PHX.  The outdoor eating area even has cooling water misters to keep you cool from the salsa heat. Coming back for more.
