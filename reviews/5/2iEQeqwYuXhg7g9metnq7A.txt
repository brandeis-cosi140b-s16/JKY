i wouldn't normally give an uninspired chain restaurant a Five Star rating, but i just love their brunch specials and big patio.

one of my favorite weekend ventures is getting friends and cruisers together to pedal to a local patio for some eats and drinks when the weather's nice, and this place is perfect for that.

it's tempe, so there's plenty of places to lock your bike within viewing distance from the joint's huge patio. it's right off mill, so there's plenty of people watching, and it seems like every other weekend there's a festival of some sort, too.

the brunch is sundays from 11 to 2, and breakfast options are as basic as eggs benedict (pretty good) to breakfast enchiladas (also spectacular). you also get muffins or cornbread to snack on that are excellent.

the best part is the drink specials, $3 mamosas and $3 bloody marys buffet. yeah, that's right, a buffet just for your perfect, do-it-yourself bloody mary. they have three or four mixes to choose from, like straight up tomato juice to their special spicy jalepeno blend. then you can add as much ice, veggies and fun stuff as you want. they have several different kinds of olives and why not throw in a beef jerky stick to stir it up? did i mention that for $3 you have your choice of top shelf vodka? i know, this is too good to be true, but it is. they have kettle one, skyy, absolut, you want it, they got it.

you're starting to understand why i would rather bike than drive up there, i hope. anyway, the crowd is so-so, but with a big group of friends, some sunshine and bicycles, it's pretty fantastic way to end a weekend.
