We ventured over here since Outback next door was a nightmare.  SO GLAD WE DID.  THIS PLACE IS GOOD!

We walked next door and entered. The entrance seemed slightly seedy with tinted glass windows. It had the feeling like you were about to enter a low class titty bar.

When we got inside...it was nice and clean.

The food was EXCELLENT, FRESH, and seasoned just right.

I think we will put this place in our normal rotation of eating.   It could quite possibly be the best Mexican food ive had in Charlotte.
