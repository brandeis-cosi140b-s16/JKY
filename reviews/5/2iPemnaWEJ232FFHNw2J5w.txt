I wish I could give this place 10 stars! I love tamales, BUT I am very picky that they not be too dry.  These tamales are AMAZING.  I've tried most of the tamales, but look forward to getting there and seeing which ones are fresh.  So far my favorite are the Red Beef, but I love all of them.  I prefer that they are all take out because I like that they focus only on tamales.  if they became a restaurant, I imagine they would start adding all kinds of other items.  Tamales are difficult to find AND good ones are even harder to find.  I am grateful to YELP for turning me on to this great place.
