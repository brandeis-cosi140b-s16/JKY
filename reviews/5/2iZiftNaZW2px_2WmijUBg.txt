This is authentic Mexican and it's as good as it gets. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte (Indian Trail). Try all the different sauces with the complimentary chips so good and spicy. Their 'street tacos' are amazing. Three tacos are really more than enough. Very filling. The restaurant was recently renovated so can accommodate the regular crowds even better. Expect a wait if your going during peak lunch/dinner hours. Super nice staff that is generally attentive. If you haven't been and love Mexican food, this is a must try location.
