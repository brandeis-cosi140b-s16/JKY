Finally I have found a taco stand to replace my old favorite. The tortillas are hand made so you won't get that sour tortilla taste that you get at some places. Everything is finely chopped which to me is a deal breaker. 

I brought my Mom and sister here for a late lunch and we ordered 3 tacos, a quesadilla, gotta, & three drinks and only paid $18! For me that was a steal especially for the portions.  The quesadillas are pretty big and the tacos are just the right size. I will tell you this its in a sketchy area but you can always order them to go if you don't want to stay and eat there. 

I will definitely be coming back soon.
