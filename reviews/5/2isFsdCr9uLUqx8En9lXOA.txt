I'm very picky about my Mexican food, as I'm from Arizona and this place did NOT disappoint. The location is in a strip mall off of South Blvd, but don't let that discourage you. They're quick and authentic! The salsas are made fresh and boy, they are spicy and delicious! This place was recommended to me by a co-worker and I'm so glad I came to check it out. Next time I'll have to order a few different things on the menu. 

During my visit, I got the carne asada tacos which came with three tacos and rice and beans. The tacos were garnished with onions and cilantro. The only thing I would've added was cheese (which I forgot!). It was delicious! The steak was tender and cooked to perfection. You really didn't need anything else added to it. My friend ordered the enchiladas and it was plentiful. 

They didn't have prices listed anywhere, but it was pretty inexpensive. We'll definitely be back!
