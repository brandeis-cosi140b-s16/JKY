I am a vegan...with a Paradise Valley Burger Co. addiction!  The bacon cheese burger is the best bacon cheese burger I have ever had. The brioche bun melts in your mouth, as you bite into two perfectly cooked burger patties, topped with cheese, the real deal special sauce, bacon and fresh veggies. I will never have a burger from anywhere else. Don't even get me started on the sugary spicy specialness of their French Fries! Once you go PVBC... You won't want a burger from anywhere else.
