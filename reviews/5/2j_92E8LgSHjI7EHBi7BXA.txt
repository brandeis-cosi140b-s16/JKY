Awesome food and proportions.  Great service!  For under $10 you get a Baja chicken chimichanga meal with rice and beans.  The chimichanga is as big as the plate.  You can taste that the beans and rice are homemade.  Try the churros with vanilla ice Cream and a caramel sauce that is out of this world.   Can't say enough good about this place.
