It finally hit me that this is the same place as their other Scottsdale location so we rushed over as I've had several great experiences there and knew the food was fantastic. 

The choices were difficult as many things sounded great so my son and I opted to share the 10 course tasting menu which was as amazing as it sounded! My daughter ordered from the kids menu and got a generous portion that she loved too. 

This is not your ordinary Mexican fare so don't come expecting a big menu of fajitas and burritos. If you want crap Mexican food like Arriba, go to Arriba but if you want great food, come around the block here and you won't be sorry.
