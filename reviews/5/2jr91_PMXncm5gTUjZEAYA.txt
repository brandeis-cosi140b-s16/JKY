This place lives up to the reviews. Tacos-excellent, burritos-excellent, service- top notch AND fast, condiments and sides- fresh and tasty!
If you want fresh, authentic, fast and super inexpensive Mexican food, you owe it to yourself and family to give this place a try. I have a feeling after you come the first time you will be back as I will!
