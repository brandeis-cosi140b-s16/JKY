WOW! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to in Charlotte! (we're originally from AZ) Great food!!! & they serve REAL jalapenos! :) We had chips/salsa (best I've ever had), chimichanga and fish/beef tacos, they were awesome! Good drink deals and the service was perfect! We will definitely be back!
