Came all the way from Los Angeles and decided to try this place based on yelp reviews. Boy, i was not dissapointed. I usually ignore traditional mexican restaurants, as i tend to find the rice and beans untasty, opting for the americanized albertos type of mexican food.

This place was well decorated, with friendly service. I ordered the flauta and my companion ordered 2 carne asada tacos. i loved my flauta. (its basically a burrito that they deep fry before hand.) Mine came with beef that literally was moist and so tender it was falling apart on the fork. it also had  nice sweet marinade to it. the 2 carne asada tacos were good too. It had a nice meaty taste to it, but defintiely not as good as the flauta. the portions were pretty big. i opted just for a single serving (as they gave you options to order another portion for 3 dollars more), but i couldn't even finish one portion.

each dish came with arrozo ( a noodle tomato soup was terrific) plus rice, refried beans.  All for about 11 bucks.

A decent price for top notch food.

I'll definitely be dropping by here again the next time i'm in vegas. 

Its not hard to find, just look for the wal-mart.
