Have I seriously not reviewed Chinos?????  How can that be???? I've been coming to Chino's for about 20 years. I started at the only location, up on Bell and 19th Ave (I think that's where it is) even though I live in Ahwatukee. Then, after 4 years of them having a sign saying "Chandler location coming soon!", it finally opened. I was in heaven!!  Went there often until it unfortunately closed and now it's back occasionally to the one on the west side.

Why do I love it? The food. Simply awesome! Comfort food, filling, tastes delicious, and tons of it! How do you mix Mexican, Caribbean and Chinese? Never thought of it, but Chino's does it and my family and I LOVE it! Love that you can get whatever you want as an entree, in a burrito or in a quesadilla. Love that it's served in a metal to-go container, sitting at plastic tables and chairs. It's the ultimate dive, hole in the wall, established forever, for good reason, place. The service is typically friendly and the cookies that come with your dish, especially when they're the chocolate volcano cookies, are awesome! Black Caribbean beans, jerk fried rice, jade red chicken and emerald chicken, yummmmm! I absolutely love this place.

Seriously, if you've never tried this place, it is an absolute must try!!! Once you do, if you're like me, a week or so later you'll start to crave it,...so good.
