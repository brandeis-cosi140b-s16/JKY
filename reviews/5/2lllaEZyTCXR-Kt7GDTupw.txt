So many people say they can't find an authentic Mexican food restaurant in Vegas.  Well, I found one for you.

It seems like Viva Mercado's has been here forever.  From the salsa down to the awesome mariachi they have on the weekend, everything snaps with charm when you walk in the door.

And a really cute full bar right in the middle of the place makes me feel right at home. (yep, I was born in a bar.)

The biggest reason I wanted to YELP about Mercado's is, they're moving soon and the word needs to get out.   They are moving from a strip mall on West Flamingo and Jones to a free standing home on South Rainbow and Spring Mountain. (thankfully still in my 'hood.)

When in the mood for that tasty random margarita night, this is the place to go hands down.  I can't wait to see it's new home, and hopefully I'll see you there.....sombrero' and all.
