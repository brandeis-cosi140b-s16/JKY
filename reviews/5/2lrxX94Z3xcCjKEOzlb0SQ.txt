Ah Chipotle, you lure me in with your cilantro-lime rice and woo me with your guacamole. I'm such a fan of the burrito bowls but hate the burritos -- too much tortilla ruins the flavor for me. Great and fast service. 

Drink area is in a bit of an odd place and this location is PACKED at lunch -- avoid this area if you can between 12:00PM and 1:00PM Monday-Friday.
