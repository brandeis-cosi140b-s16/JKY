Sol keep doing what you do and you will have a life long customer all the servers are friendly. I could drink enough of the house margaritas to kill my liver and still have a smile on. Honestly sometimes the fianc√© and I just come up for chips & salsa margaritas. Also the chicken quesidilla is the bomb diggity. They also have really good bfast menu.
