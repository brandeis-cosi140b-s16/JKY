Have nothing bad to say about this place!

The first time I came through drunk and stumbling I was handed a free Chips and Salsa coupon (and it was just a free thing, didn't have to buy anything).  Because of that we decided to eat there the next day and I had a delicious burrito.

Our next trip down there we figured we should stop by again, got some tacos and those were great too.

Always had good food, great service and decent prices.

Has become a staple of our Vegas vacations!
