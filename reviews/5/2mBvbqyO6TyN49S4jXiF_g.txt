My sister suggested El Charro last night for dinner. I had never been and after looking at some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the interior is a little dark and dated, but I found it somewhat charming as I don't like cookie cutter restaurants. Our service was great. Our server was very sweet and attentive. Never had to wait for drink or chip refills. During our meal 2 other employees also came to check on us and see if we needed anything. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I ordered a cheese quesadilla which was delicious. The tortilla tasted and appeared to be homemade. My sister had the sour cream enchiladas which she really enjoyed. Prices were very reasonable. For our 2 meals and drinks we paid around $19. I would definitely go back.
