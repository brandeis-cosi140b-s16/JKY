Fantastic Mexican seafood. Friendly people, mariachis, The armed guard at the door was even having a good time!  I'm guessing this place is not in a "good area," but what do we know, were from out of town. It seemed fine to us. 

I had the coconut shrimp and octopus, Greg had the shrimp ceviche. It was wonderful!
