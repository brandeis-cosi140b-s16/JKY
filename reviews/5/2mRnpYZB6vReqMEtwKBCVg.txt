Cleanliness: 5 Stars
The front of the restaurant smells and appears very clean and sanitary. This small shop definitely takes pride in ownership

Hospitality: 5 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. I used their call ahead order service and was impressed with the friendliness and promptness received.  

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great for a "quick" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option.
