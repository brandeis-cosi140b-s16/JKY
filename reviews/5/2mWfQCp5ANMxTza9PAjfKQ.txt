So I was out playing poker at the Golden Nugget and wanted something quick. I walked past this place and was immediately drawn in. I mean come on, where else can you get Asian and Mexican cuisine under one roof and from first glance everything is made fresh! I tried the tacos and a few Asian chicken dishes. Both dishes had the flavor of something you'd expect from an authentic Spanish or Asian restaurant. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Anyone close to Fremont St. needs to visit. Something for everyone and you won't be disappointed!
