I love the gourmet chicken tacos.  For "fast food" it is bit expensive 7-10$ for the combo plate.  I wish a single taco wasn't 3.29$ but it is great.  The kicker for me was the management and staff.  This place about a mile from where I live, so that is a plus for me as well.  But the manager ( 2 so far) have been nothing be the epitome of how a manager should act.

I had just moved to Peoria about a month and half ago and was exploring the nothern Peoria area and seeing what was really close to my house.  I relied heavily on Yelp, and the reviews for this place looked great.  

I walk in and the manager starts small talking with me and I am a big small talker so I mention that I just moved here from Michigan and it is my first time in.  He gave me a FREE fountain pop cup and said "Welcome to Arizona and Rubios"  ( You had me at free bro!)  I order the chicken taco plate.  He brings it out to my table and I take a bite.  DELICIOUS food.

He asks if I like fish because their signature dish is the Fish Taco.  I told him I am not a huge fish guy, and 5 minutes later he brings me a FREE fish taco just to try!!

What a nice fast food place!   5 stars for all around awesomeness
