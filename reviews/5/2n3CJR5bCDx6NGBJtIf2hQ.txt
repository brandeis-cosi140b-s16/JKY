We just discovered this gem of a restaurant and we have gone there 3 days straight.  It is a family run restaurant that serves amazing food.  They are super friendly and always smiling.   This has become our favorite Mexican food and we go to a lot.  You know it's authentic when they serve lengua!!!!  Everything is great here!!!
