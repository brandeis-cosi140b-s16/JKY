I hate to cook, hate to wash dishes, and hate getting fat even more. So I eat Chipotle almost every single day. Who cares if it's a "fake-Mex" chain? It's quality, healthy food at an affordable price...and they even claim to use sustainably raised ingredients. When someone comes out with another fresh fast food option, I'll diversify -- but for now, I'm basically on the Chipotle diet!

For those interested, I get a chicken salad bowl with all the veggies and salsas, guacamole, black beans and brown rice. No sour cream or cheese; that shit is poison. Ditto with the sodas and drinks. My one indulgence is the baby size chips -- 10 tortilla chips in a little bag, just enough to treat my taste buds without making me a lardass. 

I try to rotate around several area Chipotles, so the kids there don't think I'm a loser. This one is closest to my house, so I maybe hit it a bit more. It's clean and well-lit with plenty of parking, and friendly staff.

What more could you want for $10??
