We are from California and were looking for a good Mexican restaurant, this place is great, the food is really good and fresh, the service is very friendly, I had the chilaquiles and they were great, my fianc√© had the carne asada plate, the meat were very tender and cooked to perfection. We are definitely coming back next time we visit Las Vegas.
