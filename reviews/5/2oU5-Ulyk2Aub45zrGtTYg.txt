Baja is definitely a great taco joint! Being next to UNLV campus, it's a great college spot. Even the inside gives off that college-town feel. When you walk in it's the regular, small restaurant area and to the left is an attached bar for the 21 and older kids! I absolutely love how they put the place together, photos of their customers all over the wall and funny signs scattered everywhere too. 

Onto the food, 
No other place can beat the specials here at Baja! They even have happy hour everyday 5-7pm!!! 

The tacos are great as well. I say they're some of the best in town esp for the price. All people know about is Taco y Taco and Tacos El Gordo, but I honestly think Baja falls in the same category!
