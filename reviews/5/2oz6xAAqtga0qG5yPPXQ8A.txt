I was really impressed with the manager and staff with my experience at this location 4/29. The staff informed me they are out of salmon for fish tacos and if I wanted to wait it would be about 7 minutes. I said i'll take vegetarian. but they insisted it would be a treat to wait for the salmon so I did.. It ended up taking around 30 minutes. But patient as I am I waited quietly. The manager came over and apologized and offered me a free soft drink, and 50% off my meal for my time waited. When the salmon was ready, they made me some great fantastic tasting tacos, and went above and beyond with my meal and service. Very satisfied customer and I shall return again many times in the future. Thank you
