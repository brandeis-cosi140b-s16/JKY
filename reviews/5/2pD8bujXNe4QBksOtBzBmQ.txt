This is an awesome bar that is actually pretty well hidden.
I've only been there on Sunday for Karaoke with Appa (great time) but it's never been an overly crowded or rowdy place. Very friendly atmosphere.

Their street tacos are outstanding and their nachos are worthy of the establishment's namesake. They also have hard cider on tap which is my favorite, especially in a giant frosty dwarf mug.

Great food, great drinks, great service, great prices. Highly recommended.
