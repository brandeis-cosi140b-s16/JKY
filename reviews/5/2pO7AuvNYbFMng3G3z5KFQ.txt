Our cab driver gave us this recommendation - it was well worth the trip.  I had the carnitas - YUM!!!  with enough left over for a midnight snack!!  my daughters had chimichangas - the plate comes with 2 of them!!!  way too much for them to eat - but again...midnight snacks!  we will definitely go back for more if we ever make it back to vegas!
