Wow!  Thanks Yelpers for the great reviews of this wonderful restaurant!!  I had the enchiladas, one w/red and the other green, cilantro lime rice and refrained beans.  My husband had the Carnitas Estilo Michoacan and I had to stop him from licking the plate when he finished it!!   Everything has a BIG, rich flavor!  The chip were warm and fresh and we couldn't decide which of the salsas we like best.   Generally, we like to go to a different restaurant each night while on vacation, but we might have to return here.   Yummmm....!
