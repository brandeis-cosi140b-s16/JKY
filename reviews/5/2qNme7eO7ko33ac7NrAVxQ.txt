This place is at my budget friendly and the food is good. They have a week special for Mon-Thur. At what I think really good price. Super clean all around. And friendly service.

I just ate the taco salad (marinaded chicken) very tasty and very filling. And goes for the same price as Carne Asada fries. My sister had that and I gotta say way better then Roberto's fries. 

I'd say give it a try when your hungry for Cali Mexican food Or when you just puff puffed.
