This is my favorite Chipotle location in town! It's close to home, and the staff is very friendly.

It's rarely crowded, but there have been a few times that I show up right in the middle of a killer lunch rush, and that's always a pain in the buns.

I have a few favorite employees here, they always hook up my veggie burrito bowl with extra sour cream and cheese just like I ask. They even remind me to get my guacamole on the side so I can eat it with my chips. Does it get better than that? I think not!

I'm here so often that the staff recognizes my boyfriend and I and has asked where our friends are on a few occasions (we rarely dine at Chipotle alone). I feel welcome, and never rushed to make decisions on my order, since sometimes I pretend I'm going to get something different, even though we all know that I'm never deviating from my veggie bowl... ever.

Another plus is that this place is always clean, and they have a healthy stock of Chipotle flavored Tabasco sauce at all times!

Hands down the best Chipotle in Vegas. Go here to satisfy those hunger pangs and Chipotle cravings.
