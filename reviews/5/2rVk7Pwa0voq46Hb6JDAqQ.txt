You should eat here. The food is absolutely amazing. (And relatively inexpensive - we each paid around $25 and had a delicious fresh cocktail, two tacos and split chips/salsa). We were so lucky to grab a table on the sidewalk without a reservation and the staff was incredibly friendly. This was a fantastic choice for a post-work happy hour dinner/drink. I'm excited to go back and try the wall of tequila.
