Not going to lie but this place has some amazing carne asada..... Granted, when I went here the other night with Reggie and Terri after the Speakeasy at Herb's and Rye, I was a little leary of the place as they were about to close and just about packed everything up for the night. 

Turns out the only thing they didn't have was al pastor.... which was a big let down since that was the main reason we all went. Alas... the carne asada was nothing short of amazing! 

**TIP** ::CARNE ASADA WAS AMAZING::
