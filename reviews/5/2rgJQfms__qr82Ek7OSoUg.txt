It was pretty good, but what made it great was the service. The man (owner?) working was very friendly and helpful. We got to try samples. The food was delicious. I loved the fish and the seaweed rice was good. Prices are very reasonable, even without the Groupon that we went in there with. The coconut bark is definitely worth getting also.
