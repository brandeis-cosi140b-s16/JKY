Very good, fairly inexpensive, and fresh.

As another reviewer stated, if you order something with a tortilla (like the hard-shelled Tacos Durados for example) they make it fresh.

The Tacos Dorados are huge, and stuffed with meat and cheese (and all the other fixins) for the meager price of $1.50.

The horchata is delicious, and from the looks of it, homemade.
