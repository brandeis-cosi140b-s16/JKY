This is hands down the BEST PIZZA IN MADISON! I had been to the Sun Prairie location before and had the pizza so I knew to expect excellence and wasn't disappointed. Every time I have been to this location it has been PACKED. 

There are a few downsides to this location however. There is never any seating due to the fairly small space. So you are better off ordering your pizza and picking it up, unless you don't mind waiting for seating. I guess the positive to the small space is that it always makes the restaurant look busy. (which it is)

Another thing to keep in mind is that the menu is different from the Sun Prairie location, so if you have a favorite pizza at that location, you may not be able to get it at this location. 

Regardless of the things I mentioned above this is hands down the best pizza in madison and I highly recommend you go and try their pizza. Either location won't disappoint!
