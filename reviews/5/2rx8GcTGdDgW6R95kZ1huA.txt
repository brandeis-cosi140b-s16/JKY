After a failed attempt without reservations (2 hour wait?!), we got our stuff together and planned ahead.  Totally worth it!  

The place is way bigger than it looks and very different from what you'd assume if you were just looking at the part you can see from the street (the open kitchen with the outdoor barstools).   Inside, it's dark and dungeon-ish, but in a very attractive way.  The octopus sconces, iron and wood decor, and Mexican candles lend the place a really fun vibe.   

The food was amazing.  We ordered the queso and two special taco plates.   One of the specials was shrimp with a bunch of deliciousness including pistachios.  It was a great fresh combo and I definitely wish it was on the regular menu.  The other special was a cheesesteak taco.  This was not your average cheesesteak - tender strips of actual steak - not the processed pressed stuff you think of when you think cheesesteak.   Both specials were absolutely delicious!   Each plate came with two tacos, which was a pretty good portion for the price and quality.   

The queso appetizer was really the only thing I had a comment about.   The queso itself was awesome.   The soft tortillas it was served with were awesome.  The combo, though, was a little awkward.  Do you make a very cheesy burrito?  Try and dip/scoop with the soft tortilla?  We tried it a bunch of different ways; but in the end, we kind of just wanted some chips to scoop up all that rich and creamy queso.   

Service?  Also excellent.  Our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly.   As an added bonus, we asked where the restroom was on the way out.  He pointed us in the direction, but took the time to tell us that there was a big line and we'd be better to try the one in the attached Butcher and the Rye (see my review of that place for why there was no line there).   

Overall, a sure winner and I'll definitely be back.
