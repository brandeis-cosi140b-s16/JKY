BAJA FRESH!! 

The company stormed into existence years ago taking over the fast fresh mexican market but since Chipotle has been around on a large level over 8 years or so it has "chipped" away at their market.

In saying that I still love and appreciate both. And this location has never done me wrong. Been there many times and the service is always fast, busy or not(often it's quite dead in there actually a little sad)

But the food is always deeeelish! And unlike Chipotle or many other places these days they still give free chips and the best salsa bar around! Try the pico de gallo if you haven't!
