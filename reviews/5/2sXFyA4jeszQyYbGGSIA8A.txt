A-MA-ZING!!! Best little taco place I've been to in AZ!!! The Fuego Taco was so super delicious! Don't pass up the guacamole- incredible! Sergio (owner) is so nice and takes pride in his place. We'll be back next week for sure...glad I don't live close by (I'd be huge from Fuego Tacos!!). Delicious!!
