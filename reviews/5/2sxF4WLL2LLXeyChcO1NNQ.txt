Not only the food was great. I totally forgot my wallet on the table there when I ordered to go. I didn't realize the wallet was gone till I got home. It was about 45 min I just noticed it was gone and just my luck, I came back to the store and they where holding it for me when I got back! Talk about good customer service!!! But the food is overall amazing! I had a carne asada quesadilla which I recommend!
