Just so you know I have been in LV for about 7 months now. I'm from California.
Still looking for my "go-to" Mexican food place. I came here today for lunch and I was so happy I did! Everyone at work raves about Casa Don Juan, but no thank you. 

This place was quick, delicious AND affordable. I got the 3 tacos, rice & beans plate - $8.00
Carne Asada
Al Pastor
Carnitas
All very delicious. The red sauce is chipotle based and the green sauce was good. Both very watery but good just the same.
Their beans remind me of my abuelitas and the rice was fluffy and delicious - just like I like it. 
I will be going back. Super small place but clean and has tables to dine-in.
