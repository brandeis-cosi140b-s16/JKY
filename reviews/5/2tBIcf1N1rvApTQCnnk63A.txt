I heard about Milagro Grill after attending the 2012 AZ Taco Festival (where they were grand champions both days). This place did not disappoint. I had a cucumber margarita and three chicken tacos. They were by far the best chicken tacos I have ever had. Their tortillas are homemade and delicious. They have a nice patio, but it was full when we arrived so we sat inside. If you are a taco lover: Go. Here. Now.
