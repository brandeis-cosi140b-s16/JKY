Authentic street style tacos served up in seconds, in a clean stylish atmosphere.  Monday is mariachi night.  There is also a salsa bar, with house fired and then pickled jalapeno peppers.    The salsa barn also has pinto beans, which are done to perfection slightly firm not mushy, a little creamy.   They have a daily happy hour.  You order at the counter but I prefer to sit at the bar which only has four seats.  The tequila choices are varied and ones you will not find elsewhere the bartender is extremely knowledgeable about the history and origins of the various offerings.  My date enjoyed the corn on the cob cooked Mexican style; it is fire roasted and spices added.  I had chicharon, lingua, and buche.   My favorite is the Buche delicious and tender.   There are several fresh house made salsas including some made with habanero peppers my date loves that flavor, me not so much.   The food is great but the real hidden gem I have found on two visits is the quality of the drinks, fresh squeezed lime juice, and a house made tomato juice concoction to mix in with beer.  They also make two versions of sangrita, one sweet one savory sip a little while doing tequilla shots!
