My husband and I went yesterday (Sunday) for lunch. I love Mexican food and have been really disappointed in the other restaurants we've tried in the area since moving here in October but this one did not disappoint! Everything was absolutely delicious!! First off the margaritas were perfect. Not too sweet. Not too strong. Just right. But the food took the cake. It was hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had - period. The chips and salsa were really good. I loved that you got 3 kinds of dip/salsa with them. Then we ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas. The meat quality was excellent and they were cooked perfectly. We also ordered the white sans chimichanga. OMG! GET IT! sooooo delicious! The service was great too. Very helpful & polite waiter. We sat outside on the covered patio next to the little water fountain. Overall, a very pleasant experience with delicious food. We'll definitely be back
