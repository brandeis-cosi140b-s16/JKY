We LOVE Rosa's and were super happy to see they were getting a 2nd location! Our favorites are the flying saucer, pineapple avocado salad, the mole enchilada (yum!), and the fish tacos (my fav!!!)- even our notoriously picky teen son loves them! :) The Horchata is really yummy, and our kids love the red cream soda. The owners are wonderful people and so nice. Atmosphere is fun, beautiful, and relaxed...perfect place to take visitors. One of Mesa's best!
