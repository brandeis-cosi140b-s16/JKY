Tried the chicken taco and Korean nate dog, and as much as I liked the chicken taco...I LOVED the korean nate dog. The chicken taco is spicy and the kimchi adds a good bit of savory, sour taste. But the nate dog was awesome! it has a different spiciness to it, and the spicy mayo was bomb! dont eat it if youre on a diet though!! :D
