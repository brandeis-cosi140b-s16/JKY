The pizza at Cela's is consistently good. And it's inexpensive. A large 14" pepperoni that barely fits in the box and a bottle of Mexican Coke ($1.50) was just a few pennies over $7.

I have had the pizza from Cela's at least 10 times now. Each time it was consistent with the last. It has a soft chewy crust, the sauce is slightly sweet with good flavor and the cheese and pepperoni are good too.

Don't let the run down strip mall it's located in turn you off this place. Don't let the divey interior turn you off it either. It has an A health inspection rating. When I want a quick and inexpensive pizza but still want quality pizza, this is the place I call. It beats the flavor and size of the $5 Little Caesar's, it isn't greasy like a Pizza Hut Pan and has better flavors and a better crust than Domino's or Papa John's. Support a place that is locally owned and has a better pizza than the big chains.
