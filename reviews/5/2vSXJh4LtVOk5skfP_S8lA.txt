I'm sorry, but I just love Julio's.  I've been to all of them.  The Pollo Magnifico is to die for.  I hate it because it tastes so good, but is so bad for you.  It's a guilty pleasure that I just have to indulge in every now and then!  But, when I'm not eating a dish worth every bite of it's cheesy, deep fried 3,000 calories, a fajita barrito is a nice choice.  The queso dip is great and in general I've never been disappointed. 

I've been going to Julio's since I was a kid and I will be going until I'm old and frail- I love you Julio's!!!
