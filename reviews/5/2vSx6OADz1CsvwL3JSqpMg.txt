When you've graduated from Taco Bell and it's too depressing inside an empty Roberto's, you're ready for Cafe Rio and its addictive fresh awesomeness. 

Don't get me wrong: you won't forget the Los Tacos of the world, and I still love a good lunch at Mariana's. But Cafe Rio is wonderful. Big fan of both barbacoa and grilled salmon. Whole menu is great and worth the extra buck over your average fast-casual spot.
