On a recent visit back to Arizona, I knew I needed some authentic Mexican food. Checked out other Yelp reviews and this was spot on. I ordered the lunch special and for $8 (wow!) I got a tamale, chile relleno, beans, rice, and chips and salsa. It was spicy, just like I love it. Best salsa I've ever tasted. Had a good lasting burn but not over the top burn. I wish I could move back to Arizona so I could eat here again and again. Service was quick, efficient, and servers were polite. If you live within 50 miles, go check this place out for delicious Mexican food.
