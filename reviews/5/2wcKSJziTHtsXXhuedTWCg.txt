We split the short rib enchiladas and pork carnitas and they were amazing! The salsas and guac were also delicious and extremely fresh, and the staff were very attentive. If we'd found this spot earlier in our trip we definitely would have gone back a few more times- but we'll definitely be back during our next visit to Vegas.
