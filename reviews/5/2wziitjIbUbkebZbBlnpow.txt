I love the Rio.  I have to drop by for lunch every time I'm up in the Northwestern part of the valley.  The staff is friendly, courteous and cheerful.  The food is awesome, and generally it is served amazingly quickly after we order.  The chicken chimichanga is my favorite.  My husband will vouch for "The Ocho," or the eighth combination plate as it is known on the menu.  Their margaritas are also good.  I don't order margaritas very often because I am usually disappointed with the flavor, but the Rio's lime/tequila/orange liquor balance is just right.  

I have never gotten a bad meal here.  Even the rice is moist and delicious.  I thought all Mexican restaurants considered the rice plate garnish until I ate here.  The salsa and freshly fried tortilla chips that they bring to the table are also really tasty.  Their extra hot salsa (which you can request) is plenty hot, but not as flavorful as their regular salsa.
