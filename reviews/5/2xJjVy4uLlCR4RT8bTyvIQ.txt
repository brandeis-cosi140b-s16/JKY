Taco Bell is very popular in the vegan/vegetarian community.
 (Just ask for no meat or cheese or sour cream) (sub with gauc, rice or beans) Sometimes it's hard asking people that because they think you're crazy and sometimes aren't very friendly with me asking this simple task.

This Taco Bell was a very pleasant experience! Odilia B was so friendly and understanding! She even drew a little smiley face on my bag. 
Thank you for hiring such nice employees like her!
