I have been going to this restaurant on a regular basis for a few years now. The food is always fresh, hot and served promptly. I like the hot sauce and salsa that come with the chips. I typically get a la carte items but tried the Pollo Diablo entree my last visit. This is probably my new favorite!  It's a laid back crowd, family friendly and enjoy the satellite radio. Everyone who works here has a great rapport with customers and respect each other as well. Hard to find in restaurants these days. Our servers have always been attentive and pleasant to deal with in every aspect. Rod the night manager is very personable and  friendly. Those who gave it an A-Ok rating should try again.
