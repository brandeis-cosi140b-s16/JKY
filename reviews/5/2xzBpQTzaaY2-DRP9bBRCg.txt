Fantastic Mexican food!

Stopping in yesterday for a quick bite was a pleasantly surprising experience, especially after reading some less than flattering reviews.This is a great place to swing by for lunch if you are a vegetarian - sorry, I cannot speak for the carnivores. The beans and rice are wonderful, especially when topped with their guacamole, pico de avocado and other salsas. Not having had other menu items I cannot comment further.

A clean restaurant that serves great food with fast, friendly service. What's not to love? I will definitely dine here next time I find myself in this area of town.
