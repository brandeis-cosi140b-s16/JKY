I eat here almost everyday for lunch! The wait can be long at certain times but worth the wait- the regular staff is awesome and friendly and they remember my order - I only have issues when they have visitor or new employees but they still get 5 stars because they move the line and are friendly and the food is always fresh and amazing!
