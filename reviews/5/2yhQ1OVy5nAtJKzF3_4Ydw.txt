So good here.  So good.  I asked my friend who lives in Phoenix what's a place that is "Phoenix" and I can't eat anywhere else.  She recommended Poncho's and man, I am glad she did.

I had already eaten a bag of Ruffles sour cream and cheddar, so my stomach wasn't feeling that great.  But I had to get the pollo fundido, and it was amazing.  It was pretty big.  Ok, enough about that, just know, it was amazing.  I am salivating thinking about it.

The chips and salsa was great.  Everything was great.  Go here for some authentic Mexican food.  Yum.
