I absolutely LOVE Mucho Gusto.  

Came here for my first time on a Friday night to get some drinks with friends.  The Margaritas sold me instantly.  I went a while ago, but the happy hour special for that day (they have different specials based on the day, Saturday is 1/2 price Marg pitchers!) was $5 a Margarita.  They are so good!  They're homemade and don't have that nasty artificial taste.  Not too sweet either.  A friend ended up ordering dessert and she got this delicious flautas dish with vanilla ice cream and berry sauce.  SO GOOD!  

The dessert and drinks alone captured my interest, so when some out of town family from back East came for a visit, I suggested Mucho Gusto to get some local flavor.  They're not really used to Mexican flavors because there is limited exposure where they're from in NY, but they enjoyed their meals and LOVED the Margs.  

Kudos to me for introducing them to new food, and kudos to Mucho Gusto on great service, food, and atmosphere!
