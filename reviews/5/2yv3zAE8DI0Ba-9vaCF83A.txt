I guess after 10 check-ins I should review this place lol. However, this review is seriously on only 3 menu items. Everytime I try to make myself get something new, I talk myself out of it and get the Al Pastor tacos. Super flavorful and not soggy tortillas (big pet peeve) and pineapple!  Yum! I've tried the elote once before but didn't get it again because I was too full to eat my tacos afterwards and just because im not really a fan of elote in general. Lol good flavor, and really sweet corn. Next, the only drink I get is horchata! Not too sweet or grainy, it's perfect!
In my opinion, this place is better than Tacos El Gordo, Pepe's, Roberto's, Fauto's, Las Gorditas, Jalisco Cantina, Imperial Tacos & Beer, and Taco Tijuana. I'm no expert on tacos or anything lol I just reaaaally like them. I could live off tacos haha. They are fresher, bigger portions, bigger flavor, better sauces, more seating (especially their location on Eastern) and faster. I've yet to try the rest of their menu but they have lengua, asada, barbacoa, carnitas, tripas and lots of other meat options, plus some nonmeat options like soy chorizo, veggies, and panela. They also offer nachos, burritos, quesadillas, bowls (definitely need to try this ), vampiros, tostadas. Their salsa bar is also pretty expansive. Favorite tacos in Vegas!
