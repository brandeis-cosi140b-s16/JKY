First things first...Very clean. Maybe not important to everyone, but for me it is.
I went for the first time and had two tacos and a nachos. All were affordable and tasty and made fresh! Yes, the steak for my asada tacos  and nachos was grilled right in front of me, not scooped from a pile of previously cooked meat. Now that fresh cooking means that you will have to wait a little while, so if you are in a rush you might want to go somewhere else, but definately come back whern you have more time.
I also enjoyed the free chips from the self serve salsa bar in the dining area. They were heavily salted, (which I like) but if you are not doing salt, then I guess you will have to skip these.
The dining room has adequate seating, and a big screen tv, usually showing sports. There is a cantina (pub) connected to the dining room , but I didnt go in there.
The friendly service topped off the whole experience to make my visit a five star visit.
