I love getting burritos from Tortas El Rey!! I always customize my burritos and they always get my order right at this location. The burritos are very large so you won't be dissatisfied when it comes to size. I have come to this location multiple times and love it every time. The building looks a little run-down, but the food is great and the service is great! I never have to wait a long time before I get my food and they have a covered outdoor area with tables to eat at that's located next to the building. They also have a drive-thru if you're in a hurry. I would definitely recommend eating here if you are craving Mexican food!
