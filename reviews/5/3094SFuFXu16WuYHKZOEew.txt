Excellent food and service!  The Tomatillo echiladas are the best you will ever have.

Beautiful restaurant and bar.  Everything you would expect from a Mexican restaurant is upgraded at Viva Mercados.  They start you with perfect chips and high quality salsa and creamy beyond belief bean dip.  For salsa fans they have a large selection of salsas of varying heats.  They also provide a perfect little plate of seasoned onions and chile peppers.  The menu is huge but everything I have had here is good.
