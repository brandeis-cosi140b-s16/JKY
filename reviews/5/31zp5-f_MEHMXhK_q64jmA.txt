I have been here countless times. I'm floored by the number of poor reviews. I've had Mexican food all over the country and this is a fav. Love the Taco and Enchilada Wednesdays, love the Chimi's, love the burros, love it all. The family is always present and are sweet as can be. If you don't like Raul and Theresa's, I don't know if I like you.
