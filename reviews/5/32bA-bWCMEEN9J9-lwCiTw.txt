Hungry and kinda of cheap to take a cab out to the strip (I stayed at the HRH) three of us ventured off to this little strip mall.  

After reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant to try to this place. Thankfully, when everyone got their food, we were all super happy.  I ordered the Fajita sandwich and I was pleasantly surprised. It's basically a burrito (chicken fajita, sour cream, lettuce, tomato, avocado) in a fluffy torta. Actually, it's a TORTA! For lunch, it was perfecto. The servings are pretty large, enough for two people to share. Everyone else said their food was also good. I think my bf got a regular burrito--he loved it and his cousin got a flauta-eggroll like thing--she also liked it! 

Drinks...the margaritas were also large and strong. I left feeling buzzed even after all that food. I don't remember how much everything was, but it was definitely reasonable for the amount of food and alcohol we got.  

The service was spot on. Our waitress (she wore a flower in her hair) was very attentive, helpful and friendly.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for anyone looking for a nice, quiet, and inexpensive lunch place.
