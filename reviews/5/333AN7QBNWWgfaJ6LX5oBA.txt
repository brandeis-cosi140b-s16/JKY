This is by far the best Mexican drive-thru in the area. My favorite is their super nachos. I have never had a bad meal when eating their food. 
I no longer live in the area and I miss their food, I have yet to find a place here in the Monterey Peninsula that comes close to the quality of food at Filibertos. 
Every time I am in the AZ I go to Filibertos!
