Food is amazing! Everytime I come 2 PHX I come 2 this plc. It's small, not fancy, but who cares b/c UR here 4 the food! The food is extremely fresh. Did I mention homemade? The waitress is so sweet & helpful. Only drawback is their not in Los Angeles! Can't wait 4 my next trip 2 PHX!
(I wanted to add pictures that we took, but can't figure out how)
