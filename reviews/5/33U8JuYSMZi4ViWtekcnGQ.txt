stopped by this week to grab a cocktail while enjoying the awesome weather and some NBA action.  All the staff was helpful and a call out to Berlin who was really nice and a good sport about giving my boss a hard time (as he bailed on this trip).  I also met some nice new peeps and I wish ROH hadn't wiped their names from my brain.
