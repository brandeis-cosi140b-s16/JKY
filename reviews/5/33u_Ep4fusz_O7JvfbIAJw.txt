Do not skip over this place! I'm a GCU student and saw the sign for the place on the way to school for years, and didn't stop in until recently. Let me tell you, that was a HUGE loss on my end. This place has some of the best tacos I've ever had. The Asada, and Pastor are absolutely amazing, and the sushi here is pretty good too! Also, the Horchata is absolutely delicious. When I crave tacos, this is the place you'll find me :)
