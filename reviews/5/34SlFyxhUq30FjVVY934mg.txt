Just opened and I really hope the locals help this place survive because I just had the chicken tacos and they were amazing. The best I've had in all of Queen Creek and they do their hard shells right. They make them. None of this pre made shell crap you find and some other local spots. The guacamole was fantastic, and the salsa was "ok" (not the best I've had) but I do like he homemade chips. They have a kids menu too and looks like a full bar (I don't drink so I'll be useless for info on that) but it looked pretty stocked. I will be making this a regular spot. This location seems to have a curse so Queen Creek let's help break that curse and help this new spot thrive. My wife had the steak tacos and said they were very good. So far so good. Can't wait to go back!!! I posted some pics of the food too.
