For Mexican food, I love to visit this Azteca location.  The service is excellent and they will substitute items on the menu.  As a shrimp lover, a favorite dish is the Carnitas Camarones which is prawns sliced and fried with onions, green peppers and mushrooms served with rice and beans.  They usually have a margarita special (mango = yummy) along with a beer special.  The restaurant is always crowded for dinner on the weekends.  Although the restaurant is pretty large, I suggest you arrive before the dinner time hour so that you don't have to wait.
