This place was great. I had the chicken enchiladas..the green sause was great and semi spicy..the beans and rice were also very good. My wife had the Al Pastor tacos and she loved them, they had chunks of pineapple..

The service was even better...the waitress was very nice and the  chef came to our table afterwards to bring our flan..best flan ive ever had.. we have our go to spot now in vegas.
