I grew up believing that kimchi was something that adults who liked to live on the edge with bad breath enjoyed. It was spicy, didn't have the best smell and I wasn't quite sure how it made any dish taste better.

Since Yelpers have rarely let me down, after reading so many reviews highlighting the kimchi at KoMex, I couldn't resist adding it to my fusion burrito. Why not? My flavor profile has evolved since the age of 5 and I do like sting that comes with spicy cuisine a little more than I should (empty bottles of chewable Pepto in my purse say so).

How good is the kimchi here? Not only did it turn me, but the next time I went to KoMex, I forgot to get it on my burrito and was very, very sad when I got home and realized this upon the first bite. Don't get me wrong, the fusion burrito puts Chipotle, and every other burrito for that matter, to shame-the flavors are intense, fresh and portion sizes aren't for the faint of heart-but kimchi adds that little extra kick that takes the burrito to the next level. It adds crunch, spice and a little bit of sass. Add some of their homemade hot sauce on there and it will shatter all other burrito eating experiences for you. 

The woman who helped me both times, I think is the owner and she's really friendly! It's not the food or service you'd expect out of this unassuming storefront restaurant, but the quality speaks for itself!
