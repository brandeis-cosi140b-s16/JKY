Stopped in at abuelos after working up a serious appetite shopping at arrowhead mall. What a work out carrying all these bags. I started off with a shrimp cocktail then my entree was the Monterey, that plate was a beast. From the chips and salsa to the entree I couldn't have happier. Our Server Jose was also attentive and made dining there a pleasure. The enchiladas and taco were delicious, I liked the different enchiladas that were served. Variety is always nice. The chips were light and crispy and the salsas were flavorful as well as spicy. We'll definitely come back to the place.
