I love Hawaiian food and this place did not disappoint. Everything is really customizable and their meat tastes great. I love their Kalua pork which seems to be the fan favorite. Their huli huli chicken is great too. As for the steak, it wasn't to my liking but it didn't taste bad. I didn't get to try the mahi mahi, which I probably should have.

I had a Kalua pork burrito with seaweed rice, sour cream, cheese, etc. it was a really good size and filling for a good price.

Next time I go it defiantly need to try the coconut bark. I've heard nothing but good comments on it.
