So after seeing this place get over 4 stars I had to try it. It was bomb! I got the number 1 combo, pork sirloin with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, chilies, home fries and a drink. My friend got the same thing but it was chicken, very good as well. I got the melon drink and fell in love. They have a case full of Mexican pastries, we tried the cheesecake, so good. This isn't a sit place, but don't let that keep you from coming in! Service was fast and friendly and the place was clean. Don't wait as long as I did, you will regret it.
