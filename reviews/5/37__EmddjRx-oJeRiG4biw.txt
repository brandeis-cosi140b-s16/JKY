Jenny and I hit up RAEO because we recently moved to the area so we just MUST try the local food joints. I typically prefer to cheat east, not west, of our place but when you're talking about good mexican food in a little hole in the wall next to a tobacco shop in a we buy gold shopping center, you're going to have to give up on location (doubt they are planning to expand into Kierland or anything). I do wish they were open later but, as I pointed out about the location, I can't fault them for their hours.

Anyways, the food is good and the service is legit. We haven't decided yet if it will be our new "bring out of town visitors here for the good mexican food that is near our place" mostly because of the ambience. It's great for me, fine for Jenny when she's really in the mood for good mexican, but you know how visitors get. Maybe we'll take our most casual friends -- definitely not a place to meet the parents for the first time. 

Recommend the hot dogs and you can't go wrong with any of the tacos. Fish tacos here are better than most places but their carne asada is great for those of you who like to play it safe with a classic order.
