Los Sombreros was truly a WONDERFUL place. We went for lunch, and got the chips with salsa and guacamole, which was the BEST POSSIBLE STARTER!!! For a main course, I got the Carne Asada (beef) and it was amazing! It was the perfect portion, but I had a lot of chips and guacamole, so it may be a little small,or even too small, depending on your appetite. 

Also, we got the Chicken Emoulada, which was delicious. It was not too filling, and even a little tangy, but in the best way possible. It was perfect! 

The service & atmosphere were wonderful. We *thoroughly* enjoyed ourselves!!
