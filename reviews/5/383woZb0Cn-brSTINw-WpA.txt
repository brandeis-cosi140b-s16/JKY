Solid no frills place to grab a quick soft taco uptown. Choices are chicken, beef, and pork. Pork is by far my favorite and you can really taste the difference in how the pork is slow cooked. $3 all in with cheese, lettuce, salsa, and sour cream or ranch. And tax is included! First timers get a free water.  The Seahawks flag is a little sketch in these parts but if you can get over that your tummy will be thanking you.
