I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and just started eating here last year! Crazy...I know! A few months before I had my daughter last year,  a friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch and suggested this place. Always saw it when I would drive by but never went.....until that day....and since then I have been hooked!

The place is small and fills up FAST but the food is worth it and the staff is super friendly! Its the only place to go for Mexican food in the west valley. So if you are in the mood for some really good food, dont waste your money by going to a mexican food chain. Grab the family, friend (s) or a date and head over to Don Rubens. You all will leave happy and and satisfied
