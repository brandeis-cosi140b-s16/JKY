So to be honest,  the fact that it's attached to Saphires almost scared me off. I'm so glad i decided to try it anyway.  Mondays is half price locals and the food is the best Mexican we have had in town (honestly!!!). Atmosphere is classy and sleek.  You SERIOUSLY could bring your kids here. Great margaritas....not a single complaint about this place.
