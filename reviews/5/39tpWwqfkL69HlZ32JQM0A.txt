I am a huge fan when it comes to Chipotle. My proportions aside, this place is one of the fastest growing changes in America. I've not had a bad experince here yet. I don't imagine I will have a bad time here, but I'll leave my future options open. This location is particular was pretty darn classy. 

Here's a trick I picked up:  Order a burrito bowl (for here or to go doesn't matter) and ask for extra rice. Then ask for 2 tortillas and dump the contents onto your tortilla plates. This makes it easier to mix the goodness around and you can eat the plate! I usually roll it into a burrito when its less-than-exploding-mass is all that's left over.
