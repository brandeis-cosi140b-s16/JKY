They were really fast in making their food but it definitely didn't taste like those fast food Mexican places. It really tasted like REAL authentic Mexican food. The flavor that comes out of the tacos were just flourished with the taste of their culture. I loved it! And the price is definitely PERFECT for full-time college students.
