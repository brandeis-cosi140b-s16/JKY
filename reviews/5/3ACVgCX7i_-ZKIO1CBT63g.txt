These tripa tacos are the absolute best tripa tacos I have ever had. I had gotten used to the nasty tripa tacos I used to get in Texas. They were so bad, fried within an inch of their lives and hard as shoe leather. Taco mich has some amazing tripa tacos, and their carne asada tacos are pretty darn good too. Be careful with the red salsa, it is easy too put too much on your tacos and ruin them by making them inedible. The horchata is very tasty as well, none of that overwhelming coconut flavor like at some places.
