Just had early dinner at El Dorado Cantina - it was great.  Food delicious and service marvelous .  Enrique was our server, he was attentive, informative and a really nice guy.  Would ask for him again. Everyone had a different entree and the were all great.  The table side guacamole was made perfectly and the pitcher of margaritas were spot on.  Can't wait to go again.
