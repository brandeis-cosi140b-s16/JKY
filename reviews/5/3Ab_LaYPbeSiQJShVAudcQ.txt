I come about once a week. Its a nice place, good vibes, great service (never had a problem) hookahs are always clean and hit nice. Servers and all employees are awesome and friendly.


Sun-tues by bowl but its more laid back and you can watch football games which is awesome and music isnt too loud.

Thursday - Saturday are pretty poppin musics loud usually tons of people good if your tryin to dance and turn up.

Food is A+ their zookies are delicious,  loved the buffalo sliders. And even the fried gouda mac n cheese bites are bomb. Only problem is food takes alittle while to come out depending in what you get but its totally worth it!

Id give it 4.75 stars due to me thinking there is always room for improvement.
