The best authentic Mexican restaurant in town!!  Everyone who works there are so friendly and make you feel at home!  Their food is super good!  Service is excellent!!  Not to mention that the owner himself -  Raul is there to open the door & welcome you at his new restaurant in Summerlin!!   In addition, the restaurant is festively decorated like a Mexican hacienda!  I just love Don Juan's!!!!
