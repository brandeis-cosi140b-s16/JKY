First of all I just  have to point out that Zabas, in comparison to Chipotle, wait... that's  right.. there is no comparison! Zabas  has more options to choose from, fresher food, and all around better service... I always get the Zaba Bowl with shredded beef, lettuce, potatoes, cheese, and pinto beans..(I even ventured out and got shrimp one time..also fabulous!) The friends I bring here often get the burritos and I've never heard a complaint from any of them. This location(or any of their loacations actually) has never offered any sort of bad service or lack in great food. So, if you ever come for a visit to Las Vegas.. I highly recommend stopping at Zabas!
