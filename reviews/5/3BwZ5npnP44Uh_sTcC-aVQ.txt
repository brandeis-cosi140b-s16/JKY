WE FINALLY FOUND GREAT MEXICAN IN CHARLOTTE and we haven't wavered since! 

Both my boyfriend and I LOVE good Mexican food! We have tried lots of different places in Charlotte but didn't find anything particularly good until we tried 1900.

It's reasonably priced for such great quality! We love their Queso & Fajitas! Definitely a must-try in the Charlotte area---where good mexican is hard to come by!

We've gone so much that the people that work there know us when we walk in or even when we call to place our pick-up order. It's a fun, local, unpretentious, delicious spot!
