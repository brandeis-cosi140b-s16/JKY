This a great healthier fast food.  The chicken is marinated then grilled and taking straight from the grill to your plate.  They have a great  creamy cilantro dressing for the salad.  I'm not a cilantro fan but love this dressing. Great meal at a reasonable price and you won't feel all bloated like regular fast food. Great place for a family lunch or dinner.
