I grew up going to Matta's on Main St. Followed them when they opened on Higley/Brown and once again when they opened a location at Riverview.  I've been to the location on Power 3 times now and love it.  I've ordered the nachos suprema (not on the menu but available) and have also had a Robert's taco combo plate. Both were fantastic. I feel like they're still trying to get the details of day to day business figured out but I'm sure that will come with time. There's been an overwhelming response to this new location and I don't know if they had counted on just big the demand would be.  It's been packed every time I've gone, but I will continue to wait for great food.
