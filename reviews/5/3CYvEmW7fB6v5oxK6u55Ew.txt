All-around fantastic. My husband and I stopped in around 6:30 last Saturday night and  were told to expect a 40-minute wait. We decided to wait next door at the Johnson Public House. I hardly had time to finish my glass of wine at JPH before we got the text that our table was ready, 15 minutes earlier than expected. We were lucky enough to have the best seats in the house: right by the window, but also in view of the very talented dough-tosser in the kitchen. We ordered the fig and bacon pizza (with kalamata olives instead of bacon on one half). It was fabulous. The gorgonzola perfectly complemented the figs and balsamic-red wine reduction. And the crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy soft within. The service was wonderful as well; our waiter was knowledgable and prompt and made us feel very welcome. 

All in all it was a very special experience. I can't wait to go back this weekend and try the basic tomato pie. YUM.
