Sabor Latin Street Grill is basically magic. After discovering Sabor last June it became a quick favorite (the kind of favorite you have to go to every Monday night to get two steak tacos or one of the amazing arepas - just to shake things up a bit). Wait time on food can vary a bit depending on how busy they are, but the food quality never suffers. Fresh salsa bar, free chips when you check in (heyyyyy), consistently delicious food, what more could you want? If you have never been to Sabor Latin Street Grill, do yourself a favor and get over to this hidden Elizabeth gem.
