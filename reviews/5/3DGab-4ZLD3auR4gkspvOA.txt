Ballys casino has a brand new Mexican restaurant.  We got to check it out on its 2nd day opened.  They have a very friendly staff.  We ordered house made guacamole.  They bring a cart up to your table and make it fresh in front of you.  Excellent avocados and freshly made chips.  This place has over 43 different tequilas at the bar.  If you want to come here for just drinks, this a worthy spot.  You can drink tequila straight up or enjoy an interesting list of drink creations.  The hours are Noon - 6am everyday.  Happy hour 3-5pm and 10pm-midnight where tacos are just $2.00!  So people in Vegas now have a quality restaurant to eat at for late night food.  My friend ordered the shrimp salad and I got the steak fajitas.  The fajitas were cooked great, served with sour cream, pico, guacamole, black beans and tortillas.  They add certain spices to tweak the flavor of the dish.  Tequila Taqueria is a small new spot inside Ballys with access to great tequila and Mexican dishes, this spot for sure is a winner.  I live in Texas where we eat Mexican food all the time and I would highly recommend this spot.
