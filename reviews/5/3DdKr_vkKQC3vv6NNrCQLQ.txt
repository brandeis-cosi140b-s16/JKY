I have been religiously coming here for months...simply stated everything is delicious.  

Ever since moving to Pittsburgh three years ago, I've been dying for a good Mexican place.  I've had to sustain my Mexican food craving on Chipotle, but then Los Cabos popped up and it's like a whole new world. The people working there are super friendly, it is byob with a six pack shop just down the street, and if that's not enough the food is phenomenal. The menu is exactly like what you would find in San Diego, down to the horchata and carne asada fires.  If you dont know what to get, start with the California burrito.  You cant go wrong with meat and potatoes.  Also, I highly recommend any burrito with fries in it, the chimichanga, and shrimp ceviche.  Come hungry though, the portions are substantial and you will inhale the free chips and salsa they give you while you're waiting for food.
