Great!  fast breakfast lunch dinnerMexican food. Muy Saboso!
I've grown-up in the southwest and know good Mexican food when I find it. This place used to be called Armando's but has recently changed hands, however the food is just downright tasty.The green sauce and red sauce are flavorful and just hot enough.anything with chicken is juicy and tender. The beans are cooked to perfection in. I haven't tried the breakfast Barito selections yet. They do have green chilies from New Mexico which is a real plus in Arizonaso give this place a shot when you're working late at night and you need to get a quick fix in the neighborhood.
