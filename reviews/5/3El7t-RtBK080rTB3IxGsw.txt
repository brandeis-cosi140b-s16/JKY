My first experience at Chipotle was here and I'm glad I chose those place. Since it was my first time there, they were pretty patient with me on me deciding what I wanted, but I ended up getting a chicken burrito that was huge and kept me full and so happy I didn't waste money on a skimpy meal somewhere else that's usually $20 bucks. Great staff, friendly and fast service. I will go back anytime I'm at Scottsdale Fashion Square :)
