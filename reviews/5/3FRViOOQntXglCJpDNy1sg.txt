To be honest, I'm surprised this place is only a three star. I live close by and frequent this place a lot. Very good customer service every time I go there. Usually get my order taken from a shorter older lady or a younger skinny guy. Their tacos are the small kind and so delicious every time. When I do eat in, I always order the churros with ice cream dessert. Also, I am a spicy LOVER, and they have a really spicy habanero sauce. If it's spicy for ME, then it will destroy YOU lol. Five stars from me!
