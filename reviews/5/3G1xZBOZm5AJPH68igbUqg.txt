Okay, it's 4am and you want something, greasy, fried, with meat and cheese, you want to stuff yourself silly just because you can and you don't want to spend more than...$8.  Where do you go?

This place.

It is packed, always.  But, the line moves quick, you can literally see all the food made by in right in front of you, including tortillas from scratch.

They have lengua fries!?  I love lengua, and I love carne asada fries, but the only way I could think to make asada fries better would be to swap out lengua, and this place does it!  And!?  They are amazing.

The tacos are super cheap and really really fresh, they have loads of drink choices as well as a huge variety of grilled Mexican goodies on request (jalapenos, onions, that sort of thing).

Serious, for delicious, grubby, 24 hour mexican food, it doesn't get better than this.
