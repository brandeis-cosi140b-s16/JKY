My two boys had the kids cheese quesadilla and loved them. My husband and I shared the carne asada nachos which were amazing and worth coming back for. We all shared rolled chicken tacos which we felt were a bit bland, but adding salsa from the salsa bar quickly livened them up. Service was friendly and small tables were clean. All my boys loved the horchata.  We'll be back next time we are in town.
