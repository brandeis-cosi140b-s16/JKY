What a fun little place with phenomenal food!  I let them know it was my first time and they offered me a taste of each of their meats, all of which were delicious.  The set up is kind of like a Chipotle, where you select your meat and then go down the line of toppings telling them what you would like to add to your taco or burrito.  But the quality of ingredients is FAR superior.  Be sure and pay for a side of chips because you will want to try each of the salsas.  Super yum to everything.  If this place had alcohol I would become a regular.
