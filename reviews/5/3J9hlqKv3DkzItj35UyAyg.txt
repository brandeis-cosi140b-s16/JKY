You can never go wrong with this place! It's tasty and different from most other Mexican joints. I always get a craving for it late at night which is perfect because they never close. I have always liked their taquitos. It's a bit divey but I've never gotten sick from here, so I have no complaints. There's sticker machines and such for kids to use as well. The menu is huge, and you'll find yourself looking over it for a long Time. I love it here!
