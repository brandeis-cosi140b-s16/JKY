Went here a couple of times but the last time I was here really stood out to me and will make me a local for this Mexican joint. We came here a week after my girlfriend's birthday. I ordered my girl one of those bomb mango margaritas...frickin delicious! But as we were finishing up all the employees, cooks included came out of the back and sang happy birthday to my girlfriend! Mind you I didn't even tell them it was her birthday. They must have noticed the date on the ID when checking her age. They got her a churro cake and a shot of tequila on the house!! We were both blown away and had me cracking up the way they made her take the shot! Lol love the crew here. Family owned local restaurant check them out!
