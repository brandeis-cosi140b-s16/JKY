From the street, it may look modest, but go inside to eat and I think you will be pleasantly surprised. It has a great menu with lots of things I want to try. On our first visit there, we had the Burrito Cuco's which is very yummy. I had an excellent peach margarita (medium, which is pretty big).  Bring the kids. We brought our 3 and 6 year olds, and their kids menu extends beyond Mexican into standard U.S. kids-menu fare such as chicken nuggets and hot dogs. Excellent value and service over other places in town. We plan on going back again and again.
