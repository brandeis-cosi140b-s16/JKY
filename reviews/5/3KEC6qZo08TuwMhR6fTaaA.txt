My husband and sons are huge fans of New Mexican Grill.  Went there today for lunch.  The nachos with carne asada were awesome!  As we were finishing lunch they brought over a bowl of cinnamon  crisps.  What a nice touch!  Definitely worth going the staff is really friendly, the green sauce is amazing and the cost for lunch for 5 was under $50!
