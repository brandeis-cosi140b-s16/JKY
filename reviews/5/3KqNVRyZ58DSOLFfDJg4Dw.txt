I'm sort of a Mexican food junkie. Constantly in search of the ultimate green chili (chile verde) burrito. I didn't see green chile on their menu, so I figured I'd try their take on a burrito stand staple: the mighty Carne Asada. The burrito was good. Beef was tender and flavorful, well seasoned. as any that I've had recently. Moist, but not filled with the juices the way that they can be sometimes (not that I necessarily mind them juicy, it's just a little messier). The pico de gallo had fresh chopped jalape√±os in it, which was a bit of refreshing spice. Guacamole tasted freshly made. The tortilla was appropriately chewy and slightly crunchy the way they are if their done right. Not the biggest burrito I've had, but a decent portion, maybe slightly undersized for the price. But I would eat it again.
