I'm from Mexicali, where the street tacos are AMAZING. I've been in Phoenix for over 2 years and I can genuinely say that I FOUND A LEGIT TACO STAND

The salsa bar is cool: BEWARE of the salsa roja because it's spicy

Customer service is great! The cashier is the owner's son. 

If you're from Mexico or SoCal, this is the place to go.
