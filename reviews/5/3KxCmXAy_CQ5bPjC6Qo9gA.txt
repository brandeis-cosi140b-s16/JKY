We try to go to Naked City Pizza every time we come to Las Vegas so it was a natural that we go to Desnudo Tacos, their sister restaurant right next store.  Needless to say Desnudo did not disappoint.   Simple environment, you sit at picnic tables, but very clean and the employees are very polite and helpful.

Since it was our first time, we ordered simply.  Guacamole and chips to start.  The guacamole was fresh and obviously homemade and the chips are made order. Very tasty.  Next, tacos.  We ordered Carbon (skirt steak) and Carne Desebrado (crispy shredded beef). Both were very delicious and offered different favors for the pallet.   Each order included two tacos for only $7!  The tacos have two tortillas each so they can be split to make four if you have a larger group. Next, a side of beans and a side of rice which were both excellent as well.  

This location is a five minute drive from the strip and offers top quality food for a fraction of the price, a must stop for the taco, torta, or burrito enthusiast.
