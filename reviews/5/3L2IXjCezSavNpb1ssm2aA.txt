must haves: table side guacomole, Javiers's top shelf margarita, and the steak and lobster (if you are feeling fancy) or carne asada(every other 364 days of the year). We went for new years eve and ordered the steak and lobster...sigh. I was actually nervous ordering it from a mexican resturant but it was great. They can prepare it several different ways but we went with the waiter's favorite. Spicy and a new twist on a familar pairing made it reinvented completely. I have eaten there probably 100 times and if I can I will eat there 100 times more.
