Only place in Vegas that has Sinaloense style sushi ....I am a huge sushi fan so i know good sushi!!! They also have mariscos which makes them have a variety because not every1 one likes sushi. I really enjoyed the shrimp with cream cheese inside deep fried. The only thing that was not to good was the soy sauce they prepared, it was extremely diluted. Other then that the service was exceptional, and everything was served at a timely manner. The place is also keep very clean, which is a huge plus!!
