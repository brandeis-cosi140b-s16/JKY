Perfect hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant! Quint,authentic, family owned, just the perfect atmosphere.Great Margaritas! which is always what breaks or makes a Mexican restaurant for me. My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first, just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall,' but they turned out to be great... then again it was my first experience eating oysters... We all ordered burritos which were also very good, I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken. I mean why do restaurants always advertise white meat chicken anyways?  that's what usually steers me away from ever ordering chicken in the first place! For sure gotta come back to try more of their menu!
