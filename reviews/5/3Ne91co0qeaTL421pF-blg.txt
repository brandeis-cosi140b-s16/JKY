We were dropping off her kids at Grand Canyon University this week and yelped for a good Mexican restaurant locally. This had the best reviews so we came and it even exceeded our expectations. You have to try the mango margarita it is stellar. The tacos were good, everything fresh with oversized portions. I had a breaded calamari fillet with garlic butter and I wish I could drive back to Arizona from California just to eat it once a week. You will not be disappointed.
