The service is excellent,  very friendly staff.  The owners work as servers as well.  The entire staff is very knowledgeable about their food.  
The food has its own unique flavor.  They have a lot seafood fare as well, Mexican Baja style.  The fish tacos are especially good.   

I'm from the Midwest originally and the down home atmosphere I feel when dining there makes you feel like a local. They truly appreciate you eating at their place.

The combination of service, atmosphere and quality of food makes this not only one of our favorite restaurants but our favorite Mexican restaurant.
