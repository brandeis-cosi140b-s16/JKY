What an incredible restaurant. 

My family tends to seek out the best Mexican restaurants wherever we are, and this is definitely it in Las Vegas. The location is definitely odd, but the inside is incredibly inviting.

The food is fantastic. From the different salsas to the fried ice cream, El Dorado Cantina has not disappointed me. I love the carne asada burrito; I crave it. The steak is definitely the best out of chicken, shrimp, and steak, but they are all good. The chef regularly comes into the dining room to greet the guests, and he is incredibly friendly. It really makes dining here a special experience. 

This is my idea of a hidden gem in Vegas, and I certainly hope more people are able to discover it.
