I was very impressed!!!  From the moment we entered we were welcomed and enjoyed every moment.  I ordered the combo plate, I figured that the taco, enchilada, and green tamale would be a good gage as to wether they are worth coming back.  I am so sick of horrible mexican food, that was not the case with my dinner.  My husband had the enchilada style burro, red beef, he was not disappointed either.  Both of us won the clean plate award at dinner!  This is not usually the case.  We will be back!!!
