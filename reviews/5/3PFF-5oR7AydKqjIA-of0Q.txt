I tried to get in for dinner last night, and I couldn't!  Awesome that, for a new hotel/restaurant, they already have such a problem!  I just noticed, too, that they are a "a Joie de Vivre Hotel."  I love these hotels because they emphasize the experience with all the "little somethings" that make you feel good about being there.
