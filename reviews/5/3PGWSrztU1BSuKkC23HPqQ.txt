With a stroke of luck I randomly strolled into this place after getting hungry walking up Fremont street.  There were a couple of shady-looking characters wandering about outside, but where in Vegas are there not?

My girl ordered shrimp cocktail and the papano fajita platter (I think that was the name).  I was going to order the chimichanga dinner but the lady told us we were getting too much food so I canceled the chimi and sure enough, the shrimp cocktail and cuban fajita platter were plenty for two.  Really, really tasty.  The service wasn't great but the food and price more than made up for it.

We went twice.  On the second visit, I finally did get the chimichanga and it was perfect.  We also tried their "old laundry" Cuban soup (ropa vieja) which was awesome, and fried platains which were great.  

This place has a great "down home" feel.
