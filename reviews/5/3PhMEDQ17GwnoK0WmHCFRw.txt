I've hit up Johnny Burrito's for lunch a few times in the past but I've never been a big burrito fan. I'm not sure what was different today but my regular size, ground beef burrito was damn good.  I threw in a $.46 moon pie to top off the lunch.

We could have started a new trend, "Burrito Monday" in our office.
