Of my favorite Mexican style Restaurants. You line up and direct them how you want your meal prepared.  The food is fresh. The place is clean. The menu is simple, yet enough choices to find what is right for you. I use my Zaba's reward card, after so many meals, then you get a free meal. I frequent this place often.
