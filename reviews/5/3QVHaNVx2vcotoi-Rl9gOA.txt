Absolutely Amazing! From the service ( Leana rocks) to the salsa (green salsa!!) To the amazing meals. 5 stars across the board. Very cozy ambiance, great patio and pretty solid drinks. Not overly priced for what you get , my only complaint was the chimi was more tortilla than filling but still fantastic. Highly, highly recommended!
