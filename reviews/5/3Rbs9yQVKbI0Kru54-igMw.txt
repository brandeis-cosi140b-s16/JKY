Wow.  Second time there and they are so impressive.  Order a tostada, they make their own.  Fresh, hot, fried, delicious.

I had a steak quesadilla that was stuffed with peppers and steak.  I dined in this time and the restaurant was generous with their chips and salsa.  The serving was huge and I had to take some of the quesadilla home.  Authentic Mexican rice.  It was light and fluffy without being too salty.  It was divine.
