Ate here again recently. This time, I got the carne asada fries. I was greeted and served by this friendly guy. He even checked up on me after a few minutes to make sure I was enjoying my meal.

The carne asada fries themselves were pretty good. Since I ate at the restaurant, it was served on a covered plate. They even gave me napkins, which is always a necessity at Mexican joints.

The portion was huge, comparable to that of other Mexican spots. I even had enough left over for half a dinner. The guy who served me did not hesitate to give me a to-go container when I asked for it.

The red sauce and the picked carrots, jalapenos, and onions were also good. The carrots were crunchy but still had a degree of softness that made them enjoyable. The jalapenos, however, were lacking that small level of spiciness, but I still enjoyed them.

When I left, I said thank you as I enjoyed the meal and the service. Replying to me was this nice lady who said "gracias" as I left. Now that's friendliness, which I really appreciate.

I'll post a picture of my meal once I figure out how to do it. And I'll definitely keep coming back to this place when I'm nearby.
