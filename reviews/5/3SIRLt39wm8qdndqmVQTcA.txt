This business has not closed.  A few months ago the name changed to Papa Chevo's, but everything else is exactly the same.  I tried to update it with Yelp HQ a month or so ago, and they said No mas.  Then I uploaded some pics so hopefully it will get corrected.  It is not closed as Kirk R. mentioned in his review update.  I got some tasty enchiladas there this afternoon.
