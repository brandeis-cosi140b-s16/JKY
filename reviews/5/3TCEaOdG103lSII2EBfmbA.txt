Aranda's is DELISH!! Me and my husband's favorite place for some awesome Mexican food! The owner and all of their waiters and waitresses are so down to earth! Everyone is alway eager to serve you! Our favorite waiter is Fabian! The margaritas, mojitos, and of course beer is wonderful! They have a huge menu and literally everything we have tried is good! My faves are the shimp tacos, burritos verdes, and burrito croqueta! YUM! You always get fresh, crispy chips and salsa! They have a very good white queso dip too and of course guac! In the summer we love to sit outside too!  Awesome place, awesome staff! They also own La Tolteca in Portage and Sun Prairie!
