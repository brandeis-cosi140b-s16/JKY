These had to have been the best pupusas I've ever tasted - and the largest!  We got two pupusas each for an appetizer and a meal.  The pupusas were enormous and the platter (pollo asado) was piled high.  I can't wait to go back and try the corn tamales.  

The prices are very reasonable; the staff was so friendly and most importantly the food was so delicious.  I can't wait to go back !
