Beautifully authentic classy mexican food vegas style!! My girl friend and I felt right at home with Eduardo and his lovely team mates.

Chips and salsa arrive quickly as we decide on a casa margarita and jalapeño margarita.  Fancy handshaken margaritas for the win. I also try the Mexican margarita which is with fresh lime only which I prefer to the jalapeño margarita.

My shrimp Javier's chopped salad was yummy!! They managed not to overcook the shrimp.  My friend loves her crispy taco and enchilada combo.

Wish we could come back soon!! Aria has a great variety of spots.  This restaurant was happening and we really appreciated the lovely service and spacious booth for 2 female diners.
