NEW MEXICAN FOOD not MEXICAN.  that is what i think alot of the neg reviews come from.   I have been to the South Phx location and this location is only a few miles from my home.  i dont really understand some peoples judgements....just because its in a strip mall doesnt make it a bad place.  if your from the south or the midwest and used to free standing places get over that. you will miss out on some of the best dining in the valley.  not just this place.  we went on saturday 6/2 at about 545pm an early dinner for us.  like 99% of downtown eateries it was not crowded at all. probably about 12 people in the place. the margaritas were great.  more importantly the food was great NEW mexican food. HOT HOT HOT.  if you dont like spicy dont come here. its not for you.  if you like to have your eyes water this is the place. 

ive been here a few times and im not really sure what the complaints are about the service.  they have always been very nice and very FAST service. first we ordered our massive margaritas which also came out surprisling fast.  we ordered our dinners and within 10min the food was in front of us.  i think the longest we have ever waited was maybe 20min.  

to people reading the reviews...spicy is HOT.  There is nothing at the chain type places that compare to the heat you get with these dinners.  the green chili salsa is probably the best in the valley.  the red is right up there too.  

usually when i do go i order one of the specials or something the waiter recommends i have yet to be let down.
