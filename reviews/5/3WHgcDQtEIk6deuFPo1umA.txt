After my big move from Texas to Arizona my first order of business was looking for a good mexican place. Although this place looks like a mexican restaurant gone corporate, I gave it a try and I was not disappointed. So far I have tried the rolled tacos with shredded beef and I've tried the mexican torta. The rolled tacos came with fresh avocados, something you don't readily see at a fast food mexican joint. The green sauce and side of red sauce were the perfect companion. They also coat the tacos in sour cream and crumbly white cheese which made them all that much better. The torta was equally good but a little too nice and neat for me, I am used to a well designed mess in a bun. The Horchata was also good, not too sweet and not too watered down. The only complaint I have is that it's a little pricier than most fast food mexican joints like filibertos and the like, but I can't complain too much because the food was well made and well worth the price. I venture to say that this might just well become my regular mexican place, sorry Humbertos.
