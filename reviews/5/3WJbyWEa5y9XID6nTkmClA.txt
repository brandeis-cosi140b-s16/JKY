Salsarita's is by far my favorite of the "fast food, prepare it in front of you Mexican chains" (Chipotle, Qdoba, Moes, Taco Bell (if that one even counts)).  The Cotswold location is the closet to me so that's where I'll go if I get a hankering for their amazing chips and some tacos. 

The food is always good and consistent.  I like the soft tacos (one chicken, one pork) and I love that they give free guacamole (lookin at you, Chipotle...).  The service is always pleasant and friendly.  I've had their catering at church events and it is on par with their fresh preparation.  

Also, the new vinaigrette they have is INCREDIBLE!  I can't remember the title of it, but some sort of honey lime or something?? It's so good and adds so much to the tacos. 

Overall, I would pick Salsarita's over any of those other chains any day.
