I dig a dive, or a hole in the wall. It's like finding buried treasure.  This is the pot o" gold at the end of the rainbow...$2 fabulous authentic tacos. Cheaper than a trip to Mexico. The perfect food to fuel a day of exploring the strip or an evening of dancing. Fast, friendly, fabulous!  I've just shared a Yelp secret.  Just between you and me...this is the bomb.
