I've had their dinner numerous times & have always enjoyed it, but this is the first time I've had their breakfast,  and I've got to say..... DAMN! I absolutely loved it! I had the green pork & eggs & my husband had the green chilli biscuits & gravy. Both were phenomenal! They have a Benedict that looks great. We will definitely go back. If you like spicy New Mexican breakfast, you have to check this place out.
