This place is a tad more expensive compared to your typical Mexican restaurant, but it is worth it. They do not shove you into a seat and out the door like most Mexican restaurants do. We had great service. They really took the time to make sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff members were extremely friendly. The food was AWESOME. They give you chips, salsa, and a green dip (cilantro salsa) when you first sit down which tasted great. I ordered the La Unica Burrito without the red sauce, with beef, and a side of rice and beans. It tasted great. Rice was probably the best rice I have had at a Mexican restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the pollo fundido. He always orders this at every Mexican restuarant. He said he was disappointed that the cheese on it was shredded/melted instead of the cheese dip, so you may want to request the cheese dip instead. Overall a great experience. We sat at the bar and they let us put the game on we wanted to watch and gave us the remote to turn up the volume. I will go back for sure. We stayed at the Best Western and walked right over. Super awesome. We did both order margaritas. There was too much sweet and sour mix for my taste. I am just not a big fan of places that pre-make their mix with the alcohol already in it. They were not super strong, but not super weak either. I think next time I will ask for an extra shot in it though. Try it out.
