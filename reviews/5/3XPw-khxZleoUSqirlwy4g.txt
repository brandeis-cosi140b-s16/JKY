Did someone say Machaca!? My all time favorite Phoenix Mexican food restaurant (Notice I say Phoenix and not authentic! So don't attack :) )! I don't tend to stray from my Machaca Chimichanga with Christmas sauce very often. But when I do, I don't miss my regular too much, because everything is so good. All their ingredients are top notch and super fresh. Nothing ever sit's under the heat lamp for too long (very typical in Mexican food restaurants.) They have happy hour every day from 3-7pm as far as I can tell its only drinks, but their menu is reasonable all the way around so no worries. Their Margarita's are on point. They have tons of dinning, bar, and patio seating. But expect a wait if you come around 7pm. This place is always busy. The staff is always friendly and keep up pretty well for how busy they get. But lets get back to the Machaca... the most tender, juicy, flavorful beef you will ever try. Seasoned and cooked to perfection. I recommend it for any of their dishes. I of course prefer it wrapped in a tortilla, deep fried, and covered in both red and green sauce. If you haven't tried it... do so NOW! You wont be disappointed. 

Great place for families, a casual date, lunch, Happy Hour, dinner for one, and pretty much anyone. Unless you are looking for a fancy, quiet meal. Like I've said, its always busy.
