I LOVE LOVE this place. I literally drive from GOODYEAR to go there and have lunch  40 Miles... 

The Food is way way above par.  and the staff who have all been there for years are the nicest people on the east side.  They dont remember my name but he and she always remember my Ice Tea and My Chimi.

Such a relaxing a great place to eat.  

Another little fact their Pico De Gayo and Picante Sauce is even sold in SAMS CLUBS!
