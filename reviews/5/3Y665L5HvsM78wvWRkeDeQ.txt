Sooo good.

I love cheap burritos (as vegan as they can possibly get). I've eaten a lot of them. This one particular burrito I had was sooo good. I will remember it forever. I got some Sierra Nevada from a neighboring liqour store, kicked up my feet at a 29usd a night hotel, and watched Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. 

It was a beautiful experience. [I like Roberto's even better than Farolito on 24th in SF, I thnk. Shhh! Don't tell.]
