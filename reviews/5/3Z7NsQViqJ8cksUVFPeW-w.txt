Diego Pops, is a modern tequila and taco lounge/ restaurant! I love it! It's not what you think it is coming from the outside but everything about the logo and what they are about is true! Neon, modern edgy and of course the decor inside is what made me love it more! The service was wonderful not too rushed and we probably came at the wrong time but that didn't stop me. I've been hearing about the Nachos, it's not just any nachos it's the Brussels sprout nachos! From the flavor to the cheese and to the ingredients everything is so outstanding in flavor! You see I never had a Brussels sprout but it's kinda like a more flavorful broccoli! I give it 2 thumbs up! They also have different sauces from chipotle mayo to a Serrano ranch! Tacos are outstanding but it's based on one, there's so much more j want to try! Cocktails and the specialty drinks are wonderful and different! Must try the coconut drink it comes in vodka and tequila! So if you are in the Scottsdale area give it a try stop by! By yourself or with you or friends!
