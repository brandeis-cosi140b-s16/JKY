Eat here!  Bring your family and friends here!

My husband would make fun of the concept of an enchilada place as we drove by, but one I night I said we were eating there anyway and he loved the food as much as I did!

I've had both the chicken and the beef and both were delicious.  Green sauce recommended!  I've heard from others I have taken that the spinach and mushroom filling is even better than the beef.

Only issue is the line can get a bit backed up with all the options they have and people going in their first time.  It would be great if they could also put some guidance as to the options on the glass between the customers and the enchiladistas so you didn't have to keep stepping back and looking up.

I plan on going back at least weekly...and I don't think my husband will mind either :)
