If you want delicious, authentic food in a laid back environment, I highly recommend La Taqueria! My boyfriend and I purchased a groupon and decided to check it out, and we are glad we did. The service was outstanding, and I can't compliment our waitress enough (unfortunately I didn't ask for her name). She made our experience very entertaining and was very outgoing.

In a previous review someone commented on the salsa being too hot. When we sat down, our waitress brought us chips and salsa but offered to bring us one that was more mild if we preferred. 

In all, Mouthwatering Food and Exceptional Service!
