I'm basing this on only one experience at lunch, but it was excellent!

I was having lunch by myself at the end of a weekend with friends in vegas before heading to airport, and decided to hit Border Grill since I hadn't been there before and it was close (we stayed at THEhotel).  

At the server's suggestion, I had the daily special chicken and fruit salad.   I had been thinking I was in the mood for more traditional mexican, but he spoke so highly of the salad that I went with his recommendation.   And, I was SO glad i did! 

It had a great combination of flavors - peaches, nectarines, mangoes, black cherries, spicy sunflower seeds, marinated chicken, and boston lettuce all with an apricot jalapeno dressing.   YUM!  

The service was also very attentive, with multiple folks checking up on me regularly.  

It was only one experience, but based on that one time, I will certainly try it again next time I'm in vegas.   I hope they add that salad to their normal menu!
