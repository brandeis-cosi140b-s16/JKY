Thanking God for everything! Beautiful Sunday Morning! My first born son, birthday is coming up so quick! Just thinking how blessed I am to have so many beautiful children! And praying one day to be a better father to them all. Del Taco's breakfast menu is amazing! I am so very happy with this choice. I pray, they continue to serve this community with love and compassion, In Jesus Name, I pray! Amen! And always remember the customer is their priority, even if the customer is homeless! Treat every customer with respect no matter their social class! -Brother Jenkins
