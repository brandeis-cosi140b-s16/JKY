Seriously. This is the best rubios ever.

The workers are amazing. Every time, and I mean every time I'm greeted by a friendly, "hello welcome to rubios." I'm helped promptly, and the food comes fast.

I come every Tuesday after 230p for the tacos at 1.5. And I add a chips and guacamole for 1 dollar more! 

The place is spotless clean, salsas are consistently fresh and delicious, and I love the food.
