Like the other reviewers, I could have sworn this place was called El Patio! Hmm. Mysteries abound. Never the less, this place is a find. Located just across the street from the UNLV student union, it became a quick "between classes" place to grab a bite. In a town full of chains, this little gem is hidden away, but so worth the find. For UNLV students, they have $1.95 margaritas.  You read me right. A DOLLAR NINETY FIVE. I was sure they would be in shot glasses, but noooo.  standard size.  Ok, so they aren't using Patron in these, but hey.  They have yummy, authentic mexican food at "how do they pay the rent on this place" prices. I usually get the El Pastor tacos (yummo and a buck something apiece), but my friends love their quesadilla's and nachos too. The decor is a bit rough around the edges, but it's clean and the staff is awesome. There are even a couple couches in there for a little lounge if it be your pleasure. Check this place out!
