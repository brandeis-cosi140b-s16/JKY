It's a chain, but I love it! Practically everything we have ordered here is fantastic! I usually get a southwestern Caesar salad with no chicken sub shrimp! It is the best Caesar salad. The jerk chicken salad is awesome as well, as is the chopped chicken salad. 

Sometimes we go for happy hour because their half off specials are amazing. They used to have the most delicious nachos with black beans, but they have since vanished from the menu. Oh how I long for those nachos, haha. The shrimp dumplings are top notch, and the ahi is delectable. Misses are the catfish beignets and the fish tacos, just didn't hit the spot. 

We go here all the time- the servers are attentive and always remember our quirks and orders.
