Want good Mexican?  Go to Algobertos and order the Chicken Burrito with rice, beans, cheese, pico, sour cream and guacamole and you will think you died and went to Heaven, that's right, it's that good!! Sadly, I've lived here 15 years and it took that long to find a Burrito shop as good as the one's in the Bay Area (sorry, Roberto's I'm not a fan:(.  The only problemo is that I live waaaay South!
My mom's Chile Verde burrito was delicioso too.
