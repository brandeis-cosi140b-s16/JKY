The first time we are here our waitress was rude but the food was amazing. Thank goodness we gave it another try because it's become our Friday night happy hour spot. Love that they give you a large portion of chips with salsa AND bean dip which is really good. They also have a FABULOUS skinny margarita and amazing fish tacos. We have never had a bad meal and thankfully that rude waitress is no longer there. Ask for Vince and you will get the best service. Portions are big enough to take home and to-go orders usually come with chips and dips too! This place is just easy and the outdoor patio is nice especially when a fire is lit in the fireplace.
