Woah man, fresh ice cream! Crazy flavors! Normal ones too!
This place is the real deal. All their ice cream flavors are rich, complex, and utterly realistic. 
Most of the ice cream names are in Spanish.
They let you try before you buy.
My favorite flavors are Chongos (idk what kind of tasty magic they put in it, but I'm under its spell), and the orange one. Don't remember what it's called but it's the orange one that doesn't taste fruity. I'm sure if you ask for that description they'll know what you mean.
They also have rose flavored ice cream, with little bits of petals in it. Tastes just like they smell...rosey.
Definitely an experience and a delicious one at that.
This is my favorite ice cream place in the whole wide world.
