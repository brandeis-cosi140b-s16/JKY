My fianc√© and I have been to The Revival three or four times now and the food is so delicious! We have had the green chili pork tacos, the chipotle braised rib tacos, and the carne asada tacos. We also just had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Best I have ever had!!! 

The staff is nice and the ambiance of the whole restaurant is relaxed and comfortable.

I would definitely recommend giving them a try!!
