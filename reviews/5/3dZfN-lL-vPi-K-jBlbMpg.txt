Great food, clean atmosphere!  First timer and love a mean green chili.  Went with the El Jefe burrito based on recommendations here and was so happy I did.  My husband and I both had the same.  We will add this place to our regular lunch spots.  The place filled up after 12pm so try and hit it a little earlier.  Thanks Yelp and Espos!
