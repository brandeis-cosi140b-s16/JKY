This is brand new place with a new crew. So a wait time is expected, I will not give them grief for that. You try being in their shoes. 

Anywayyyy, onto the review

The tots they use in their sides are fried perfectly. Light and crisp and a punch of flavor. I love them. The nacho tots are ridiculous.  Definitely a brand new guilty pleasure. I also tried the Seattle which is basically a burrito form of a fish sandwich.  There was a bit too much tartar sauce but not enough to ruin it. The  slaw they use is nice and dry so it picks up a lot of the sauce and flavor from the fish. The fish is a great quality as well, nice and flakey.  

I was absolutely delighted by this place and the staff. I will be returning. 

Keep up the good work!
