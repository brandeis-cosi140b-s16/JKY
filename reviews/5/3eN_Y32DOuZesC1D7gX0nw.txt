Can't get over some of the negative posts. This is (in my opinion) far and above the best Mexican restaurant around. My husband and I order our favorite everytime we go...The Ultimate Fajita (one's big enough for us to share). This plate has it all: Beef, Pork, Cicken, & Shrimp w/butter dipping sauce plus rice, beans and a sample serving of corn pudding & guacamole. It is absoluely spectacular! Everything tastes home-made. Love their salsa and thin, crisp chips. As someone else mentioned, the tortillas are made fresh on-site. We go to Chevy's frequently and have them punch a card offered by the restaurant which eventually resuls in a free entre! We always experience curteous, efficient  service. Oh, and by the way, someone in another post referred to a small mom & pop restaurant in Holland, Michigan called Margarita's. We're transplants from that area and compare Chevy's favorably with the former favorite in our home State. Coming from us, that's a big compliment!
