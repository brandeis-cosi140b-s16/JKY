Move over, former favorite Mexican restaurants... there's a new restaurant on top!  While I cannot pronounce the name and therefore struggle to convince friends and family to try it, this is hands down the best Mexican food in Madison.  The salsa bar is great, as previous reviewers noted.  The kids menu (albeit written on a board) is really generous - $3.50 for nice helpings of rice and beans, and a gordita, taco, or quesadilla. My husband and I each had taco dinners (rice and beans and three tacos), and they were great.  Not your run-of-the-mill meats and flavors, but meat choices the included pork rinds, tripe, etc., as well as the traditional chicken and beef. 

The staff was very friendly.  One lady even struck up a conversation with my 5 year old, and showed him all kinds of pictures of ruins, etc., and gave him a calendar he's thrilled with.  So we not only had some awesome, reasonably-price Mexican food, but my son got a little history lesson and is phyched to learn more.  We will definitely return.
