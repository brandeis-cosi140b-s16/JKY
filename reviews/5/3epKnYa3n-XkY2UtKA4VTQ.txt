I am happy to report that this location is just as good as Central Ave!  I was working in Huntersville and I saw the Three Amigos logo out of the corner of my eye, I couldn't believe my eyes!!  I went to work and made a plan for everyone to have a margarita after work!  Who could say no to that?

I ordered what I always order, guacamole and chicken enchiladas verde.  Delicioso!
If you like spicy food, make sure you ask for the salsa verde, it's pureed jalapeno. You're welcome! lol The guacamole with a drizzle of the salsa verde makes me sing (and cry from hotness sometimes)

This atmosphere is shiny and new, but it's in a newish shopping center, everything can't have charm like Central Ave!

Three Amigos always has drink specials, kid's nights, contests, make sure you read the board!!!
