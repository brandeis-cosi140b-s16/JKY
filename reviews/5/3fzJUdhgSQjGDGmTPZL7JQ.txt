I live in Mexico City so I know good Mexican food.  This place is legit.  The pork belly tacos were amazing,  and 3 dollar Margaritas were served strong, but were still pretty tasty.  My favorite was the Mexican street corn though.  If you aren't a meat eater, do yourself a favor and order you some corn!!!  I definitely got my taco fix while visiting Phoenix, and next time i'm in town will go back for sure!  One last thing: the vibe was pretty chill on the outdoor patio and the service was excellent!
