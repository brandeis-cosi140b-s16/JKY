We have been here many times and I am unsure why it has a 3 star rating at this time. The good and service is always consistently great. We are always served with friendly attentive service. We have had the taco platter on several occasions and they are always so good. We have tried many other dishes on the menu and they are always great. Prices are not low-- but average for restaurants in the area. This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Goodyear/Avondale area.
