Breakfast is truly authentic New Mexico cuisine.  Their meats are to die for. I've been several times. Tried many of dishes but still not all.  You cannot go wrong with the carne adovada, huevos rancheros ( bacon cooked in)...make sure you ask for Christmas on the sauces ( that's both red and green chili sauce).  The staff is always courteous and helpful. 

Don't miss out on their amazing Bloody Marys either.
