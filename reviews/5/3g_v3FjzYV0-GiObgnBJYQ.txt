Los Dos Molinos is THE BEST Mexican food in town; hands down!  I'm an AZ native so I've tried pretty much everything over the years, but they stand out for achieving a level of flavor and spice that's hard to find.  The ribs and pork roast are outstanding as are their margaritas and sangrias (very tasty but very powerful so be careful).   :)
