Delicious food!  Chips and salsa for starters, chips have extra spice on them.  2 for 3$ tacos were delicious, lots of choices for meats. Bartender Kelton seated us and served us right away, super friendly the whole time. House margarita is great, only tried it blended but great taste.  We'll be going back soon and taking all our friends with us.
