I am addicted to their shredded beef tacos! Their machaca beef melts in your mouth, everything I've eaten here is delicious. They are one of the very few restaurants in the area that consistently get perfect scores from the health board. Check it out on maricopa.gov, it's made me think twice about eating out, but I know Caramba's is safe.
