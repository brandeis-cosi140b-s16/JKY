I'm probably over doing it, but I've been here 3-days in a row. I'm getting my Mexican fix before heading back to Detroit. It's been a few years since I've been here. I'm never disappointed after eating at this place, the people are friendly, and the juice drinks are sooo good! I can't eat anything like this in the D, not even in Southwest Detroit - Mexicantown. 

They have a hotdog stand outside their door for those late night cravings. The guy who mans it is friendly and is there everyday except for Monday nights. 

Maybe I'll make tonight my 4th visit and eat some grub! Yummm!!!
