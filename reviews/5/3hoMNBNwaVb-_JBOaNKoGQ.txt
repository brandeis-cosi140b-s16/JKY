I loved this place! I cane here with a friend and one of the employees greeted us and immediately insisted we sample all their meat selections. I did the green chile pork burrito which was fantastic. Might I even say better than Chipotle?
Similar concept to Chipotle, but better all around. Great fun and funky decor. Music was interesting, it started out good then got weird. That's probably the only thing I would change...
I marked this as good for kids, but be careful, many of the meats are spicy!!
