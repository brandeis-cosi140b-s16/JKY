We ate at the location in the miracle miles mall. Best breakfast for under $4!! We made our own little burrito with eggs, bacon potatoes and tortillas. Their coffee with baileys was good as well. My friend had the .99 cents Bloody Mary and liked it as well (warning it's a little small but for .99 what do you expect.
