Absolutely loved the food my husband and I had today! We both had the special. It consisted of a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. The refried beans melted in your mouth and the sauce on the enchilada was so delicious! The beef taco was tasty and fresh.
The service was excellent! They kept our chips and salsa bowls full and refilled our drinks when empty. Next time I am in the area, I will make it a point to come back and eat there again!
