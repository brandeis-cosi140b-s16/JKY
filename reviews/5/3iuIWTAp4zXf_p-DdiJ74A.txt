My husband and I have been going to one of the Los Dos locations for almost 17 years and we love their food BUT to us and we have eaten in all their locations including NYC, the Chandler Blvd location is soooooo wonderful.  On our last visit we were treated to freshly roasted hatch chilies, green chili mac n cheese and all our other favorites. I live currently in New Mexico and still travel at least monthly to Phoenix. Our first stop is ALWAYS Los Dos for food and TLC from Cheryl and Brendt. Just for reference we happen to be foodies and travel mostly just to eat.  If you like your New Mexican food with lots of flavor and heat you cannot miss Los Dos.
