Super good! My husband and I live in the area and we always would see lines outside of this place. We decided to try in yesterday and it was so yummy. Everything was very fresh. 

I had the carnasada with rice and beans and my husband had the carnasada nachos. The only thing I would have changed for my dish is that there were more rice and beans! Love that stuff :)) overall, good food for a good price.
