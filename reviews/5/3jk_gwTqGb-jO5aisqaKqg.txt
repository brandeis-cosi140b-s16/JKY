Easily some of the best tacos in the phoenix area!

I've been here before they briefly closed, and since it opened up again and have noticed no change in quality. The Fish tacos are top-notch. There is a good amount of fish,  and a light batter - not too heavy, and never overcooked or tasting like oil, which I've experienced elsewhere.  The Carne Asada, Pollo, and Al Pastor are all great as well. I've tried the quesodilla with meat here as well, and its amazing! The horchata is pretty much the best I've had, and I always get horchata anywhere its available! 

Some tips - Say yes to the onions and peppers, say yes to the pecans and cantaloupe in the horchata, and make sure to drink the horchata from the top - not with a straw - to make sure you get some of this with the horchata. 

The exterior looks questionable, but don't let that turn you away, the meal more than makes up for it!
