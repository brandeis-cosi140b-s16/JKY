I love this place. I always get the Carne Asada California burrito. It is so good, it has so many different flavors wrapped into a burrito. Until I started my semi-health kick (I know how can I be on a health kick and eat fast-food Mexican food?) I used to also get their breakfast burritos. Their Damn good too! In the mornings, on a Sunday, this place just gets tons of over the phone orders, so expect a longer wait. Years ago my friend recommended this place, only it was on Chandler and Dobson. 

I like to think of "Los Favs" as a less greasy and cheaper version of Filibertos (though that may not be true).
