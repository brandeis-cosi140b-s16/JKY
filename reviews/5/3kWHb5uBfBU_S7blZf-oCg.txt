This is one of my very favorite places in the valley. Their food is fantastic! No one in my family has had a bad meal in the place and neither have the friends I've brought.

Now, I could list all the different things I've tried but that would take a while and, well, what would be the point? Between us, we've tried just about everything. The shrimp dishes are yummy because they cook the shrimp just right, it's not overdone like so many places in the desert. The chicken is delicious and the beef and pork are really good, too. Oh, and my daughter loves the tamales. My favorite thing is the chicken chimichanga. 

While the place isn't five stars on the atmosphere, nobody goes there for that. They go for amazing food at bargain prices. It's just a pleasure to support a local guy starting a family, eat the great food and walk out with your wallet intact.
