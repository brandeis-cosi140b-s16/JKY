I've lived in the valley for 15 plus years and can't believe I hadn't been here before. I hit it up Saturday around noon to find it quite slow. This worried me a bit because most other places (Matt's Big Breakfast for example) are still jumping. However, we were in between crowds. I ordered the green chile & eggs breakfast. It was awesome. I heard a guest ask if they had menudo, and they did. My guest and I, both suffering from mild hangovers, knew that menudo was just what we needed. We split a bowl between us, to which our server brought us a second bowl and extra condiments. (Thanks!!)
I'm spoiled by my Grandmother who makes homemade menudo, so my expectations are kind of high. I was thrilled that La Canasta had their act together and served up an excellent bowl or red menudo. 
I now have a place to bring friends & family for a really good Mexican breakfast. I look forward to checking them out for lunch & dinner entrees too.http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3107975444_4907cb63ae_m.jpg
