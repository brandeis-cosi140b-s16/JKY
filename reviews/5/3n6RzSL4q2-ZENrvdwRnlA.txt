So, I've been here once with definite plans to come back again. The outside area is darling, although will probably be too hot in the coming months. The staff was all courteous and very attentive. But the food...oh the food. 
I wanted to go here a long time ago but was shy about it because I saw it was a butcher shop as well and I had a totally different picture in mind. So one day I was like well screw it I need Mexican now, so made my boyfriend meet me there. Ahh, we got the chips and salsa. It is so hard to find good chips and salsa here. I enjoyed each flavor, tomatillo is my favorite but I wasn't so sure at this locations as the flavors in their red was on point. I got the torta, him the short rib. My dish was great! The bread was soft, I wasn't crazy about the flavor of the bread (I mean it's white bread, I guess there isn't a whole lot of that anyways) otherwise it was good! Except there were pickled something I don't remember now because my phone was stolen with the photo on it - pickled anything except pickles go off my list. So I took them off. The short rib was tasty. So tender and flavorful. It was put on top of white rice...which I thought was weird, and that was all. So rice and meat? A mans dish (sorry stereotyping) but all the same good. I've had a patient tell me they have the best house rice in town. I will go back to try. 
If I remember correctly...the menu was good, but not a huge selection like some might be used to if you tend to frequent places like Garcia's, Chevy's or whatever the heck places there are here. 
Anyways...go. And get the chips and salsa. 
I might mention that the same owners own Sal's next door, I should write a review for them too, so good. And around the corner is a smaller bar/wine bar of sorts that I want to say is the side door but I don't remember...haven't been there but if they have same quality it is def a go try.
