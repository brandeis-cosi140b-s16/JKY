Just a quick review to praise the red hot sauce made at Los Olivos.  It is the best I've ever eaten!  

I have been eating Mexican food since I was a little kid, growing up in San Diego.  I've eaten in little taco shops, from street carts in Mexico (Ensenada, Rosarita Beach, Tijuana, San Felipe and Puerto Penasco), and in sit-down restaurants.  I LOVE the red hot sauce and along with the re-fried beans, I pretty much can tell if they know what they are doing.  

Try the red sauce.  It's hot, smooth, and DOES NOT have chunks of tomato in it.  It has tons of dried chile (ground, but with seeds visible), vinegar and other spices.  So good with chips (of course), but EXCELLENT on anything on your plate.  Take some "to go" and put it on your cheese omelet the next morning.  You'll come back here to thank me!

The food is solid here, old school, along with excellent shredded beef tacos, tostadas, etc.  But for me, the FIFTH STAR goes to the RED CHILE SALSA!!!!
