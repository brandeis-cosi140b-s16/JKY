The food here is fresh, well-prepared, and delicious!  We always start with tableside guacamole, which manages to taste better than any we've made at home (I think it's the secret sauce!).  The chips are thin, crispy, and served warm.  

My husband and I typically get the tacos, which have been good in every variety we've tried, but he's partial to the mahi mahi, while I like the skirt steak.  The street corn is decadent and spicy, and you can get it off the cob if you prefer (easier to eat).  If you make it there for brunch, the corn crab pancakes are salty and savory, and it's not something I've seen in a lot of restaurants before.
