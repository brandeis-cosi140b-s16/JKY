As one of my favorite places in Phoenix (to see a concert or otherwise) I wish I could write the perfect review for Crescent Ballroom. Alas, that is impossible because words don't really do it justice, but I'll still give it an attempt.

I have seen so many amazing shows at crescent and a lot of credit for these memorable experiences goes to the venue itself. There's not a bad seat in the house in the actual concert area. There's bleacher seating in the back if you're looking to chill and plenty of standing room if you're looking to dance like a maniac, spin around in circles, and jump till you drop.

Whenever somebody tells me that they haven't been to CB I immediately start gushing to them about the many great qualities about this place - music, people, food, atmosphere, ticketing, etc - and there are really very few places that I actively promote like I promote Crescent Ballroom.

At the end of the day, if you like music and/or cool bars and live anywhere in the Valley of the Sun, you have to give this place a try. Also, BEAN DIP!!!
