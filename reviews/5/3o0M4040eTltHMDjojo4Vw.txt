Peace,

Realest Mexican Food in Las Vegas, period.

You pull in and the place has "sketch" written all over it.  No, really, someone carved out the word "sketch" on the side of the building.  But anyway, when you walk in you are greeted by a PacMan and Galaga Arcade game (which is awesome).  Then you are greeted in Spanish by the nice lady taking your order who always recommends you go with "El Burrito."  Do it.  Best Burrito I've had outside of southern California or Mexico.

Two bad-ass 2 pound burritos and a drink: 11 bucks!  Add a quarter for a game of PacMan and for $11.25 total you get a monster deal.
