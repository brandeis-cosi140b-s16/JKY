Cafe Rio is one of my favorite place(s)
The workers all have a happy face
Get your butt into that line
Look up and you'll see some fresh limes
Check out the menu is has a lot of food
All of which is super good
I always order the fire grilled chicken (salad)
The reason why is cuz it's bitchen
Fresh tortilla, tender chicken, salad, and some beans
That meal right there is fit for a Queen
I top it with some creamy cilantro
And always ask them for extra que-eso

Ok, this is a new Cafe Rio and it's semi close to my house. I legit love it, and will carb out on their fresh tortillas any day! I'm loyal to the fire grilled chicken salad (+1$ for grilled chicken) it's topped with your choice of beans and rice, chicken, salad, tortilla strips, queso, and cilantro with a side of guac. I get it sans pico though. 

All of the items on the menu are delicious, their steak is never over cook, nor is the fire grilled chicken. Most of them items can be ordered "wet" but I never opt for that.

They have a variety of drinks including horchata, jamaica, and mint teas as well as the fountain drinks.

I really like the customer service here, the workers are all super nice even when gringas make a big deal over not having green sauce ready THAT MINUTE. Lort forbid they had to wait 3 minutes. HMPF.

Anywho, I got some bogo coupons (Rare!) so I def utilized them!!

I love you CR!

Yay!
