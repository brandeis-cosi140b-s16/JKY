My wife and I ate here before a Steeler game. It was wonderful! Erica waited on us and did a great job desiring the menu, this being our first time. Erica's service was attentive and helpful but not intrusive and the place was packed. I had the el Diablo margherita and my wife had wine to start and we had the street corn and papa bravas apps. Would recommend both, but the papa bravas was my fav of the two. It was hard to pick the tacos we would order, but settled on the Korean and Baja and shared them. Again, both were delicious, but the Korean was the over the top. An order is two tacos, but don't think that's not enough. They are packed. We could not order dessert because we were so stuffed, but the next table had some wonderful looking desserts! Everything is fresh and really good. Check was 65 bucks with tax. Not bad for the quality and amount of food you get! We'll be back next time we are in the 'Burgh.
