Went to this location for the first time yesterday with my family and we were blown away! Excellent food, fresh and savory! High quality food for a decent price. We had this awesome waitress who made our experience very pleasurable. The food comes out very quickly, which pleasantly surprised me! 

We ordered appetizers from their happy hour menu. We had their nachos, quesadilla and three dips. All were good, but I would recommend their nachos, lots of toppings and flavor! For dinner, I had their carne asada tacos. It came with three tacos along with beans and rice. Add some hot sauce to those tacos and you are set! My sister got the Mexican cobb salad, brother got cheese enchiladas, his partner for fajitas. Didn't get to taste, but it all looked delicious. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone to try a contemporary twist on Mexican food. Excellent customer service, environment and awesome food. I can't wait to go back again!
