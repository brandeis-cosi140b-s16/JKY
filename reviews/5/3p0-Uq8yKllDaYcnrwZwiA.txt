Stopped by and had the chipotle shrimp salad which was delicious. The shrimp are grilled so they have a good flavor they are medium sized. I had the works which included white rice, fajita veggies, hot sauce, mild sauce, sour cream, cheese and guacamole. The salad was fresh and tasty. Price was about 9 bucks my girl had a brownie $1.75 which was really good. Took everything to go but dining and kitchen areas looked clean. Overall good food decent price friendly people which is more than I can say about the centennial chipotle which is the opposite and ticks me off cause I like chipotle. I guess everything happens for a reason though cause if that chipotle wasn't terrible I would've never tried zabas shrimp something chipotle doesn't even offer.
