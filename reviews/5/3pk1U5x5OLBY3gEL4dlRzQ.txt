We decided to celebrate with some friends on Friday night for my boyfriends birthday by taking him to his favorite restaurant, Cabo Fish Taco, in NoDa. The restaurant is so good that it's been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. We started out with the crab dip for an appetizer. The dip was so addicting and delicious. I love crab dishes that have more crab than cream cheese and this certainly did. The flavors that were added to the cream cheese made it even better. The pita chips it came with were fried and tasted like a funnel cake. My practice with moderation was definitely challenged. For my meal, I ordered the guacamole salmon salad with a vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was awesome, but I couldn't eat the lettuce because they poured cilantro all over the plate. I didn't know that it came with cilantro otherwise I would have had them take it off. The next time I went, I ordered it WITHOUT the cilantro and it was better:) The guacamole at this place is awesome! 

We always have great service when we're at CFT. My brother, who is a fish taco king, said they had the best fish tacos HE HAS EVER EATEN. That was one hell of a compliment. 

The restaurant is very hip and a great place to bring your friends or family who are visiting. It's definitely a touristy-y spot. After dinner, you can walk down the road for some drinks or coffee. Noda is a very hip neighborhood.
