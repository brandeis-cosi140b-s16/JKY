Driving up and down on Scottsdale Rd, I was looking for Panera but thought Baja Fresh looked intriguing.  It was early so I could find a place to park in the tiny lot they share with Starbucks.  I ordered a chicken caesar burrito and thought it was the best thing I've eaten in ages.  The wrap was filled with romaine, well-flavored chunks of flame grilled chicken, bits of avocado.  The salsa bar had several delicious options.  I might go back just to snack on tortillas and the different salsas.  I hope they open in Albuquerque New Mexico soon.
