First of all, love Chipotle so much. Fast service. Perfect place to eat last minute. So glad they finally put one at Greyhawk! Definitely a lot closer than the other one down on Scottsdale Road! The chips have a lime flavor to them which just makes them 10x better! Good prices and very reasonable for people not wanting to spend a lot on a meal!
