What can't I say about this place? It is the best Mexican food in town. The tacos, tortas, burritos, and carne asada are all amazing. The chips, salsa, and the indispensable green sauce are all great and manage to rise above just being food while you wait - they are guaranteed to still be eaten throughout the meal. The only bad menu item I've ever had is the enchilada, which wasn't terrible, but simply okay. The service is perfectly fitting and the environment and location of the restaurant is equally good. I can't speak for authenticity, but everyone else claims it is. It's worth the extra distance from pretty much any local Mexican restaurant you could go to.
