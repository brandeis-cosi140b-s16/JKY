I went to Tia Rosas in Gilbert a few weeks ago and had a great experience! A genuinely friendly hostess who immediately took my name and gave me an estimate of wait time greeted my group right when we walked in. The wait time was less than the hostess had told me and she directed my friends and I to our table. No less than 15 seconds after we sat down we had chips and salsa and water for the whole table. Our waiter came by shortly after and was extremely friendly and a nice guy. He took our orders and in 10 minutes we had our food. The food was absolutely delicious. It was so warm and prepared exactly the way it should be. After we finished we had bussers taking our plates away for us and the check was brought to us. The restaurant had a great vibe about it and you could tell all the employees really enjoyed working there. It was also beautifully decorated and just a nice environment to eat in. I cannot wait to go again!
