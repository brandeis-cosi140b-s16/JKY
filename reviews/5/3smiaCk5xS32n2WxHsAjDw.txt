Needed a place to eat before departure and stumbled on this place. Very  nice people and the food was delish. We ordered tacos and quesadilla - fresh tortillas and fresh meat and huge portions for a very low price ! We were very amazed and left extremely full and satisfied with the service and hospitality we received. I would totally come again!
