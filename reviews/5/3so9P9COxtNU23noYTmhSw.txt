We love Mexican and are pretty picky about it. I have been here twice and thought it was excellent both times! The margaritas and chips and salsa are both delicious! (And that's the true test of yummy Mexican right?!) I had the chopped salad and it was very good. Huge portion. The kids meals have great options which we love as well. Service was great both times we went.  I'm a fan!
