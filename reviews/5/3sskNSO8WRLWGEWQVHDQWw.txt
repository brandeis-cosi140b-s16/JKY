Recently tried this restaurant and the food was delicious and authentic Mexican food! The staff was very friendly and professional. Found out it has been under new owner and inside has been remodeled to give a more Mexican authentic look. The atmosphere was inviting, casual, and family friendly. On top of delicious food the margaritas were amazing. Can't wait to go back and try the other items on the menu!
