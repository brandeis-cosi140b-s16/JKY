Mannys is the best Mexican food around great busy atmosphere. Feels very family oriented . Food is outstanding! Fresh and served hot. Best chips and salsa and let me not forget the only place that makes great margaritas around this area. Can't beat the food, the margs and the great service. You must go if you have not! You will be happy you did. I bring everyone there who visits me from out of town and when they return they ask to go back.
