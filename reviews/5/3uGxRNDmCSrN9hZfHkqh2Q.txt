My wife and I went to Dick's one morning for breakfast, when we were in Phoenix last month, based on the Yelp ratings.  It was so good, we returned the following day also.  The huevos rancheros are very good, as are the bloody marys (served with a beer back).  The atmosphere (literally - how many place have a mesquite wood grill burning in the kitchen) is great.  Can't wait to go back and eat more of the menu.
