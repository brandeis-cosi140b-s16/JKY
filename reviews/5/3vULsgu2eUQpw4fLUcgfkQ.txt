Could have sworn we wrote a review for the Rokerij a long time ago...

This is one of our favorites and a place we have been back to many times.   Have met lots of friends here and they end up loving it and bring other friends.  

Our favorite thing to do is go for happy hour and smaple a bunch of the apps.  Have had a full dinner a few times and have comepletly enjoyed every meal.  I don't think we have had better seafood anywhere else in PHX.  Still want to try the monstrous ribeye they offer.

We usually head down into the cellar( where we promptly lose cell phone service..if you are expecting a call, good luck!).  Upstairs is very nice, but the real people watching is downstairs. Downstairs gets VERY busy.

The only thing we have not done yet at the Rokerij is the late night happy hour....maybe this week!
