I've been coming here since they opened when I was a kid. Best things on the menu: chicken taco salad (such tender, delicious shredded chicken & tons of it!), green corn tamale with green enchilada sauce & cheese (the best ever!), the appetizer chili con queso dip to go with your chips (so worth a calorie splurge), and, of course, the pollo con queso. Their guacamole is mediocre - save your calories for other menu deliciousness!
