Javier's in Las Vegas (Aria Hotel) is amazing!!! Ambiance is so perfect and romantic. Very dim lighting.  Had the taquitos, queso fondido and nachos. The beef taquitos were delicious and crisp. The nachos were huge!! Big plate! The queso fondido was delicious as well. Make sure u ask for no onions if u hate them lol but overall I give it a 5 star!
