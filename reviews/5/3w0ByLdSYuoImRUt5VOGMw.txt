Love this place! I always order from the blonde cashier and I always feel so bad because I can never remember what I tried the time before. But she is always so patient with me and helps me choose the burrito I love. The entire team here always has a smile on their face and makes me want to walk in even when I'm not hungry for lunch. They are an incredible team/business!
