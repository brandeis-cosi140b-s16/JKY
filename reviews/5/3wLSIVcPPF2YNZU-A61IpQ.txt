I have always loved this particular Del Taco location more than the others I've tried around town. I've recently had to move away from Vegas and will miss the crew here. Being at this place is very close to my house I'd stop by for dinner a few times a week. The food is always great, served warm and tasty and price is decent.

During the night when I'd come by, sometimes 2-3 in the morning, it is extremely slow in drive-threw, it can easily take 20mins from ordering time to eating. This is my only complaint.

Epic Burritos are to die for.
