I have been to Irma ' s Kitchen twice.  Both times the food was very good. The first time I had a bean and cheese burrito and the tortilla was very fresh, hand made, stretchy and delicious.  Today I had the tostadas. A generous meal with extremely fresh ingredients.  One of the owners saw me taking my friend's avocado that he didn't want and she brought me some of my own. Very attentive. Nice people.
