This place does not dissapoint. It's not your typical taco joint. A unique fusion of Mexican and American, I mean you can get a rib eye torta with a side of fries, it's brilliant. Throw in a salsa bar with HOT jalepinios and smoky salsa, an ice cream booth and a selection of mexican bread/pastries and you have a sold 5 stars in my book. Grab your coworkers and head over for an excellent meal.
