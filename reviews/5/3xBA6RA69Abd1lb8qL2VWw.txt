I'm so glad Doce Taqueria is in Pittsburgh! This place has all the elements of a perfect little taco shop. There are Mexican bottled sodas, the tacos are absolutely delicious, they offer black beans and nachos to supplement the few taco varieties, and the price is right! You just can't go wrong with that. 

My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday around 6:30, and it wasn't too busy. We were able to sit and put in orders immediately. It was fun watching the staff assemble our food, and the ingredients all looked and smelled incredible. One note about the service...I thought everyone was incredibly friendly and responsive, however I can see the staff potentially forgetting or not seeing you right away on a particularly busy night. Nothing to keep me from coming back, however I think I would prefer to come when it's less busy since I need my tacos customized due to my dairy allergy.

Between us we tried the carnitas, chicken, and beef tacos. I inhaled my carnitas and chicken tacos...they were the best I've had in Pittsburgh by far. In addition to beef and carnitas tacos Kyle got an order of nachos. I could only look longingly at them since I can't have cheese. He said they were wonderful. I had a Mexican Squirt with my meal and he had an interesting variety of Mountain Dew. We'll both be getting Squirt next time! It was surprisingly refreshing. I'm planning on coming back to Doce Taqueria sooner rather than later. I want another carnitas taco already!
