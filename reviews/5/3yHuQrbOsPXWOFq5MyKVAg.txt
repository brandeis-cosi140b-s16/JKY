I went to this restaurant for the first time last night after waiting for what seemed like forever for it to open over the last several months, however, I can see why it took the time that it did. The inside looks great, lots of details to look at, but that's not why you go to a restaurant, you go for the food.

The food was great! I had the "Special Dinner" which tasted and looked great. It came out on two different plates and for around ten dollars was a great deal.

The service was good as well. Miguel served us and was very attentive had a good sense of humor.

Overall, I would definitely go back and make this a regular place to eat when I'm out and about.
