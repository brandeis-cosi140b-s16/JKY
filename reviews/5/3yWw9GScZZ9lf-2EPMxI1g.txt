Definitely a must try! They have a wide variety of Mexican food, vegetarian friendly, great appetizers... The Brussels sprouts nachos are to DIE FOR. 

The vibe and ambiance is truly one of a kind... It's a modern cantina feel with indoor and outdoor seating, with a bar outside, perfect on a sunny day. Satisfy all your Healthy (ish) Mexican food desires!
