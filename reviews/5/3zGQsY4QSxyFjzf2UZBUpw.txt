Pleasantly surprised by...everything. 

Short wait for a table of 6, drinks while we waited. I was impressed by the salsa, I think it had jicama(?) as did the guacamole. 

Tried 2 different agua frescas (cucumber mint with gin & horchata with amaretto) both delicious & $5 on happy hour. The taco combo (3 tacos + 1 side) is a lot of food. Tried the shrimp, carne asada, and some chicken one...the shrimp was my favorite. 

I was very pleased by how clean and decorative the inside is, the staff is friendly, and of course delicious food. 

Will definitely come back. I'm craving a Mexican mule now...
