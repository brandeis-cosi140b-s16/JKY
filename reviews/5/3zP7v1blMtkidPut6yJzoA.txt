Been working up the road form this lil gem the past couple months and this is one of the best burrito places I've been to. It's setup like a Moe's or chipotle's but thank god no one screams at you when you walk through the door. The owner and staff immediately realized I wasn't a local and we're very friendly so I've been back a couple times and the result is the same, great food n service!
