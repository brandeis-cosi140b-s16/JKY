La Fonda Mexican Food is an amazing find.  The BEST chips and salsa ever!  I absolutely love the shredded beef tacos and anything with Fundido sauce on it.  

This restaurant has been here many years and is family owned.  The red and green sauces are the same from when they opened the restaurant (same location), back in the 60's.

A very casual eclectic restaurant through the years.  If you want delicious sonoran style mexican food, look no further.  La Fonda is absolutely tasty!
