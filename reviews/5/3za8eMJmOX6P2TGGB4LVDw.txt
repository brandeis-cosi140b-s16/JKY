This place is amazing. Used the $10 for $20 deal and it was well worth it. Very friendly staff and amazing tacos ! Plus, they had incredible horchata.  I will definitely be going back. So glad I found this place. If you have no tried it, I highly recommend it. It's better than most Mexican places in town and it's affordable.
