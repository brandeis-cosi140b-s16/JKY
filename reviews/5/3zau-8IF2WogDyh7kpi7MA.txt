Great choice for takeout Mexican food! The place doesn't really look like anything from outside and it's in one of the older strip malls of south boulevard. You walk inside and there are pictures on the wall of what they offer. I think most tacos are $2 (depending on what you order). Delicious made to order food, not expensive, and the place was clean.

Will definitely be back.
