My husband and I and a couple of our friends went to Cabos on a Friday night. There were several people waiting to be seated when we got there so went to the bar to get a drink. $2 Bud Light Lime, $9.99 for a skinny margarita, and $5.99 for a Bob Marley, were the specials that night. 

I got the Bob Marley which has 3 kinds of Malibu rum and is very colorful and tasty. I always appreciate non-beer specials :). 

We were served chips and salsa at the bar until the hostess came over and told us our table was ready, which was maybe 15 minutes after we first arrived. 

It didn't take long for us to place our orders and get our food. I got the Lomo Saltado which is steak, peppers, rice, and homemade potato wedges. I normally only order a cheese quesadilla at Mexican restaurants (a self proclaimed particular eater), but this meal is amazing. 
I also get it knowing we will have leftovers for my husband to eat the next day because he loves it too. 

My husband and his friend got the tequila burrito, which is very good but spicy, with 2 sides. My husband said he also loves the California burrito which is not spicy. 

Even with the bar we were out in an hour and I felt we got an excellent service and good prices. This is definitely my favorite Mexican place in South Charlotte.
