This place is amazing! First and foremost the staff is awesome, and the place is clean. I eat there about every 2 weeks and the food is always good! Born & raised right here in Az with a wide variety of Mexican restaurants, I always come back to Julio's. 

This year for my family Christmas party we ordered platters from Julio's, everything was perfect, they even made sure I had enough chips & salsa. 

This place is a must try!!
