I go to the one on Country Club near Main, in Mesa....The is New Mex food. Made with great care. Stacked enchiladas are awesome with an egg on top., or "Spooning Rellenos" stuffed with your fave are to die for. MY fave is the beef tenderloin in one, and  Adovado pork in the other. Service is always great for me.Prices are better than avg, for the quality of the food.The have a full service bar.Comfortable atmosphere. Sometimes, I just make excuses to be in that neighborhood, just so I can go to Blue Adobe!
