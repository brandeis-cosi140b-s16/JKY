On another treasure hunt and I found GOLD in KoMex! The concept is awesome...Korean infused meats / seasonings in Mexican based dishes like tacos ext. AWESOME!

First of all, the food is amazing and the prices are ridiculous. We fed 4 of us to our max for under $20 dollars. WHAT!

When you walk in to this non-assuming restaurant you are quickly greeted by the staff. This is a family owned place and you can tell they really appreciate your business...which I LOVE. We were given the yummiest free chips and salsa and GUACAMOLE! Yeah, I said it...complimentary GUACAMOLE. Who does that?? It was awesome. I almost cried I was so happy.

We tried everything...LOL..Ok, well we had one of each of the fusion tacos (only $1.29 each - very good investment, return is amazing!) We also shared a burrito that was the size of my face...and I have a big head. It was sooo good. They also finish your meal with a complimentary orange already pre-sliced....Love that too.

The only downer now is that every time I go to a Mexican place I am looking for the Korean meats. I am forever ruined.

Price plus great food and great service earns this place in my top eats. I see Mo-Mex in Ko-Mex in my future. (translation - I will be eating here again)
