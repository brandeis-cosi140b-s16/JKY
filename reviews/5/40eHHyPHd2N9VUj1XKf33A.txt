The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious.  We had the carne asada and chicken fajitas, both of which came out fresh and hot.  The shrimp ceviche was a steal at $2 and was scrumptious.  Fantastic prices for authentic Mexican food.  We will definitely be back!
