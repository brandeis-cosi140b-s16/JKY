Gardunos started in Albuquerque, NM  where I lived for four years.  In Albuquerque they use fresh grown New Mexico chilies and use a lot of the authentic recipes from that area.  When we went to the Gardunos in the Palms it was just the normal Mexican fair.  It is still too bad that the Palms kicked them out.  We haven't been back to the Palms since.   As a local that is the only reason we went there.

I was pleasantly pleased to see that this location is attempting to get back to their original heritage.  The menu is different, offering the blue tortillas option etc.  The chef was on the floor talking to the customers so I told him I was from ABQ and that I knew about Gardunos.  I told him I could tell they were trying to get back to the authentic offerings.  He said thanks!  Know why?  He had just returned from there learning more New Mexico traditions for his kitchen!  

Years ago, I had to use the soapapilla and honey to put the fire out, I didn't need to so either the Rojo sauce needs to be hotter or I missed the hottest option.  My traditional fair is a blue corn cheese enchilada and chili relleno with Rojo.  My next visit I will ask for a hotter sauce and see how I do.

If you drink Margaritas, it has a huge selection and the tequila bottles are hanging from a moving track through out the ceiling.  Salsa bar is cool.  I give them 5 stars for effort and style and a 4 for not hot enough!  I'm looking forward to our return visit!
