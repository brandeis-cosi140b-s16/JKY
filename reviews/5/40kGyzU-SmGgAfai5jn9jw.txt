Poncho's is an Arizona institution, and has the best Mexican food in town!  Whenever we are craving authentic Mexican food, Ponchos is our first choice!  In fact, we recently took some visiting relatives from back east and they loved it and can't stop racing about the food!  I would highly recommend Ponchos to anyone looking for a great Mexican food experience.
