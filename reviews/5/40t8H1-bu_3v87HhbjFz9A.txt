I love guad. Had a vegetarian huarache and some refried beans and rice and was just the happiest camper. I would say this is authentic, significantly better than any chain Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately I can see this becoming a weekly delivery order. (Side note: I've only ordered delivery and never actually been there.) (second side note: mild salsa is amazing and the guac is ever so spicy.)
