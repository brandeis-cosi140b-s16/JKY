Don Tortaco is my late night addiction. That's probably why I'm currently the duchess. They are so quick and easy. I usually walk in and out in 5 mins. My go to order is chicken tacos. They currently have a special when you buy 2 you get 1 free. I cant eat all three but a taco in the morning can't be a bad thing. I also steal a lot of their green sauce. It's delicious and I use one cup on each taco and a few for my chips if i get any. Sometimes I just want to stop in and get chips and 6 sauces.. And I do. It's a weakness!! I'm a huge fan of the carne asada nachos. They are so big and delicious but I can't order them a lot. It's too much food for me and day two isn't as good. I usually order them with a group and make people get ratchet with me. Still 5 stars for being open 24hr and always being there when I need a late night meal or taco fix. Thank you Don Tortaco.
