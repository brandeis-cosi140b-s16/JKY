Just as good as the Tucson locations. We saw El Guero Canelo in person. Cool to see the owner interacting with the employees and customers. Tried the asada burrito for the first time and it was awesome. The construction out front is lame and the parking lot was small, not restaurant's fault. Bring cash, that line is shorter. I'm so happy that they opened here. Will bring as many people as I can to this place!  The prices are really amazing, we were so full on the $25 I spent on myself, my fianc√©e and our son.  I had tons of leftovers.  Everything is great about this place!  I don't give 5 stars normally, but I'm still dreaming about our meal last weekend and can't wait to go again this weekend!
