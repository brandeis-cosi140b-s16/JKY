After driving around for nearly an hr trying to find somewhere to eat, I came across this place on Yelp. Without reading any reviews, I decided to come have breakfast here. Although it was a full house, they had enough space to seat us promptly. We were greeted right away by a great waitress by the name of Catalina. She was very nice, attentive, and wasn't bothered at the fact that we kept ordering different things, she had a smile on her face the whole time and was extremely respectful. Even when she was walking by with food in her hands for another table, she never failed to ask us if we were ok, or if we needed anything. I haven't had such great service by a waitress in a very long time. They are so attentive that the moment we set our utensils down and were finished with out food, someone was already there picking up our empty dishes. I am so glad I came to this restaurant. They actually have a lot of seafood in all of there sea food dishes unlike most places nowadays. I was here with a party of 5. We all ordered something different. Everyone's food was DELICIOUS! I was highly impressed by the cleanliness and layout of this restaurant. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Very family oriented, respectful, and clean. 

I'm from California, I have visited so many restaurants both here and there, and it's been a very long time that I have actually been impressed by a restaurant. If I could rate more stars, I would! 


Ps! 
We had an extremely hungover friend (we had a wild night out) that didn't want to eat and felt sick to her stomach. We advised her to order some Menudo. Sure enough, after eating some she came back to life. Lol
