I love Los Favoritos. I come here often and the food is consistently excellent. I don't remember ever having a burrito I didn't enjoy. I usually get the same thing but everything I've had has been delicious. Great customer service and fast too. There isn't ever really a long wait. The dining area is clean and neat and the tables are always wiped off quickly after someone leaves. Plenty of seating for the guests. I would definitely recommend it. 

The salsa that they give you is awesome too. Just an FYI. :)
