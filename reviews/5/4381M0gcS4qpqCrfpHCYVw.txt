Best tacos in Madison! Been to the State street location many times, but this was my first time at the Odana location. It is in back of a small bodega style store, which is really fun to walk through. Daily specials are written in Spanish and the lunch crowd was 90% Hispanic...you know you have stumbled on a good place when that happens.Ordered the pastor tacos and they were perfectly cooked with a nice crispy sear, but the meat still retained its juice. Topped with plenty of fresh white onion and cilantro. Their two salsa options for topping your food items are also superior. The red is spicier than the green tomatillo which is what I like. The salsa served with the chips (free by the way) is also a tomatillo and pico de gallo mixture that has more kick that the squeeze bottle and was highly addictive. Will be going back many many more times before I leave this frozen state.
