Glad I finally stumbled into Sabor! Casual, relaxed vibe with an authentic menu. You place your order at the counter and they call out your name as your order is ready. They also serve Mexican coke, so another star for that. 

I have been back a few times since my first visit and have yet to be disappointed. My favorites are the authenticos tacos with shredded chicken. They serve some fantastic pico de gallo, so grab a side of that and put it on everything. 

Sabor is going to be one of my regular spots, especially once the streetcar opens in mid July. The prices are very reasonable; couple tacos and sides will run less than $10.
