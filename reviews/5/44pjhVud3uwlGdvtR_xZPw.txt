Delicious!  The meat is tender and everything is fresh.  I had the torta and it was amazing.  I love the set up of this place.  I haven to say that originally even though the set up is nice I was a bit sceptical but they exceeded my expectations.  I absolutely recommend this place to my friends.  I work at zappos so it looks like i found a new spot for lunch!
