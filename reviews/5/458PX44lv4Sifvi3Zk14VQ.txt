Went in on a Tuesday night around 9pm and had very prompt service. The hostess was very welcoming and the server (Clay) was very friendly & gave excellent recommendations. I've never had a tomato sauce based ceviche before, but it tasted pretty good! The guacamole appetizer had a savory taste as well. There is an extensive drink menu, and I must say that I am a fan of Mango Mojitos.
