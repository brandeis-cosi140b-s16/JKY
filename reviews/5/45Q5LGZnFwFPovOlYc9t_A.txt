I was staying at the Stratosphere and saw this place. My friend wanted to stop in and see what they have. Glad we did. Cheap and very good Tacos really hit the spot. It was nice to see that the place was busy and pretty much everyone in there was speaking Spanish. I live on the East Coast so there is not much around me like this place. Enjoyed the food so much that I went back 3 times in a 3 day period.
