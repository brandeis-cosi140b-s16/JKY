I had the enchilada dinner.... by far the best Mexican food in town - maybe even the best Mexican food I have ever had. I have tried several different items on their menu and everything is great. My family goes weekly and every time a visitor comes to town this is the first stop after they get picked up from the airport. Amazing food, friendly staff, good experience.
