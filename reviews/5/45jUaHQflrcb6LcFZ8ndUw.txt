I think I just found my favorite taco shop. Lemme tell you guys. I've been waiting for a place like this. Everything made from scratch. They're tacos are amazing. Best part of this place, home made salsa. Holy cow their salsa is amazing! Btw you can BYOB! I recommend this place! Two thumbs way way up! And the guys who work there are the best! It's like being in somebody's home and them cooking their food with some kind of secret ingredients that was passed down from generation to generation. This is true Mexican food!
