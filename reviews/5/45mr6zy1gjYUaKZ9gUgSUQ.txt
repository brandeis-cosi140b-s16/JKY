After the fish tacos here, I feel like I haven't had them anywhere else. So good. The ceviche tostada and crab enchiladas--packed with crabmeat--were absolutely delicious. 

The ambience was bright, draft beer was deep, and service perfect. The owner even comped us tostadas. This place deserves another star!
