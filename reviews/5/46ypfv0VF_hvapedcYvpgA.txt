Service like you have never seen & margaritas off the chain!  The kids like the creamcicle shake thingy.  

I had my wifes delicious homade quesadillas for a late lunch so I made the mistake of going full on mexican food already.  The chips come seasoned with a chili P thing & 2 salsas.  The trick is to mix the salsas.  Not bad!   We got nachos & I wasnt feeling them  - now probably over full from chips & salsa. I got the street tacos & listen... the veggie fixins and mini tortillas (very cool) were fresh, but the carne was too peppery for my tastes & overcooked (like the rice) Albeit tender & not fatty.  I tried my wifes carnita tacos & it they were excelent!

My advice is double up on margaritas and get the Carnitas! Definately coming back on kareoke night!! :D
