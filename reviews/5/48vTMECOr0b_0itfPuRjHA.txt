We had dinner here a few nights ago with my sister and brother-in-law after the Coyotes/Blackhawks game. It was AMAZING! We all tried various tacos and the chicken enchilada. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The new decor really looks great too! I can't wait to go back this week!  You won't be disappointed!!!
