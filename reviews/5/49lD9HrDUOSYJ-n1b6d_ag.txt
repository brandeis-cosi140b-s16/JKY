I loved this place. Being a local it's hard to find a nice casual eatery that isn't super cheap and has great food. I've been here twice before, once for happy hour and then dinner on Saturday night. The service was great, the food came out very quick and it was delish! When dining again on the strip I will definitely be back. I'm not a fan of the Luxor Hotel, but I did very much love this place! Plus they have open table so I was able to make a reservation and get my points.
