Got the recommendation from the concierge at the hotel I was staying at.  The food was excellent.  I had the carnitas, seafood taco appetizer, and guacamole dip.

The guacamole was thick and creamy with fresh avocado.  The onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and lime juice were blended well together for a a creamy and thick guacamole that was still fresh and bright in flavor.  The chips were sturdy enough for scooping while being thin enough that they were not overfilling.  One of the better guacamoles that I have had in awhile.

The seafood taco appetizer was excellent.  The soft tortilla was evenly made without a doughy taste or feel.  The ceviche filling had a great citrus taste without it overpowering the minced seafood and other ingredients.  There were no harsh onion notes.  Great appetizer, but a bit on the small side if you were thinking of making a meal of it.  Not sure what the entree looks like (just more of them or larger ones).

The carnitas were sumptuous.  They are slowly braised in oil leading to a soft and tender carnitas rather then a roast one.  While I do enjoy a good roasted carnitas with a good maillard reaction and crust this method was also very good.  Although it is slowly cooked in oil the carnitas were still had a strong pork flavor that shone through.  It was not overly oily or greasy.

I also partook of a mezcal that was on the menu, the particular one I had was recommended by my waiter.  It is a cousin to tequila but not cheap stuff from college.  It is served with an orange and spiced salt but the drink itself comes neat.  It had a wonderful smokey flavor to it with a great depth of flavor that made a wonderful complement to my meal.

All in all I would return to Los Sombreros if I am in the Scottsdale or Phoenix area.
