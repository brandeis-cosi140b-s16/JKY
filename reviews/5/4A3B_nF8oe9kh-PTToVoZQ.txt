First trip to Vegas in 18 years.  We ate here twice during our stay.  I am mostly vegan and this place had a nice variety of vegetarian food.  First night we had the guacamole and chips.  Crazy good.  Guacamole is made fresh.  Ordered again the second time.  I had a black bean taco and open sesame noodles the first night. My husband had a pork taco and the hot and sour soup.  Everything was SO good.  The second time I ordered a fish taco and 18 monk noodles. Amazing!  The noodles were hand cut.  My husband got the Mongolian beef salad.  We rave about this place.  Our servers were so friendly. Miller and Megan.  Thank you!
