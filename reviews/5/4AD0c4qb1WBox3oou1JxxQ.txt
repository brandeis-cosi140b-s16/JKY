I LOVE this place. It's cheap, it's delicious and it doesn't make you feel miserable later on like other fast food-y type places. The bean and cheese burrito is my fave, no lard!

The ladies who work at this joint, (mostly women), are the nicest. They always act happy to see me and now know me by name; I may have a burrito problem.

Plus, the company is involved in the community. Just last week they did a #CarneforaCause day, giving 20% of their daily profits valley-wide to Phoenix Children's Hospital. Yummy and altruistic, love that.
