I am not sure that some of these people were at the right place. I have never had a bad meal or experience there. All food is homemade including the salsa. The grilled shrimp are amazing! If you order beans, rice and salsa..mix altogther..aka: "the mixture"...that's all you need on any given hangover or non-hanging day...it's like crack salsa....It has always been very clean and great service...go for breakfast or lunch before 11:15..then after 2...otherwise you will wait a very very very long time...or dinner you can always get a seat....LOVE YOU JUAN!
