Wow wow wow. Here I am, a chipotle lover for 5 solid years, and Baja Fresh sneaks up and just blows it out of the water! How this place isn't more popular absolutely blows my mind.  Many more options than Chipotle, and it seems that their food is indeed extra fresh. Gimme a god damn burrito from baja any day.
