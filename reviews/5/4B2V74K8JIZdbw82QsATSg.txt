Last review said Qdoba served frozen guac??? This couldn't be further from the truth!!!! Qdoba ALWAYS makes fresh guac from a case or sometime two avocados, EveryDay!!!! Ask to watch them make it!!! Totally FRESH everyday!!! I believe Chipotle is the one w frozen guac and a Chipotle worker made this review
