Oh my! This place is so delicious!!! We drove 30 minutes just to try Jalapenos Bucks. You get a farm-like feel to it, it's very nature-y! We probably only waited 6-7 minutes for our order. They have a variety of sauces - which were all tastey! There were a lot of people (which shows it's a great place to eat), so the only thing I'd recommend is probably more tables. But, I definitely recommend this place!!! :)
