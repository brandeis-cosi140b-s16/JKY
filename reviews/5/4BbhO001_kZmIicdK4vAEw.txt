Today I decided to try Amigos Tacos to see if it would compare to Roberto's, which I think is pretty decent for cheap Mexican food. I have to say, I was VERY impressed with the quality and flavor or the food. I ordered the Carnitas Chimichanga combination plate and it truly was one of the best ones I've had in Vegas. Everything was well cooked, seasoned, and fresh tasting. After this experience, I'm making the switch, sorry Roberto's...Amigos just kicked your ass in my book.
