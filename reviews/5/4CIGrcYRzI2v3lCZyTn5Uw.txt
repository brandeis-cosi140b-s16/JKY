Superior customer service is hard to come by in fast food establishments. This Rubios is absolutely fantastic. The woman operating the register, Marina was wonderful. Always smiling and keeping busy. As a good employee should do. I would hire her in a heartbeat. Keep up the great work at this location guys.
