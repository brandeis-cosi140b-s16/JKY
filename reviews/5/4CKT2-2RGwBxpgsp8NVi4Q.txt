We arrived in Vegas late Friday evening.  After a long drive, I was tired and wanted to sleep.  My hubby brings back Roberto's cause its across from our resort--Carnitas, Chicken, Adobada...I woke from a dead sleep and couldn't stop saying, Oh my God!  These are amazing!  Next morning, just as delicious.  Warning--went back 2 days later...not as good.  Guess it depends on the cook who is on shift.
