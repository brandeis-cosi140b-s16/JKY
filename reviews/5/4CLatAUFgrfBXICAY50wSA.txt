I was very happy to be back here today. It's been too long for sure! As promised, I grabbed myself one of the wet burritos from the menu and it was just as delicious as everyone else has proclaimed. I went with the burrito with the rice and beans on the outside. The sauce over the top was great and I am a huge fan of the three salsas they provide. I was sure to load my burrito up with the hottest one they provide. Really really happy with the quality, price and service here. I'm quite sure I won't be able to stay away from this place for very long!
