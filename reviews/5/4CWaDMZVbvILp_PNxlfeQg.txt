I am so impressed with this place!!! I was craving shrimp tacos and this definitely hit the spot! They used large shrimps that they marinated so it was packed with flavors!! And the el pastor....oh my goodness! Pork belly marinated with pineapple chunks...wow! I like their house sauces as well. We are at the bar and the girl was so pleasant. Would definitely come back. We came during lunch but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It would also make a fun place to go for dinner.
