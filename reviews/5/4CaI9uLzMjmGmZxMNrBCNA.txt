When people ask me what my favorite restaurant in Phoenix is, always the Barrio Cafe comes to mind.  The Barrio is one of those places where everything is so great, that you're willing to wait.  It's not a large place, but the food is extraordinary!!  They really put their love into the food with those little extra touches that make a good restaurant a great restaurant, from the pomegranate seeds in the guacamole to the unique flavors of the main dishes made my experience a great one!!
