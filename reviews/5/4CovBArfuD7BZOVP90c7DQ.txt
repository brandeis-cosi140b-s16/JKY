I was leery of eating here because the yelp reviews from a couple of years ago seemed so mediocre. It seemed like most of the chains in the East Valley put out food that is not very memorable. The first time I ate here with friends...I settled for their margarita and chips. 
About a month ago, we met friends again and I actually ordered off their menu for dinner. I was shocked to enjoy the best chili relleno I've found in Arizona!!! My husband was raving about his chicken chimi. The other couple was totally enjoying their Tampiquena. Who knew??? We returned the other night, enjoying appetizers and fried ice cream. I never would have thought Manuel's would become my new go-to place for enjoyable Mexican food...wow!
