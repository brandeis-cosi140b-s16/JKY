I have been coming here for many years. I had not been here for about 4 years now. So a long over do visit!
This place is simple, simple and good!  It is very clean inside, including the restroom.
The staff is great. We had a great male server. Sorry to say I cannot remember his name.  
Chips and Salsa fresh and great!   Enchiladas are fresh and tasty.  I did not realize that Mexican food could be so bad till I went to a place in Scottsdale called , Jalapeno inferno! Because, of my Visit there I found how much I really appreciate Fresh, good Mexican food.
This place is worth your time. Worth your Money. Good price as well. Get it a go!
