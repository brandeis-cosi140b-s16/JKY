Great mexican food, located in a crappy little strip mall but the food makes up for the location.  Nice pleasent atmoshere. Can be crowded but a good sign is that they are expanding their hours.  The Tortas are great, filling and reasonably priced.  The chocolate flan is sinfully delicious.  They have nice marqaritas and crappy beer to wash the food down.
