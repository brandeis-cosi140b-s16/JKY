I got to Vegas super early and was craving their Queso Fundido so I went hoping they'd be open. I had to wait long enough to lose a few hundred dollars as they don't open until 11:30. 

I had the Queso and street tacos as normal. I also thought I'd be a tough guy and order the salsa Diablo. They were nice enough to replace it with the house salsa after I swallowed my pride. I think they may have noticed I was sucking down ice water like it was keeping me alive. 

Anyway, you won't believe this. I still don't believe it myself...

Towards the end of my meal, the manager came by and recognized me from my past yelp review!  I was kinda freaked out!  But how awesome is that!  She had messaged me previously asking how they could improve their service so there was correspondence, but wow!  I was impressed. She walked by and did a double take and was like are you, did you, are you the guy I talked to who left a yelp review?  

She was really pretty. Lol. So I may have gotten a bit nervous after that!

Regardless, great food as always, and the Queso Fundido with chorizo is simply fantastic. The service was great. I had multiple people take care of me.

I will go back for sure, maybe even again on this trip!  

You don't find sincere personal service like that at very many places and it is appreciated. That's how you gain loyal customers. They gained one today!
