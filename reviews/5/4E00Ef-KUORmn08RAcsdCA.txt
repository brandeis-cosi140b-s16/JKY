El Charro is just the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down and I looooooves me my Mexican food. Unfortunately I live in California now where they believe Mexican food has to be pretty above all else. Mexican food is NOT about pretty! Mexican food is about greasy cheesy spicy goodness wrapped in deliciousness and fried in real lard! I've been going here for decades and every time I'm back in Arizona I make it a point to go at least twice. 

People who are hung up on 'host services' or other BS should just order the green chili burro and shut up. This place is about speed, cheap, and wanting to gorge yourself on everything on the menu until they have to cart you out in a wheelbarrow with smile on your face so wide they can count your fillings.

OK, since I should be 'unbiased' and 'fair' and all that stuff, here: 
1. Cashier/host staff aren't exactly plucked from the Rainbow Room. They can be in a hurry or just lazy. The wait staff are good though.
2. As unhealthy as it gets if you're insane enough to care when food is this good.
3. The music - recently they started piping in some 'authentic' Mexican music to add some sort of ambiance. They need to go back to how it used to be, it does get annoying.
4. I'm reaching for a con here but If you are into taking a long time savoring your appetizer before the mains come, you'll be disappointed. The waiter goes to the kitchen, the door swings open and the door swings back as your waiter emerges with your food. Some days I was sure they were psychic because I couldn't believe it was that fast.
5. Hands down the MOST ANNOYING thing about El Charro is that it closes for an agonizing 2-3 months in the summer time. Yes, no one wants to be in Mesa in the summer time, but COME ON the people need their fix!

But let's be honest, those cons are NOTHING compared to the pros of this place. Go here, go here often and take your friends/families.
