This location was my first experience with the Two Hippies restaurants, and it makes me want to try all of the other Two Hippies establishments.  I can walk there from work and I eat there all the time.  It's not fancy, but the food is really inexpensive and I find it very tasty.  The hot dogs ($3.50-$4) are particularly good - they come on large hoagie buns and are covered with generous amounts of toppings.  My favorite is the #9 hot dog with onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese and guacamole.  Burgers ($6) are good too - juicy with flavorful toppings.  And, the staff are super friendly which makes a trip there all the more pleasant.
