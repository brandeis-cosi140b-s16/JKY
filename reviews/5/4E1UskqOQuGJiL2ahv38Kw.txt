We sat at one of the few tables and were entertained by the pictures of Acapulco on the walls. --Acapulco is a beautiful beach in Mexico therefore this thought crossed my mind: "Why on earth would this guy move to Pittsburgh, of all places?" 
I don't know and I don't care. We want him to stay in Pittsburgh forever! He's got one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Burgh. 

Owned by a couple, the wife does her magic in the kitchen and the husband runs the floor. The typical menu look has plenty of entr√©es. Our food here is always outstanding; you get what you ask for, not a dish filled with lettuce or cheese or sides as you often see. Consequently when our friends asked us to meet us here we couldn't wait to drive across town and enjoy another dinner with them. Too bad we don't live near this place, with this quality and price we could eat here almost every day!
