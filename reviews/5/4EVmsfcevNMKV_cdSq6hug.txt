For someone who claims to dislike Mexican food, my reviews sure speak differently. Carlito's Burritos are a mammoth of a meal. Being raised in Vegas, it should not come as a surprise that everything is super sized or all you can eat. With this place, their monster wrap might as well be totted as a buffet in itself. 

Katrina M. has been raving about this restaurant and the spice factor of the food. If there is one flavor that I cannot get enough of, it is spiciness. I came in ready to regret my decision, but it was more well rounded than that. Between myself and a friend, we shared a pork verde combo burrito with rice and black beans. It comes with an option to smother it. I suggest the green chile sauce because it definitely adds a distinct kick. We added a sopapilla, green chile stew, and a salad for three dollars more. I am glad that we split this meal because it would be near impossible to polish everything off by myself. For ten dollars and change, this is the most filling, high quality, and cheap meal you will be able to get.

The pork was tender and moist. The mellow flavors of the inside are accentuated by the subtly bold bite of the green chile that covers the entire burrito. The dressing for the tossed salad was too oily and lacked an acid to balance it. The green chile stew is the same as the one that we asked for on the burrito, but it was delicious enough to warrant another side. We had thought that the sopapilla had been forgotten. As I was about to speak up, they came out with the freshly fried morsel and a bottle of honey to accompany it. The bread had a nice airy quality while producing a chewy bite. I love any variations of a donut and they make one of the best. 

It is hard to continue my "I dislike Mexican food" stance with such high quality places such as Carlito's around.
