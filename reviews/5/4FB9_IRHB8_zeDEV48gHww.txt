Going to Border Grill is not just going out to brunch/lunch/dinner, it's an experience! My friends & I sat on their lovely patio for brunch for the 2nd time & it keeps getting better & better. Hands down, no Las Vegas brunch can match the quality & price you get at Border Grill. We also had the pleasure of meeting "The Two Hot Tamales," it's great to see a celebrity chef owned restaurant with chefs actively involved in their own restaurant & not just a famous name attached to it! Even the executive chef Mike came out to our table just to make sure we were enjoying everything. I can't wait to go back for brunch, next time I'll try the unlimited mimosas they offer, the table next to us had them & those mimosas looked so refreshing! Thanks for another great dining experience!
