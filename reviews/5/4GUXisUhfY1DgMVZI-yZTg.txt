The hubby and I were up for trying a new place and saw the great reviews for Tapas 51. It did not disappoint! The menu is relatively small, however it still gives variety without being overwhelming. I wish I could have tried one of everything, but we ended up choosing the beef empanadas, lamb mole and pork belly tacos. All delicious. I wish I could have tried the ceviche but am 5 months pregnant at the moment so will have to save it for another time! The staff was very attentive and courteous. It's definitely off the beaten path and very unassuming (you wonder if you're in the right spot when you pull up for the first time). It was fairly empty for a Saturday night, but I'm hopeful that business will pick up and they can keep their doors open!
