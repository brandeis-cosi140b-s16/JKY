I don't tout many restaurants especially Mexican food but La Condesa is by far one of the best taco shop restaurants I have been to in the valley. 

It is hard to believe that with almost a Mexican restaurant on every corner in Phoenix that most if them if not all of them are disappointing or overpriced.

If you want a Scottsdale vibe with overpriced drinks and unauthentic food then this is not the place for you but if you want home flavor cooking with fresh ingredients with an authentic smile, then don't miss trying out this great new hot spot. You won't be disappointed!
