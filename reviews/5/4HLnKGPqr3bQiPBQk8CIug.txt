La Loma is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Arizona!  The enchilada's are addicting!  I could seriously eat here every day and there have been many weeks where I have eaten here 4 or 5 times! My advice is give it a try, I have taken many friends here and they have all been as pleased as I am with this place!
