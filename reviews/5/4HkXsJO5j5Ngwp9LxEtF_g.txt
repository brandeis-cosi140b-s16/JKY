We just moved into a loft apt in downtown phoenix and we figured we would walk down to Vitamin T for dinner this past Saturday.  Much to our surprise it was gone...and a new restaurant in its place, there was a sidewalk sign stating "Soft Opening 5pm. At first we were hesitant but figured we could wait the 25mins and swing back by...and are we glad we did!!

We noticed the tables outside were not barren and had plants on them, we walked in the door to a much more inviting and relaxing atmosphere than we were used to at Vitamin T.  We were greeted by this rotund man with a big smile, turns out it wasnt an employee..but the owner of all three Fuego restaurants - Jeff.

He proceeded to welcome us and seat us at a table and give us a short rundown on the restaurant.  All food was 50% off because it was their opening night, and were getting the staff trained.  We looked over the menu and decided to go with the Empanadas to start, then I ordered the Fuego Meatloaf, with black beans and sauteed veggies and my companion went with the Short Rib Ropa Vieja, with the green chile au gratin potatoes. 

The food was amazing!! other than they forgot about our Empanadas (which they gave us for free) the flavors were outstanding.  The dinner was made complete by a slice of their Key lime pie, which was sensational!!  

Great Food...Great atmosphere... definitely reccomending Fuego Cityscape to all my foodie friends!!!
