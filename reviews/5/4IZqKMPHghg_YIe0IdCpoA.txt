I have been here about twenty times. It was good from the start, but, every time there is some little improvement that impresses me even more. Last night I had theh 9 oz New York Strip medium rare, rice, whole pinto beans, a chile relleno. and some flour tortillas.  I always dump a whole little dish of their fresh salsa on my rice. I also had a margarita the way I prefer them with Cointreau and Corralejo Blanco Tequila. Everything was very tasty.  I will get the exact same thing next time.
