My boyfriend and I went to this place because we saw its five-star review. They have these super cheap mini tacos. Yes they are mini sized when served but then they have this salsa bar that you can fill up your taco an.d makE iT your own. All of the meat in the tacos and the salsas are authentic Mexican. All home-made by a crew that knows what they're doing. Also, the lady that served us was very friendly and willing to help us read the menu because it's all in Spanish :o Prices comparable to any other fast-food restaurants with quality of a dine-in restaurant and complimentary chips! We were very impressed and came back the very next day.
