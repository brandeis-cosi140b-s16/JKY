I love going to Mundo! Delish maragaritas and great food. It's strange to see the negative reviews about the hostess and wait staff as we NEVER have a problem. I can vouch for the sea bass and the scallops. Both are phenomenal! Just make sure you don't get there too late...this isn't a late night kitchen, but it's a great place to dine if you're headed downtown for the night!
