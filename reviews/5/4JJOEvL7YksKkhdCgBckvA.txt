Absolutely love this place. The pulled pork sandwich is the best I have had. Sweet and juicy. The 1/4 pound is so large that I wonder how others are able to eat more of it then that. The brisket has a wonderful smokey taste to it and is very tender.  I/4 pound size is more then enough to feed the average woman. I added some macaroni salad as a side and once again it was delicious. Thank goodness that they don't add cabbage las was stated previously by someone else. My family has tried all of the burritos and we don't have one complaint. 
This is a to go place but there are four tables outside to sit at and some additional chairs. It is nestled in an orange grove so with the misters that they have it is a very comfortable place to relax and enjoy your meal. Coke products are also available, as is Sarsaparilla. Saturday's they have ribs that are also available by the rack and pork butts that can be purchased whole or by the pound. I would call ahead though because the ribs go fast. 
The owners and workers are incredibly nice and will chat with you when they have a moment.
