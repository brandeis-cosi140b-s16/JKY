The food is excellent here and the staff is very friendly. It's a family owned business that's survived for some time now. Primarily a husband and wife who own the business and work basically all day and night. It's a hole in the wall place but some of the most authentic Mexican food you will find in the area. Also, their Christmas tamales are a huge hit! If you're looking for somewhere good to go here's the place to stop!
