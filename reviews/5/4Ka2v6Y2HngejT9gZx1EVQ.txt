Every time I go to Mesa to visit family, I try to stop here, even if its only for next day leftovers.  Everyone's very friendly and will make your food to order and correctly every time.  They also have really great deals each week that are super inexpensive, yet filling and delicious.  (somewhere around $4 for food and beverage depending on the week).  Food is awesome yet affordable and they are so fast on getting it out to you.
