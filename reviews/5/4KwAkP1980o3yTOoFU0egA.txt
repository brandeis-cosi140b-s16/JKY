BOMB!  This place is my favorite Mexican fast food restaurant I have discovered in the Phoenix metro area in the past four years.  I'm a first-generation Mexican American so I tend to be fairly picky about Mexican food.  Salsita's meets and exceeds all my expectations.  They have a wonderful selection of meats, and do not charge you extra to replace meats in the combination plates like other places.  For example, if you order a combo that regularly includes a shredded beef burro and would like carne asada instead, you don't have to pay an extra $2-3 like you do at other Mexican places I've been to.  They have quite a diverse menu, and serve many different dishes.  They also have a salsa bar inside, which is huge indicator to me that a Mexican place is legitimate.  
The food is tasty, the salsa is spicy when it needs to be, and their guacamole is pretty dang good too.  
Be careful with other Salsita's locations though.  I have discovered that the menus are not universal.  That's why this location is my absolute favorite.
