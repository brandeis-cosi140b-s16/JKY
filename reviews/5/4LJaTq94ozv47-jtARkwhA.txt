We just had a wonderful, delicious and authentic Mexican meal here and we couldn't be more pleased. Understanding that this is a new reboot in an old classic establishment, the interior threw us as compared to the outside, which is fairly simple. Inside was beautiful! Sparkling new and charming. But really, the food! That's what we came for and it was top-shelf quality! Service was lovely. We left completely satisfied and full of their good, good food. 

When we come back, we will be sure to return!
