Sunday, and I'm looking for an early Mexican food lunch.   I turned to Yelp as I often do and soon was sitting at the bar chatting happily with 2 friendly employees.  Lenero Mexican Grill on Bell in Union Hills get a solid 5 from me.  The bartender-waitress was very helpful, and soon I had put in an order for a new one to me: a Plate of lamb cooked Barbados style.  It quickly arrived over a thin layer of diced veggies that complimented the flavored, which was fantastic.  Warm corn tortillas, a small bowl of amazing pinto beans, spiced perfectly, and a dab of lettuce and tomato.  It was all delicious.   Nice chat with my server continued and I started thinking about a possible small bowl of Lentil Soup to take home.  I asked for a taster, which was happily provided.   The soup flavor, ala Mexico, was terrific.  One for tonight awaits, and one for our freezer.   I left even happier than when I arrived.  I will go back and without hesitation recommend you give Lenero a try when you want great, distinctive and even healthy Mexican Food.  Check out their website for the menu and to understand their healthy approach to serving you delicious food.  This is a family operation working very hard to succeed and serve their customers.   I love that.
