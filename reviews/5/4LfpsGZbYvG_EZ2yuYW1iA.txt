Having dined at the one in Santa Monica, CA I knew what their menu offered and what the highlights of it are. The bartender mentioned he had only worked here a week but he was very friendly, attentive, knew how to make his drinks well, and was a great conversationalist. Our food was excellent, came out promptly, and met expectations. I really enjoyed this place and would definitely come bak again.
