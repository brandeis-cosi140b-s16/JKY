Shockingly good and inexpensive to boot. We got a nice corner table on the patio on a Saturday night when it wasn't so crowded. There is a dance floor inside with a very small crowd about 10pm. The food was great though. The $5 nachos had some magical combinations of ingredients. We added chicken, but the oaxaca cheese was a nice twist and the colored chips were easy to dip and get alot of toppings. One of the better nachos around. Tried the $3 side of five spice fries and those were thin and crispy, but not alot of spice really. My order of three tacos for $6 was incredible. You had Corona Beef, spiced chicken and tequilla lime shrimp. Each was loaded with toppings and came with an unusual side of jicama slaw. My buddies chicken pita at $7 was huge and looked great as well. Overall, a great meal. Inside of casino was packed, but this place had room to eat and dance if you wanted. Good slection of craft beers too.
