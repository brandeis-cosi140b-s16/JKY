This place is a hole in the wall worthy of our 30 min drive there! Best Mexican food I tasted so far! Fresh ingredients super flavorful.  The shripadilla is an explosion of flavors in your mouth its pretty amazingly tasty!!! Tacos are excellent! Great music , service and the lady that cooks is the bomb!!! She is super friendly and will do whatever you want ! I can't say enough about this place! We will be regulars!! My kids love the homemade horchata and ending our meal with tres leches, flan or sopapillas!! YUM!!!!
