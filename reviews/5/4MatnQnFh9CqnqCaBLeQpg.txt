After hearing great things and sick of the usual Mexican food haunts I decided to take my date to Gallo Blanco Caf√©. This, it turns out, was a great decision. One I will continue to make for years to come.

Walking over the threshold of the door could just as well have been a porthole that transported me straight to downtown Mexico City. The restaurant had a cool comtemporary/Districto Federal feel to it that complimented the ultra-hip Hotel Clanderon it is attached to. The place was packed and it soon became apparent this was because it was a Wednesday and Wednesday's are Flamanco night! Now even though its not my thing I have to say I was pretty impressed by these dancers. 

While waiting for our table we sauntered over to the bar which was quaint but perfect for the setting. We both ordered the San Juan. A tasty concoction of Lime Vodka, Liquer 43, and Soda water, and lime juice (I was in love at first sip!). After a short wait our table was ready. For dinner I ordered the Half chicken, my date a steak torta, and for the table some guacamole. The first thing out was the guacamole and considering myself quite the guac snob I was immediately impressed. Light, zesty, and perfectly balanced! Another round of drinks ordered and dinner is served. My chicken was citrus marinated and came out with a sweet glaze that is still making my mouth water as I type. With tortillas on the side and eaten fajita style, it was delicious. Her torta, a grilled ribeye with cheese and salsa, was good but it was clear to both of us I was the delicious-dinner-winner tonight. 

Afterwards save some time to grab another cocktail and walk over to the retro pool or rooftop bar of the Hotel Clarendon. In Phoenix we are not exactly overflowing with cool rooftop spots so indulge while you can. Great view and quiet enough for good conversation. Overall, I couldn't have been more pleased so go check this gem out. Preferably on Flamanco night. (thank me later)
