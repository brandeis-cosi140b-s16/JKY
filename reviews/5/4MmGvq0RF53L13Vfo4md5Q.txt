What a fantastic dinner!
Surprised they weren't pack at 7:30 on Saturday night of Labor Day Weekend.
The gal on the phone was pleasant and welcoming! Free valet when we arrived. The hostess sat us in a beautiful booth. And then...our cheery server delivered thin, crisp, warm chips with flavorful salsa!
The house margarita and the Sangria are both great choices.
Dinner was enchiladas served differently than anywhere else I've been. They were baked separately in a skillet rather than on the plate of food as normally prepared. The rice was a mix of sweet corn and rice and was delicious! The black beans ahead a nice spicy kick, but not too hot.
We completed our meal with a plate churros (with whipped cream and chocolate to dip!) and the best fried ice cream I've had in a long time!!! Honey drizzled over the top added a wonderful flavor!
We met another staff member on his first week in the AZ location from the original location in MN. He was excited for this new opportunity and we wish him continued success!
Next time I'm in Phoenix, Black Chile is definitely a return visit for us!
Please give them a try!
