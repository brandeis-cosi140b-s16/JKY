I just recently moved into the area and I have been hearing about this Filibertos Mexican Food and how good it is... So being cautious I came onto yelp to check the reviews to see if they were good or not... Well I saw the reviews were not what I expected but my friends swore this place was good so I decided to check it out... All I want to say is I came I tried and I LOVED IT!!! The food there is fresh and really tasty and the people working there are extremely friendly!! I told them I was new to the area and they hooked me up with a free taco as a sample!! I just wanna say people who are having bad days or are just usually negative dont come onto yelp and write untrue useless reviews! I have nothing but good things to say about this place my suggestion to anyone that comes on here to look at these reviews dont take our words for it try it yourself I am sure you will be nothing but pleased with this location!!
