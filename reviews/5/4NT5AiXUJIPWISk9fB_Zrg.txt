This is a great local restaurant run by friendly people. My husband and I come by at least once a week. The decorations are festive and bright. The wait staff is always great. We love their fish tacos, enchiladas, homemade tamales, and chili rellenos. The house margarita is always refreshing. I choose this over Macayo's and La Fonda every time. You get the kind of flavor and attention that just aren't at these bigger restaurants.
