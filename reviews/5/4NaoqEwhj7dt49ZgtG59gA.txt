I love Chipotle!  Their vegetarian burritos are the best!  We eat at this location a few times a month, but on our last visit, the girl really skimped on the rice and beans and we had to wait for the fajita veggies to finish cooking.  Not our best visit, but won't keep me from eating there either.  :)  Oh, and the have GREAT margaritas!
