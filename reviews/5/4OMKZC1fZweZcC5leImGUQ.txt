Stopped in for lunch.  Nice little bar with great variety of beers and margaritas.  More patio seating than inside seating.  As far as lunch, the chips and salsa were ok.  Wife had the carne asada tacos which were very good.  I had the chili verde burrito.  Burrito was great!!  Perfect amount of meat with great flavor and a awesome spiciness to the green sauce.  This is a must try little "hole in the wall"!!  Next time stopping in for dinner on the patio.
