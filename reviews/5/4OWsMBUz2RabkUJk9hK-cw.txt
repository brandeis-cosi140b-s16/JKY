This shop serves great tasting tortas. I've been there twice, my favorite so far is the shredded beef, I add a lot of the chipotle sauce they have in the salsa bar. 

I want to try this shop's torta ahogada, which is a torta with hard bread stuffed with big chunks of tender meat and dunked in tomato sauce. 

The price is reasonable, your paying like six bucks and change plus tax for great customer service, cleanliness, good food and very quick service. 

The building has some very cool old-school Mexican movie posters up on the wall.
