Johnny the owner, manager, cook, cashier and greeter is AWESOME! My husband and I ordered the breakfast burritos and they were excellent. The burritos has a homemade aroma to it! We loved it! We also love the salsa and pico de gallo, there are many various type of salsa and you can have as much as you like! In addition to our visit, Johnny gave us four free burritos to take home! He is one of sweetest owner I have met. It is oblivious that he cares for his customers. Awesome food, awesome owner, awesome place! Very clean too. I highly recommend and I will be coming back myself.
