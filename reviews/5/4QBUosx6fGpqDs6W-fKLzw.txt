Awesome place.  Chris is great! Suggests drinks and food items if you were never here. The music is great, atmosphere is comfortable and friendly. The food is amazing, the steak quesadillas are delicious and crunchy as well as cheesy and yummy. The Original Margarita is perfect. I will definitely come back.
