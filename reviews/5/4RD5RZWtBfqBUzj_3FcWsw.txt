I was there for lunch. The waitresses are very nice and fast. Also you don't have to wait for the food. The restaurant is not over-cooled (due to air conditioning), because everything is open to the street on one side. This is very well done.

Thank you, Tracy B. for this experience.

Only the food is not so healthy. But that's almost nowhere in the United States the case.
