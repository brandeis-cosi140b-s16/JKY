Hello, my name is April, and I'm a Chipotle addict. 
I always get the same thing...one small soft taco with all the fixings and steak, a kids bag of chips (just the perfect amount without going overboard...because if I get the big bag I WILL eat the entire thing). The perfect amount for lunch/dinner without breaking the bank, always under $5. YUM!!!
