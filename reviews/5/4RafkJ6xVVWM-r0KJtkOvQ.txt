Been waiting for this place to open since I saw the sign go up a few weeks ago.  They sure delivered.  The tamales are awesome!  Ordered the dozen, and not only did the owner throw in some bean tamales to sample, but she added more meat tamales of my choice because she's been getting slack on yelp.  Totally unnecessary, but much appreciated.

I loved the beef tamales, while the wife preferred the chicken.  The salsa is tasty with a pretty good kick.  And the beans, don't forget the beans, pure awesome!

We'll definitely be coming back.  The owner is an absolute sweetheart, and the customer service is top notch.
