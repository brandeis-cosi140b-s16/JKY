Mexican food genies, these dudes work kitchen magic in tiny quarters. If you can get in to one of their ~8 seats, you'll enjoy great food (try a chorizo burrito!) diner style with quick, friendly service. Come by when it's not busy, or order carry out - and good luck parking! You won't be disappointed, especially when you consider what you paid.
