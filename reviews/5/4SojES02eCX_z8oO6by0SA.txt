Such an interesting concept in a gorgeous new casino on the strip! 

What initially caught my eye were the neon signs on either side of the entrance. One proclaiming "Mexican Food" and the other "Chinese Food". Being a Mexican food junkie, my friend and I saddled up the bar on the Mexican side of the restaurant surrounded by cool Lucha Libre masks. We watched the Mexican women make fresh corn tortillas by hand behind the bar. 

I started with my token order of chips, salsa and guac. Oh..my..God!! The chips were to die for (What is that seasoning?), the salsa had a nice spicy kick and the $12 bowl of guacamole was huge & fresh!

We then split an order of chicken tacos which are small and come ala carte. The corn tortillas were as delicious as they looked! Naturally, I washed it all down with their signature salt margarita which had an amazing lime tasting foam on top.

I can't vouch for the Chinese side of this joint but the whole restaurant was buzzing with energy and I am still dreaming about the food a week later....
