This has got to be my favorite new spot in town. They opened right down the street from my in laws and we are there all the time. As everyone has said, not only is the food great but the service is incredible. There is never an empty cup in that restaurant and they are quick to refill the chips. They light the fajitas on fire for a little flare right before serving them to you. But my favorite part is the grilled onions they bring out with the cips, salsa and bean dip. Yum!
