Get a double Family pack of Carne Asada, corn tortillas, a big order of beans as much salsa and limes as you need. This meat is grilled over charcoal for super flavor. As good as anywhere in Sonora or Jalisco. Get this to go on a Friday night and you will eat like a King all weekend and be a Family hero. Don't be shy the very friendly staff will help you when you step up to the left side of the counter. Get a take out styrofoam to go carton to put your salsa and vegetables into to take home.

If this food tastes like the homemade carne Asada your friends serve you should not be surprised to find out they really picked up a to go meal from Tacarbon. Open until 10:00 and you can eat on the patio.  I love this place.
