Got the $4.31 deal for 2 Fremont street tacos and a 12oz PBR. The deal was not on the menu or advertised anywhere that I could see, but I asked a worker about it and they knew exactly what I was talking about. The street tacos are small, about 3 bites each, but they were good. I got one shredded beef and one chicken, both with corn salsa, onions, and cilantro. The shredded beef had more meat in it. See the picture I posted for a visual.
