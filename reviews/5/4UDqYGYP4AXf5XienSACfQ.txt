I am biased.  I love this place.  I love the atmosphere and the service.  The wait staff is great.  My glass in never empty and the chips keep coming.  
It is priced a little high...but well worth it to me.  The quality of the food is great and the Carne Asada is a favorite.
The El Capitan Torta is amazing.  I can eat about 6 of them without blinking.
That's why I'm fat.
