The food here is excellent and varied! I haven't tried anything yet that I haven't loved. The prices are about what you'd expect. I was a Chipotle fiend for a long, long time until this Qdoba moved in near my home. I hadn't gone back to Chipotle for a long time until recently and now I see why. 

Qdoba does everything better than Chipotle, except it is just as unhealthy. The menu is more varied and don't listen to anyone that says they don't give you options because that's absurd. I have a very specific order that they deliver quickly and with a smile every time I go there. On the other hand, if you're eating mexican food while on a diet you clearly aren't getting the point lol.
