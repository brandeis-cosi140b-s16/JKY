this place was an old taco bell joint, and there isnt a drive thru so IDK what the guy below me is talking about. But this place is the best place ive gone to, and believe me, ive lived in Phx my whole life and have gone to almost every bertos, hole in the wall mexican food place and Rolandos is the bomb!! Prices are cheaper than the bertos and cooked wonderfully. Its is definately run down but their food makes up for it all. Also, my husband and i just went there and they are accepting credit cards now!!!!! and looks like they did some cleaning/remodeling.
