I absolutely love this place. In fact, most of my friends eat here on a regular basis. As for myself, I pretty much live on their steak n egg breakfast burrito. For $4.32, how could you go wrong?! 

The portions are as generous as Mother Theresa. I get a good coma nearly every time I eat here. Perfect for anyone on a budget.. Who needs daily deals when the entire menu is already unbeatable? Almost seems like they're paying is to eat their food. 

As for the grub.. I've never once been let down. Granted, I'm a sucker for anything wrapped in a tortilla (..anything), but I gotta give it to em.. they do great work on Mexican food. Not overly classy, just the right atmosphere to s sit down and enjoy some spicy delectableness. 

I doubt I'll ever love a Mexican food joint more than Riva's. I can die happy with their steak and egg burrito in my hands
