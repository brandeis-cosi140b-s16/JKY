By far, hands down, the BEST taco/burrito place in Vegas for a take out place.

I love fried foods, even though I try not to eat it a lot.  Out of all the Mexican places I've eaten at in Las Vegas, California and Arizona, Roberto's houses the best chimichanga ever.

There is a Roberto's in Arizona, but it is literally 50 miles away from my home.

I miss Roberto's.  It's one of the things that I loved about living in Vegas -- it was 24 hours.
