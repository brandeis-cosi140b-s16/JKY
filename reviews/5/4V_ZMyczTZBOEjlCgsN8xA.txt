Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.

I had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla "wet" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.

The carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.

The chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.

A word about the "salad" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.

The beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.

The staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding....
