AS for the place, it is awesome!!

Fresh corn and flour tortillas are to die for, a little pricy, but there is no other choice in Central/WesternPA.

The Taco stand outside is awesome, it surely satisfies the cravings for tacos from a Taco truck in California, while being right here in PA.

It is in a tourist area, so regular mercado items are way overpriced!

Also I would give 4.75 stars, but not an option because it is owned by Americans and they are taking the big profits while the Mexican people doing all the work are probably getting minimum wage or less.
