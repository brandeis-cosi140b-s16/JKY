I love Rivas! I always come very late at night and well  it doesn't even matter because the freshness of the food is consistent. Anyways I always get steak fries no beans. It is scrumptious ! && service is a little bit above above of their  competitors. Very good. Wish they had a stamp card for their regulars.
