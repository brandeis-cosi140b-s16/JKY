this is my 3rd time eating here. The first two times were carry out. The 3rd time I dined in. I love a good Mexican burrito. The first Burrito was the red chili pork. I love spicy/hot food and this burrito was just perfect on the heat leavel. The second burrito was the grilled steak. This one had good flavor and a great grilled taste. My third was the shredded beef. This was in my opinion was okay. So out of the three I have tried I will say this if your looking for a little heat with the flavor go with the Red Chili pork. If your looking for just over all flavor go with the grilled steak.

I love the burritos and will frequent this spot.

Oh, and for about 7.50 per person to dine in its worth the visit. If you don't have the time and want carry out its just a little under 6 bucks without a drink.
