I have been going to this restaurant all my life through all its different locations. I have never had a bad meal or bad service. And while I live a very far distance from this place and dislike parking in the mill ave area, I still come here at least once a year for my birthday. It is also the cheapest sitdown restaurant I have ever been to. I prefer it to any other Mexican restaurant. The taco suaves are amazing.
