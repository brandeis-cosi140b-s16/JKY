As someone who moved from Phoenix to Boston, it has become impossible to find a place like FIliberto's here. Appreciate what you all have in Phoenix. There is no review I could write to explain the sorrow that I have for leaving behind Filibertos. I don't want to live without Filibertos...

Seriously though, appreciate the awesomeness while you still live in Arizona.
