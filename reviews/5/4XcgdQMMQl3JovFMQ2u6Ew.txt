First off - 6022 S. McClintock is apparently their address, although this is a little north of where Amados actually is.  Amados is on the west side of McClintock just a tad north of Guadalupe.  There's a sign out near the street, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.

So what is Amados?  A Mexican joint that's open 24/7 and seriously has some of the best Mexican food you can find.  The carne asada is so so so good, the chile relleno burrito is AWESOME (and I believe it's veggie-friendly for you vegetarian folks out there), their fish tacos are delicious...I could go on and on.  $8 will get you two carne asada burritos, which is a *lot* of food.  They also have a little condiment bar that has excellent red and green salsa, limes, cucumbers, jalapenos, and a bunch of other stuff you might be interested in.  There's a surprisingly decent amount of indoor seating, and there's a little bit of outdoor seating as well.

Amados is basically amazing - I seriously go here at least once a week.  One of the coolest parts is unlike Filiberto's and a bunch of the other taco shops nearby, a trip to Amados won't result in you spending the rest of your day sitting on a toilet.  I've been eating here for years and have yet to get even slightly sick from their food, which is impressive for a 24-hour taco shop.

One warning - late at night (meaning midnight and later), this place can get extremely shady and packed full of people you probably don't want to be around.  During daylight hours though, everything's always very mellow here.

And don't be worried if you don't speak Spanish - the staff here speaks excellent English and is very helpful.
