Attn tourists.. You should venture off the strip and have some great Mexican food at the Tuscany casino.  They have great prices and the staff and service is excellent.  I recommend this restaurant to everyone as it is one of my 
favorite places to dine in Vegas.  All of the food is from scratch.  The bean dip is the best I've ever had in my life!  It's complimentary with chips and salsa too!  I love the quesidillas and burritos.  You can also use a buy one get one entree from the Vegas 2 go books.  I won't eat Mexican anywhere else!!  This place is a hidden gem!
