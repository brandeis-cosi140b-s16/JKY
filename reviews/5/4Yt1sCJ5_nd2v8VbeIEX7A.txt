Oh Border Grill, how sad am I that you, somehow, inexplicably, don't have a location in the Bay Area.  We would welcome you with open arms!  I would single handedly pay your rent for a year the first month out!  

There's not just one thing that sticks out about Border Grill, but it's a culmination of everything, executed to perfection.  The drinks are imaginative, strong, sweet, spicy, tangy, whatever you want them to be.  

The food kind of sucker punches you with how exceptionally delicious it is.  I mean, I knew it'd be good, but not that good!  Shouts of "WHAT IS THIS?!" accompanied by vigorous head nodding could be heard echoing throughout the restaurant with each bite of my plantain empanadas.  
The Oaxacan strip steak is as delectable as it is huge.  And if that mesmerizing mole doesn't win you over, you don't stand a chance against the wild mushroom quesadilla. Not. A. Chance. 
If you're as undyingly full as we were but stubborn enough to force down a dessert because everything else was so amazing you could never live with yourself without having tried it, they do two half portions of any of the desserts so you can "share" but still get the one you want!  Fair warning: the half portions are pretty much as big as a full portion anywhere else.  

The service is effortless.  Ryan was awesome; he knew the menu inside and out, made some great recommendations, and gave us good tips for ordering.  Someone give the guy a raise!  The ambience is perfectly cool and casual, so we felt totally welcome to take our time ordering, just sit back and lounge and keep the drinks on coming.  And all this for way less than it has any right to be!  

I'm just so angry!  Where are you back home when I need you, Border Grill?!
