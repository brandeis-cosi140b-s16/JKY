Delicious! I had 3 tacos. The barbacoa was my favorite of the 3, but they were all great. I loved the toppings/salsa bar. My husband had a combination plate of tacos that he loved. My daughter loved the crunchy French fries. The staff was friendly and helpful and the seating area was clean including the highchairs.
