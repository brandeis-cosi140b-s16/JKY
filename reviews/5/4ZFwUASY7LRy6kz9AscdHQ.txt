Best Carne Asada Taco in Vegas! I dine on fresh-Mex food religiously and Jalapeno Grille is now on my priority list. I started with one Carne Asada Taco and had to order a second. They have a very good salsa bar as well. The salsa verde had a nice smokey flavor and was one of the best I have tasted.
