Wow!

A restaurant trifecta! Good service, good food, original idea.

First, the service. Our waitress was extremely nice and very efficient. I always appreciate friendly service and good recommendations.

Second, an enormous quantity of tasty food. We could have ordered half as much and been completely sated.

Finally, this fusion trend is not new but when it's done right, you know it. The spicy pork torta with jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and kimchi, and the beef burrito with kimchi on the side were full of flavor.
