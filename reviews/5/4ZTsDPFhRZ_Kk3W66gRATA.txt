I really liked this place.  The service was on point and the food came out quickly.  I really appreciate the vegan menu items that's more than just salad.  I had the vegan nachos and it was very tasty.  I would totally go back to try more of the items, especially the ones with tofu.
It was kinda pricey...but it seems that's normal for the majority of Mexican places like Lindo or Frank and Fina.  I ordered 3 dishes (vegan nachos, bean& cheese burrito, and a burger), dessert and a soda and the check was $53.

I'd say give this place a try, you'll be in love with the food.  If the price bothers you, then try their happy hour menu on Monday through Saturday from 3pm-6pm.
