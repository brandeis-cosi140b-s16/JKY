Amazing burritos and pleasant staff. I probably stop here at least once a week. Their commitment to locally sourced, organic foods is commendable. This is a  build your own line style burrito/taco/torta place run by a family with strong local ties. Not only do the burritos make my stomach happy but their ethos makes my my heart happy too.
