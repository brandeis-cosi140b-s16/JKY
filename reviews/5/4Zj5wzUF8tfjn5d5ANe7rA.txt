This is the second location. The original is still location in Avondale on MC85. This one does not have the home feel like the original, but  is more like a regular restaurant, which you might prefer it if you are claustrophobic or don't like being in tight quarters with strangers.

The food is always fantastic. The enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had. I could drink it!! Food is consistent between locations and visits. Portions are generous. Prices between $7 and $13. One of my favorite places.
