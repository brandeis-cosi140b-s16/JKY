First Visit to Diego Pops! Definitely won't be our last! 

Be sure to ask to be seated at one of Steve Sparks' tables and order whatever he suggests that evening, he won't steer you wrong! Having grown up in the Valley and eating a lot of Mexican food, he said he felt like their tacos were some of the best in the Valley, and he wasn't wrong!

We tried the pineapple pork bowl with creamy beans and coconut rice. Brought half home and will definitely be looking forward to leftovers!  Also tried the green chile chicken taco in crispy corn tortilla, grilled steak in flour tortilla, grilled shrimp in crispy corn, and chicken adobo in crispy corn also! All were awesome-especially the grilled shrimp! I've tried grilled shrimp tacos from New England to San Diego and Portland to Miami, but have never had any with the flavors this had. 

They have a nice selection of domestic and import beer along with a variety of tequilas and cocktails. The mix a mean Michelada that is spicy but refreshing at the same time. 

Already looking forward to our next visit! Brussels sprouts nachos are first on the list!
