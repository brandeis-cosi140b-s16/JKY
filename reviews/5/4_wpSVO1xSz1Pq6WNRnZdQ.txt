I love this place. I live down the street and have been going here for a year! Amazing salsa bar. The red medium is amazing. Pretty much everything on their menu kicks ass and you cannot go wrong ! I love their amazing burritos and carne asada fries. Get the burro burrito its a huge ass thing feeds 2 you can't go wrong only 9 bucks!!!!!! Enchilada plate is good to. Try them out very tasty and authentic !! Wish they were open 24/7 for those late night food runs lol
