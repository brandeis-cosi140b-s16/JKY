I'm a sucker for fresh, flavorful, quality Mex and these guys deliver.
Staff is always courteous; register lady is very sweet, the cook (which I think is the owner) is friendly too and will customize your dish if you ask.
While you wait, you get a bowl of fresh warm chips and some well crafted salsa. They make their own and sometimes have variety of different colors/flavors/hotness levels (ask). Although, that also means it's a little inconsistent, so don't whine if they got it a bit off that day :)
You'll get your food in more than reasonable time (even when it's super busy) right as it's made and ready.
Like others here mentioned their fish taco/burrito is awesome, thanks to their own made sauce and fresh ingredients (my favorite dish). I tried most things on the menu (used to work near by) and everything was good except a steak burrito I had once (the meat was on the dry side).
Horchata is fresh made and delicious.
Lastly, guess what, these guys have a liquor license; so if you're on the market for a noon margarita definitely try one.
Cheers
