I do not understand some of the bad reviews. . .I guess I am confused as I have been here multiple times and all the times that I have been here. . .I have had the best service as well as good qualtiy food.  Maybe I was lucky???  Who knows!  =)

Either way, I love love this place!  It has a grea Hawaiian vibe to it when you walk in. . .all the decor is Hawaiian and the staff are definitely friendly like I expect the Hawaiians to be!  LOL  Adn it's right down the street from me. . .PERFECT!  =)

My bf still prefers Chipotle but for me. . .I would much rather goto Braddah's!  =)  The flavors just rocks it for me. . .=)

Anyhow, onto the food.  

IF it is your first time, let them know that it is your first time, they will give you little bites of the meat so that you can taste before you buy!  Good deal huh?

I normally hate chicken and will not eat it anywhere else unless it is deep fried. . .BUT here the chicken is sooooo freaking good!  Juicy with just the right amount of char to give that extra kick of flavor.  I have had it on a salad, burrito and nachos. . .and they have all been delicious!  I've liked the chicken so much from the beginning that I have not wanted to eat any other meat there. . .so my reccomendation is to get the chicken!  =D

Also, they give samples of the bark that they have currently in stock. . .ok I admit it. . .it is UGLY to look at.  But like the saying goes. . .don't judge a book by its cover. . .well don't judge until you eat one. . .very good!!  I tend to like salty sweet desserts and they have just the right balance.  =)

Last but not least. . .if you want some kick in your food. . .don't just get the salsas. . .ask them to add on habaneros to your dish. . .=)  I have had the habaneros and some were spicy and some were not. . .but they sure do add a lot more kick them the salsas do.  =)

One of these days, I will order the other meats. . .but for now. . .this is my goto place for chicken!  =)
