Best Mexican food I've had

Tagged this place as an eatery to hit due to its great Yelp scores.  Just visited it and I understand why.  It deserves every star it gets.

I'm normally not a fan of Mexican food and don't know what's truly authentic.  Without exception, I find the cuisine too greasy, cheesy, and bland unless I slather on Tapatio or Cholula.  No longer.

Don Pancho's food is wonderfully flavorful, meats are tender, and it tastes fresh.  Great menu with selections you do not see at Americanized Mexican food eateries.  Service is fast and exceptionally courteous.  Chips and salsas are also good.  And their flan is uber yum.

We will be back to try more of the selections we've never heard of.  I had the beef head tacos and loved them.
