This place is great!

I was looking for a quick place to grab lunch close to work, but wanted to try something I had never tried before. I grabbed my phone and popped open the Yelp app, and started looking. I saw this place and decided to give it a try.

I was not disappointed. I ordered the California burrito and added Guac. The price was around $6 with a drink. I received my meal quickly and was pleased to see that the tortilla was hot and fresh. It looked and tasted like it had been made on the premises. The ingredients were tasty and hot!

I will definitely come back!
