You know the tacos are good when you only see Mexicans eating there.  I ordered the beef brain, beef head, and cow tongue tacos.  The cow tongue tacos here were hands-down the BEST tacos lenguas I've ever had in my life.  It was too spicy for me (you can ask them not to put the sauce on), and I still thought they were super delicious. I love cow tongue tacos, and these were really the best ever.  Tacos cost around $2 each, with the exception of the tacos lenguas, which were $2.25 each.  Worth it!  My brothers got the spicy pork tacos, and they said those were the best they ever ate.  They also have a bunch of other things like cow tongue fries, sopas, and other traditional Mexican foods, but I'll save that for next time.  Yep, go to this place.  Cheap good food, and it's enough to satisfy your stomach.
