Popped in today looking for a new place that served Mexican and so far I'm extremely happy!  Got the Fajita Veggies (Burrango) and that Dulce de Leche Cheesecake for dessert.  Ate to go, and the food was great!  The prices are very reasonable.  (I spent $25~ to feed 3 people) 

The man and woman who were running it were extremely friendly.  I hope to see this place succeed -- it's a great little spot, super clean, and well designed.

I would add that the only thing I'd like to see, is them expanding on the menu a little bit.  You can't make a menu to please everyone, so a little more variety would be awesome.  Maybe expanding on some traditional mexican items - huevos rancheros, cheese enchiladas, etc etc.  Overall, great food, great service, great price.  Cannot complain one bit!
