Poblano Pesto=YUM!

Their craft 2 menu is great.  You choose two items from that menu and you are more than full.   I love the mexican gumbo with black beans and chicken ask for a spoonful of corn salsa on top and it's all good.   My second pick is either two crunchy tacos or the quesadilla (chicken of course).  Delicioso.
