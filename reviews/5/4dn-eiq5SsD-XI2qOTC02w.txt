This place ROCKS! The food is different and seriously delicious. You should definitely get the taco platter and choose three flavors just for fun. It will be far too much food, but do it anyway. The variety here is killer and it would be silly to do anything but gorge yourself.

The prickley pear margarita was sweet and a perfect start to our meal. We enjoyed guacamole, white queso and the salsa bar while waiting for our meals and I can tell that I would love a happy hour here. They had mild verde (read boring) but yum! did that chile de arbol have some zing. Tread lightly here, I seriously love heat. My taco trio consisted of avocado frito, southern comfort and el pastor. The avocado frito is a lightly breaded and fried avocado with beans and cheese and mushrooms. I'd give this one three stars, good but the other two were to die for. The southern comfort had fried chicken which was crisp and salty, with soft sweet potato hash and chipotle sour cream drizzled on top. Slam dunk, Tubbs.  Then my absolute favorite, el pastor. Tender pork, tangy pineapple and cheese, all wrapped up for sweet and salty, juicy and savory pleasure. This one is not to miss!

If you are looking for awesome flavor, you simply must stop in to Tubbs for a try.
