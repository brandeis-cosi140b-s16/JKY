Best place ever!! Love it here. EXTREMELY AUTHENTIC MEXICAN and HONDURAN food. I'm extremely picky when I go out to eat Mexican food since I'm Mexican-American. This is my go to place to eat with my boyfriend. Great atmosphere and extremely friendly staff. If you come eat here brush up on your spanish since the servers speak mainly spanish. So many options on the menu! So delicious and big portions! I had the steak and chicken sopes and a side order of fried plantain. My boyfriend had the mixed quesadilla which comes With shrimp chicken and steak. YUM!
