OMG the Pork Barbacoa Salad is to die for!!! You can't really go wrong in this little strip mall with Firehouse Subs, Patsy Grimaldi's, Nielsen's, and Freed's... But I'd have to say Cafè Rio is my fav. 

They make the toritllas fresh daily, and the "shell" they put their humongous salad in is nothing short of fantastic. It's a thicker version of their dinner plate size flour tortilla, with a little melted cheese on top. And after your first endevour with this lettuce pork tortilla strip and pico de gallo masterpiece, when you reach the "shell" after the salad is all gone... Whoa! You'll wish you hadn't waited so long. Paired with the Creamy Tomatillo dressing and their Hot Salsa Fresca, you'll never think about ordering another taco salad elsewhere ever again.

Kudos to Cafè Rio for keeping it real... Real fresh!!
