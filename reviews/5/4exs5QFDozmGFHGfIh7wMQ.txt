Gave this 5 stars, but it's NOT fancy or upscale at all, just so you know that. What it is: Excellent food (see the other reviews), service (very pleasant & attentive, desire to please), & an excellent Value! 

I had chicken taco's and my gal's beef (marinated) taco's were even better. (Soft tortilla's were hand made (they said) as ist all the food. Rice and beans were good (which for me means not fancied up or spicy). The Salsa was amazing!!! I always said you could make millions if you could get the roasted tomatoes and chili flavors w/o the burn/pain (I'm sure you can ask for the hot stuff if desired). Well they did it.   Margaritas were excellent (unfrozen w/ salt) Owners were most gracious named ,"Beth and Bill" (not the radio personalities). 

Very relaxed atmosphere (jeans are great as goes for all of cave creek) w/ a few small TVs around over on the bar side at least (no sound heard, which I preferred). 

Mariachis (probably just because it was Valentines) were a nice touch for the occasion, ... bit louder then I prefer, but they were very good and had the tact to not come over to our table since we didn't make eye contact. Nice voices and instrumentation to be sure. 

Handi-capped friendly from what I remember. Private parking on the side was pleanty for a fairly busy Sat. night (w/ more out back). Light gravel made for no dust, and wasn't too thick so I'd guess wheel chairs wouldn't be a problem. 

Not sure about reservations as we stopped on a whim, but with immediate seating on Valentines, I'd estimate no problems getting in,..least till the mobs at El Encanto find out about this place. :-) 

Am looking forward to one of their breakfasts.!
(would have probably gone with 4.5 stars if able.)
