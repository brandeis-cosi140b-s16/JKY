I don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time. We walk up here for fabulous - and inexpensive, but not cheap - tacos. They load the tacos so full you have to knife and fork them.

I have always found the ingredients to be fresh. I'm not a huge fan of the chicken seasoning, but the other meats are good for the price point. 

Menu is simple: burritos, quesadillas, tacos, salads, tortas and nachos. Even though the menu states a 3 taco order, you can actually order just one (which I think is plenty). I really like the choice of pinto beans instead of the traditional black.

The guacamole is fresh and the portion is generous - and no extra charge when it's part of a vegetarian item.

The thing I find most unique are the spicy onions that are a topping offering. I love spicy food and these definitely clear the sinuses. 

Finally, I loathe cilantro, and I have a lot of control over the cilantro situation here. The only topping I won't add is the corn, which has a lot of cilantro mixed in. The rest of the toppings are either very light on it or don't have cilantro at all, but you can have it added to your dish to get your fix, if that's what you're into.
