I had 3 of the best tacos of my life here! Island shrimp taco, Al Pastor (with pineapple!), and the tinga taco pretty much blew me away. And you cannot beat the Sunday $5 milagro margarita deal. Great cantina vibe in this joint, plus plenty of screens to watch football on Sundays. And best of all, the salsa was actually spicy!
