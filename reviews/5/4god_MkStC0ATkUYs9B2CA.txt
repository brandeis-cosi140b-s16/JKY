If you looking for a great authentic Russian food this is the place to visit. The service is great and what is unique about this restaurant that it's combines multi cultures and brings the Russian cuisine with meadle eastern style in one place, they also have a great hookah's. We visited green dacha several times and my favorite there is the beefstrogannof. The place is designed very well and have a lot of space which gives a very warm and inviting atmosphere.
