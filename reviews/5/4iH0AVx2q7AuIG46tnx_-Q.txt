I'm not sure why people are giving bad reviews, other than Vitners Grill and Honey Salt, there are no other non casino restaurants, offering designer decor, superior food, custom cocktails.  I enjoyed the outdoor patio when it was Agave and still enjoy it now as Dos Caminos. The grilled fish tacos are amazing, their skinny margarita is a great low cal option, and the cornbread side dish is like dessert. I would recommend for girls night out, dinner date, or even family dinner.
