Found a new hidden treasure this evening!!  I have been searching for a local taco shop that has Carne Asada Burritos that are not only flavorful, but don't squirt oil all over the place when you take a bite out of it.  I have had a difficult time finding a taco shop that is as good as any in San Diego, CA.  I ordered 4 Carne Asada Burritos, 1 Breakfast Ham Burrito, & 3 beef Flautas. My order was prepared very quickly.  You have to give this place a try, the food is good, the place is spotless clean, the girl working the counter is friendly, and the food is fairly priced. Overall, I rate this Mexican Taco Shop my new favorite for the Northwest (Centennial Hills) area. I found this place tucked away behind the 7-11 at the corner of Farm @ Cimarron
