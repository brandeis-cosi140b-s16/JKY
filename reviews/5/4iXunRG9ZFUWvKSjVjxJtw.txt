If you like it hot and spicy this is the place to start your quest.  After hearing tales about the food , I got to try it out for myself on a visit this past week.  I wasn't disappointed nor was the heat from the menu an exaggeration.  Very very tasty.  Be that as it may if you want a meek or mild meal you won't find it.  This is the kind of Mexican food for people who know the real deal and aren't afraid of it.  I loved the atmosphere, colors abound and are delightfully light and cheerful.  I went with two regulars to the place so I'm not sure if that had any effect on the service or not, but even during a busy weekday lunch hour they managed to give us our due attention.  The portion size was generous so that I we each had enough for another meal to go.  Will I be back? oh yes! you bet I will.  It gets my recommendation and a great rating for authentic Mexican food this side of the boarder.  The one and only odd thing I found, was that they don't do separate checks at a table. I have no idea why? but come on folks that's not even a real issue now is it.
