I love these big ol burritos in my mouth!! HAHA.

Well seriously, I've NEVER got a bad Chipotle item. I usually always get either the chicken burrito or the chicken bowl. Today I got my beloved chicken burrito! I got there 11:09 am and was like "oh crap, I'm probably like the first one here!" Boy was I wrong, there were already like 6 ppl in line!! It was my turn and I ordered my chicken burrito. The lady asked what salsa I wanted and I pointed to the hot one and she started putting pico on it!! I was like "No!!" but def not in a mean way, more of a please gosh no way. I totally hate tomatoes. I pretty much scared her. Oppsie!! Anyway, she was super nice to take them out and put some yummy hot salsa on there!! They wrapped up my perfect burrito and I got my chips and guac on the side and paid.

Since I was driving to get my scripts I tore through the burrito on the road, thank God no one was listening to me eat it. They may have thought I was doing something naughty! Which I was!! Desfrutando in my delicious orgasmic burrito!! Ahh Chipotle, me love you long time!
