Coming from san diego we always love finding good tex mex restaurants. We found el veracruz 5 years ago when it was located just up the street from where it is now. This place is great, staff is very friendly, service is very fast and i have never had a bad dish here. Even after 5 years we re still regulars, eating here aboutonce a week. I would recommend el veracruz to anyone looking to get away from chain mexican food establishments.
