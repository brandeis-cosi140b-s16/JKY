This is our go-to Mexican restaurant in the Concord vicinity.

Chips and salsa are great, but if you ask they will bring out different salsas - we've gotten a hotter chipotle salsa and an avocado salsa.

Portions tend to be huge.  I've had their fajitas texanos and their street taco's - both were terrific.

If you like shrimp and spicy HOT, I recommend their camarones ala diabla - shrimp in fiery hot chipotle sauce.  It brings tears to my eyes, but it is soooo good.
