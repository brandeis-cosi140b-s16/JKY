This place is authentic! It has the best cheese crisps and I love that it has 3 kinds of salsa! I mix all of them together=) I took my mom in law there and she LOVED it! Whenever Im on the west side I come here! Its not the ideal place for children sometimes but the staff seems to be friendly. This last time the waitress gave us the wrong plate. My husband was willing to eat it anyways and was embarrassed to say anything. The waitress checked on us a few times and after seeing what my husband pulled out his burrito she instantly realized her mistake. That impressed me. Just a tip for you who like this place...go on citydeals.com they have certificates for 75% off! I think they may be on restaurant.com too
