I LOVE Blue Adobe Grill. The food is great! I can go here when I want delicious New Mexican food but I'm not prepared to pay Richardson's prices. The service is usually pretty good but when it's really busy at lunchtime, the servers seem a bit frazzled. I usually stick to the rellenos or the carne adovada. The salsa is also wonderful. I've made myself hungry just thinking about it...
