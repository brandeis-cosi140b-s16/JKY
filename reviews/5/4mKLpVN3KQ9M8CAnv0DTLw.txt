I don't know why this place only has 4stars... 
Their carne asada tacos are YUMMMY
Their beans must be made with crack, because I can't get enough...
Their hot dogs??? Are insanely good Mexican-style! My nana looooves their Lengua tacos... I'm too scared to try them, but if your adventurous enough...

Their condiment section is full of goodies... There is this creamy avocado sauce that will cool off any really spicy dish. They even give cucumbers which are a healthier chip... And so much more.

Wash it all down with a glass of delicious and not-so-grainy Horchata and you are all set!!
