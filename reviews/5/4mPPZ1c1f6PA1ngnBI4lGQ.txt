I go to this location about 3-4 times a week since I work and gym nearby and every time the staff is nice and the food is fresh! During lunch time the lines are all the way to the door but the staff work fast and efficiently and its never a long wait! 

I always order the same thing and never get sick of it. 

Bowl: 3 scoops brown rice, fajita, chicken, mild/med/corn, sour cream, cheese, and lots of lettuce.
