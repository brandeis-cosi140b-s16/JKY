This place is awesome! Felt like I was at home eating homemade menudo! The staff is very friendly and attentive. The service was great...we ordered the Menudo and Pozole and they both came out super fast! I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas and In need a hangover remedy like menudo! lol
