We just moved from Utah and were looking for a mexican restaurant similar to all the "Betos" style restaurants found there. Tosinos was far better than any of those, and the breakfast burritos (served all day) were excellent. The burritos are plenty big, and one usually fills me up while my wife usually only eats half of one at a sitting. All ingredients were evidently fresh, and the staff was great. I got quesadillas for our boys which they devoured quickly, then saved the contact info in my phone for fast convenient ordering in the future!
