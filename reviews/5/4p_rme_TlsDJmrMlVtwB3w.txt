We just discovered this place and loved it! I had the enchilada deluxe with ground beef and green sauce and my boyfriend had a carne asada burrito. Their food is just great and the staff very friendly. I enjoy coming here once a week, if you go on a Friday they have live music playing. It's very very nice and I recommend it to anyone looking for great Mexican food.
