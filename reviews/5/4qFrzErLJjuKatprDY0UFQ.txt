The food here is awesome. I have had there vegan tacos , carne asada burrito, carne asada nachos ...not in one sitting hehe. There salsa is fresh and spicy . Everything is fresh. Certainly the owners take pride in preparing the food made to order. Everyone is super friendly . I work in the same shopping center and sometimes I cannot get away to get my lunch so they bring it to me :)
