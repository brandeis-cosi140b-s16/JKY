waited in line for my "Adobada Taco" and after eating it I was bummed I didn't get 2 of them! For me it was the clear winner! Unless you don't want it on your taco it comes with onions, cilantro, and an avocado sauce. I asked for the pineapple on my taco and I couldn't ever imagine ordering a taco again without it! My man had the "Asada Taco" and he said for him that was the clear winner. I have renamed the tacos here at Tacos El Gordo. They are now called "Crack Tacos". I'm addicted! I loved it so much I asked if we could go back the next day and I got no complaints! The tacos are only $2.00 each. The food is made fresh right in front of you. I thought it was awesome to see this lady making tortillas right in front of me and knowing that tortilla she was making was going on my plate. You can choose corn or flour tortillas. If you want they offer free grilled scallions and peppers to eat along with your food.

I like this location better then the other one. I don't know what it is about the LV Blvd location but it didn't have the same feel and the tourists might have something to do with that I don't know. There is more seating inside at this location as well.

Parking can be a pain but it is because everyone else knows where the crack tacos are too. If you go with a group then you might want to designate someone to get a table.  I can't say enough about this place! Just eat here already!
