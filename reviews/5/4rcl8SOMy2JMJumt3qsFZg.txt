After trying this at the AZ Taco Festival, we had to try the real deal
This was my favorite at the Taco Festival and after trying the full experience, I am sold!
I love a restaurant that is built to be outdoors. It was nice sitting right by the huge garage doors.  We were outside yet not..
The margaritas are good? The queso fundido was yum! And the chipotle fish tacos... omg...
I seriously took another order of them to go and dug into it when we got home

If you want tequila and a table food of awesome tacos, this is the place
