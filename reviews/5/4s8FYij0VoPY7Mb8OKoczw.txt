Food: I am a regular here. Generally once or twice a week I come and get some grub on my lunch break. I have tried 75% of the menu and there hasn't been one thing I didn't enjoy. Obviously some things are better than others, but here are a few of my favorites Compechana (spelling?) quesedilla, anything with al pastor, and rolled tacos. And I cannot leave out their horchata. It is amazing. They make it in house and Dan (the co-owner/operator) puts crushed pecans on top. Delicious. Their salsa is great. I love the avocado salsa. Every order comes with a side of roasted onions and jalape√±os. 

Atmosphere: Perfect for what it is. A no-frills taco joint. No distractions. Plane Jane. There is indoor and outdoor seating. It can get a little jammed inside as it is a smaller place, but I have never not had a place to sit once my food was prepared. 

Service: Excellent. Dan and everyone that works there are super friendly. He always has a smile on his face and is obviously stoked on the fact that he works in a taco place. (Who wouldn't be?) The food always comes out quickly, but hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp, you order it, they make it. 

One last note, due to the light rail expansion the area roads are a bit difficult to traverse. Don't let that turn you away, it is worth the extra 5-10 minutes of bad traffic.
