Wow! In my previous review I had a lot to complain about, but after the owner messaging me and asking me to come back, I'm glad I did. They got a MUCH better staff (all of them speak English) they were like bam bam bam when it came to filling up drinks and bringing the chips and salsa and the food even tasted better! We got the same thing as last time, and the steak fajita had a lot more meat and less onions. I'll defiantly be back and I'll bring some friends :)
