As soon as I walked in I was reminded of the hole-in-the-wall mom & pop taquerias down in San Diego that I miss so much. Taco Bell this was definitely not...and I was instantly excited to try their food!

I ordered a carnitas burrito, my standard fast food Mexican restaurant order so that I could compare it with carnitas past. The cashier asked if I wanted "everything" on it. Figured she meant carnitas, pico de gallo and guacamole. Nope, she meant everything: carnitas, rice, beans, pico de gallo, a healthy handful of very fresh cilantro. It was stuffed!

Got it to go and when I got back to my office about 15 minutes away, I was happy to find it was still hot when I unwrapped it. But then I realized there hadn't been a salsa bar and I forgot to ask for sauce. :(

The first bite revealed that it didn't need sauce at all! Everything was perfectly spiced and delicious. I don't remember stopping to breathe the entire time I was demolishing it...it was THAT good. (I did manage to pause long enough to photograph it though; photo in the gallery.)

Can't wait to return again this weekend. Heck, who am I kidding? Can't wait to return tomorrow! YUM!
