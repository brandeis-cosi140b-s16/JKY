It's a good thing that Chipotle warms my soul, because they had the A/C set to 60*... But if you're the type that likes that thermostat setting AND burritos/salads/tacos, you my friend have found your home. Stopping for dinner after the gym in damp clothes wasn't the best idea, and cause us to inhale our food so we could escape to warmer pastures. 

This Chipotle is just like the others. They're all nearly identical and produce equal product. That's a good thing. Burrito/Bowl/Taco/Salad - I love them all. But their guacamole, is the opus of avocado. Nothing compares. With their citrus infused tortilla chips. I die. Truly one of my favorite nosh choices around.
