This was the best burrito I have ever eaten! They use rib eye for the carne asada. The meat was very tender and very flavorful. The red chili beef burrito was also very good. The best thing is that they give you the burrito opened on a plate with the meat on it. You get to put in what you want from the salsa and vegetable bar. When I eat a burrito I don't normally eat the tortilla but I ate the whole tortilla. They bring the tortillas in from Mexico . Yum!! And the homemade salsa was awesome.  I will try to get back there the next time I am in Phoenix.
