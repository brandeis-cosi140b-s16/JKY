I'm from Texas, so I have been looking for a decent taco joint up here in Madison. 

Today, I found an acceptable establishment. 

The taco pastor was superbly delicious and well stuffed. 

I've found that different people like their horchata different ways, but for me, this may be my favorite horchata yet! Not very cinnamony, and creamy without being too terribly sweet. 

Taco + horchata + tax left me at a total bill of $5.26, so no complaints there, either.
