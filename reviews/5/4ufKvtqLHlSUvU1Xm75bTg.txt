My second time to el dorado cantina, requested by many of my friends and it was a success! Only drinking last time (the margaritas are amazing!) So I was excited to order some food this time! I had  one of each of the street tacos and was pleasantly surprised by the range of flavors in EACH taco! My favorite item was the chicken street taco, accompanied by  Cilantro rice &  fresh refried beans really brought the dish together. The fact that my tacos arrived in a doubled traditional corn tortilla, & the waiter prepared my guacamole TABLESIDE, gave this new hot spot serious authenticity! Between the quality, freshness, attention to detail in ALL the flavors, & fantastic atmosphere this will absolutely be somewhere I return again & again!
