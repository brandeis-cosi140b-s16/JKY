We have been here a couple of times and really enjoy it. Andrew was our server the other night and he gave us some great recommendations and he was right! The flank steak was fantastic and the girls enjoyed the tacos and of course the drinks were GREAT! The atmosphere was awesome, alot of people having fun enjoying life. If you go here ask for Andrew, he does a really great job!
