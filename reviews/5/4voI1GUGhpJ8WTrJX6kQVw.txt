Two visits.  First, at the bar solo; the mixologist was given ideas on what I like and cut loose to make me something she could concoct - twice . . . and both were awesome anejo-based cocktails!  Oh, and the chorizo tacos were exceptional too!  Second, at a table with my wife - we had Korean and Al Pastor tacos - each an exceptional flavor fest . . . and our margaritas were outstanding, too!  Great place, great atmosphere, great service, friendly . . . make reservations well in advance!
