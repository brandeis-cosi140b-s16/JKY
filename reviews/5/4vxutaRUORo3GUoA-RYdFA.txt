Love this place.  I go there about once a week.  Carne asada fries are amazing and they're plenty big enough for 2 people.  Also good are the fish tacos, anything with carnitas or chile verde.  Way better than Filibertos across the street where all the meat tastes like its been boiled and left under a heat lamp for days.  If you're in the area and want good tasty authentic mexican food, this is the place.

As for some of the poor reviews i see, If you come here looking for ambience or great service, this probably isn't the place for you. It's just tasty food at a decent price.

One last tip: try mixing the diablo salsa with a little of the roasted pepper in oil at the salsa bar-Delicious!
