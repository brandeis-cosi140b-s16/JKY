Stopped to try a new place and was very pleasantly surprised. Had the three taco plate. Fish, Carne asada and green pork. The tacos were huge overflowing the shells. Filled with meat, beans, rice and veggies. Fish was my favorite and grilled not fried which is always good.  Also had a pineapple lemonade which was really tasty. Definitely recommend this joint to my friends and can't wait to bring my kids. They will love the decor.   And realized as leaving that its BYO. Look forward to the weather cooling off and enjoying some tacos and beer on the outdoor patio.
