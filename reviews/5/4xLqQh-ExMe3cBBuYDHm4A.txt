Again, a great experience!!!! We have been coming to Manuel's a few years in a row now. We always sit outside, next to the door to the bar -- live music! - so our girls (4yrs and 8 yrs) can go dancing after dinner. They absolutely love it. And the service was fantastic, as always! Ricardo was our server and he kept the kids entertained, laughing and enjoying the overall experience. A great night and perfect way to spend our last night in AZ!!!!
