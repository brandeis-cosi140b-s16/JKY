First, my credentials, briefly: I'm a native New Jerseyan but travel the nation for work  When I first heard "fish taco" from a co-worker from L.A., I thought, "Disgusting!"  Then on vacation I tried one at the behest of a friend in Pacific Beach (San Diego).  I was changed forever.  But, the bar was set high.

Thankfully, Rubio's is an authentic fish taco maker.  It is a chain, and is similar to Baja Fresh and other "Fresh Mex grills", but with one glaring exception, and that is their fish taco.  The others make fish tacos, but Rubio's has mastered the art.

Having a Rubio's so conveniently located in the food court at the Monte has made one of my more well-liked casinos to become a preferred casino.  The routine is that I go in the back, right to the food court, have a DELICIOUS taco dinner (2 fish and one "street" taco, with some fresh salsas, and a soda to wash it down), and then hit their casino for some great gambling at lower minimums than most of the strip.

But the food is a no-brainer.  Inexpensive, easy, quick (relatively), and ever so delicious, the Rubio's at the Monte Carlo is one that I visit several times on each trip I make to Las Vegas.  So well worth it.
