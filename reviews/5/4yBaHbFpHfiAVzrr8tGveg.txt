This is my favorite place to eat.  Be sure to order the cilantro house dressing and put it on whatever it is you order.  I prefer the pork over the chicken or steak.  If you order the tostada with a soft tortilla you will get the perfect size version of a cafe Rio salad for a much smaller price point.  The regular size salads are huge!  My kids live this place too.
