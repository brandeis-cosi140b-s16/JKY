Don't let the location or appareance inside/outside fool you. The food is authentic and service is superb. The coffee is good and fresh. The coke is served in a glass bottle (so delicious) and the food delivery is fast. Its very small but very efficient. First comes drinks then a basket of chips with two different salsas. Next is the main meal you ordered. The tacos are so damn good, as well as the fajitas. Free refills on coffee and attentive service with great prices! We will eat here again.
