I will begin this review by saying I bought my first condo based on it's close proximity to this particular Monterrey's.  I'm not sure if that's sad or a good move on my part.  The old school Charlotteans will remember this as the former site of the famous (in my heart at least) Rainbow Deli.  Monterrey has done a great job over the last seven or so years making this reborn location a fun hangout with unbeatable service and food that I constantly crave.

It's not often I take my little "Mini-Me" out in the evenings- At the end of the day, I'm not mentally prepared for toddler-sized meltdowns before the food arrives.  Monterrey is always the exception to this rule.  Our plates come out so darn quickly, and in the meantime, there are several waiters to come by and make funny faces at her to pass the time!  Although I haven't lived in the area for several years, they still know me by name and I'm treated like family as soon as I walk in.  I used to think I was just special, but I've heard several people with the same experience.

I've had almost everything on the menu, but the Cheese Steak Burrito is my "Old Faithful."  Their Sangria is pretty remarkable and the margaritas are decent.  The best part:  The Dos Equis drafts are so cold, the ice particles form on the outside of the glass- Delightful.  My absolute favorite is meeting friends on their substantial, covered deck with some cheese dip and cold beers.  I've had birthday parties here, bridal showers, etc. and they are completely hospitable to everything.  

Five stars for great food, even better service, cold beverages, and both kid and adult friendly!!!
