Yes, very very good!  

I recommend the shredded beef burrito.  With a lot of nice melted cheese in it, this burrito is a handful of heaven.  

And if you like carnitas - their carnitas is superb - delicious!  

I also recommend the veggie burrito.  I am not vegetarian, but I like a packed burrito with lots of lettuce, etc!
The veggie burrito is packed and really really good.  You can add ingredients to any burrito for an extra charge. So, theoretically, you can order a veggie burrito and add meat to it...although, this seems to not ever turn out quite right...otherwise the burritos don't have much else in them other than the meat...each burrito comes with one or two additional ingredients depending on which one you order.  
   
...Uniquely flavored rice and red salsa. Not my favorites, but uniquely flavored.  I love their green sauce, though...
