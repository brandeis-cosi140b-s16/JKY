been awhile since I did a review for anything.  it has not, however, been that long since I went here for food(half an hour ago, and several times in the last month). 
If only I lived in this area instead of just watching my parents house, Id be here every 2-3 days.....

This is my go to mexican restaurant.  I have tried all the rest in the 5 mile radius of 32nd ave and peoria.  Bueno burger, rolandos, federicos, filibertos, big burrito, and a couple other small ones like mi peublo and mexican food its all good off of cactus.

With all that said, NONE OF THOSE PLACES CAN TOUCH LA OAXAQUENA! Ive had the al pastor, the chicken and the asada(my favorite),  All were excellent.  They will make you a big burrito like chipotle does if you just ask for those things in the burrito.  They have the best rice and beans in this part of town, IF NOT THE WHOLE CITY.  
The steak is outrageously good, practically addictive. 

Im there so much when I come in they KNOW MY ORDER, they just need to know how many(I'll buy one burrito to eat then and another(or 2) for the next day or so(reheats wonderfully).  They remember repeat customers and take care of them.  I never have any problems, they're always nice and professional.   

I just hope someone reads this wall of text and says, no one would give this much effort for a lackluster establishment....  Try em out, you wont be disappointed.  Go during lunch hours for 5 dollar lunch specials with free chips and salsa.
