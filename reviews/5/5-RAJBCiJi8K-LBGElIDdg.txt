You must be able to make decisions if you go here as there are quite a few options.  Me= fish and huli huli chicken tacos.  He=huli huli chicken bowl. I topped my fish taco off with cabbage, pineapple salsa, sour cream and some grilled veggies. The chicken tacos were made with grilled veggies, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and pineapple salsa. Warning!!  I needed a half dozen napkins during lunch! All tacos were delicious and flavorful. My friend had a loaded huli huli chicken bowl.  He licked the bowl clean.  Having read so much about the coconut bark, we had to get a small box. Great call!  It was sugary, chocolatey, coconut deliciousness!  Cute place. Friendly service (you can get samples of any of the meats).  We will be back on our next trip.  One odd thing-  as we left Braddahs, we noticed a couple dining at an ourside table with their dog.  I had to double-take..... the dog was wearing a diaper! Yes, a full-fledged Huggies!
