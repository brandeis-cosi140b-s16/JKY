The empanadas were delicious! I came here with two people and we all devoured our food. The empanadas were semi-soft, not greasy and excellent. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the tamale - maybe I was used to a different kind because this one came in a banana leaf and the masa was pur√©ed it seems.
