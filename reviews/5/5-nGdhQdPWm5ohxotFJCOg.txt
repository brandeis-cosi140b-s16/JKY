For those of you that read my reviews... first of all, Thank You, second of all, you know that I eat Ultra Low Carb one day a week.  But, today I have guests from out of town, and when that happens, your diet goes out the window.  We were in the shopping center this Baja Grill is in.  And, even though I have tossed my diet out the window, I still looked for a healthy option.  And I had the "Skinny Wahoo F.T.W."  

The food was great... Shrimp, with cabbage and a mango salsa... tasty and the spice was just right.  It wasn't over the top but just enough to make your tongue say hello.  My friends stuck with the fish tacos and they liked them as well.

Just to finish up my review... here are the small things that I like about this place.  Parking is easy - the restaurant isn't in the main part of the strip mall - bright and welcoming when you walk in - clean - and friendly employees that are efficient at their job.  A smile goes a long way with me.

So, for a quick bite at a "Fast Food" place, this place is great.
