I have visited Gallo Blanco probably 20 times. I cannot believe I never reviewed them. 

First, I love the Clarendon Hotel. Everything about it. Colors, Art, Furniture, Pool, Roof- 

The restaurant has provided me with a neat experience each time as well. I am such a fool for those little seafood tacos (halibut is my fav). The guacamole is the bizz.. as are their carne asada burritos.

I have ordered something new each time I have been, but make sure to have my dining partner try something I have been completely satisfied with previously. I usually find myself recommending to them whatever I had last time. 

Gallo Blanco: i am so sorry I neglected you for so long. Please accept my 5 stars? i swear I am not just being nice..
