I went for the first time after reading the competition article in Phoenix New Times about the Chimi debate between them and Tee Pee. Both are equally good don't get me wrong and really it's like comparing apples and oranges. I really enjoyed Carolinas enough to buy a dozen tamales to take home to keep in the freezer to pull out when I need a quick fix.
