Best Street Taco place around.  We've tried just about everything on the menu and all delicious.  We  aren't really fond of the Gordita, {shell was pretty hard}, but everything else has been perfect.  Love the Crazy Potato, makes a nice side with a couple of tacos.  

We have always had good service, but space to wait for food is a little tight if they're busy and the patio is pretty noisy with all the street noise, but you just can't pass up the good tacos for these prices.  Also, love the salsa bar.....always fresh, crisp radishes and cukes.  Order a basket of chips and try the different salsa, etc.
