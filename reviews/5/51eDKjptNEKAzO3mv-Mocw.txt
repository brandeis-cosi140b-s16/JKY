I switch between going to this location and the one at Fort Apache and Trop, but they are equally good and both open 24 hours. My regular order is 3 beef tacos with plenty of green salsa on the side. The salsa is a bit spicy for me yet delicious! Also the horchata here is perfect.... not too sweet, not too watery. I have also fallen in love with the chicken burrito. It sounds like it could be plain but the chicken is shredded and so juicy, and also having tons of onions and peppers leaves me in heaven. Also a fan of a good ol' bean and cheese burrito and beef taquitos.

The prices are very fair too, even though they were raised about a month ago. I believe the beef tacos were $3.05 before and now are $3.35. Not a huge change and I would much rather they raise prices a bit than decrease portion sizes. My only real beef so far is that burrito sizes vary. Sometimes it is very generous, sometimes not, so you never know exactly how much you'll get.

Also a note that Roberto's serves their menudo on the bone. I love menudo but hate eating it off the bone, and once heard some unknowing customer complain to them about how she was eating their menudo and almost chipped her tooth on the bone. She acted like a douche about it, so.... "if you don't know, now you know!"
