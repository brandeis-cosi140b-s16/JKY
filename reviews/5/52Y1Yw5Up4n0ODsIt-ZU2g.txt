We came here on Saturday night with a party of 16.  They were SUPER helpful in seating us quickly and at a nice large table.  We asked off the bat if we could split the bill since everyone had cards and they went above and beyond for us and made everything super easy!  The food was excellent and came out in a very timely manner!  I would highly recommend this place and thank you to all the servers who helped the big rock climbing party on Saturday night!  THANKS!
