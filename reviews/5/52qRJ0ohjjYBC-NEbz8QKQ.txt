I don't get all the negective comments about the food. I think it is some of the most authentic Mexican Food I have had in Las Vegas. The only thing I don't care for is the enchiladas, but we have eaten here several times, it's cheap and it's good. I'm going to have them cater my Super Bowl Party. Yummy
