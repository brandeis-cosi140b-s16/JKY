This place has become our family's favorite Mexican restaurant. Friendly staff, incredible food, atmosphere kinda ghetto... just how it should be. When you walk in the first time, they toss out a sampler of their best meats. And it's not the basics, it's their house specialties. I always get the machaca beef burrito (I add cheese, beans and rice, and get it extra grilled) with a side of sour cream, and it blows my mind every time. My wife gets the bean and cheese burrito and prefers it over Some Burros and Filiberto's. For dessert we recommend the sopapillas. Delicious. Get an ice cold Coca-cola in the bottle to top it off. Overall, especially considering the good prices, this is a fantastic eating experience. Just don't plan on eating the rest of the day! ;P
