I was traveling to Scottsdale for work and stopped here for dinner. Upon entering the new owner personally greeted and seated me, and even brought me my drink. My beef & chicken tacos also came out quick and tasted fantastic. They definitely give you a lot for the price.  It's a shame reading some of the negative reviews as I believe they were directed at the previous owners. Give them a shot if you're looking for good Mexican food in Scottsdale and give them another chance if you had an unpleasant experience with the previous owners. You won't be disappointed.
