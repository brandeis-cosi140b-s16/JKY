You know, this place really sticks out among Mexican restaurants. For one, the food is fresh, and entirely handmade. Second, it is tasty! Their salsas and sauces are fantastically spicy and smoky. 

Not many of their dishes are vegetarian friendly as written, but they made the special point of telling us that they would do as much as possible to accommodate us, and essentially made us entirely new dishes. 

Definitely recommend!
