OH CHUY'S, HOW I WILL MISS THEE!!
Unfortunately for society as a whole, Chuy's didn't pay the rent and they've been closed down.  I tried to go 2 days ago and there's a sign on the door talking about a Landlord's Lien for non-payment of rent.

Oh well, time to head to Two Hippies instead. They do nice Taco's too.

Cheap Eats, Free Chips and Salsa, good $2 margheritas all day and night!  Did I mention cheap? My wife and I can usually eat well and both have a drink or two for less than $20 including a tip during happy hour.

I love this place - This is how a chain should be! Tasty food, feels local even though it's not and a staff that takes care of you without ever being in your face.
My heart has fallen hard for the broiled mesquite fish Tacos, or the chicken tacos. The broiled fish tacos are the best I've had anywhere. I generally stay away from the steak dishes because they aren't as good but I don't hold that against them. It's just that Baja California food is best served as fish or chicken, 'nuff said.
Here's a tip - If you don't like the rice they serve on a combo plate then you can usually substitute in an extra protion of beans or cabbage salad instead to keep it low carb.
