I went here because it was one of the few restaurants within walking distance of my hotel. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The chips and salsa were very good. Fresh chips and the salsa was not too spicy. I ordered a burrito with steak and cheese (I forgot the name of it) and it was EXCEPTIONAL. Probably one of the better burritos that I have had in a long time. Service was friendly and prompt. Anytime I needed anything they were right there.
