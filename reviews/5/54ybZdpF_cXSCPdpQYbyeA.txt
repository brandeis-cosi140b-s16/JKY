Stopped over for lunch while my wife was at the hospital. I had the lunch special with a burrito, chicken taco, rice and beans.  I paid a little extra for the Colorado beef in my burrito.  It was well worth it.  The taco was huge and very good.  The burrito had large chunks of large beef of lean beef that was flavored well. Very authentic and very good.  Highly recommended!
