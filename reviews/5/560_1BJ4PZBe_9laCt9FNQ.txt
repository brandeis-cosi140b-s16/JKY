Well. For a place that I visit at least once a week, what higher compliment can I give than spending hard earned money there? Well I could write a great review! I used to be obsessed with Barbacoa tacos, but recently for diet reasons, switched to Barbacoa Burrito Bowl. Yum. This is the closest thing I will get to fast food. AND....they are organic and don't use companies that practice animal cruelty. All in all, its the perfect lunch/dinner place for healthy food.
