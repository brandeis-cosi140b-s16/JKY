First let me start by saying, I came here about a month after they opened in Maricopa, and it was awful! Every bad review was fairly accurate. I had absolutely no plan to return.
Now, here we are @ 5 months plus later, I live in Maricopa and am hungry. I figured I would try again, order something different and see what happens. The first time I ordered fajitas, so needless to say, I was not expecting much from this experience either. I was prepared for rude/slow service, watery, heavily odd spiced flavored salsa, boxed tasting rice and canned beans accompanying whatever bland tasting, rubbery tortilla having main dish. 
However, what I experienced was a friendly, attentive staff. I was seated immediately, and within minutes fresh chips and slightly better salsa at my table. I ordered seafood chimichangas (have been back several times and between myself and family we have ordered all of the seafood and fajitas). All have been absolutely wonderful, even the accompanying rice and beans were good. Guacamole is very good as well. 
I spoke with a Manager by the name of Miguel. He confirmed he had in fact seen the negative reviews and has listened and tried to correct our complaints. In my honest opinion, he really did.
If like myself you tried this place around the time they opened, had an awful experience as I did, perhaps you may want to try them again. We have very limited restaurant's in Maricopa, so it is nice to have one that is really trying to make us happy!
