We usually get Juan's take out 2-3x's a month. Never disappointed! My favs are the Taco Combo plate with shredded beef. Another favorite is the green corn tamales. I have never gotten a stale chip or not to par salsa from there in my life! Chips are warm when I pick up and the salsa is fresh with the great mix of cilantro and spice. Must be luck. 

I have only dined in 2 times, and the service was great both times, even though it was pretty packed. They even refilled when I was only half full on the drink. 

This place is consistently good!
