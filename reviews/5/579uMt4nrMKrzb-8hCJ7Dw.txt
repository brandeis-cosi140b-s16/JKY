My wife and I are always on the lookout for what I would call great under the radar restaurants, and I had been wanting to try Mariscos El Dorado for quite sometime. I had read some revues and they made it look promising. As it turned out, we were in for a treat.
First, if you are expecting fancy, this is not it. the atmosphere is simple and understated. It is a large clean room with several tables, and a karaoke lounge to one side. Thankfully there was none of that when we went, but instead, they were playing great Mexican music. The service was very good, and prompt, and our waitress was very friendly. They started with tostada shells which we broke up and used as chips. Along with this came two dipping plates. the first was a plate of Swordfish Ceviche, that was absolutely delicious. The second plate was Habenero Pico De Gallo. And I was warned ahead of time that it was HOT. Being raised in the southwest, I have loved spicy food my whole life. Usually when a waitress tells me something is hot, it is nowhere near hot enough. This time I only had two bites and was very satisfied. If you don't like very hot spicy food DO NOT eat this. I however found it delicious. For dinner I had the Camarones A La Diabla. It had a wonderful kick, and went very well with a cold Negro Modelo. My wife (a little more of a tenderfoot) Had the Camarones Al Ajo (Garlic Shrimp). both dishes left us very satisfied, and the portions were large enough that we finished them for lunch the next day. All in all, I would highly recommend this for a fun night out.
