Have you ever thought of the perfect Mexican food paradise? Every time I come here I leave completely satisfied. Even as I park I get excited for what is to come. My hubby works up the street and I envy that he is able to come here for lunch on the regular. We usually get the carne asada fries,tacos, pupusas, or a torta but we are willing to try to rest of the menu and we know we won't be disappointed. It feels like every meal is made with the same homemade love and care as the last.
