Had been here previously (3 years ago) and certainly didn't disappoint.  Had friends that were getting married and looking for a place to eat for our group of 30+ people so I recommended the place.  Not only did they send a shuttle to pick up the wedding party but also seated us right away and gave us all superb service.  Drinks were constantly being refilled without asking and at the end of the night we were all dropped off near our hotels on the strip.  Food was excellent, service was excellent and overall it was a memorable experience!
