As a vegetarian it is hard to find fresh fast food to enjoy.  This place is awesome!  I order the tostada every time and have never been disappointed.  Especially on Wednesday when it is the deal of the day and discounted.   They have a wonderful house ranch dressing that is great on all the items as well.  My husband orders the sweet BBQ in burritos and loves it.  It doesn't cost extra for enchilada style which makes seem like you are in a sit down Mexican restaurant.  I would rather go here than any other Mexican restaurant hands down.  I also love the different drinks that they have there which you can't get anywhere else such as mint limeade and many other tasty drinks.  During lunch if you order ahead it's easy to just come and pick up your meals.  They even have a punch card so after you buy 10 meals you get one free.  I LOVE this place.
