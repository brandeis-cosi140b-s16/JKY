Burrito Bowl..  Mmmmm...

I discovered burrito bowls after always feeling like a bloated whale eating their whole burrito's.  I'm far from complaining because they were so damn good.  But I like to enjoy life after eating Mexican food. 

This location is always busy, but they seem to keep the line moving very quickly.  Also sometimes it's nice cause I'll add an extra item and occasionally they wont charge me.. (thx!). 

The people are nice and always smile.  That's pretty important.  Even if you're having a  bad day it's nice to smile because we definitely return the favor.  (mainly speaking of the girl at the register and the a couple of their line people).

I love this place and usually frequent it at least once a week.

Good food and good people!!
