Just like Sonic I miss this place so much. I have not found a place that can come even close in Boston to the unreal Mexican food "Betos" had 24/7. Nothing beat hitting up Betos after a night of drinking or even hitting it up at 7am for a breakfast burrito. You cannot beat their prices, the breakfast burritos are less than 2 bucks and their bigger and as heavy as a brick. Betos will you and Sonic please move franchises to Boston.
