LOVE LOVE LOVE this food - best tacos/mexican rice/sauces/authentic flavors ever!  That's from a local hispanic chick!  I'm still not through trying everything on their menu because I'm stuck on my favorite every time I go in.

We used to walk our dog there for breakfast burritos almost daily.  One fateful day  I asked for fra-diavlo sauce on my shrimp burrito...YUM!  I can't stop ordering it now; I'm absolutely addicted.  Word of warning though, that sauce will clear your sinuses, for sure!  

Great prices, and they're pretty fast, too!
