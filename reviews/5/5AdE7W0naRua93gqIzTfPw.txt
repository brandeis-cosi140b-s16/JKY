Great food and great service! We had the chicken and the steak fajitas and they were delicious! Big portions! Yummy guacamole made fresh at your table...I ordered a regular margarita and was HUGE...it was literally 3 drinks in one! I could not finish it. (The margarita was $10). My only negative was that they didn't list the prices of the alcoholic beverages. It's ambiance was festive and their booths and bar chairs are made from hand carved wood from Mexico. We did not order dessert (too stuffed!) but the menu had 8 choices and they all looked amazing. The server brought us a cinnamon fried tortilla with whipped cream and raspberry sauce and it was awesome!
