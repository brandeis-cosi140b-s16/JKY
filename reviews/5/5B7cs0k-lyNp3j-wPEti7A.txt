We were in the mood for Korean and decided on Komex solely based upon its wonderful Yelp reviews. And let me tell you, it was just as good as its awesome Yelp reviews. Nice & accurate work Yelpers!

I had the seasoned french fries (only $1!) and shrimp quesadillas which were loaded with shrimp. We will definately be back!
