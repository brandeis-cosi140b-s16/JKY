My family and I heard so any great reviews about this place thy we just had to try it out yesterday! It was everything we heard and more. I know authentic Mexican food and let me tell you they live up to that and more. Amazing customer service and atmosphere. We will definitely attend regularly and recommend to everyone. Don't knock it till you try it!! ;) Also do the amount of food you get the prices are great! Don't forget to try a cocktail, my personal favorite Modelo Especial Michelada!!!
