I've been waiting for a place like this. It only existed in my dreams until now. 
Picture this. Filiberto style mixed with chipotle as the lay out. That's the first impression when you walk in along with the paintings of the Mexican wrestlers. 
The menu is simple like chipotle but similar ingredients as the normal fast food burrito places

All of that goes away when you try the food. I had the surf and turf burrito with pico and spicy guacamole. This burrito had huge shrimp and carne asada meat. 
The cook/owner allows you to customize your burrito with various ingredients and also asks you how you want them cooked. 

The 5 stars was easy for me and I plan on going back tomorrow.
