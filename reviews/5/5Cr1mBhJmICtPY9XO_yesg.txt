omg amazing place! definately try a green-sauce enchilada with cheese, the rice and beans are amazing and salsa reminds me of the authentic places in San Diego...tiny hole in the wall though, so keep an eye out for it...if you exit the 1-10 at 32nd, head south about two blocks, make a left (east) on broadway, its right after 36th street in an industrial area....if you see Napa Auto parts across the way, you found it! :-) they will literally make you ANYTHING you want (within reasonable terms of course!) and they have a good kids menu for the little ones
