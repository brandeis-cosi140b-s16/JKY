Pros: This place is all about the food and it is GOOD food! I love Korean food packaged in Mexican goodness so this place hits the spot on a budget! I got their bulgogi bowl and their 3 tacos... YUM. In Vegas, this is probably the best food for it's price! The selection is pretty good and you can't go wrong with their food. The staff is very nice and attend to your needs.

Cons: It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place so it is smaller with little emphasis on decor. The parking lot is also on the smaller side but totally worth the trouble for the food.

Overall: Yes, yes, and yes! I'm all about quantity and quality with food and this place hits the spot! Highly recommended for delicious food for a good price!
