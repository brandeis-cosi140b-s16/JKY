If you're anywhere close to a Zaba's, don't even think about going to Chipotle ever again.  First off, the menu is much larger than Chipotle, but with the same build-you-own style meals.  The burritos here are magical and are not overloaded with rice and beans like at Chipotle - all of the meats that I've tried are amazing, but the carnitas definitely shines above the rest.  My favorite menu item, however, are the nachos - the queso sauce is AMAZING, and well worth the clogging of my arteries.  My only complaint is that the salsas are not the best, but it's a small price to pay when everything else is so good.
