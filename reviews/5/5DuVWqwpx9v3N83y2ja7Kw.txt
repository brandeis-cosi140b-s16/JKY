First of all, thank you for the amazing service! Falyn was as friendly, helpful and proactive as she is a great bartender. 
The food was stellar. The guacamole was fresh and delicious. I had the chicken burrito with a side of beans which were delicious. I paired the burrito with their spicy aioli. My friend had the spinach and mushroom scramble which looked AMAZING, and I'm going to try it next time for sure. They serve breakfast all day which is a huge plus ++++ Also the menu is enormous so there is definitely something for everyone.
The ambience is great, and very clean looking. The restaurant itself is situated in the Clarendon Hotel and they will serve you drinks by the hotel pool which is awesome.
Overall I am very satisfied with Cafe Tranquilo and will be back!
