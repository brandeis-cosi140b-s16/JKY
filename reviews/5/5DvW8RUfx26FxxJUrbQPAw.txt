Growing up in Hawaii leaves you EXTREMELY limited to mexican food, and so I grew up not liking mexican food. I don't like the beans, am not a fan of the rice and pretty much considered Taco Bell good mexican food. But oh my god, the food here is seriously making me reconsider mexican food. It's a complete hole in the wall place you would never think twice to stop by, but you should make it a point to. The serivce is awesome, the guys there are really nice and they don't skimp on the servings. Love, love, love the food here!
