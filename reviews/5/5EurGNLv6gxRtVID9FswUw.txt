I love this location! They have a friendly staff and good food. I usually order take out and they always hook me up with lots of chips and salsa (it is free with every order) I never have to wait long. All of the employees seem to enjoy working there, they are all really nice. I have never had a bad meal here. They have great happy hour specials.
