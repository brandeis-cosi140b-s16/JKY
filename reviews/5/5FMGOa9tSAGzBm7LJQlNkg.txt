I recently moved here from LA, so my mexican food standards are pretty high.  So far this is my favorite place in Charlotte, I come here every 1 or 2 months. The food is great and the prices are great.  Their salsas are fantastic, traditional mexican salsas  as good as any in LA, warning they are a little hot on the hot side, my husband loves them,  I always asked for mild and that is about the most heat I can handle. My only complaint is that their margaritas are weak, they need to work on them.
