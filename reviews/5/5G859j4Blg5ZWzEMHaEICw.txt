This is the best Chipotle in town.  The staff is always very friendly.  They give you the proper portions!!  When you order extra meat it's nice to actually get what you pay for!  And the restaurant is nice and clean.

If you work or live by the airport, this is an excellent option for lunch or dinner.  Highly recommended.
