I am not a mexican food fan, it seems like everything tastes the same at most palaces. Not at Casa De Mina... this place is the best! You can tell everything is home made. The ingredients were fresh and top notch. Well run, very clean, everything we ate was outstanding. I had the seafood enchiladas. They were fabulous. The shrimp (and there were plenty in there) were fresh, and flavorful. I would give it 6 stars if that rating was available.
