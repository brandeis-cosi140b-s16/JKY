I had been to Vida located at the Epicentre so the wife and I tried to grab a bite at Vida Vida, the more casual side.  Vida Vida has frozen margaritas and a more casual atmosphere.  

You seat yourself and even order yourself via a pad in the middle of the table (at least this way I know my order is right).  

We started with chips/salsa/queso.  These were the same good chips they use at Vida and a good quick entr√©e

My wife and I both had tacos....her chicken, me ground beef which I like since I don't think Vida has them on the other side of the wall.

There are more TV's than VIDA (we watched the Stanley cup finals) and it's a little louder, less restaurant, more fun spot

we'll be back
