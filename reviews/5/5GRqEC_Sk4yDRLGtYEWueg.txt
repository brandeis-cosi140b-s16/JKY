This is one of my three local places I eat on a regular basis. There is nothing bad about this place. The drinks, the service, the food is all far superior to any other Mexican food in town.

Try the Tacos, especially the chorizo or lengua. The Tortas are amazing and filling. Their Tamales are great. Eat the chips as they are fresh made and ask for the fresh sauces they put out.
