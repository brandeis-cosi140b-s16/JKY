After church on Sunday, my wife brought me to Zamora's, saying that she really liked it. After I left, I was also a huge fan.

The chips and salsa are some of the best I've ever had. The salsa had a decent amount of heat, but not too much. The chips were also done to perfection. We both had tacos, containing really great shredded beef. The tostadas and enchiladas are pretty tasty, as well.

They have lunch specials 7 days a week, and I believe I saw dinner specials as well.

Talking to one of the employees on the way out, it sounds like their business has dropped off because of all the business closures in that area. Folks, do not let this place go away...it is a hidden treasure.
