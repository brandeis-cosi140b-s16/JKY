My g-chat status has been set to "Los Taquitos FTW!" for about three weeks now. No, not because I am too lazy to change it, because I pretty much eat Los Taquitos every single day. 

If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.

I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was true love.

Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.

But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.

The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!
