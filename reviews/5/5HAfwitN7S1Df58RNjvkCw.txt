Went with a few friends and I've got to say, $1 Taco Tuesday's was amazing! Being my first time at Sabor, the line to the door make me a little impatient, but once I got my tacos...it was worth it! I ordered one beef and one shredded chicken, and they were amazing! Can't wait to go again! If you see a line when you go, stick with it because you won't regret it!
