Yum yum! This place looks like a hole in the wall, has barred windows and Spanish speaking only staff and also has excelente food! I got a small mixed ceviche - fish, shrimp and octopus and it was delectable. Two $3 cervezas later I had a beef taco (tiny but good) and a pork tamale (decent, yes!). This place gets a thumbs up from me. So many yummy Mexican seafood options. :p
