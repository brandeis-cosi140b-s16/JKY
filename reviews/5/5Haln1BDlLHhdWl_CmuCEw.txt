Their tacos are great!  I had the fish, al pastor and the gringos tacos.  They were all excellent.  I will have to try the others on the menu next time.  The service was excellent and the decor inviting.  It is a little bit on the pricey side, but it makes up for the quality of the food.  I will be back when I am craving for a good Mexican food when I am in Vegas.
