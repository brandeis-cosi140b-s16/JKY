The food tastes great & very authentic! I had the Huevos a la Mexicana. Perfect portion size. Free chips and salsa, and their salsa is the best I've had in a Mexican restaurant in a long time. Clean, small but great decor and "home-y" feel to it. Feel like I'm at my nana's restaurant, if she had ever had one, or like my nana's tio's cousin's daughter's in-laws place. So, my cousin's place :) I'm coming back with friends.
