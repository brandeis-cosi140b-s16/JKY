I love chipotle and am so happy they placed one close to my house. I eat here on the average of 8 meals a weeks between lunch and dinner. It is always fast and friendly. 

The staff knows me personally and always makes me feel welcomed. It can be chilly inside bit I bring a jacket or eat outside and it is perfect! No complaints here
