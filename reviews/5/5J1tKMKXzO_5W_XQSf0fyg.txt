This was the first place I ever tried based solely on a Yelp review and it was great!

After reading my friend Ryan D.'s excellent collection of Yelp reviews, I wrote down the addresses of his recommended restaurants.  At the top of the list was La Takiza, a place Ryan credits with the best tacos in Las Vegas.

Clearly, Ryan is a guy that knows great tacos!

I had a carnitas Super Taco and it rocked!  The taco was absolutely stuffed with a generous helping of perfectly cooked carnitas and fresh tasting toppings.  

The service was fast, pleasant, and the price was right.  Even with a Super taco and a soft drink, you still get change back from a five.

If there's anything I like better than great tasting food, it's great tasting food at affordable prices.  In other words, a bargain.  And while La Takiza might not be the least expensive place around, what you get is a great value.  

Damn good food, prepared fresh and fast, at a reasonable price.
