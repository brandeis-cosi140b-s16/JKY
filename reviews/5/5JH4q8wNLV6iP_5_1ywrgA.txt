Excellent!

I had the cochinita pibil, a 12 hour roasted pork dish.  The pork was juicy and awesome.  I don't even really like pork that much but this dish really stood out on the menu.

I'm from LA so I'm used to decent Mexican food.  But I moved up to Seattle last year where there is absolutely no good Mexican food.  So as soon as I came down to Phoenix, I rented a car at the airport and drove straight here.

The neighborhood is a little dodgy but not too bad.  There is a small parking lot in the back.  The murals in the parking lot are a little scary looking and the painting inside the restaurant are a bit scary as well but the food was great.

They had live music playing loudly.  It made for a nice and festive atmosphere.

They open until 10:30pm on Fridays and I got there at around 9:45pm.  We ordered and finished eating at around 10:30.  There were only 2 other tables around when we left.

In addition to the pork, the tacos de carne asada were great and the enchilada de mar was also very good.

The table guacamole is a bit gimmicky but was good nonetheless.  They put pomegranate in guac which isn't typical but tasty.

The margaritas were good.  We had the lowrider margarita and it was good with a lot of tequila!
