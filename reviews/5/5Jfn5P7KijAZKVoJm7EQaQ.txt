This place changes the notion of a "burger joint". I've been to PVBC many times. I try to make it there at least once a week. Their burgers, sweet potato tots, and chicken club on 9 grain keep bringing me back. The food is well presented, well put together, and the flavor combinations are incredible. 

Yesterday, however, I decided I was going to try something new and went for the weekly facebook special, the Texas BBQ Burger. Double chargrilled patties marinated in homemade BBQ sauce, roasted poblano, creamy slaw, smoked bacon, and freshly shaven smoked mozzarella. As I took the first bite, it happened: all other experiences I've had with burgers in my life faded to the distant background, and PVBC cemented itself as my definition of the PERFECT burger, flawless in taste, presentation, and overall execution. 

And from now on, all burgers I will have anywhere else will only be cheap imitations of the products of divine work being done in this modest, unassuming kitchen. Part of me is just thinking of never eating another burger outside of PVBC.

OH YEAH. IT'S THAT F-ING GOOD. Do yourself a favor. Stop in. Order the brulee, the pulled pork, or my go-to, the chicken club. It wil change you, and then you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.
