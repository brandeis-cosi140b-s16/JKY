Visiting Phoenix from the East Coast, I wanted to savor some authentic West Coast fish tacos.  When I asked where I could find the best, I was pointed to Rubio's. Wow!  I knew with my first bite that I had found heaven!  I had the Original and my hubby had the Especial.  Both were very yummy!  If you're looking for great fish tacos, look no further than Rubio's. 

The service was great, the restaurant was clean, parking was easily accessible, and the prices were very reasonable. Can't ask for anything more!
