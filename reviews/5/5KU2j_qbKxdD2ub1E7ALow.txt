Awesome food, great price and great service! We went on a Friday night and it was just us and another family in the restaurant.  The flavors and feel reminded me of my favorite place in Puerto Vallarta. Authentic flavors and service. The owner/chef waited on us personally, and was very attentive. Salsa is a bit spicy but very good. Ask for some guacamole, it's not on the menu, but he'll make it fresh for you. And the green sauce is to die for! I had the marinated pork chimichanga ( also not on the menu) and my boyfriend had the carne asada. Both were wonderful. Even the rice and beans were good! We will definitely be back. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!
