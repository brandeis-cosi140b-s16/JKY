Going in, my initial impression was, hmmm nice and artsy, bet the food will be tiny portions and the price very ridiculous. Was.I.Wrong.
True Gallo Blanco (literally, "white rooster" I guess?) Looked upscale, hip, with walls decorated with artwork, modernistic furniture and lighting to set the overall mood and atmosphere. But after having gone to many cheesy hole in the wall "authentic' barrio-type Mexican restaurants which by the way I do love, the Mexican fare at this place was near perfect. Posole-definitely my favorite. The tacos I ordered were cochinita (pork), fish, and the de rigueur carne asada-good as well. 
We enjoyed people watching too. This was right next to the Clarendon Hotel where we happened to be staying at. My teenage daughter did notice the GLB crowd for both the hotel and the restaurant but we were so cool with that. 
The best thing and the biggest surprise was--- the perfectly reasonable prices for the food! The large bowl of posole was something like 8.00. One cochinita taco was somewhere around 2.60(?), for example.
They also have a good alcoholic beverage list, as well as nonalcoholic ones such as free as, Mexican hot chocolate, sodas, etc. 
All in all a great place to go on a date, a business meeting, or just need to unwind and enjoy the artsy ambiance.
