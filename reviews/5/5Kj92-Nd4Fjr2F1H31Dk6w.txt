I've been going to the old location since I was young and the food has never let me down! Went to the new location tonight and was so impressed!! Clean, bright, contemporary! I loved seeing the old faces in a new, bright place. They have the same food and the same love goes into that food. Recommend their combos to try a bunch of stuff at once, but also really love their chimichanga, fajitas and enchiladas. Old school Mexican - fatty, full plates!
