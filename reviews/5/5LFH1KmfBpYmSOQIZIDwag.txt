This is a great Taco Bell.  The food always comes out great and the order is never wrong.  

The shells are always crispy (this isn't the case with all Taco Bells, believe me) and the items are prepared well.

Gotta love the new Diablo sauce too.

Always friendly polite kids working the drive thru as well.

Whoever is in charge of this location deserves a pat on the back.

This is walking distance from my house so I'm very happy that a competently run Taco Bell is near my house when I get the inevitable craving.
