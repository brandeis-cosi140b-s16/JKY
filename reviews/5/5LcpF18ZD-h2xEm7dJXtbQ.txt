Best Shrimp Cocktail on this side of town. I've been to a couple different mexican spots on this side of town and always come out dissapointed don't really like to have robertos either unless I absoulety want mexican food quick or I'll cook it myself lol but my brother told me about this one and said i'd like it since im very picky when it comes to mexican food, guess he was right taste a lot better than other robertos
