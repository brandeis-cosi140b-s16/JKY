We stop here and get our order to go on the way back home. The guys are very attentive and helpful to help us 'pack' our order in separate containers so it doesn't get soggy on the hour drive home. Only once, this past time, was the staff rude and snippy to us, and still didn't get our order correct. Their barbacoa is amazing! I won't let one bad experience ruin the dozen of good things we have to say about this place. It is always clean, and am always greeted upon walking in the door.
