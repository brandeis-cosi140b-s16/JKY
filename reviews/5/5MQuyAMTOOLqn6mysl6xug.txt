The food here is excellent and the service was just as good. As of right now, locals get 50% off their entire bill on Mondays. Even without the discount, they're reasonably priced. $12 for my plate of 3 tacos, with rice and beans. 

The only awkward thing is, it's pretty much connected to the Sapphire strip club. I won't ever go back into Sapphire (see my review about them), but I will absolutely come back to El Dorado. The inside is nothing like the club next door - it's clean, modern and welcoming.

I would recommend this place to anyone who like good food. They have a good selection of food on their menu and it all tasted very fresh. The chips and salsa were great too.
