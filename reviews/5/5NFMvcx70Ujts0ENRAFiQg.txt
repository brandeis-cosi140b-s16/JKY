I literally work 2 minutes from here. Working graveyard it hard to find 24 hour quality food. Mostly because I'm vegan. They have gluten free and vegan dishes. The veggie tacos are bomb. The first time I called for pick up I got through but 3 times after I can't get through on the phone so I just drove and took it to go. Very nice abeyance. Clean bathrooms. The staff that comes on in the morning always seems to be in a bit of a trance. The hostess never seem to happy to be there and she always seems to be the one answering the calls... You can't beat the quality of the food. Yummy
