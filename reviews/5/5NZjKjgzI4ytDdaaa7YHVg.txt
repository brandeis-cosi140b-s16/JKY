I love the bean and cheese burritos here (I add corn and pico inside), it's around $4. The majority of their food runs around $7-8. Their tortillas here are just so good, they are seriously to die for.  If they sold their tortillas by the bulk I'd buy them. I personally don't really like the meat burritos, the plain bean and cheese is definitely the best (that's the only thing my entire family gets). My mom enjoys their fish tacos though. I used to come one to two times a week, but unfortunately I don't live close to here anymore and have to take special trips just to grab one of their burritos. You should open a location in Scottsdale!
