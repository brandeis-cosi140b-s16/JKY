This place is a homerun!! My lady is from El Paso and the time I spent there (5yrs) was awesome! The people are friendly,  the city is safe, and the food is ridiculous! Chicos Tacos comes to mind when El Paso and food are mentioned. It is said to be one of if not the stop to make when in EP. I am one of this who loves Chicos Tacos so when I was told about this place it was a must try. I went and ordered two singles,  some fries, and an elote en vaso. Let's start off with the elotes, it was a little disappointing to be honest it was nothing like the elotes I've had in EP, it has mayonnaise which is totally different from what I've had and its not that appetizing, its also made with yellow corn. EP elotes has white corn, butter, Chile, and  cheese so I had high expectations and was let down in the elotes department. Although if you want some street corn this is more along that flavor profile and in that sence it is good, just not elotes good. Now on to the tacos, they were........GREAT! I mean you can tell that its not chicos but it is darn close, the spicy tomatoe sauce with the rolled tacos and some green chile sauce is amazing and will hold you over till you get back to EP for some chicos! They are piping hot and will crunch as you eat them and then have a great bite when soaked in the sauce! The fries are great and with ketchup and dipping them into the spicy tomatoe sauce really brings back memories of eating at Chicos. This place is called juarez-el paso border food, so in my opinion if your not from that area or have been there you will not understand the food as it can't be compared to anything else really. If your in the mood for some Mexican food and want something different I say definitely give this place a go next time!
