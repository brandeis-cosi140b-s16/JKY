I've never been to a place with a friendlier staff! Everyone was attentive, kind and happy! They brought games to our table while we waited for our food...I mean, how cool?!? My kids played connect four while my wife and I played jenga. The salsa is ridiculously good. The food was on point!  A must eat! The GM, Renee, was extremely kind and her team is behind her 100%, so please go pay them a visit and try the Avocado Salsa. Enjoy.
