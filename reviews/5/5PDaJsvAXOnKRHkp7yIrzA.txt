My new favorite Mexican spot. When I pulled up, I almost thought I was at the wrong place. It's in a strip mall and you feel like you are about to walk into a take out taco shop but when you open the door it's really quite a surprise. Very nice atmosphere, service was great, food was excellent. We were a party of six and not one of us had a bad thing to say. Can't wait to go back! Ask to be seated in Luis's section and you will not be disappointed.
