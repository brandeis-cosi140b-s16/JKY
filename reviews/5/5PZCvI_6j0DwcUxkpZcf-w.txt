It was around 1am, after exploring the dives along the South side of Old Town and many cervesas later, we were strolling along and the smell of food came to my senses and low and behold to my left was the Super Burrito!  I had flashbacks from college to a joint called Burritos As Big As Your Head and I had to give it a try!  We walked in the door and, how appropriate, there was a guy stoned out of his brains waiting to dive into some late-night Mexican grub Hahah!  

It also was very apparent to me because I am a bit of 'clean freak', that the place was very sterile...stainless steel counter tops, open view to the kitchen, clean tile floors...few 24hour places ever look that clean (I have only been here once but I hope it is always like that-extra kudos).  So I walk to the counter and the friendly gentleman asked me what I was hungry for and I had no idea!  So he gave me a brief tour of the menu and I opted for the Super Nachos to share with mi Amigo!  It came covered in lots of yummy carne asada and they added lots of pico de gallo for me, and then we topped it with various fresh salsa from the salsa bar.  And because the street tacos, our stoner neighbor was chowing down on, looked sssooooooo good I had to try two of them too!  FYI the carne asada is better than the carnitas.  We did not go home hungry that early Saturday 'morning'!  

As you would expect at such a place, the prices are very reasonable, but what sets this place apart for me was the cleanliness and great service...oh yeah and the food is good, but what isn't at the wee hours of the morning  :)
