Why would anyone ever go to Taco Bell, when there is a Los Tacos!!!  

I have been to a lot of taco restaurants with big names and expensively priced dishes.  Los Tacos may look like a fast food restaurant, but it is better than most of the pricey americanized Mexican restaurants in town.  

In one word: Authentic

Restaurant is clean, nice looking, the outside grounds are very nice and well kept.  The servers are very nice.  The drive through works great.  Everything hand made, per order and real, fresh ingredients.

Salsa's are fabulous, so many kinds.  Veggie Tacos A+.  Chips & Salsa A+

Mmmmmmm!
