Authentic and freshly made Tortas Ahogadas! Hole in the wall joint. Found by hunger. Crunchy bread full of pork juicy  carnitas topped with a flavoring delicious tomato base spicy sauce. I ATE 2!!!
The habanero sauce is killer spicy! Great service, reasonable price and very friendly staff. I recommend it. I noticed they also sell tacos and Birria. 
 The tortas ahogadas are like a Mexican steak Philly sandwhich But with a spicy kick!
