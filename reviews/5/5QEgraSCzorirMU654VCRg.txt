A friend of mine suggested we meet at Jim's Burros and have one of their Chile Rellenos (a la carte).  He told me they are some of the best he has eaten, and now I too am a fan of Jim's.  We arrived at 12:30 on a weekday, we were promptly greeted as we came in, and our server took our drink orders right away.  In moments, the drinks arrived along with a basket of chips and a bowl of salsa.  Service was extraordinary during our visit.  I would rate the chips and salsa as a 9 out of 10 - very tasty and on the hot side for the fresh salsa (red).  We placed our orders and the food arrived in about 15 minutes, fresh and hot.  The Chile Rellenos were excellent.  Much different than New Mexican style, but definitely excellent.  Unless you have a very large stomach, just order the Relleno a la carte.  It came with a giant flour tortilla with butter, too.  Prices are very reasonable.  I will definitely be back soon!  The only suggestion I would make it to pave the parking lot (I ride a motorcycle).
