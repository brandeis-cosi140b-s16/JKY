I've been here for the past 7 years of my life at least once a week. I never learned how much I should appreciate this food until they closed for a few months. I've had everything in the menu from A-Z. Some items were better than others of course, but they all satisfied my expectations. Let it also be known that I have high standards when it comes to food.
