Absolutely amazing! The complimentary chips and salsa is the best I've ever gotten at a Mexican restaurant before. The chips are very thick and the salsa chunky. I've had the tacos asados, highly recommend! I've also had the regular chicken quesadilla which was also amazing. It's rather inexpensive as well so that's a plus. Check it out! Very friendly staff as well!
