I've been going to Julio's since I was born. It's a family favorite. When Julio G's closed, I literally cried but Julio Too's keeps my cravings in line. The salsa is perfection. Hands down my favorite. The enchilada sauce I could drink. The mini chimis are addicting. I personally love their appetizer platter that has a little bit of everything because I can never decide on just one thing. The service is so genuine and kind. It's all around one of the best Mexican food restaurants in Scottsdale.
