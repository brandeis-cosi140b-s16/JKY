I'm so happy they have an El Pollo Loco nearby!! I've been saying for YEARS that they should open one in the southwest area! I love coming here because it's my healthy alternative. It's so easy to eat unhealthy around here because there's too many fast foods! By the end of the day, I just want to pick up food quickly and go home. El Pollo Loco offers that for me. Looks like they're brining the big cups back for salsa because they had these little dinky cups that only fit one bite. I guess I go at off times because it's not as busy as the other El Pollo Loco's can get. Going there tonight!! Can't wait :)
