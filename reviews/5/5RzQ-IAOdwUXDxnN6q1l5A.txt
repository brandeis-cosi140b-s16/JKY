Let me give you some background: It was two years ago in May. I was still eating meat. I got the same thing every time at Taco Bell: Chicken quesadilla, extra quesadilla sauce on the side, and fire sauce. I use an entire packet of fire sauce with every single bite. That's honestly the only reason I come to Taco Bell: for the sauces. The sauces are supreme considering they come in little packets. 

This Taco Bell experience is embedded into my brain and will never leave it. I just ate Taco Bell where I live in Michigan and it reminded me of this night in Charlotte, NC. I had to come on Yelp and finally give my first Yelp review. 

Five stars is a lot, but let me tell you, this late night Taco Bell stop was a pleasure for me and my pals who were paling around starting only hours before. We attempted to sing karaoke but this one guy kept doing The Killer's songs over and over again, which was fun, but this caused us to not have a single chance at going up to sing. The bar closed, we decided to leave, and my friend got in the driver's seat and I demanded with all my might to go to Taco Bell. On the way we listened to Taylor Swift's "22" on repeat and sang so much my friend lost her voice. I had to pee like a race horse. 

We finally get to Taco Bell, placed our order, and drove up to the window. "Would you like any sauce with your meals tonight?"

My eyes grew big. My heart grew strong. My mind raced -- I heard it -- my calling -- "sauce." 

"ALL THE FIRE SAUCE, please." I demanded from the passenger seat. 

The man working there gave me an entire Taco Bell bag full of fire sauce. I will never forget this night, or that man, who I called an angel a number of times. I think of him time to time, wonder what he's doing, what other people he is doing good for. It was truly a blessed experience at a Taco Bell. 

*drinks fire sauce packet* I will never forget it.
