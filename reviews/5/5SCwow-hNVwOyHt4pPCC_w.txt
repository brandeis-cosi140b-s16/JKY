I love this casual, neighborhood restaurant that serves authentic Latin street food. Order at the counter, pick out a bottle of your favorite local brew (I recommend NoDa's Hop Drop N Roll), and make sure you check in for free chips with an entree. 
Everything here is quick and delicious! Even the chips are made in house, as is the plentiful, fresh salsa bar. They have daily specials, including $0.99 authentic tacos from 3-5, Monday through Friday.
