We have not been disappointed with the food or service. We usually go here on Sundays because kids eat free with a paid adult. They have a huge selection of food. My favorite is actually the taco salad.  It comes on its own fried taco shell bowl. My kids get the mac and cheese or chicken strips and they are all good. I was a little skeptical about a chain restaurant. Their salsa is hot and margaritas are cold. Try it out!
