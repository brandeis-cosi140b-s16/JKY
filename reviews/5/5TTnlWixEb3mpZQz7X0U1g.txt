We've eaten here twice and both times we were absolutely delighted! The wait staff was excellent and the food was fantastic! I have only tried the burritos and these are HUGE! One burrito fills up the plate for just $9.95. The first time I tried the house special burrito with large chunks of juicy steak along with spicy jalapenos and onions with a zesty sauce. The second time I tried the carnitas burrito. It was AWESOME! 

I recommend that you order sour cream as a side for your burrito and bear in mind that this is the traditional Mexican "crema" and not the kind of sour cream you and I get at the store. I have to say that the food was delicious both times and that the service was impeccable both times. My favorite so far is the carnitas burrito with green sauce. It is the traditional slow roasted pork with jalapenos, onions and other peppers. It is spicy! Try it! You'll thank me later.
