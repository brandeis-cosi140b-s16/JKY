If your looking for some fancy smancy  trendy Mexican bistro then stop reading, 
this place is not for you!

No fancy table and chairs here, and the murals are borderline tacky. But the food, the food is comforting and delishisly satisfying!
  So good, I've been coming here regularly for the past 25 years. I hate to sound like a broken record, but everything on the menu is good! 
If you have children, the mini bean and cheese burritos are the perfect size, just ask for no sauce as it might be too spicy for the young ones.
 My favorite is a red beef burro with beans, and a large order of strips with extra cheese. put some hot sauce on each strip one at a time while you eat them and you'll be in heaven.
Whats the price like, you ask? I know of no other place, where you can feed a family of four for under $20!!!! and leave completely satisfied!
