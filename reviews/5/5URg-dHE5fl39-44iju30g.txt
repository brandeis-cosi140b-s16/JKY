Food is excellent and a great value. The unassuming taco stand (off freeway Downtown) delivers the goods. The horchata is a little too sweet for me, but still drinkable. Service is speedy and you'll see a lot of customers hanging out. The neighborhood looks sketchy, but there are two police command stations within a half mile which keeps the order. The homeless along the boulevard do not disrupt the business.  Also, the taco stand is right off of the Cultural Corridor by the Cashman Center which means that you are close to everything (e.g. freeway, downtown, the Strip, Fremont Experience and North Las Vegas casinos).  I only wish they had somewhere to sit momentarily.
