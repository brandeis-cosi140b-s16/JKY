I just discovered this little hidden gem about two weeks ago and it was love at first bite. It's hard to find a traditional family  Mexican restaurant but this is it. The carne asada torta is amazing. The salsa bar is the best. The complimentary chips and salsa is a great touch. The service is very nice. Definitely will be one of my frequent spots
