I've been looking for some decent mexican food around here for over three weeks and wasn't able to find any until I stopped in at Los Tacos after some shopping. 
The place is as others have stated as being very clean and the staff very friendly. Knowing a bit of spanish will definitely make casual conversation a lot easier.

The style is from the Jalisco region of Mexico(central yet on the west coast) and is where Guadalajara is located.
The food is very flavorful and tasty. I've been looking for a good burrito shop since leaving San Diego and was getting depressed with not being able to find any. This little place is a good find.
