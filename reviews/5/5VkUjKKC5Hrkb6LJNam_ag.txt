I have been wanting to try SumoMaya for quite some time, and this visit was most certainly not the last.  We came in during happy hour, and the bar was quite full.  We were seated in the main dining room.  We were told happy hour would be honored for us even though it was supposed to be bar and high tops only.  Our server gave us great recommendations, the pineapple pisco was a great cocktail, and the bacon wrapped dates and Korean bbq taco are a must try. I can't wait to try the ceviches and the guacamole.  Our server, Benjamin, was wonderful.  Asian Mexican fusion, in both flavor and ambiance, at its finest.
