I honestly can't believe people are giving this place a bad review. My husband and I originally had reservations at pub 1842. We cancelled it and just wanted something fresh and quick. This place hit the spot. I got the 3 tacos and he got a taco salad - all delicious. Yea, you pay extra for things like guac...that also happens at chipotle. The Beers are pricy. Hey guess what?! You're in Vegas!!! This place is fresh and super delicious. I recommend the pulled chicken for extra flavor.
