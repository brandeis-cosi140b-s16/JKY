If it's PINK I'll take two...

I didn't see any pink tacos during my causal lunch 10/1 but the Ceviche I ordered was very flavorful and equally amazing! 
The honey chipotle wings are definitely an acquired taste! I'm uncertain if I'll order them again. Overall a great experience next time I'll have to order a PINK taco!
