First visit, with Lady Wife and sister. Superb staff, accommodated quick change in our size of party (I hadn't known some went different directions). Menu pretty wide. A la carte flexible, you state choice of meat. Sunday after concert, open and welcoming. Spacious, plenty of family trade, polychrome. A pleasure all ways. Parking lot N of restaurant, off Park St. A bit hard to find (dim-lighted sign), near Meritor Hospital, just S of easy-to-spot Gordon's Flowers.
