This place is one of the best Mexican restaurants you can find in AZ! Now, its not the fanciest, most expensive, or anything like that, but their food is mind-blowing! Depending on when you go, you may be in for a bit of a wait because the restaurant is small, but it is well worth waiting for. When I worked at the Bank of America across the street, I made a trip to Mango's on a daily basis. 

My favorite thing on their menu is their Chimichangas but everything is worth a taste. Their seafood tacos/burritos are delicious and you won't be able to find better fruit drinks anywhere! 

The price is fair and you won't be sad that you dropped the money. 

Beyond this, the staff is amazingly friendly. While they don't speak very good English, they make up for it in great service. The owner is also nearly always there and makes it a very great experience. Mango's is one of those places you can't just go to once. My taste buds still yearn for this food even though I am thousands of miles away!
