We ate here twice recently, and had huge plates of delicious food, including the basics, like tacos and their yummy and elaborate appetizer plates.  Really, you could just order appetizers and have more than enough to eat.  We ordered the fried ice cream for dessert again, and was sooooo good.  Outdoors can get crowded, but we were seated right away inside.  Service was great, and we were happy to use a 50% off coupon!  We'll be back....
