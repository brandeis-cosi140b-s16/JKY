This place is great compared to other mexican restaurants nearby. The portions are fairly large and have a home cooked flare loaded with flavor. This not a commercial mexican restaurant which i love. In other words, all the food is prepared, not processed. I immediately noticed the rice and beans were cooked the good ol' fashioned way. The chips and salsa you get while waiting are another nice touch. Their salsa is honestly the best salsa i had the pleasure of waiting with while my food was being prepared. As for the menu items, I prefer the steak (ribeye) & eggs for breakfast....very savory, very juicy! This is a mom and pop style place so if interior decorations are a must have, then cafe zamora is not your spot. 5 stars for food, friendly service, and approproate atmosphere.
