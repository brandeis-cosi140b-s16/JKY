Stopped in here for a Bloody Mary and lunch. I ordered the nachos with menchaca short ribs. They were some of the best nachos I have had in a long time. I am pretty picky about nachos because they are usually drenched in queso. This place uses a white queso, and the right amount so the chips stay crispy. It is delicious and reasonably priced. If I was doing a blind taste test, I would not guess that this is airport food. So good! I highly recommend stopping in for some nachos and a Bloody Mary.
