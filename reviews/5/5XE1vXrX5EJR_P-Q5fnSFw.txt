We love going there. Great atmosphere with the mariachi band on weekend. The food is great..espically the chips and salsa. I usally order the tilapia fish and its always fresh and large size fir only $ 14.00 fir whole fish with salad and two side dishes plus soup. Two people can share. Great service!
