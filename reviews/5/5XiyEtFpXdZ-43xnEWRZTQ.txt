Excellent little restaurant. We had a delicious dinner. My wife had the chimichanga's and I had the Mexican taco platter (chicken, steak and carnitas...hard shells). The chips and salsa are well worth the price. Salsa is fresh and has just the right zing to it. I also ordered the $2 house margarita (lime on the rocks). Must have. Very tasty. 

The service was very good and the decor is bright and fresh looking. There were a few other people on this Saturday afternoon. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their meals. We sure did and will be coming back. The prices are reasonable and pretty much on par with everyone else. Food is delicious and worth coming back. 

 The review in the Isthmus was spot on. Thanks for the suggestion.
