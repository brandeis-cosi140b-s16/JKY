I saw this on an episode of Diners, Drive thrus, and Dives. The seating and parking are very limited, but we were lucky enough to find a table big enough for the four of us. Our order did take much longer than expected because they were out of tortillas for an enchilada my wife ordered - so they made it from scratch. When it arrived it was magnificent. I ordered three tacos including a Oaxaca Black Mole Taco. That was one of the most incredible tacos I have ever had. I have had mole before and wasn't a big fan, but this was fantastic. The salsa bar was good, the chips and salsa excellent, and the horchata was the best I have ever had. I would certainly go here every opportunity I had.
