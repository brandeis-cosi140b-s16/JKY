I am staying at the Residence Inn and was looking for a late lunch. Was contemplating the Sub Shop next door but saw the sign "Tacos & Beer" and thought what could be better than that! I was pleased with the blues filled bar and many taps. The menu is simple alacart style and you can mix your order any way you like. Prices are low and the food was off the charts good. Oh did I mention happy hour from 3-6 and 11 to close with $3 Mexican beer, $4 Margaritas and a great selection of tacos for $2 & $3. This is going to be my regular stop for the best tacos around.
