no its not another roberto's. because they actually speak english and you get a beautiful waitress that always takes care of you. the food is not greasy and disgusting like roberto's. its family owned business so their is passion involved. the prices are beyond affordable. this location is my favorite because the area is still growing and it's only one of the few amazing places to eat at.
