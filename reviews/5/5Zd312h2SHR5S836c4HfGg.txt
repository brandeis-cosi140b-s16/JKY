This place will hopefully be the turnaround moment for PGH Mexican food, which in general has been one of my greatest disappointments with food in this city. 

Everyone loves Mexican food, but IMHO the city doesn't have a truly great option. Instead of focusing on my negative opinions about Mexican food in the burgh, I'll focus on the positive at Reyna's.

First, some history; I actually took a small tour of this place about 4 years ago when it was barebones (but still looked functional) and have been wondering why the long wait.

Well, upon entering, you'll see why. The atmosphere is extremely solid and beautiful. Very intimate as well. But, we're here for the food right? Reyna's is one of the handful of Mexican groceries in the city, and they have a reputation for making salsa and their chips are everywhere! I think Mad Mex still buys their tortilla chips..though that may have changed. Regardless, they had a lot at stake here and the time to prepare.

The payoff is great...and give it some time.. I think this place will be *the* staple food to take your out of town friends.

I don't even want to go into details about the food here; I had the Chiles Rellenos, multiple salsas, and my friend had the Tilapia. Though there were a few so-so's, we were quite floored by the majority of tastes. The owner, Nic, is adamant about keeping recipes as close to authentic as possible and you can sense the extra mile in every bite.

Great job guys.
