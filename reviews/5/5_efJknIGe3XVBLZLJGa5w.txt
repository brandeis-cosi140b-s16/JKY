This place is wonderful! The food is fantastic and fresh. I got the vegetarian burrito, which was full of saut√©ed veggies in a light sauce (not your typical rice, beans, and cheese). The boyfriend had carne asana tacos that he loved. 

Our server Verenice was one of the best I've had in a while. 

Check this place out!!
