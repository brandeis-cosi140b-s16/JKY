Finally, a place on green and first that is good! i think i have tried everything on teh menu. This is the most legit mexican food in town. Get the chalupas! It's the best deal. You get 3 chalupas for 4.99 (ish). Other good things to get are tacos and tostadas.  if you get a torta, get ready to bring home leftovers because that thing is huge!

The meat here could use a bit of salt and pepper. also, don't bother to get the fancy steak taco or fish taco because they dont taste that great. otherwise, everything is delicious!
