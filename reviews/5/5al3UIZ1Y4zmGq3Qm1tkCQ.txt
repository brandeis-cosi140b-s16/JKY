Just like any other awesome Vegas find, this place was tucked away in a corner of a strip mall! Definitely didn't disappoint. The service was awesome and our waiter Ignacio was great. I always judge a Mexican place by its chips and salsa and street tacos.... Again, was not disappointed. I'll definitely be bringing out of town guests here!
