This place has amazing wings.  They are all drumsticks, and they are amazing.  2 dozen huge meaty wings  for $11 bucks??? ( It's in house only fyi.) 
That's how much most places charge for 1 doz.  And the people here are really really friendly.  We brought our furry kid and sat on the patio.   Nicole, our waitress,  brought our pup water and was very quick with service, even though we were the only ones on the patio.  When I went inside, I noticed that she was also the bartender.  Pretty impressed that she was so quick with everything.  
This is our second time here...and we will be back.  I just love being able to bring our dog with us when it's nice outside.   And even better when the staff is cool with the mutt.
