We were on a mission to find a good Mexican eatery in Scottsdale and we happened upon Havanero's Mexican Grill.  The guacamole is to die for.  I designed my own burrito stuffed with guac, cheese, black beans, cheese topped off with hot sauce.  My husband had soft tacos stuffed with pork and steak with rice and beans.  YUM!  Everything is FRESH and authentic.  The owner waited on us and was nothing but totally gracious and humorous, as well.  We came in at 8:55, not knowing they closed at 9:00.  We offered to leave and he would not hear of it!  He just got his liquor license and is very excited about that!  He made my husband two drinks, one was on the house!  This little delight is hidden amongst other businesses, so you have to search.  It is well worth the extra effort!
