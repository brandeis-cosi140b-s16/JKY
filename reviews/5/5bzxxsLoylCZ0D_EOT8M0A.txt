It's no secret in my Yelp reviews that I LOVE tacos, so when I had been hearing my friends rave about this place for weeks, I knew I had to check it out.  My roommate and I ventured down Carson Street and entered the quaint, colorful restaurant.  A handful of seats are at the cement bar surrounding the taco prep area, and a few more at the window counter.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy, but glad that we were able to grab seats.  I will be honest, I wasn't impressed with the service right off the bat, as it took the two employees working about 5 minutes to even acknowledge that we were standing there.  They were working on putting together a couple of orders, but a nod or "hello" to acknowledge our presence and impending orders would've been nice.  The gal working finally found a second to take our orders: 3 tacos for me (pork, chicken, and Americano), and 1 taco (pork) and an order of black beans for my roommate.

The tacos came out in a jif, on warm, corn tortillas as requested.  These tacos are the perfect size and good LORD are they delicious.  My favorites, in order, would be the chicken, Americano and pork.  The pork was good, although the slaw that comes on it isn't something I'm a fan of... I'm just not a slaw fan in general so I won't hold that against them.

Doce also offers a cooler full of fun drinks to wash your meal down with, for $2 a pop.  When the check came, I was shocked.  $18. That's it? Should I order more tacos? I mean, EIGHTEEN BUCKS for four tacos, an order of black beans, and two drinks?  I did the math in my head and it checked out.  At $3 a taco, Doce has an advantage over one of my other taco faves in the city, and the location is prime.  I will absolutely be back to this place again and again.  They offer takeout as well!
