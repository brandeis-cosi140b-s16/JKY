One of the bests HEALTHY fast food places is the U.S. The staff are very friendly and helpful to first time patrons. Everyone in Vegas is nice to tourist. The portions are generous and you get free chips and salsa with your order. Oh and get this, the have Vitamin Water at the fountain and its the same price as regular soda. (included in the combo) Mind Blown!

I don't know how they get their chicken so juicy and I don't care! I just love it :)
