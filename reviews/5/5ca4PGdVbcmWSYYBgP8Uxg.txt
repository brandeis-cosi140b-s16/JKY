Ate here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. As far as breakfast meals, the chorizo and cheese burrito is flippin' awesome. I order it with sour cream and salsa. Steel cut oatmeal with blueberries  and brown sugar is pretty tasty and filling too. They make a good strong coffee. Iced latte was good and so was the cafe au lait . Also tried the crab guacamole during happy hour and on another visit tried the sweet potato tots. Loved those! But I always return for that burrito! Food is fantastic, staff is friendly, service is great. I will definitely eat here in the future.
