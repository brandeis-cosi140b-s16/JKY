I just keep coming back. I brought my brother here and he was amazed with their pancakes (flapjacks). They are heaven! These large pancakes are light, spongy and crisp on the edges with a nutty flavor. What is amazing is that even though they are fluffy, they don't turn into soggy sponges when you pour on the real maple syrup. 

Today I had their huevos rancheros. Their version is the best. First, they put them on sopes, a small thick version of a corn tortilla! Then, they use delicious tasting white beans instead of refried beans. The eggs were cooked perfect and the chili rojo was too mild for my taste but it was flavorful. Then the watermelon aqua fresca was clean and fresh. Can Cafe Tranquilo hit triples or are homeruns all they know. I never ate here when the place was Gallo Blanco but I cant see how it could have been any better. Que vive Tranquilo!
