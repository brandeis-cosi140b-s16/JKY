EPL, as I call(ed) it back home, came to Atlanta as only a tease.  It opened 3 locations that offered healthier, more inspiring dishes than what say, KFC has.  Then out of the blue, all 3 locations closed.  WTF!?!  I need my crunchy chicken tacos!  This had been a crushing blow to my love of Mexican fast food.

So as we were driving around Dobson Dr. near Mesa, I saw a logo that looked familiar.  It was time we met again- I saw an EPL!  Of course we went in.

I didn't even look at the menu- I told the friendly cashier I wanted 8 tacos and 2 drinks- she looked at me like a glutton- but she didn't understand where I was coming from- as I tried explaining, she just laughed.

The dining room- a decent size.  The salsa- more flavors than I had seen!  The drink machine- served coke!  Now, to perfect the experience, I just needed the tacos...  And then they arrived!

It was like finding a long lost love and being reunited.  It was that wonderful.  I should have asked if they deliver across the US- I would even consider it!

It was just so wonderful to be re-united again...
