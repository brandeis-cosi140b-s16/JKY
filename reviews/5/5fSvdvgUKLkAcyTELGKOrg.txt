My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place about a month ago on our way home from Papago Park and we were both pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic and moderately priced and all of the staff members had smiles on. It was a memorable experience and we felt we needed to come back.

We came back today and to our surprise the waiter remembered us after a whole month. Nothing makes you feel more welcome than having a waitress or waiter mention they remember you. Our waiter was Miguel and he was absolutely fantastic. We will definitely be coming back again.
