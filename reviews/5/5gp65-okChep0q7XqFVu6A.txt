Had a taste for Mexican food and this place definitely satisfied that craving. The staff were helpful and the place was clean. My kids ordered the grilled cheese and cheese quesadilla and they ate the whole thing! The complimentary chips and salsa were very tasty as well, and my son just couldn't stop eating it. Will definitely come back here again:)
