I ordered a huarache de tinga with grilled onions instead of raw. Tinga is chicken marinated in a bit of vinegar and seasoned in other spices. A huarache is like a huge thick corn tortilla that is filled with a thin layer of beans then it is topped topped with whatever you order. Absolutely delicious!!!! Go! Order it! You won't regret it!
