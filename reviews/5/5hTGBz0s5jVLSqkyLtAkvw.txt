Just had my first breakfast burrito here this morning.  My only complaint was that it was too big for me to eat it all.  I had bacon and my husband had chorizo.  He was very happy with his also.  Wish I would have started going here a long time ago.  Yum!  Can't wait till I'm hungry again to try something different.
