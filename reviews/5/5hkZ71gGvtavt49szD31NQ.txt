We were going to go to Chipotle for lunch, but we decided to try this place out.  We only know it by El Patio Mexico, lol, but it may have another name.  Anyways, the salsa was not too hot, not too mild, just right.  The chips were also made correctly.  One time we went and they gave me the wrong order (because of a little language barrier) so they gave me a free slice of cake which was very delicious and I didn't even use an attitude or anything.  The bathrooms are very clean and the atmosphere is very nice.    The burritos do need to be eaten with a knife and fork, lol.  The vegetables are very crisp and fresh.  The menu is also bilingual as well.  They also have a nice seafood selection.
