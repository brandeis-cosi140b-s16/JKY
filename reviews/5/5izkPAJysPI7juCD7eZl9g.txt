My husband and I have been coming to this Filibertos for years!!! We come here every Wednesday for the 99 cent bean burritos, which are amazing!! The staff are very friendly and are very willing to correct mistakes in your order. The environment is Mexican themed as well as neat and clean!! They keep adding new specials to their menu that are very tasty!! If you've  heard bad things about this location I urge you to come down and find out that this place is amazing!!
