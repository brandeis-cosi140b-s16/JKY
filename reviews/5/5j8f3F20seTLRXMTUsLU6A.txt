The weekend brunch is fabulous! Get a group together and share the small plates in order to experience the wonderful flavors. Some dishes have a little heat, but the effect is taste, not singeing taste buds. Carmie was a great guide on helping us select what to eat!

Relaxing on the patio and enjoying great food is a wonderful way to begin the day. We will be returning tomorrow morning before catching our flight home.
