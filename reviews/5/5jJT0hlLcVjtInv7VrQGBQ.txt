Honestly, this is some of the best mexican food in town!

It's connected to a gay bar Charlies and homo's are not going to eat half rate food...so needless to say it's amazing. Gay, Bi, Straight, Tranny....it doesn't matter, everyone is welcome!

Suggestions: Chicken or Steak Quesadilla, Nachos, Bean Burro

Go....go now!
