Best tacos north of the border. I've spent years in Mexico, and these are the only tacos I've had at a retail establishment in America that rival tacos I. Mexico. The flavor of the beef is so close to Sonoran beef I couldn't believe it!! Great guac and great prices too. Simple place with the focus on food.
