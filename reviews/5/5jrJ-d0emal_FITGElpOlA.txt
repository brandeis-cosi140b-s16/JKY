This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The food, atmosphere and drinks are great. Their outdoor patio is so cute and the entrees have such funny names. I love their appetizer the three amigos: Salsa, queso and guacamole. It is honestly the best combination to have at a Mexican restaurant.
