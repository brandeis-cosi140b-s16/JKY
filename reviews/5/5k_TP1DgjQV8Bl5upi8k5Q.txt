Food: EXCELLENT! 
Wait staff: EXCELLENT!
After being burned on Yelp a few times searching for Mexican cuisine, we finally hit the mother lode. We both had the carnitas chimichanga. DELISH! I had mine Christmas style and both sauces were rich and tasty with a bit more kick to the green. Nice atmosphere in a small old town setting. It is small so you may want to get there early or call ahead. Prices were fair and everything was served with pride, like a nice restaurant should always be. Nice enough to be well dressed, casual enough to come from the golf course. Would definitely do it again.
