This is among the best in Madison. No lie.

I'd been turned onto this place by one of my coworkers and so I decided to get lunch and something to take to work later. I'll be back, 'cause I don't have an ounce of regret.

The building itself is pretty weird. It's an old Popeye's, so it's kinda got that fast food, counter service feel to it, but there's no menu visible when you walk in. The guy behind the counter (who, by the way, wasn't what I expected at all...he was a pretty cool stoner-looking dude) hands you a couple of menus and tells you to seat yourself.

There's coolers and cases everywhere where you can pick out donuts or cakes or rice pudding or whatever if you want too. Forgot that part.

The food I tried was beyond excellent.

I had the Poblano mole. The guy working there warned me (in a friendly way) that it's a pretty polarizing dish, but having liked moles in the past I pressed on. I guess you get a choice between bones or no-bones (I'm not sure if this is like...bone-in thigh drumstick versus boneless breast or if you ask for no-bones if they cut it up for you, didn't ask). I opted for the bones for no particular reason. 

The portion size was huge. I can't emphasize that enough. They served me the biggest chicken thigh and drumstick that I have ever seen. 

The sauce was great. Slightly sweet, the chocolate base really comes through. It was served with rice, beans, and a bunch of corn tortillas. Outstanding.

I got a couple of steak tacos to go which I had later at work. They were also outstanding. Just a touch of salt, cilantro, and onion. The sauce in the cups that were packaged with was a highlight. It's not particularly hot, but it has a peppery kick that I really like.

This place isn't for everyone, but those who like great Mexican food will really enjoy this place.
