This place has awesome seafood!! The place is small and cute, with a beach theme. They make awesome Micheladas for curing a hang over. We had a dozen oysters, which were delish! I had some fried shrimp and fish  and a shrimp ceviche tostada. It was Scrumptious!! Next time I'm in Phoenix I will be sure to visit this place.
