Although Rubios falls in the genre of fast food, this location always has amazing fish and shrimp tacos and a friendly staff. This is an annual stop for my husband each year during our Barrett Jackson weekend visit to Scottsdale. My favorite is the blackened tilapia fish taco and my husband's is the classic grilled shrimp burrito. If you like coconut, the lemon bar makes a great desert.
