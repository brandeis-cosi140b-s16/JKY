This is one of our favorite mexican food joints. We can't get enough of their bean dip and green salsa. The green salsa is actually the best I've ever had--whenever we go we end up buying a pint of it to go. My wife always gets the tostada (a.k.a. a chalupa" from where I come from), taco, and enchilada combo which she really likes and I usually swap back and forth between the tamale or the enchiladas. Good stuff. This is also the first place I've ever had a Sonoran Hot Dog which was pretty darn good too. If you haven't tried this place, you should!
