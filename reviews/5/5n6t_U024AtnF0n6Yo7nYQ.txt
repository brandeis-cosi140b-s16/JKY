Just flat out yummy. My husband ordered marinated pork chimicanga and it was packed with flavor with some sweetness and spicy. Pineapples in there. I had a steak burrito that was super yummy too, although his was more flavorful. Service was good, tables were clean. Will be going back again when in Mesa again!
