All I can say is WOW.  I was in Fountain Hills with family for Memorial Day and needed a good Mexican food joint and Senor Taco was it and more.  Walked in and was greeted by possibly the owner and immediately felt welcome. I  had trouble deciding what to order because they have it all.  Decided on the Diablo shrimp burrito and it was delicious with all the flavors i was hoping for.  The others I went with loved their food and of course the margaritas were refreshing in the Arizona heat. Prices are a steal especially for the fountain Hills area.  

If your visiting from out of town and unsure where to go, this is a no brainer.
