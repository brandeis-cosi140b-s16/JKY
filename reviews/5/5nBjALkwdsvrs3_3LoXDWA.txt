Holy cow this place rocks!  I have been eating my share of mexican food in arizona for quite some time.  It always tastes the same.  I came here and now I feel like I know what a carne asada burrito should taste like.  I was amazed.  I would like to continue to come here and try some other things.  The staff is also incredibly friendly.
