I am in love with Carlitos Burritos!!! Best new mexican food in Vegas!!my best friend is from New Mexico and she says that is real good new mexican food! I've personally tried a bunch of items from the menu and they were all wonderful. My favorite is a green chile smothered bacon and sausage breakfast burrito...they are half off on Wednesdays, and 2x1 on sundays!
