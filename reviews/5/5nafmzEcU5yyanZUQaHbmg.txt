WOW! The food here is AMAZING!!! I have been here a few times for lunch and every time I go I try something new everything is delicious so far I've tried the Costillas en salsa Verde (ribs in green salsa) OMG to die for! If you are thinking of something on the lighter side try the shrimp tacos with a side of guacamole! The service is great they were very friendly & welcoming I felt like I was with family. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for great authentic Mexican food.
