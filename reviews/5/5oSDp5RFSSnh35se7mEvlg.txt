Previously I wrote how I had fallen in love with the vegetarian crunchy tacos. While these are still delish, I have a new love in my life and that's the soft flour vegetarian tacos. Here's what I do:
- Brown rice
- Black beans (the pinto beans have bacon)
- Fajitas (peppers & onions)
- Medium salsa
- Corn
- Lettuce
- Guacamole

I bet these are REALLY good with sour cream and cheese as well, but I'm trying to cut out the dairy. The medium salsa is AMAZINGGGG! I can't believe that after all of these years I am now just discovering it. 

I really like this location. The employees are really upbeat, positive, friendly, and very very helpful. The restaurant is always clean and you can tell that the kitchen where they cook everything is spotless.
