5 stars for the bean and cheese burrito!!! This dive is nothing fancy, but the bean and cheese burrito is delicious and the red hot sauce is amazing! My hubbie likes the chorizo, but any of the breakfast burritos will do. My one hesitation about the food here is the enchilada sauce, it's from a can and not very good. Otherwise, go eat and enjoy!
