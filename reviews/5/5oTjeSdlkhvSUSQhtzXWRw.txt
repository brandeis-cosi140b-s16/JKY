My 6th time here. I love this shop! My go to is the hard shell taco with carnitas. Damn delicious. And beautiful presentation.Every purchase is made to order fresh. Worth the short time to make. Very delicious. Hours are great for those of us who work nights (open at 7am). Also they have a great selection of custom sauces (including an extreme hot which is legit). Will continue to be a staple for me.
