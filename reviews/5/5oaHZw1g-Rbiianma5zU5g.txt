So of course i saw the Man V Food episode last night about the Del Ray Torta. Thought is looked amazing. So for lunch i went and tried their food. It was definetely difficult to choose what i wanted. So many things looked good. 

I chose the Arizona Torta. One word: Awesome! 

It was hot, delicious, and tasty... Oh and i got the traditional Coke in a bottle! 

Will be back.. maybe for dinner tonight!
