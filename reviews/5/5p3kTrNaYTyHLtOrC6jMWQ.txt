Good and fun location.  The environment is upbeat and lively. Servers are friendly. 

The food is amazing. Fresh and flavorful. The salsa alone is to die for.  The beer is good and the daily deal affordable. The lemon shrimp tacos are so good and the avocado pasta is unique and tasty.

Try this you won't regret it.
