I really wish that we could rate something 4.5 stars.... 

Went back last night. Even better than before, because of a new discovery.

$3.75 MARGARITAS

No gimmicks, no shenanigans. Menu price. 

The service was STILL excellent. Our server had a fun, witty sense of humor. The food was awesome. If there IS a gripe, it's that the food is too hot when it comes out. SCORCHING, so be careful!

These cheese crisps are THE BEST in town. If I could figure out how to make these at home, I'd be breaking fat person records. Best I leave this one to the pro's.  

Since I'm continuing my quest to find something wrong with Don Ruben's, I tried something different on the menu, as did my gf. I did the Carne Asada tacos, she did the Spinach Enchiladas. Two plates full of AWESOME coming right up! 

The low rating befuddles us, and the recent accusations of "imposter postings", or "shill postings" throws us off, so we talk about what WOULD make Don Ruben's a 5. We can't think of anything. 

This is the best Mexican food in the Valley. There's a few others I'm obligated to try, (DAMMIT!) but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make to get a fair comparison, and to bring an accurate review to my beloved Yelp.
