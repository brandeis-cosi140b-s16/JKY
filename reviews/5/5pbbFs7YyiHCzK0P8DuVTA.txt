New taco joint! The Estiffy is aptly named and it's a meal. Two not so mini Chimis filled with nicely browned ground beef, perfectly deep fried with some stiffy producing creamy pink sauce and a nice topping of cotija cheese. Yum! Shrimp taco at $2.95 had a lot of nicely cooked shrimp with a cabbage salad and nicely sliced salsa. Busy little place.
