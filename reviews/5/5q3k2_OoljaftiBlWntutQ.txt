Finally writing a review after my third visit!  Twice for lunch and once for dinner. AWSOME food and love the patio. Rachele was our waitress and she honestly was probably the BEST server we have had!  Great personality and amazing service. Food is so fresh and drinks are great too. Can't wait to go back!!!!!
