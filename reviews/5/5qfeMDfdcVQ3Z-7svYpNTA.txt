This is what Torta perfection is all about.  Wide range of styles and proteins, freshest ingredients, real telera bread and a passion for delivering mouth watering goodness every single time tattooed on the culture of the establishment.   I've tried the Cubana, the Milanesa de Pollo and the Nortena de Pollo.  While all clearly above the rest, the one that really stands out is the Nortena.  A harmonious blend of grilled chicken, slightly charred, loaded with melted cheese, tomatoes, avocados, refried beans, chipotle AND jalape√±os.  I couldn't just eat one... I had two.  They have regular size (which is really Xtra Large) and Minis (which are regular for everyone else).   Attentive and friendly service.  Stand out appetizers include the Tostada de Ceviche as well as the Tostada de Tinga.   Buen provecho!  Eating here is like being in a year round Torta-pallozza!  I love it.
