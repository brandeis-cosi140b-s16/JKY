Excellent place to get great seafood!

Restaurant and Food:  The restaurant is nice and cozy.  At max, there are maybe 15 tables in the entire joint.  However, don't let the size, location, and lack of flashy chain-like display fool you.  The menu has a wide array of choices from fish tacos to different styled fish plates.  I had a fish plate prepared with garlic and a lemon pepper seasoning (Pescado Ajo Mojo I think) as well as an horchata for my beverages.  The food was impeccable!  In my experience, coming across fresh seafood in Phoenix is hard.  The seafood was well prepared and fresh (no gamy-fishy taste).   Additionally, the menu has pictures of almost every dish so you can gauge your interest in a choice (Visual examples appeal to me).

Service:  Spot on along with the food!  As mentioned previously, the restaurant is not that big.  Our server was always on top of her game and frequently stopped in to check on us.  

Atmosphere:  The restaurant has a bright decor that is very fun and fitting for the type of restaurant.  Not to sound cliche, but you will feel almost as if you are at mom's kitchen (I'm Hispanic and my parent's house has similar decor).  

Overall, this place wowed me with the food and the service.  For the price and quality you will receive at Mariscos Playa Hermosa, I doubt you can find many places in the neighborhood that will compete with this place.  Try it and see for yourself!
