This is a great new Southern California chain restaurant that just opened (December 2007) in down town Tempe.  They took over for the former Cap Company space on the southeast corner of Mill and Sixth Street and offers a menu of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.

The mood is mellow with Mexican folk art paintings, shelves of T-shirts, and an overall unfinished look.  They have 3 hree high-def TVs that hang over an eight-seat bar, and a garage door opens to a sidewalk patio.

They have an excellent menu of fast Mexican food that is exactly what you'relooking for while enjoying a game or ending a long night out.
