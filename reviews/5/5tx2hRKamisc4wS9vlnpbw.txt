This visit was the quickest chipotle visit I have ever had!!! So impressed! They had everything stocked sufficiently and were well staffed. I moved through the line seamlessly and got to the register in less than 8 min even with 2 customers in front of me. Once at the register I was worried because someone was being trained, but was pleasantly surprised by the speediness of the payment process. 
This is now my chipotle of choice, even though there is one 2 min from my house. I will drive 10 min to get better service!
