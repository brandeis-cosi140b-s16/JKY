This is where I fell in love with carne asada burrtios!

When I moved from Chicago to Phoenix, I had no idea what Mexican food could be.  This was the first place I had tried because it was within walking distance to home & school.  I must have eaten here twice a day for an entire semester.  Today it's more of an after-the-bar treat.  This is the benchmark for all burritos.   You may feel the need to high five someone after eating one.
I can only relate in analogy. It is Garfield's lasagna, Bert's oatmeal, Laestragonian's Acheans, Olympian Ambrosia, and Elvis's peanut butter and banana freakin' sandwiches all wrapped into a burrito.
