BEST DAMN HOT DOG YOU WILL EVER EAT. PERIOD.
Order the pork. Dig in. Immediately have a food induced orgasm. A few blocks north of The Stratosphere. Kinda seedy area, but no one ever messed with me, and honestly if you are scared to walk down a major street in public, go back to The Bellagio and order some gluten free, organic quiche or whatever. You probably haven't lived enough to appreciate the working class gourmet flavor here. 
Damn. I want one now....mmmmm Felix Pork Hot Dog....drool.
