I'm from Houston, Texas and Los Cabos is about as good as any Mexican food you would get here in Pittsburgh. Now, its no Tex-Mex, but it is darn good compared to the other mexican fares in and around the 'burgh.
I live down the street from Cabos and have been frequenting the restaurant since it opened. The staff are wonderfully nice and recognize me and my friends when we come in.
Great place all around!!!
