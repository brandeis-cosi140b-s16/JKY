I have got to say we got here on Oct 21 and I have ate at the Pollo Locos at least 7 times since, and it does not disappoint. I always get 4 pc chicken with 2 sides usually slaw, pinto beans, flour tortilla s. Delicious, make your own tacos and all the fresh salsas freshly made on counter to get as much as you want. They gave me a senior card with large drink $10.22 not bad. Chicken is so good, you want to eat it all encluding the skin.
