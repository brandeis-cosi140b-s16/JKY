Molcajetes as authentic as the Mayan calendar.
Food served on a molcajete, a grinding tool made from volcanic rock, the same kind the Mayans and Aztecs used for thousands of years back can only prove the authenticity of the cookware and of the scheme. The mariachi band playing loud music, vendors coming in and out of the restaurant selling DVDs and CDs and other stuff can only prove the authenticity of the atmosphere.
  My eyes were fooled, my ears were convinced but  my taste buds, the toughest one of my senses, are the only one that can conclude authenticity.
 We started with an order of raw oysters, juicy and chewy with some tapatio and lime, paired with a michelada and I was instantly a fan. The molcajete mixto with steak chicken and shrimp, sizzling exploding like a volcano with south of the border flavors sealed the deal, it was real mexican food and this Mexican was happy! 
 I will definitely return if only for the raw oysters, everything here taste amazing and the service is equally awesome there's nothing here that doesn't scream authentic! ...except the little umbrellas that decorate the servings...those are made in China.
You go now!!
