It's hidden away indeed!

When we finally found Dick's Hideaway, I wished I would have done so YEARS AGO.  I've been missing out all these years, on absolute GOODNESS.

The "Pasta Heidi" is a dish that will likely NEVER be knocked from my "top 10 favorite foods list".  It is MY-OH-MY GOOD!

The ambiance is absolute perfection.  Rustic yet polished.  YES, it is teeny-tiny BUT we were there early on a weeknight & sat in the bar area and there were still tables available long after we arrived.
