Amazing!  We came on $.99 taco wednesday.  We got a chicken and a beef, and paid the full price of $2.75 for a fish taco.  A side of chips and guacamole was also ordered.

Oh my it was yummy!  This place is a gem.  Don't let the building or neighborhood scare you away.  This is the best tacos in the Phoenix area!  Best fish taco I've had since being in LA.
