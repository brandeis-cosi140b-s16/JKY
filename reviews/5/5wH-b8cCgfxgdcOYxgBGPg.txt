By far, the BEST Mexican restaurant we have discovered since moving to SW Charlotte 2 1/2 years ago!  The cheese dip, salsa, margarita's, EVERYTHING good!  Great atmosphere with Mexican music, and an absoulutely fantastic STAFF that goes out of their way to make the night special for you!  Two thumbs up!!
