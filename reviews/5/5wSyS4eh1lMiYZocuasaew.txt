Stopped in for lunch to go. I ordered the chicken flauta. Large portions and very tasty. I was surprised at how large the entree was. Awesome customer service - attentive, friendly and courteous. I like how they repeat your order back to you when they bring you your bag. The place was pretty full for a Tuesday afternoon. I'd return.
