This is my favorite Roberto's location :) the  service is awesome . I always ask for my green onions to be grilled and they do it without hesitation . Their salsa bar is always clean and there tacos are delicious! 
I love coming for the Wednesday chicken taco special. California burrito is bomb too!  

The atmosphere isn't too welcoming but whatevs I come for the food
