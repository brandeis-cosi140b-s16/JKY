Let me be clear and direct in this review: I am a MAN and when I go to Chipotle I do not order a salad or a hand full of chips.  I order a BURRITO, with MEAT.  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles, which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle, burritos, and all food in general.

One of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency; you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious.  What you don't necessarily know though, is the attitude.  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation?  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty, filthy man who hates you simply for being alive, and will follow you out to your car and mug you?  Nobody knows.  Except me, because I've eaten at this one several times.

This is a magnificent Chipotle.  The people are good spirited, helpfully construct your burrito quickly, and pleasantly.  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like, "Eh, not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy" and do you know what?  I go into this place, and everybody is happy and working and it's like, "Yeah... yeah now I'm feeling a little better.  Maybe things aren't so bad.  Maybe she still loves me."

So to summarize, this is a great Chipotle.  It's bright, friendly, ample parking, and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.
