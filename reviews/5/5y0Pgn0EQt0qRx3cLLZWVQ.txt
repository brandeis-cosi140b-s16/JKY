I really like this place. It's not particularly fancy, but the food is really good. The service is friendly and fast. And, it's much easier to get a table here than at nearby Mad Mex. We started coming here when we couldn't bear the line at Max Mex, but now we go here first. I won't say I'm an expert, but the food seems much closer to the Mexican food I've had in Texas/California. Their beer selection could use some work (standard Mexican beers), but nothing's perfect :)
