My absolute favorite taco shop. My brother and his high school friends got me hooked. It is a weird location, totally unexpected for good Mexican food. Filiberto's is a mile north, but this is definitely the place to go. New and definitely does not look authentic, but anything with steak is delicious! The only con is that it is not open 24/7.

In short: Great Mexican food at a cheap price. Best taco shop in town.
