Been eating Mexican all over CO and NM from Yelp reviews ...I ordered the cheese enchiladas and the beef taco from a review below .... It's 2pm on a Monday and the waitresses were nice the place is clean the hot and mild sauces were great that comes with the chips and the food was excellent ... The fried ice cream sounds excellent, someone else needs to report on that
