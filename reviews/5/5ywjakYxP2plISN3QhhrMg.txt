I have lived in AZ for the past 12 years and visited 8 numerous times a year for 8 years before that.  In all of my dining out experiences, Two Hippies is hands down one of my favorite spots in AZ. The food is not ridiculously gourmet, but it is delicious and you CAN'T beat the price! How many places can you get a filling, tasty meal for less than $10? Two Hippies has and will be one of my all time favorites.
