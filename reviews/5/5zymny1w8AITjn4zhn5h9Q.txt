Classic "whole in the wall" Filibertos style restaurant.  Very unpretentious and basic style. Located in Guadalupe. Ordered the Chili Rellenos special for lunch. Reasonably priced at ~ $7. I usually only buy the Chili Rellenos dinners -so I can compare all the Mexican restaurants an also because I love this dish.
Anyways - rice nice and fluffy,beans tasty and Chili Rellenos very tasty. Also came with a side of salsa and another spicy sauce. I talked to some of the locals who were  eating there and they all seemed very happy with the food. One guy pointed out that he always came on a Wednesdays for the $1 Tacos. Unfortunately I missed the specials signs.  Nice covered area out front plus eating in-side if required.

As Arni said - "I'll be back"
