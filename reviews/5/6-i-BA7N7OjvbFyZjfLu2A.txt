Again, El Encanto does not disappoint in any way. It's hard to conceive Mexican cuisine as being gourmet, but this is just about as close to it as one can get without going to Las Vegas or San Diego. My wife had a chicken piccata dish that oozed with flavor and fresh tenderness; I stuck with my favorite chili verde offering. 

The superb wait staff is not hesitant to recommend house favorites.  Our waitress had something many Mexican establishment servers lack: panache. She called our attention to the local sites and shopping venues.
