What can I say?  I love everything about this place.  We travel 20 miles to get here, passing several Mexican restaurants on the way.  The service has always been good, with chips/salsas arriving at our table when we sit.  Our water glasses never have a chance to get empty.  I have tried the chili relleno... a nice sized Anaheim chili filled with what looks to be jack cheese.  Very tasty.  The seafood enchiladas are to die for.  They are smothered in a sauce that makes you want to lick the plate.  Friends have had fajitas and like the fresh vegetables.  Food is always very fresh tasting and has so much flavor.   Prices are very reasonable.  Mixed drinks are good; a great margarita!  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Don't miss Leticia's.  It is worth the drive.
