I've eaten here at least 3 times since I moved to LV. Fantastic food. The Hatch Green Chili Mac & Cheese, WOW! And the signature Sloppi Jo, it ain't a "manwich", it's a rich bowl of love! More recently tried the cupcakes, "breakfast" and "Elvis", both again great. If this truck is at a multi-truck event, be sure to try it.
