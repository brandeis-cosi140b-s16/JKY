Mexx32 is the best new hip place to see and be seen.  While true, that statement is far too shallow for the substance that this restuarant provides.  I loved the hatch chile cheese crisp as an appetizer with tasty guac and sour cream.  The shrimp tinga taco is already a favorite of mine...  My buddy loved the carne asada taco saying it was very tender and seemed like it was marinaded all day.  James was our server and he was terrific.

It has a unique style all its own with an open inviting bar with large tv's that can be viewed from every seat in the house.  There's also a cool community table that looks like it was an actual tree.  I prefer the plush high-backed booths that offer privacy to our table and others.  Their menu has a wide variety of choices at a very fair price considering the ambiance and service.  Next time, I'm going to enjoy the nice weather on the patio, as I noticed the heaters were on that night.

I was glad to hear Mexx32 even serves full menu until midnight with an open bar til 2am!  This restuarant has only been open a week, so it has some wrinkles to work out.  Our server told me they'll serve lunch soon too.

.... can't wait to make this restaurant a regular occurrence!
