If you want great authentic street tacos this is the place to come. The meats are grilled and oh wow !! So, so good. They have a lot of other items like a crazy potato that is really good. It's a baked potato filled with sour cream , your choice of grilled meat finely diced cabbage onions pico and a special sauce. If you go,try it during the week..  if you dare the weekends are ipacked out the door waiting but, well worth it. :)
