No signage at all. A bit pricey, CASH only! Limited hours, horrible parking, no indoor seating and competition for shaded seating on the half-dozen picnic tables of the back patio in this residential neighborhood. Expect the line to be out the door and you are probably going to have to wait a minute to get your lunch; because this is the best damn hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in the valley. If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience, this is it. Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo. But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door, if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else. I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit, but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav. The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried, order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions. Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious! They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips, but I've never seen nachos on the menu. Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class, assuming you like this class. If it's the middle of the week like between 11 - 4, I've got a $20 bill and a hankering for Mexican Al Fresco - Rito's. Who's down?
