Phat Phrank's tagline ("Not the best, just none better") is a cringe-inducingly awful mangling of the English language.  And the way he replaces all of his F's with Ph's is kind of odd.  But neither of these are reasons to avoid this place.  

Phat Phrank is no Shakespeare, but he makes up for it with his amazing skills in the kitchen.  In fact, he serves the best damn Mexican food in Vegas!

I dropped by Phat Phrank's for a quick lunch on a Friday afternoon.  The place -- like pretty much every Vegas business that's not part of a hotel-casino -- in tucked in a nondescript strip mall behind a gas station.  The interior is simple, clean, and comfortable.  You order at the counter (run by Phrank himself!), grab a number, and the food is out within minutes.

For lunch I had a fish taco and carne asada taco.  These tacos were absolute perfection.   The fish was flaky and tender, and carne asada was juicy and loaded with flavor.  Both were piled high with fresh veggies.  A splash of salsa verde and I was in taco heaven.

I couldn't leave without satiating my sweet tooth, so I had the churros drizzled with chocolate, caramel, and vanilla.  These were the absolute best churros I've ever had.  The dough was crispy on the outside, silky on the inside, and the combo of sauces took the flavor party to a whole 'nother level.  Absolutely indulgent and amazing.

If you're looking for amazing cheap eats served in a true mom-and-pop shop, look no further than Phat Phrank's.  You'll love it.  I know I do.
