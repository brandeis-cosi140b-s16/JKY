I was skeptical of this place, probably because of all the fancified, pretentious Mexican places popping up, but this place gets my approval seal. The interiors and exteriors are colorful. The service is great. And the food is excellent. I had a sampling of their tacos, and all of them were good. I also liked their sopapillas, guacamole, salsa, and chips. I hope they stick around.
