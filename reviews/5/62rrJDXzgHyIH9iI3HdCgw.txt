Good mexican food of any kind is hard to come by in this city, let alone authentic street mexican food.  The tacos are dirt cheap, the guys working the stand enjoy what they're doing, and the self serve salsa bar is what dreams are made of.

It's pretty simple.  

You choose a filling: carne asada, chorizo, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas, or potato poblano.

They pull two warmed corn tortillas off the flat top, stack them, and load it with enough to fill each of them individually.

You hand them two dollars. Well let's be honest, most likely you're going to hand them 6 or 8 dollars, because not only are they dirt cheap, they're the best roadside taco you can get in this city. Yes, even better than Reyna's lengua taco on one of their handmade tortillas. Close race, but Las Palmas wins.

Next, you step down the line to the salsa cart:  pico de gallo, whole roasted jalapenos, cilantro, avocado crema, mild salsa, medium salsa, hot salsa, habanero salsa, lime wedges, chopped onion, diced tomato.  The only additional cheap item I could think of to add to this salsa party is some shredded cabbage, but I sure as hell am not complaining. Grab some napkins and a fork and step aside.

They don't have any tables or chairs. There is plenty of curb space, concrete steps of nearby businesses, hell there's even a library drop box that can be used as a makeshift table.  Just find a place where you can stop for 3 1/2 minutes and make a complete mess of yourself.

The carne asada and chorizo are top notch, the others good if not great.

Don't sell yourself short. Go get a taco... or five.
