I came for Sunday brunch and shared about a dozen plates with my party. The food is served family style, so we were able to sample just about everything. 
I. Ate. So. Much. 
The dishes were very innovative and I appreciated the different flavors. I especially liked the bacon jalape√±o pbnj sandwich! I really didn't think it was going to be good, but the hot/sweet/spicy/salty combo was almost addicting. 
I also really liked the sweet corn tamales. They were full of sweet corn and very moist. 
Lastly, I can't forget to mention the bottomless mimosas! My favorite was the cucumber mimosa. I tried grapefruit, apple and pom, but cucumber won (another flavor combo I was not expecting!)
I recommend coming for brunch and bringing a large group to share dishes. We had so much fun and stayed for almost 2 hours laughing, eating and drinking. A wonderful Sunday!
