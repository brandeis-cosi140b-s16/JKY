Mind is completely blown. Korean, Mexican, Chinese fusion?? HELL YEAH!

I found this little place randomly on our way out of Vegas after a weekend trip. I searched yelp by check in offers because I was feeling cheap after losing all my money on the strip. KoMex came up, and we were sold. In fact, we waited in the parking lot for over an hour until they opened just so we could try it. 

We over-ordered and everything was so inexpensive. I had the shrimp stir fry, my boyfriend had the bulgogi nachos, my friend had kimchi fried rice and they ordered a bulgogi burrito with kimchi as well. Everything I tried was amazing. I ordered a double order of kimchi on the side and greedilt gobbled it up in less than a minute.

The people working there were super nice and the food came out quickly. Plus, free wontons when you check in. Can't beat that!
