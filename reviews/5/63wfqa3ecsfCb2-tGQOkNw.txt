this chain's a godsend to travelers who need quick, reasonably-priced,   healthy/non-greasy eats. i ate lunch here everyday while staying at Caesar's Palace.  perfect business model. always nice employees.  i dig their brown rice option (which is hard to find in restaurants).healthy & delicious.  love my no-frills chicken burrito for $7.08
