To start off with you get six different salsas and warm chips.

our server (forgot your name, nice tats by the way!!) was amazing, she was great with my nephews and very patient... i had two margs for $2 bucks each (for their happy hour, which was also very good and apparently everyday)

they had a kids menu (i guess kids eat free on tuesdays with purchase of adult entree... big bonus for people with kids)

in my eyes it was like a high quality mexican street cart vendor or high quailty los betos.

great prices, salads are very good... i got machaca tacos (not on the menu, but they made anyway) with rice and black beans (which were good as well)

i plan on definitely going back more times!! help this place stay open in n phoenix!!
