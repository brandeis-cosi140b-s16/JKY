I love the food, the employees and the location. If you have a special order such as their BRC (beans, rice and cheese) burrito and want the cheese on the side, they accomodate you. FYI if you are vegetarian /vegan the beans and rice contain ZERO animal products. 

This is the only place that I purchase my fresh made corn and flour tortillas. 

Also the employees here are very courteous and if there is a problem they quickly resolve it.

My husband and I enjoy their desserts.
