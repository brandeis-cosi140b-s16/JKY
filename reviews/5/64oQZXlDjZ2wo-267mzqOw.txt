Heard about this place on DDD, and was super surprised when I realized that this place was located right across the street from where I used to go to high school.  One of my best friends and I came here on a Saturday to see what all the hype was about, and now I can totally see why.  The owner was super friendly and all of his staff provided great service.  They were so genuine towards their customers, and I appreciated how hard they worked to make everybody happy.  Even though they were super busy, there was enough room for everyone to sit down and enjoy their food.  The bacon cheeseburger my friend and I both had was beyond awesome.  Everything they put on it- from the sauce, the onions, etc.- added its own individual taste to the burger, and it all fit together perfectly.  The sweet potato tots I tried were great as well.  The Lucky Charms shakes that we both had afterward topped off an amazing lunch.  I bragged about how good it was so much that later on, I convinced my mom to pick it for dinner after Saturday mass, and my entire family could see why I went on about it so much and why I wanted to eat it again even after having it for lunch just a few hours earlier.  A big two thumbs up for me!
