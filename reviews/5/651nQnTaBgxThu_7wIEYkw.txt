I had the BBQ pork sandwich today. The thing is huge! I had to use two hand to hold it. The pork was falling out everywhere and the juice and sauce dripping down my hand. Although it is not the very best I have had (the sauce was lacking a bit) the value made it worth the 5th star. 

I hear Mim also owns Cafe 36 on Indian School and Central in a office complex?
