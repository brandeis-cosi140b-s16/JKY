Fantastic!!!! 

Funny story, I tried to go here the other day before the truck showed up and walked around looking for a restaurant. I guess I should've read a bit more!!! haha
Its 6 blocks from my house so last night (after 7pm) my wife and I took a walk for dinner. THERE's THE TRUCK!! 

They have a very large food truck and a tent set up with seating for probably 25-30 people. Its get busy there so get there early if you want seating. They even have a waiter working all the tables and taking orders to go! Dude was busy as hell but still kept things flowing great! 

I went outside the norm and ordered Tacos Cabeza and Vampiros Lengua as well as some nachos and some Veggie Tacos for my wife!!! 
My Tacos were great, Vampiro(think huge tostada) was great, nachos were ordinary, wife really enjoyed her veggie tacos. This is a great spot! Customer for as long as the truck frequents this location!
