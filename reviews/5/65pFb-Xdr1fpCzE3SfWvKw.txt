I was very impressed with the service. I enjoyed my chimichanga, which was good, but my husband had the hue so rancheros and said it was the best hed ever eaten. Thats saying a lot as he eats them wherever we go. 

Its a shame this place is so hard to find. It was completely dead inside - on a Friday night. We were the only customers. 

They deserve better.  

Do yourself a favor and check them out. The prices for the specials ($5 for a huge plate of food) are the best youll find in town. 

Oh and even though its small, this is a sit down restaurant and not a hole in the wall.
