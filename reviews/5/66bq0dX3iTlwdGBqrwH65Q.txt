Theo, you amazing glorious bastard, you! Theo owns the place. Good little balding Greek boy turns our Mexican inspired cuisine that's as good as my mama's home-made pierogis... which I know none of you have had, but trust me they're good.

I've been going to Mexi-Casa with my wife, teacher friends, and family since near when he opened. What got me hooked wasn't the food but the fact that he and a couple of friends did ALL the work on building the interior. I got to sit on one side and shove mongo con queso shrimp burritos down my gullet while watching him toil away on building the bar from scratch. And since he finished the bar, my wife and I have found ourselves staggering out of the place on a large number of "holy crap my students are going to turn out to be serial killers, I just know it" Fridays. 

The food is not traditional Mexican or even traditional tex-mex. But that doesn't mean it's not good. Consider for a moment the simple yet inspired chicken and rice bowl, which its verdant hues composed of a blending of fresh cilantro and parsley into a heady, otherworldly green sauce. The chili has lots of meat chunks and is pretty damned hot, warming you down to your toes. Thank God they have lots of good beer with which to wash it down. Frito pie... chili with Frito's and a piece of jalapeno corn bread... yummy. And the burritos, especially with the con queso sauce made with Rolling Rock beer. Get them mongo (double meat) and pick one of the hotter hot sauces from the hot sauce bar (like the always popular "So hot your man junk will fall off" sauce), and be prepared to feel like you're on the winning end of a Man v. Food episode: bloated, carb high, and happy. 

You are a god among men, Theo.
