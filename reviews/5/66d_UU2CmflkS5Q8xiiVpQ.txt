Chipotle is my favorite chain restaurant! It doesn't matter if you're in vegas, California, or Arizona! The food and portions are always AMAZING! As a UNLV student, it is awesome having this right across the street! This place is always busy! So don't think you will be in and out in a min. The wait for food is probably 5 min, but that's because the line is out the door during lunch time. 

This chipotles is awesome just like all of them!
