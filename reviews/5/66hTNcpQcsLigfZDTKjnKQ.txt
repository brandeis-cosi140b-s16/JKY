We dined at Sabor last night and it was absolutely fabulous.  Our server, Kelly, was very knowledgable and efficient, and the owner, Scott, very service oriented and very friendly, also.  We had an absolutely wonderful meal - traditional margaritas, calamari, scallops and clams.  Everything was perfect and I can't wait to go back next weekend!  The food is from Oaxaca and it's not your typical Mexican food.  The mole was amazing!
