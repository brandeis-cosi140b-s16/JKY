We visit this restaurant at least once a week.  I LOVE their green sauce!  Everything is made from scratch - none of that out-of-the-bag guacamole.  Their menu lists the usual Mexican cuisine, but influenced by old family recipes.  The place is very clean, the prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  We think it's the best Mexican food in Wickenburg.
