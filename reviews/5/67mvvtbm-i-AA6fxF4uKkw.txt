We went to patron on a Sunday night. His was our first time here. When we first sat down, a staff member greeted us and gave us chips and salsa. He was very polite. We had Dina as our server. She was great as well. She couldn't have been any better. We ordered shrimp fajitas for 2 and a couple other small things. They came out very fast. The portions were huge and the food was even better. No complaints and we will be sure to return in the near future.  The staff was outstanding and the food was on point.
