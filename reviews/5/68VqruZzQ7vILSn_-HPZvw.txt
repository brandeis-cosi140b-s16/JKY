I recently visited Las Vegas and went to this Chipotle for dinner one night. When I went to pay, my credit card was declined. I didn't have any other way to pay for my food, as I had left my other cards in my hotel room. The Chipotle staff handled the situation very kindly and professionally. Thank you Chipotle staff for turning a terrible situation into a great experience.  =)
