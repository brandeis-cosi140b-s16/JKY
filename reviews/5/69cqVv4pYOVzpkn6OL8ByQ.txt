My friends recommended I go to Braddah's. I'm a big fan of taste, texture, colors in food and Braddah's had it all. Since I was a first timer, they offered me all four meats and it was terrific. I ordered a whole wheat burrito with seaweed rice (brown rice) with Huli Huli chicken. It was amazing! Also, they had several homemade sauces to taste with your meal. I liked the pineapple lime and raspberry sauce.

And most importantly, the staff was amazing. The manager, Josh, was friendly and attentive. He made certain that our visit was satisfying and our stomach desires fulfilled. The rest of the staff was smiling, friendly, and also attentive. The place is overall very clean and chill with the music.

Definitely coming back and might just bring my whole family! :-)
