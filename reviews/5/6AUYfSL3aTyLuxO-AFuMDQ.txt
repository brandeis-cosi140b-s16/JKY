Seriously fantastic Southwest Mexican food! My mom and I are in town for my grad school graduation and after landing we were haaangry (hungry with some sass) after a day of travels from Chicago. We yelped it up and came across this little gem! 
We weren't looking to eat a feast large enough for a kingdom, so we settled on appetizer portions. Mom had the crab cakes and I, being a fish abstainer, opted for chicken quesadillas! Love me some quesadillas!! Num, num, num! The chips and salsa were crazy delicious too, I totally recommend eating an obnoxious amount of their salsa. I did... ;-)
Now the atmosphere. Holy crap. Loved. It. So pretty and chill, but I could see myself getting schwasted on some delicious margs here too!
I highly recommend this place and I will DEFINITELY be back before heading home to good ole Chicago.
