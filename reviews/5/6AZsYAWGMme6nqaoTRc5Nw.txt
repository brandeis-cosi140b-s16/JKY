Just picked up a 1/2 dozen of these at the downtown Chandler farmers market.  I was a little hesitant because of the price, but they were worth every penny.  Not to mention that they are about 1 1/2 times the size of the average tamale.  Tried the poblano and jack cheese so far and can't wait to try the others.  I will definately go back and pick up some more soon.
