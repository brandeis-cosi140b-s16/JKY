I'm pretty regular at this Chipotle location. A few employees recognize us immediately, and they always treat us with respect and chat us up. It's a good time coming here. I don't know what it is about Chipotle, but I love my veggie burrito. It's one of the best things I have ever had, and before you judge, know that my diet is limited because of digestive problems. Chipotle burritos have carbs with non-irritating ingredients that fill me up, so I indulge. 

I never have any trouble getting a little extra fajita veggies and sour cream. They make my burrito with a perfect balance, and they are always rolled to perfection. A burrito that isn't rolled properly puts me in a very cranky and frustrated mood, and these guys do such a great job. 

The staff here is phenomenal, I am always attended to and I think that they move their lines pretty quickly. Chipotle will always be packed. Either you can get dedicated employees who pay attention to the customer and the food, or you can get employees who just pay attention to the food. I know what I would choose. 

This team deserves a giant gold star. I can't say enough good things.
