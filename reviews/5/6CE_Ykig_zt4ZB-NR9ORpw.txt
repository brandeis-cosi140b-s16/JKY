We just LOVE this place! My husband and I come once a week. The staff is great and the food is amazing! Authentic Mexican for sure. We love the carne asada. Love the chips and salsa. The coconut margarita is a must-have! 

The owner works the bar and is great. The place is super clean, which is always nice. For real authentic Mexican on this side of town, La Unica is the spot. Nice patio and lots of TV's too.
