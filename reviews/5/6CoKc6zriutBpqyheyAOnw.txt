Fantastic! Probably The Best cocktail menu I've come across in the East Valley - not every drink was loaded down with sweet sugary/fruity ingredients - even have a chile infused Mezcal which was delicious. Food was great - we had tacos since it was Taco Tuesday and there was a huge variety to choose from, all unique and extremely flavorful. Table side guacamole was excellent and a great sized portion. Everything else we saw going to other tables looked equally good. Our server - Nick was fast, friendly and had great recommendations, he took very good care of us. Price for what you got including quality, speed, and ambience is a great value. Will definitely be back!
