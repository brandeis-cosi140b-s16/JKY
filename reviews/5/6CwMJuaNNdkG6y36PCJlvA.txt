I always ask my Mexican friends for reccommendations on which Mexican restaurants to eat at. One of them told me this place is the best in the valley so I just had to try it. I've been back a dozen times, at least in the last 2 years. The food is always excellent, the service has always been exceptional and the price is right. I love the HUGE amount of chips they bring to snack on while waiting...it makes it so I don't ever have to order an appetizer.
