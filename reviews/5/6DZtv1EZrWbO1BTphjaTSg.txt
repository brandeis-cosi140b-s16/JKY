Espo's continues to impress with the Chili Relleno and the Machaca beef. The green chile in the Relleno was roasted perfectly and the outer masa was crisp that satisfied at the first and last bite. The spicy heat was appropriate to not over power the combined flavors. I'm very pleased to see this place has resurrected. I had such fond memories from high school, because they left a void that couldn't be filled.
