I have been eating here since I was about two years old. The waiters are friendly and helpful and have all been working there for quite some time. Going into the restaurant is like going into a family's home and having dinner with them. 

The food is amazing and well priced. Their combo dinners are HUGE and I often can't finish them. They also have some of the best salsa in the world. Locally owned and operated.

Try it.
