ooooooooooooomg

so freaking good its ridiculous. 

forget any other place that ends in "erto's" unless its 3am.

i have never stopped eating to write a review. but this is incredible. this place can be missed very quickly as you drive by, but look for it across from fry's.

the family staff is awesome. very nice. and cute to boot.

i tried the carne quesadilla. aaaaaaand i'm in love. highly suggest it.
