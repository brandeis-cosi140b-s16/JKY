The food always speaks for itself...awesome! But I was much more impressed by the customer service. I am Gluten-Free, and made a request for a large order to be gluten free...during the dinner-time rush hour. The line of about 4 people behind me grew to about 50 people, but the Chipotle crew ensured my gluten-free meal by exchanging all utensils and doing everything else they could to make sure that none of my food came in contact with anything that could have had prior contact with gluten. Despite my order taking about 15 minutes to be completed (because securing a gluten free environment in a restaurant can be pain-stakeningly difficult), the whole crew had nothing but smiles and kindness toward me. I was very impressed and think that all of them definitely deserve raises for such great customer service. Give your business to people who are happy to give good service!
