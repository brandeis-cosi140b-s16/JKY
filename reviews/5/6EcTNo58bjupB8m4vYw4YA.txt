I'm super glad there is another great taco shop in the airpark! I went on a Tuesday when they have a $5 lunch combo special. That stuff is an awesome price and a lot of food. I also got a bean, rice, and cheese burrito just so I could try it. It was really good too. They have really yummy tortillas, they are as good as they look. I'd recommend not trying all that food in one sitting like I did, but instead visit the place a few times if you need to try all the things. If you're like me you'll get too full from all that food. 

Anyways, I can't wait to go back and get too full again!
