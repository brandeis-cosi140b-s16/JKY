Wow the staff is amazing here! We parked and walked to the door and it swung open just as we reached it and the female employee smiled and held it open for us. She did say she loved our car, haha, maybe just getting a closer look. :)

Great, friendly people, personal, "local" stuff on the walls. All in all a success at pulling a local flare into an international chain.

The very best Taco Bell I've been in ever.
