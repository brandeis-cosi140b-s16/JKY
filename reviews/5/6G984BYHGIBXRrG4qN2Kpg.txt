Don't accept the reviews. This place has since closed and re-opened. 

Phenomenal service. Never have I ever seen a bartender so kind as Jill. She seriously makes coming here a good time. 

The specials are always good. And pirates fans get great deals during games. $1 tacos on Tuesdays? How can you beat it? 

The house of Mexicans is one of the best spots in Dormont. It's not trashy like Vasta, but not too pricey like Cains. It's just perfect. 

Love it. Get the guacamole. It's made in house. It'll make you sour cream your pants.
