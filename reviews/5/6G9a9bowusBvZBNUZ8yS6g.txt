Eaten here numerous times & the ONLY bad thing I can say is the service at the beginning can be slow but after that they make up for it in spades.  Tara M. has pretty much said it all & I agree with her, I'll add the shrimp/Crab enchiladas are freakin' sweet!  And I had the Carne Asada burrito & it was yummy and a little TOO big.

Bring your appetite with you & try a Mojito here too, tasty beverage!
