Always, always, always my first pick for food at Downtown Container Park. I'm not Mexican myself but I sure do love my Mexican food! I've tried a bunch of their tacos and flautas and always order elote (Mexican style corn) and haven't been disappointed. The quality of their ingredients taste incredible fresh and always well prepared. 

It's slightly more expensive than what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant but it is in Container Park after all. Regardless, it's well worth the price and always a good eat when you're in the mood for Mexican food.
