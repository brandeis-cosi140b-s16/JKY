Wow, so good.   We ordered ceviche, the Kissi sushi roll, a taco combo with a mix of tacos, and hochata.   The service was fabulous, very helpful and attentive.  The tacos were great; the shredded beef being my favorite.  The salsas are flavorful.  The ceviche is classic and perfect.  The sushi was fun (although fried sushi is not my favorite sushi style, it was still good).  Their charro beans were great.  Even the horchata was impressive; obviously home-made.  I used to work in El Paso; the tacos and salsas here remind me of what I would get there.  It is surprisingly difficult to find really good tacos in Phoenix, so this is a gem.  Next time I will probably order all tacos, as they were really incredible.  Would be ideal for takeout. The atmosphere is really basic; this is a simple taco shop.  They put their energy into the food, not the decor.  Worth repeat visits.
