This place was absolutely rocking last night! My group and I dressed up to attend the Zombie Carnival and enter the costume contest. We played Sandbar Jenga that was made for GIANTS out of sliced 2x4's, popped some balloons on the dart board to win prizes and received all of our first drinks on the house! This is my 5th time coming here for the night life and I love how this place is totally relaxed and spacious. In that sense I mean, there are always plenty of people to keep a great vibe going all night long, but I don't bump into them every 5 seconds or get drinks spilled on me. 
It's a win-win!

I agree the dance floor is super small, but why do you need that? You can dance anywhere! 

They always have cheap drink specials $2, $3 and $5 and offer penny drinks between certain times. It's been a while since I tried the food here, but I remember it being good. 

I love that the outside is part of the inside... or inside part of the outside and they have an all night taco stand.

Oh and I dropped something on the dark floor, Kelli, one of the managers brought me a flashlight right away. I must say she was wonderful and is quite good looking!
