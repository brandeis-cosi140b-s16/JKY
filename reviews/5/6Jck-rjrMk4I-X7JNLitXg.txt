This applies to both the 43rd ave and Olive and the 59th ave and Thunderbird locations. I have eaten at both and food and service are PHENOMENAL. Tonight took the cake though. I called and ordered a meal with a lot of substitutions and silferoto. The gentleman took down the order perfectly and even made suggestions to make the dish better. Great customer service. He then reposted the order to me and confirmed the location. Apparently I had accidentally called the 43rd ave location as it came up first on Google despite the 59th ave location being much closer. I said that I would call them thanked the gentlemen. He then told me not to worry and said they he would call over to them and place my order, telling me I could pick it up in ten minutes at the other location. I went there in the stated ten minutes and the order was just coming out and was perfect. I cannot highly recommend them enough. Best customer service I have ever received and the food is QUALITY. They're affordable as well.
