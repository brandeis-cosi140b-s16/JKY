I must have passed by this place about hundred times every time I hung out on Mill Ave; but it wasn't until Sunday two weeks ago that I finally got a chance to discover yet another eatery gem in Tempe. Since my "great" discovery two weeks ago, I have already been here 3 times total. That means something! 

The cafeteria style fits in with the fiesta/Sun Devils theme decor of the place. You stay in line, order food, then pay. If you happen to order alcoholic beverages as well, the cash register will ID you then ask you to wait right at the counter for your beverages; before you walk away to sit down and wait for your food order no. to be called. 

I came in for Taco Tuesday with an order of 3 crispy tacos: tempura fish, shredded pork and shredded beef. They are all good but my personal favorites are tempura fish and shredded pork - so flavorful and fresh with different spices and textures. The tacos are decent sized topped with queso fresco, shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, and ranch dressing! 
Besides the delicious bites, their variety of magaritas paired with different beer is great hit, also. So far I have tried their Shocker and SunDevilrita and they are both refreshing with just enough amount of alcohol to get your buzz on. They also offer Corona on tap which I often don't see in other places. 

Overall, great place to eat, drink, hang out with your pals, celebrate taco tuesdays, cinco de drinko, or any other random fiestas that your inner party-self wishes. Decent portion and value. The only reason why I gave this place a 4 instead of 5 is I feel that the place could have been a little bit cleaner and brighter.
