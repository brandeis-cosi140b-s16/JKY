Cafe Rio has stepped up there game ... After  several times of bad customer service .. And being out of Chicken, Beef, tortillas and salad dressing..One time I was so furious and just walked out cause nobody seemed to care.  
There is new staff and a new manager. And the last couple of times the service has been great. I haven't had any problem with my orders .. Thank You for making it right. Your Food is Great and I want to continue eating at this Great Restaurant.
