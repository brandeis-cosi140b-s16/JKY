Fantastic! The carne asada California is hands down the best burrito I've ever had in my entire life. If you like Los Favoritos, it's even better! Everything is fresh and the meat is tender and moist. I love everything I've tried, and intend to try more! Best meal for the price in the area for Mexican food
