We love Mexican food and this is our number one go-to Mexican restaurant.  Waiters are attentive and pleasant.  Food is plentiful and served hot.  It is very good.  I don't usually write reviews, but had to leave one when I saw the comments about " average fare". They have great chicken-- pulled breast meat.  They have great fajitas and burrito grande.  Highly recommend.
