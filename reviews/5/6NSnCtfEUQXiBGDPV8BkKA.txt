Andale is exactly what is claims to be, fresh food. Meaning you may have to wait a little longer than you would at Roberto's, but it will be worth every second. This place is a mom & pop, hole in the wall at its finest! You order rolled tacos, then you watch her roll your tacos. Same thing with the shrimp cocktail, I watched her cut up the veggies right in front of me. Everything I have tried from here has been above average, and I have NOT even dined in the place yet.
Last time I was there, they gave me chips and salsa even though I was waiting for a take out order. The girl working the front always warns me if the salsa is spicy or not. (which I appreciate because I love me some spice!) And they even offer a couple not so common dishes, such as bistec ranchero, and heuvos platanos fritos. (both of those I highly recommend btw) However, if you want to stick to basic tacos or enchiladas you can't go wrong there either. 
The location is hidden, and they are not open late. But if you can manage to find the place and don't mind funky hours, I promise you'll have a new favorite local taco shop.
