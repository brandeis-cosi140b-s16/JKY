I've been to the original location and this one does not disappoint either. I ordered the apple cider margarita, which didn't skimp on the tequila, and the al pastor burrito with green sauce. Probably the best burrito I've had in a while. Free chips, salsa and bean dip are always a positive. And the restaurant staff were friendly and extremely attentive. Definitely will be going back!
