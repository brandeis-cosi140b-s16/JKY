This place is good! Even with the restaurant being busy we got our food out pretty quick. The portions are great and you can't beat the prices, we had a large group with a couple of separate tickets 4 on each ticket and no one paid over $30 you can't beat that! You get free ice cream with your meal which is really good and the service is super friendly and welcoming!!! We had a great dinner out! The only problem we had was having to hear a table very loudly complain about EVERYTHING the staff was so professional, I would of tossed them out, but they handled it very well, and once they left we enjoyed the rest of dinner! You can't please everyone. They definitely gained a couple return visitors from our party!
