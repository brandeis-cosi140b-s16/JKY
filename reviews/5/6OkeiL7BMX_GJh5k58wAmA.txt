I love El Sol! I used to work at a little bar across the street that got all of their fresh tortillas from here. That was back when they were only a bakery. They now have a full menu of Mexican food also, and they cook as well as they bake. We often stop for breakfast and you can taste the fresh baked tortilla that I remember from years ago wrapped into a gigantic breakfast burrito.  It's clean and the people at the counter are beyond friendly. Thank you El Sol
