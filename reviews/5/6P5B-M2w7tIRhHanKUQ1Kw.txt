As far as Chiplotle's go, this one's on point. The place is clean and the staff has been friendly every time I've been. The quality is generally consistent and they know how to get through a line quickly! This place fills up since it's so close to the outlet mall but because of that you know you're getting fresh food.  A lot of the time the chicken that's on the grill while you're in line is the chicken that goes into your bowl when its your turn to order. Half chicken half barbacoa tacos with guac are my favorite!
