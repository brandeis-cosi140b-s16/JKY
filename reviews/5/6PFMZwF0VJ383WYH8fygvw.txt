I'm tellin ya. This is the best seafood mexican in phoenix . Grab a chilada and some seafood molcajete in the Vesuvius lava bowl. The fish and shrimp tacos are super, the margaritas are big and bold. Gets busy, and the location is away in a corner, but well worth it. This place is on my where to eat in Phoenix listing...
