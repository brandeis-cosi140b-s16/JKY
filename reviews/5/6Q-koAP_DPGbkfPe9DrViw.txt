wow!  after reading the other lackluster reviews I had to wonder if we ate at the same place!  I used to eat at the original Raul & Theresa's when I lived in the valley back in the 80s.  My hubby and I happened to notice this one on Litchfield and decided to give it a try.  We were VERY impressed with EVERYTHING!  The salsa was very fresh and really tasty.  Our server was excellent!  He brought us a small bowl of the Theresa's special and their green chile to try.  The meat in both, was so incredibly tender that it just fell apart when we tried to pick it up with a fork and both were VERY flavorful.  i opted for a combo that included an enchilada and a green chile burro and was NOT disappointed.  The spanish rice was delish.  My husband had a combo that included 2 cheese enchiladas, a beef tamale, and a taco.  The taco wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either.  The beef tamale was great, though.  The beef had a great taste to it and there was plenty of it (unlike a tamale he'd had before at another mexican food restaurant where he had to "hunt" for signs of meet inside the tamale).  The waiter had mentioned that he had a "surprise" for my husband.  I figured that meant he was going to give him a little sample of their desserts or something like he had with their entrees but what he'd done is replace one of the cheese enchiladas with a green chile enchilada because my husband expressed how delicious it was.  Talk about going above and beyond!  We will definitely go back!
