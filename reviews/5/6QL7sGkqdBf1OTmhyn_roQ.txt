I stumbled upon this restaurant a few days ago and had to try it.  I stopped in and browsed the menu and it looks like they have many delicious options.  However, I didn't want to get anything heavy, just something to munch on and decided to get a few empanadas for myself and the family.  The empanadas were good and really STUFFED with meat (chicken or ground beef) and cheese, but the price was high.  Each one was just under $4.00.  I obviously knew what the price was before I placed my order, but I decided to get the empandas anyway.  I really enjoyed them and thought they were very good, but of all the items on the menu, I thought the empanadas were overpriced, everything else seemed priced alright.  Maybe I'm just used to paying $1.00 for empanadas like I did in NY, but I bought them knowing the price and I liked them.  I'll be back...
