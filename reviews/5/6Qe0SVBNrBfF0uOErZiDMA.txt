This restaurant is amazing! Ordered the quesadillas from the appetizer menu... They were delicious. My friend ordered the street tacos entree and they ended up giving her the appetizer but our waitress was nice enough to get her her sides and only charged for the appetizer. Would definitely go back! Great service and great food!
