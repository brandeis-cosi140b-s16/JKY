Live in Miami. Was in Charlotte and had a recommendation from someone in Miami that if I ever go back to Charlotte I had to come here. I eat a lot of fish tacos. I typically don't delve into the realm of baja(breaded) and didn't here either. The tortillas for the blackened fish tacos were amazing. Made me a believer. I am moving to charlotte on June 1 and you better believe this will be one of my first stops on the checklist every week!
