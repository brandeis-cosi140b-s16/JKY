$4 breakfast burritos the size of Pringles cans.

You know what you're getting yourself into when you come to this place.  I did, at least.  Super Burrito provides cheap food in obscene quantities to dudes on their lunch, people looking to sop up booze at midnight, and people who love to watch Spanish soap operas on a 10 inch flat screen.

I love Super Burrito.
