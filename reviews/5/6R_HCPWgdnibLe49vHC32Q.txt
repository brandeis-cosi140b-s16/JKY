I took my family to eat breakfast at this place this morning, and I've got to say that it was awesome!  I had the #1 special, that also came with a fideo soup, which was also amazing, so much so, that my son also ordered another bowl of it, after he ate his soft taco plate.  A must visit gem when in Vegas for awesome enchiladas.
