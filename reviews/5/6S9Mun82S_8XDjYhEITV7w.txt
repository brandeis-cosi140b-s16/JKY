I always enjoy visiting Leticia's. I love that they're located in my area. 

I especially enjoy going in the fall because they have outdoor seating. 

The food is always good. Typical menu...  I don't usually order margaritas, but I do enjoy them here. Their soup is always good. 

The service is friendly and the server comes by frequently. 

Worth checking out.
