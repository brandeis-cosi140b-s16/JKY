One of the better quick serve burrito joints in town. Under 7 bucks for a large burro with a huge number of ingredients included, except for good ole guacamole. Plus it is all white meat and not just chunks, they have a chicken machaca version which is excellent. Grilled onions are also new and the medium salsa is not hot, but adds a great flavor to the burro. You can also get queso for free in there if your a glutton, but overall a great value and quality ingredients, but no chips included. This is the mall location - no salsa bar.
