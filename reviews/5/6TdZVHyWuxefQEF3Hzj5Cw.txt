The food here is outstanding -- you can order any dish as spicy as you like, so those of you complaining, you are not asking for the right things! Ask for the tomatillo salsa, it is spicy and delicious!

Also the chips & salsa are FREE + bottomless. I think they changed the menu over the last week since they opened.

You wouldn't guess it for a Mexican food place, but the burger is tasty, crunchy on the outside and plenty of avocado. For a traditional dish, try the carne asada tacos, the meat is tender and well marinated!

Overall, the bar menu is fantastic -- love the Strawberry jalapeno margarita with agave nectar and the selection of beers! 

Happy to see a Mexican restaurant at the Biltmore!
