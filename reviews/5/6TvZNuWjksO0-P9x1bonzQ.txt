I always like to find a local independent restaurant when visiting a city, International House of Food was worth going across town for. Our waitress was very friendly and the service couldn't have been better. We ordered from the Mexican food, I ordered what our waitress suggested " juarache " and I was very pleased, every thing was fresh and hit the spot. Next time we go I would like to try the Chinese cuisine it looked great.
