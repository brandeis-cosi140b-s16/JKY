I couldn't be happier because they opened a Filibertos less than a mile from me.

Who needs an Egg McMufffin when you can get the best egg, bacon and cheese burrito around at Filibertos Drive Thru window.

Every once in a while, i get a big machaca plate breakfast to take to work and split it with my 2 teammates.  Breakfast for 3, and only about $6!

I have also noticed that the people who work at this location are especially nice and attentive.
