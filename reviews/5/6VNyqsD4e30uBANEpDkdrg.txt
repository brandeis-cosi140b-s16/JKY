Love this place and the location on Central Ave.  There fresh lime margaritas are dream worthy. The enchiladas  are the best!!  A friend who was in the peace corp. told me their Mol√© sauce was the most authentic that they have had outside of South America and Central America. My favorite appetizers are the guacamole and the cheese dip with meat.  Both great with their  house seasoned tortilla chips.
