This Roberto's is the best Roberto's in Vegas. The lady that works weekdays behind the grill has got to be the patron saint of Mexican Food. 

There seems to be a Roberto's every three blocks in Vegas (which is ok with me) but this one always has fresh food and consistent portions. They always cook fresh.. some Robertos will pull pre-cooked food out of a pan when you order something.

I come here at least three times a week. They have Chicken Nuggets for my son who is going through the "Peanut butter, Peperoni, Chicken Nugget" phase of his life.. I hope it is a phase...

It's also super clean. I see them cleaning/recleaning all the time.
