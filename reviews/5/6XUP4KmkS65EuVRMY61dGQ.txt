I'm totally biased towards Salsarita's, but I just love it!  I used to go once a week when I lived around the corner.  I just love the chicken they use in their tacos. 

Also, I love their chips and queso.  Their queso is creamy and not too spicy, and they put a special seasoning on their chips that is very tasty!

Definitely pick it over Qdoba, Tijuana Flats, or any of those other places!
