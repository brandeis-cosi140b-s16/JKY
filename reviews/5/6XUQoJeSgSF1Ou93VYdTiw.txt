The boyfriend and I work odd hours so we will make a stop here anywhere between 11pm - 430am. 

The service has always been awesome, and the food has always been good. Maybe it's the difference in shifts?? 

I will agree to the greasiness, but that's kind of expected for a hole in the wall place. Our usual is the chorizo and egg burrito, like someone said its a good portion.
