The food here is absolutely delicious!  We visited Phoenix from MD and happened on this gem our last night and didn't regret our decision.  The staff was friendly.  The salsa and chips fresh.  The margarita strong and flavorful.  The food delivered fast, fresh, and delicious.  I had the enchiladas with sunny side up eggs with shredded beef.  I don't usually like shredded beef b/c it's usually too tough.  Anaya's was tender and I couldn't believe it was beef!  I'm known to be a slow eater, but I was done before everyone at my table.  I definitely recommend this hidden place to everyone who is visiting the Phoenix, Glendale, Scottsdale area.
