Came here today and had a great experience! 
The best part is they have Gluten Free options for their burgers, and I don't mean a burger wrapped in lettuce! The buns they use are so delicious! I couldn't tell it was Gluten Free....  They didn't charge extra for the bun either!
The fries are hand cut and made fresh to order!
It reminded of being at In and Out Burger only 100 times better!!! 
Next time I will try the Tacos which are also Gluten Free since they use 100% corn tortillas.
The owners and employees were very pleasant and helpful! So excited to have you in the neighborhood! I will be back very soon!
