Authentic Mexican food in Charlotte!  Not easy to find. The guacamole is made fresh to order and tastes as good as you'd expect. The tacos are great; I really like their chorizo. This is the first time I've found elote in Charlotte!  Corn with cheese and chili. Tres leches cake and flan are both great choices.
