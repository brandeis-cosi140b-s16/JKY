Good Mexican food is hard to come by in Madison.

I had lost all hope when I visited multiple "Mexican" restaurants and they put velveeta cheese on everything.  Then I ate at Taqueria Guadalajara and I am so happy that I did!  The food is amazing, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and I am happy to report that they use non-synthetic cheese. Score!

I usually get the Burrito Mexicano or chicken tacos, but anything on the menu is sure to satisfy you and won't break your budget.  

I feel like I need to get a burrito right now after writing this review! Luckily they do take-out.  :)
