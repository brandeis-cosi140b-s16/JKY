This place is sooo good. Such a fresh concept. This is where I will go if I crave sushi but don't want to have a whole sit down dinner for it. The fish is fresh, the ginger is yummy, and the prices are decent. There's a cool rice pressor machine to give you a thin layer of sushi rice in your jaburrito and another cool roller machine to make sure your roll is nice and tight. 

The only thing is the rice pressor machine is the limiting factor. The wait a quite long for a process that should be pretty quick. 

Today we tried the Rockport and Redondo. Go for the Rockport! Its so yummy! Flavor is great and spicy too. Redondo is good for you sashimi lovers as there is fresh chunks of fish. 

Also, service is great. They are nice and explain things if you don't understand. My fav sushi chef, nunu, which transferred from Soho is here too! Makes me sad that he's not at Soho, but that's OK.
