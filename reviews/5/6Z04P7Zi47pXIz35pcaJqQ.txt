This is a great little Mexican place... Very authentic. No indoor seating, but plenty of picnic tables under a covered patio.  The owners are building a new restaurant across the street that already looks very grand, even though it has not even been completed yet.  The new restaurant will have the same quality and lots of indoor seating and even live music on the weekends. 

Definitely give this place a try if you are out in the Queen Creek area.
