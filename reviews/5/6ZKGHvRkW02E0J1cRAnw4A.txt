Do you have a good taco in your life? If the answer is no, you should really find one. They're great to have around. Tasty, savory, delicious tacos. YUM....

And I have so many different tacos in my life. I don't care about the argument of what is authentic or not. Maybe it's that I've lived in Western PA my whole life, but you know what? I'm okay with that. Because my taste buds dance when they hit my lips!

So El Burro. My latest love affair! It's easy to love considering I love their sister restaurant, Cantina in Lawrenceville. But something is different. Maybe it's that I can actually see my taco (considering it's so freakin' dark in Cantina!). Maybe it's that they seem a little bigger. Or a little more thought thrown into them. I don't know... but they may have been even better!

I ordered the shrimp tacos in a pair for $8 and they were just fresh and grilled perfectly. With incredible corn tortillas. Drool. Best decision I made (along with my taco choice) was getting the chips, salsa and gauc. Oh man. It's a huge portion! I took everything home and ate it again the next day! Happy Birthday to me (note, it's not actually my birthday, but it felt that good!).
