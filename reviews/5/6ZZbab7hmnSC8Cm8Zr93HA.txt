Visit Sammy.. She's usually running the outside bar.  Very bubbly, upbeat, and happy to see everybody all the time... like she loves her job!  Very popular bar for sports (there's a ton of tv's), good food, good staff, overall great environment.  There's an inside and outside bar which makes it pretty unique.  It's my favorite bar to watch football games at.  Don't know why it's 2.5 star... definitely better than that. May not be a 5 in all eyes but it's not a 2 or a 3. See for yourself
