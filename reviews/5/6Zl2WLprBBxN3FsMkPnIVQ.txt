Drove in from deep south texas...stopped by during vacation route...super staff, excellent service, fantastic bartender..and the food was excellent. We had the enchiladas verdes, the street tacos and the nachos nortenos...everything was excellent. The pineapple mojito...to die for!  They also have great local craft beers. The small cozy feel was great. .. loved, loved, loved this place!!! Five stars!!!
