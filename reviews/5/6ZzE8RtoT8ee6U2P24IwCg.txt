Found this little gem because the bf and I didn't want to wait an hour for the Sunrise Cafe. It's just around the corner and doesn't disappoint! I got the steak and egg burrito...I'm from SoCal and this is by far the BEST breakfast burrito I've had. The green salsa is a perfect match (mild and tangy with a hint of some type of vinegar). The chips are the real deal...the kind that are crunchier and thicker, also pair well with the burrito. It's way off the strip but I'd come back for sure...it will def cure any hangover!!!
