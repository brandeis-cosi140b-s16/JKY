Have been here a few times with my gf and it's such a great experience each time. The staff is SO friendly, food is great. They are more than happy to tweak the menu for vegetarians and let you substitute anything you want instead of meat! Yeah there's no salsa bar, get over it. They have amazing pico and the same two salsas that amados and filibertos have so I'm not sure why people who frequent those places complain. Their tortillas are fresh and soft unlike the other two places mentioned who may as well wrap their burritos with printer paper. Lol love this place!!!
