5 stars for service. They treat you like gold here. The price is fantastic. I LOVE the salsa and you get it free with a nice set of perfectly salted chips. Great options for vegetarians which always scores brownie points in my book. Los Cabos is a formidable addition to a block that already includes greats like Brillo Box and Taste of India.
