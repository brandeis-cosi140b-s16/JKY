Having eaten at many Mexican restaurants in our day, including some in the casinos and some stand-alones off and away from the casinos such as this one and Lindo Michoac√°n, and Donna Rosa's, this place has by far the best Mexican food in all of Las Vegas.  The only downside: it's location--in the no man's land between the strip and downtown.  However, it is totally and completely worth the trip!!  The place gets busy at lunch time, and I've seen police eating in there more than once so it never has felt unsafe to us, nor have we ever had any problems with bums or thugs, or anything like that.  

On this trip, I ate the guacamole tostadas, my wife had a combo of taco & enchilada with rice & beans, my daughter ate a burrito.  All were excellent, and well worth the $10 per plate.

The first reviewer should've driven down the strip to Taco Bell if gut-grenading fast food is what was sought.  El Sombrero is a restaurant, not a drive through.  On the issue of time, the wait has never been more than what you'd expect, and never two hours.  The food is way above par.  Try it yourself and see!  Every weekday the place gets very busy at lunch time with locals from the downtown justice & office centers eating there.  If it's so bad, how'd it stay in business for so many decades?   Other than the location, the first reviewer got everything else wrong.  The place is Great!

El Sombrero is well worth the trip!
