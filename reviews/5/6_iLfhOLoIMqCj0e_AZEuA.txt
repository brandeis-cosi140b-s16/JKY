I was very excited when I heard they were making a Carlos O'Brien's near me! We go at least once a week, especially for their happy hour $3.50 margaritas. The waitress and owner recognize us and give us great service every time we go in. We typically order the #1 (beef taco and cheese enchilada plate) every time we go and we are satisfied every time. I love how they give you cups of water when you first arrive too. Most restaurants don't do that anymore. Their chips and salsa are really good! I love theirs beans because most restaurants completely taste like canned beans and most of all, I love how much cheese they put on everything! I'm a big fan of Popo's Fiesta Del Sol Restaurant and in my opinion, Carlos' ranks right up there with them.
