So I got into town looking for something different.  I saw this restaurant and turned around and wow was I surprised.  Started with the Tomato Soup which was freaking awesome.  A little spicy but not too much.  Then the tacos arrived.  Delicious I really liked them.  

The staff was great really friendly.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
