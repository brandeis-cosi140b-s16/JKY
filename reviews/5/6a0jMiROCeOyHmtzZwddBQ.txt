Richardson's is one of my top picks in the valley.  This place has the best New Mexico cuisine I've tried so far, but I have to admit, the only place I've ever eaten at that was actually in NM was Taco Cabana, which is a fast food favorite of mine.

We went for brunch today and their breakfast/brunch menu is fantastic.  We had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, two eggs, rice, and beans.  It was enough food for two of us to split and leave feeling very satisfied.  Their bloody mary's are great, and at only five bucks apiece, are not a budget killer.  Also, they come with a cool little beer chaser - I think it was Dos Equis or Tecate, I can't remember which.

All told, we spent $23.00 plus tip.  It was a very nice way to start our weekend.

Oh, one other Richardson's tip - they always have specials posted on the boards, and although they tend to be pricey (think high 20's to $30.00 for dinner) they are WORTH IT!!  I don't usually order a special unless I really feel like spending money on food....but they're a great treat every once in a while.
