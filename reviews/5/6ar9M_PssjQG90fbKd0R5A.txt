Love this place, a Vegas tradition. Have been to it several times. The chips are great. The toasted cheese tortilla (tct's to those in the know) are great. The burritos tasty, the fajitas great. The salad dressing, WOW, what's in it? The generous portions, the frijoles are super. Have tried many differant items over the years & never disliked anything. Well worth it anytime. Better service than other locations.
