My husband and I went to the Motown Review at Santa Fe Station last week and had dinner at Cabo prior to the show. I was amazed at the customer service! These folks are fast and engaged. Chips and 3 types of Salsa and drinks at our table within 5 min. I had the crispy tacos, they were sooo good! My husband was very happy with his meal as well. Can't wait to go back! What a great neighborhood establishment!!! The Hostess on duty, I think her name was Katherine, she was definitely customer oriented. She made sure everybody was happy and stopped to chat for a few minutes. I love this place! Thanks for making our night so special!!!
