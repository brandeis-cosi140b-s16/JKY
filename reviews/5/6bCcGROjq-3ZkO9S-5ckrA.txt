This is my favorite Mexican in Charlotte. Both locations are good, but this particular one is my favorite. Whether I'm looking for an inexpensive date night (combo 3 with 3 chimichangas and the AMAZING queso sauce is plenty big enough to share) or a good spot to check out with friends, this is the perfect pick.
