El Rico's is one of my favorite local restaurants. It's very close by and I love the way they have laid out the outside and upper floor. My girlfriend and I have gone here a few times and each time the food has been great and we have had plenty to eat. Their prices are reasonable and you can eat for nearly the same price you could at any fast-food joint. At night, the whole place really lights up and transforms the mood. Since it's out in the countryside, the stars can be seen at night and during the day, the Santan Mountains can be seen from the many windows. 

The staff are also on the spot, several times we finished the chip bowl and they had a new one to us just as we finished each of them. The salsa is great and you can really tell that it's authentic Mexican style. Plus, when our food arrived we were very surprised to see how much you get for the price. I got the chicken quesadilla and the cheese and chicken tasted fantastic. The few times we have gone there, we always needed a box to take home the remainder of our portions. 

If you enjoy a good date, I recommend going during the night; the whole environment changes from their well laid out lighting. Right now the weather is perfect to enjoy stargazing outside while enjoying some delicious food. 
If you are interested in taking a group, they can accommodate you with everything up to fine dining with candle light. The second story gives an alternative view to the Santan Mountains and the surrounding area. 

The only disappointment I had was their lack of waiting service. However, after you order at the counter they do bring you you're food and make sure everything is enjoyable and tasting great. I heard that they may be adding waiting service in the near future however, either way it is still a great place that's both visually and tastefully stunning.
