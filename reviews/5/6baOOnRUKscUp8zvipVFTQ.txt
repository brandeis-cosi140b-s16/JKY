Qdoba is the best! In my opinion, they're way better than Chipotle and the staff is always so friendly. A lot of times I've gone here after class for lunch and the line has been pretty long, but I never find myself waiting for longer than 5 minutes because the staff is so quick and efficient. 

In addition, their queso dip is phenomenal!! They have a few different kinds, although I always just get their three cheese queso as it's delicious and my favorite burrito bowl topping. Their guacamole is pretty good too and the nice plus is that they don't charge a ridiculous $2 fee like Chipotle does for theirs. This place is definitely one of my favorite places to get lunch after or before class.
