This is by far my family's favorite restaurant.  The service is always excellent and the food is consistantly outstanding.  My husband and kids love the green sauce (I'm a red sauce girl), their tamales are delicious and enchiladas to die for.  Not the greasy food you get in some Mexican dives.  The refried beans are how I judge any other place I try and none ever stand up to theirs.  The white dip that comes with the chips is crave worthy.  Don't even get me started on the mouth-watering Sopapillas.  Yum!
