I don't care that this is a chain. They have, hands down, the best chips and salsa I've had at any Mexican restaurant. I would love to buy a tub of that salsa. All of the menu items I've tried there have been amazing. I usually go for the enchiladas, but I've been super impressed by the fajitas, and most recently, a vegetable quesadilla that was parmesan encrusted - somewhat odd sounding, but soooo good. It's always friendly service, and they're very accommodating. The prices are good as well.
