Delicious! Went in on a Friday afternoon, ordered a pork burrito lunch special, for $8 I got a huge burrito, chips and salsa, and a canned soda. Was so excited when I heard they had a standalone shop, as I would normally frequent them at the local farmer's markets. Hope they're here to stay since their food is delicious and the service is awesome.
