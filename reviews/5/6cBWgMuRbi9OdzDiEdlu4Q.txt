Omg these are the best carne asada tacos in Mesa, Az I have had. I have had many tacos in Az & Mexico and these are pretty darn good! I rather eat here then a fancy restaurant. They put a good size of meat on each tacos plus they have a free salsa bar with pico de gallo, avocado salsa, green salsa, red salsa, cucumbers, and jalape√±os. A good combination with the carne asada tacos is a horchata drink. I also like to get their quesadilla with carne asada inside. They have seating inside and out which are clean.
