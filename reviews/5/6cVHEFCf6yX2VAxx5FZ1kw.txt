This place catered a tailgate for the ND - ASU game last weekend, and I can say with 100% certainty that they are the best tacos I've had in my life. The meats are cut in a way that allows you to put just enough on the taco, and the juices don't bleed through. Oh yeah and the meats are salted perfectly. I had 9 tacos, and though I don't live in the area would consider stopping by just for a lunch! The employees are super friendly and really enjoyed the time - this was an unforgettable taco experience! I want some now...
