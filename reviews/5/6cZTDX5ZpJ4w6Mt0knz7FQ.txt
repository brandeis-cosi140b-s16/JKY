4.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because it's a good day :)...here's what we grubbed on @ El Mission:
*Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze- get it! My favorite thing on the menu
*Grilled street corn: bueno, but not quite as good as the street grilled variety in Mexico 
*Lamb rib appetizer- fatty and not too much meat...but the good bits we're awesome!
*Mahi Mahi tacos- decent, but save the fish tacos for another time and place!
*Espresso churros & milkshake- a tasty and fun dessert...couldn't taste the espresso, but it was fun to dip those crunchy morsels!

Our server was also very knowledgeable - will definitely be returning to the Mission!
