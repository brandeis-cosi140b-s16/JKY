Cesar was an excellent waiter with amazing service, and we are from Chicago and would only dream to experience some of the most amazing
Mexican flair in our city. hands down all of the excellent reviews are accurate,
And the prior weaker reviews I would challenge...everything we had was
Outstanding!
