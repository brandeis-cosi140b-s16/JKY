Ah, Fiesta Cafe.

You do not deserve all five stars on food alone, but there are so many additional factors.

First off, Fiesta Cafe is a flagrantly ridiculous adobe structure, looking as if it was transplanted straight from the American Southwest into the midst of First Street in Champaign.  Ridiculous.  Awesome.  Hilarious.

Next, the service is fast, friendly, and the food delicious.  I ordered the chilequiles, which I'm a bit particular about.  I also wanted them with scrambled eggs, which seemed odd and self-indulgent, but they did it PERFECTLY.  And I was delighted.  The food was great, and i was pleasantly surprised as I thought it'd suck or be midwesternly bland.

Finally, as I left the patio, full and happy, i stopped and looked about.  There are a plethora of flags, American, Mexican, Peace, LGBT Rainbow, a whole plethora of flagtasticness.  'Twas nice to see a cool, friendly environment.

So, in conclusion: Ridiculous pueblo, frighteningly good chilequiles, flagtasticness, wondrous service.  I was delighted.
