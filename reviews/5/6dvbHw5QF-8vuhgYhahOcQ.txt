This place is so great and the owner couldn't have been nicer! We just moved to the area (less than one mile from the restaurant) and the owner shook our hands and welcomed us here! Everyone seemed to know one another, calling each other by their first names. Oh, and the food we ordered was really tasty as well! Needless to say we are thrilled to live by such a gem of a place!
