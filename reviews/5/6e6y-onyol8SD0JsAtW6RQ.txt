Ate dinner here for my dad's birthday. Service was excellent and so was the food. They serve bean dip and salsa with chips both were very yummy. Their margaritas are excellent. 

I had a green pork burrito with beans and rice. Everything was super tasty. My daughter had the cheese crisp extravaganza which she loves...has tons of steak and grilled vegetables. Their Polo Fundito is also excellent, the cream cheese sauce is perfect, not too hot. Really didn't have anything bad. Servings are huge so you will have leftovers for lunch the next day!! 

There is a lovely outdoor patio that would be really nice when the weather is cooler. 

Will definitely be back soon!!
