I have been coming to Vegas for several years. I'm in Henderson this time. This Roberto's is the best I have been to for sure. I have been to at least 3 maybe up to 5 others. I got the machaca burrito and carnitas taco. Delicious. $7.30 was all it cost. Get 2 red and 2 green sauces and grub out. You will not be disappointed. Wow!!!!! Good s..t.
