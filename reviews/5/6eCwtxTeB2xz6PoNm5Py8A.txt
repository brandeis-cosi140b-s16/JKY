Since I've been to this location 10 times this Spring semester, I thought I should write a review. 

The food here is amazing. The steak they serve is unlike any other and has an extraordinary taste. My friend gets the steak every single time because it is GREAT! It is sweet and cooked to perfection 

My personal favorite is the Kalua Pig. I get this in my burrito every time. It is tender and on par or BETTER thanbsome of the best Hawaiian restaurants in Vegas. 

I met the owner today and he is a great guy! He made our burrito and bowl and you can tell he is a great owner! 

I would recommend this to anyone any day of the week. And please DO NOT forget the coconut bark as this is what I hope is in Heaven when I die!

Go BRADDAH'S!!!!
