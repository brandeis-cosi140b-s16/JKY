Went here on a whim after passing by. Super happy we did. My husband had Carne Asada tacos , I had the Pastor they were amazing! My husband is supppppper picky about Mole. I make him try it everywhere we go for the past 14 years . Never found a good one till now! Amazing!!! But the most incredible thing for me was the Horchata holy good lord I loved it. I will be stopping by just to get that on my way home from work on many occasions. The waiters were a bit shy but very attentive without being annoying. I will defiantly be bringing everyone I know here!
