So I have to confess, I've driven by this place since it opened but haven't had the urge to stop. When I do it's usually to Babbo next door but today I did and I have to say I'm glad I did. The place is upscale casual and you order at the register and they bring you the food. The place is super clean and staff was friendly. I asked the gal who took my order what was popular since its my first visit and I went with her first choice, chimichanga!  I got the shredded beef with real guacamole, sour cream, beans & rice. They have a great salsa bar and all the hot sauces were great too. Even the beans were a hit which is a good test if a place is going to be good Mexican.  It is definitely Americanized but a nice place to have a quick bite. Sorry Babbo, you have a run for your money when I park in this lot.
