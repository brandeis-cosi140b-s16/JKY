WOW!! I was in this neighborhood today taking the Free CCW Class at the Gun Store and being one that supports Local over National Chains (there is a Taco Bell, Arby's, McDonalds & KFC surrounding this place and I DO NOT Eat Crap Fast Food so it was a No Brainer) So I stopped in and got a Chicken Burrito($6.49) and it was probably one of the best I have EVER had and it was HUGE!! I will be making a special trip to go back (like a REWARD after a long bike ride to the end of the valley) and will have them add a little cheese & sour cream. This burrito was  ALL KILLER & NO FILLER with alot of chicken. I'm so glad they are not closer to my neighborhood because it would be so hard to resist not going there several times a week. TRY IT. Period. 24 hour drive thru
