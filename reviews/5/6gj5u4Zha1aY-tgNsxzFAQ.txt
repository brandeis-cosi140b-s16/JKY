I guess they stepped up heir game .... My boyfriend and I tried the hibachi chicken and it was delicious!  They were friendly and fast.  I totally enjoyed he experience.  You can even pay with a card since most of the food vendors I purchased from had a cube for payment instead of cash.  Super convenient!!
