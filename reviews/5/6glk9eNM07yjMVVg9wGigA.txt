I am 40 years old and have lived in Phoenix my whole life.  I have a passion for discovering new and unique restaurants around the valley.  As a child, I was raised on Jordan's Mexican food every Sunday after church.  I'm an atheist now, but I still frequent Jordan's for their hot sauce, tacos and delicious burritos, chimichangas and cheese crisps.  
I went to Tacos De Juarez for the first time a week ago after a D-backs game.  I ate a pizza at the game, but had to try the food at this place because it looked like a diamond in the rough.  After eating there, I have discovered; it is a diamond.  The food is absolutely amazing! The tacos have shells that are prepared in house, and the salsas are amazing.  I have been there one time since, and am planning on going tomorrow.  I cannot wait to try their selection of mariscos.
