First time visiting this place and it did not disappoint.  We were a party of 4 (all first timers) left very happy and very full.  The food selection was varied and I felt like I could have picked 8-10 options from the menu and been very happy.  We will definitely be going back when we're on that side of the town again.  Great find!
