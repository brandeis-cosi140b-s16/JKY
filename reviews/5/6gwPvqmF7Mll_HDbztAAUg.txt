I've been coming to this Ramiro's since the late 90's. I have always had a great experience when it comes to the food, always so fresh tasing!! The staff is always friendly and smiling and their menudo on the weekends is definitely some of the best around. You can really taste the love and care that goes in to all of the food here.
