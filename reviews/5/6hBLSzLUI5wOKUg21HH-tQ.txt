Been to this location as well as the El Mirage location several times--best chimichanga around. It's pretty authentic. My parents love to go here when I visit. Their $1 margarita happy hour is the best. Can't beat it! The staff is friendly and attentive. The Surprise location is definitely more "toned down" as someone else noted.... I mean, there are a lot of "early bird special-ers" there lol.  Give it a go--you won't be disappointed.
