Everything mentioned by the review below is true. However, it forgets to mention that Mickey's not only offers Bacon, but a choice of Beans, Mayo, Chile, Salsa, cheese, cream, etc. Also, they offer a diverse choice of drinks, mostly inspired by the bottling of down south. Horchata included.

I came here a long time ago after being disappointed by what people know as Tex-Mex?!  Anyways, not important as the pictures do all the talking.

Also, excuse my short and un-insightful review as I really haven't written anything in a good while.
