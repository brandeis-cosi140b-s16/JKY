We were in town for the night and this place came highly recommended.  Boy were they right.  Chips and Salsa were amazing.  Cheese crisp app was great.  There top seller is a chimichanga burro with cream cheese.  Very good.  The owner was a guy named George.  Really nice and he is greek which explains the Gyros burrito which a friend had and said he would never order anything else it was so good.
Indian fry bread with honey and powder sugar.  We will be back on our next trip
