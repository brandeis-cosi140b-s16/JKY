Awesome place to go if you want some good affordable food. It's kind of confusing as to how to order, since the place was completely packed. But basically, there are different lines for different types of meats. It's probably easiest to get friends to stand in each line to get different types of tacos.

I got the carne asada fries ($5 for small portion, $10 for large portion) for which there was no line at all (it's off to the side). I was craving fries hahaha. The rest of my friends got different types of tacos. For the fries themselves were alright, but the toppings were amazing. I would definitely try the fries with adobada (spicy pork) the next time I go and grab a few tacos.
