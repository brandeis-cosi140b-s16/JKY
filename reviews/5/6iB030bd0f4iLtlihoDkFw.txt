I love this place!!!  It has become one of my staple "go-to" places.  The service is great, they are quick, and the food is great!  I love the Don Pedro Burrito...shrimp and chicken in a burrito, covered with cheese, sour cream, and avacado slices (and it's healthy too! LOL).  And the best part is that everything will feed you for at least 2-3 meals, so you have lunch ready for the next day!  In my book, this is a must if you are a Mexican fan.
