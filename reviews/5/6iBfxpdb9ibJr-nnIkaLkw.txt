Things I learned last night:

I love unpretentious yet quality service, in a relaxed atmosphere. (she was awesome)
I don't like drinking ice water without a straw...yeah yeah, turn your nose up. (work on that) 
You can split a bottle of wine between 5 people. (please don't ever make me do that again)
I have a new crush. (restaurants without windows)

Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers. Both delicious; the sauce served with the Calamari tastes distinctively like Pei-Wei's sweet and sour, though that's not a bad thing. Desert was "Death by Chocolate". I had one bite. One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.

All in all a great dining experience. I will be back. Many....many times. They also happen to serve the full Richardson's menu, just the way I remember it. That made the whole table happy although the following is what seals the deal for me:

* Sorry we do not provide high chairs or booster seats *

yes, it's love.... without the constant arguing :)
