My favorite Tacos place. Sure, I visit here so often, sometime everyday lol.  I agree taste is not always the same, varie time by time, day by day, but still My Toco place.  Reasonable price and good portion of food, drive-through available, and 24/7 YAY!  
I love the Carnitas Tacos although sometime not as great as tasty one.  I appreciate the  Tuesday special Tacos though sometime too much (sesami?) oil on it. I also like their breakfast burrito, bacon & potato burrito too. Considering Taste, Price, Location and Time, to me, this is my favorite Tacos place.  Just FYI, I am a sober when eating the Tacos.
