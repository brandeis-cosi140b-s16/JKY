Sara S and Alex S. I've read your reviews and highly disagree. Perhaps your taste buds have expired?  Carbajal's is top notch, family owned,  and is fairly priced. Especially when considering the location is somewhat discreet and easy to miss. The food here is some of the best I've had, and I've had em' all. I won't name any specifically, because that'd be counterproductive. Hostesses are more than friendly. Great atmosphere and decor. It's great being able to walk right in and sit down.  A hidden gem on Main St. Can't beat it..located in Sun Valley Plaza East of Power,  just West of Sossoman North side of the  street, for those who wish to find it...as you should,  because you won't be disappointed. Sara K and Alex K don't know what they're talking about. So check it out and add your review afterwards.
