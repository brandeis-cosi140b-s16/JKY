By far, some of the Best Southwestern cuisine you will ever eat. Guaranteed! Everything except the Cheesesteak sandwich is Out of This World. But then again, you shouldn't be ordering a cheesesteak sandwich from this place. 

My favorite dish is 3 Shrimp Enchiladas with the Rice and Beans. The Red Chili's here can be spicy, and the portions are huge. Almost impossible to get through. 

Highly Recommended....If you can find it ;)
