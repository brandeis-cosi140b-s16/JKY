This place is a 5 in every way... service, value, food quality, atmosphere, even the music.  Their happy hour is on point: every day from 11am - 7pm.  How can you beat $2 mexi drafts with some of the best (and warm) free chips and salsa around.  The Mexican chocolate cheesecake in a jar will change your life, as will the churros, and chili rojo de pollo!  This place has got it all figured out and executed it flawlessly every time I've been there.  I'm a big fan!
