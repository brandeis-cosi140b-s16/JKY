This is one of the fastest Chipotles I've ever been to... And they better be, given how long the lunch line can get! Great food as all Chipotles put out for a reasonable price. Since they added the brown rice bowl it's quickly become my favorite for both flavor and the fact that it's healthier than white rice or a tortilla. Yum!
