OMG! I found this place on groupon! What a great find. Ordered a dozen oysters, half plain for the hubby and the other half where fully loaded for me. What can I say I'm a foodie its what we do. They had lemon cooked shrimp and fish with diced avocado, jalapeno and purple onions on top of these fresh bad boys. Let me tell you I stepped into heaven with the 1st taste. BOMB! Flavor! Flavor! Flavor! I have been to some places where the oyster had no taste like they where frozen, gross. But not here! Tasted fresh off the doc. The hubby also ordered a small shrimp cocktail that was loaded with shrimp, I managed to steal a bite and it was pretty tasty! The small was not even small it was a good portion. For the main course the hubby had 2 shrimp tacos with rice and beans that he loved. I had the sea food enchiladas. I'm such and enchilada'er and the sound of that freaked me out. But I love to step out with my taste buds. And I must say I wasn't let down one bit. They where stuffed with fish, shrimp and possibly a bit of crab. They melted in my mouth with the cooked chilies on top and get this, pieces of bacon!! BACON!! Hurt me! Nom! Service was great, super fast. One thing after the other came to our table like clock work. Drinks, bam oysters, bam cocktail, main course, boom! This place is a must try. I grow up near Monterey bay Ca. I know my sea food and I know it well. This is the best your gonna get in the Az desert. 2 snaps up and a twirl!
