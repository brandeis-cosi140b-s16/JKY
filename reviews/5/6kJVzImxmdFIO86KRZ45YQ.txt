I was there a while ago so I don't remember too much.  All I remember is that the atmosphere was amazing, I remember that the staff were equally amazing, and I remember that the food suggested by the staff was phenomenal.  Great authentic Mexican food, great bartenders/servers, and an awesome time.  What more can you ask for?
