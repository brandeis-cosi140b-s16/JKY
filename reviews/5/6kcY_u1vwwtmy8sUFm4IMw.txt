Full disclosure: I'm not a big fan of Mexican in general beyond tacos that I cook myself at home. 

That said, this place is pretty great. Price is reasonable for the mountain of food you get with most meals, and the service has always been friendly and fairly prompt when I've eaten here. I've only ever been for dinner, so one of these days I need to do the lunch test and see if it's doable in a 'typical' lunch hour or not. 

For the one or two times a year that I am in the mood for Mexican, I go with Azteca!
