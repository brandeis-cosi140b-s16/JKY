Awesome, no frills Mexican food. Being a vegetarian, I cannot comment on the meat items, however, their black bean and pinto bean options are perfect! Great flour tortillas, fatty sized. Love that they do potato tacos! SoCal style, like my favorite Snapper Jacks would make. Living here locally, I actually go out of my to the Palms to grab either a burrito or a few tacos. I have no clue why the other reviewer compared it to Chipotle, who I think is way overrated. Oh, and since I can't stand that cilantro white rice, I'm glad they also serve good ol Spanish style rice! Oh and for meat eaters, I'm told their tortas are xcellent.
So, locals and visitors, if you want no frills,SoCal style Mexican food, stop by Chronic Tacos in the Palms casino. Or, if your in SoCal, they have quote a few locations.
