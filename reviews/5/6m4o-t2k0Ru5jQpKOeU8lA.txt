Love it! From the jalapeno ranch salad dressing to the habanaro burger (FIRE). We often go on the weekends after 11 and take advantage of the happy hour sliders. They're awesome- don't forget to ask for the chipolte mayo for the fries. 
Great Margaritas- fresh squeezed lime juice- just the right amount of salt- or not. 
They have a great patio with live music occassionally, misters and a moat. 
Two of our favorite bartenders are gone, Christy and Scotty but hopefully we still have Matt! 
A lot of people in the industry eat here so you know it has to be good.
