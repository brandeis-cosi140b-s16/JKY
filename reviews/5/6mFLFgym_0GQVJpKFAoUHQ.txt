This place is located in a small shopping center that looks a little questionable but this restaurant is a secret gem in the heart of indian Trail.  They changed the inside and instead of a big cafeteria looking restaurant, they added booths, decor and sectioned parts off to make it look more intimate and bigger.  The servers are super friendly and attentive.  They offer two salsas that greet you with chips when you first sit down.  Food is delicious and the portions are very large for the price you pay.  Two thumbs up!!
