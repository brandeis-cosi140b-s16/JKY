After reading the reviews about this place, I just had to go and check it out. There was alot of people but not overcrowded, it was alot of families and there kids. The food was awesome!! I had the fundido with jalapeno cream cheese and it was so good!! It had this awesome unique taste to it where you just couldnt stop eating, even when full. This was the only place that makes there mexican rice exactly like my moms!! It was delish! You can tell there refried beans were very authentic. Ive been to alot of mexican restaurants and this one is by far the best!
