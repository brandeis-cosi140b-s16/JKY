Literally my favorite Mexican restaurant ever! Such a great atmosphere, the food is amazing and staff is always kind. On occasion things will be a little slow but thats only because 90% of the time they are PACKED. Even the kids menu has tons of good options, picky eaters included.

I always get the same order: two item, two chicken tacos (no lettuce or tomato) rice and beans, and I have never been disappointed. 

I do wish that they offered regular sour cream for no additional cost, but I don't mind bringing my own. Keep up the good work Serrano's!!
