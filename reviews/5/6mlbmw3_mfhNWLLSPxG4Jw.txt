Had a great business lunch the other day at Isabel's brought in a client, and his partner, they both really enjoyed it--especially those carnitas!  I ordered two tacos, one beef, one pork carnitas and they were so tender and delicious.  They each had a veggie burrito (added chicken) it was smothered and huge.  Chips were light and crispy and I loved their salsa, very fresh.  I highly recommend this restaurant for some authentic Mexican food.
