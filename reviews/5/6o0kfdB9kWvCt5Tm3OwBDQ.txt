Great service and great quality food! The flavors were clean and traditional and the carne asada  burrito was delicious! Chips and salsa were brought very quickly and were very tasty.  Dining room is open yet cozy and there is great outdoor seating as well. I will definitely go again and cannot wait to try the other menu options!
