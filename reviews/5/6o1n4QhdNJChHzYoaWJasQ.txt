Very delicious, flavorful, and tasty food! 
You can sit inside or enjoy the outside. 
There are several large TV screens for your viewing pleasure so you won't miss the game. 
There's a full bar... and a salsa bar! 

The food and decor make it appealing to want to sit for a while and hang out with your friends, be served, and have a few drinks. That's one option. 

You also have the option to walk to the back, wait in a line, read the big menu on the wall, place your order, pay, then find your own seat somewhere (like at Wahoos or Panera) and they will bring the food to you. This is a great concept for people on their lunch breaks because it eliminates the middle man of waiting to order, pay the bill, etc.
