This is one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants that I have found in Las Vegas. Very fresh seafood and all the other food on the menu is amazing. It's a small restaurant and doesn't look like much but the food is absolutely perfect. The staff is friendly and the prices are great. I would recommend this restaurant to anybody. Me and my family go there all the time.
