I love this place! We wanted so good Mexican food and that's what we got! There was no wait and the waiter was very attentive. We order margaritas and it was made perfectly. They gave us chips with red and green salsa which both had a lot of flavor. I loved the green one. We both got carne asada burritos. They are alittle expensive the burrito was $26 and it doesn't come with rice or beans but it is big and definitely filling. The meat inside the burrito was perfect and they definitely didn't skimp on the meat. The margaritas were really tasty and strong which is the perfect combo
