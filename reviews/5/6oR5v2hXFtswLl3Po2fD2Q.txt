Love the tamales here! The corn tamales and beef are my fav! The corn tamales are sweet and delicious. :)

A dozen is 14 something including tax I believe. And the hours are only until 5 or 6 depending on the day I think, so make sure you get there in time to take a dozen home. And closed Mondays. I should post when I'm more awake so I could sound slightly more knowledgeable and prepared... :P
