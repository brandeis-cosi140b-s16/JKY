AMAZING fast Mexican food! Since moving to LV a year ago this has been my go to spot. The CA burrito is delicious and I love having gauc added to it. The rice is nice and fluffy too. You just can't go wrong here. Only crappy thing is this location is in Fabulous Freddy's and at times there is no parking.
