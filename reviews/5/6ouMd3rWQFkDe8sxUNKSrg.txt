My fianc√© and I ate here today!!! It was delicious and reminded me of tacos from Tucson where you could go anywhere to find them. I was disappointed to move up here and find no real good taco shops. But then I ate here and I'm so happy to find my new taco spot! I love the guacamole sauce and the carne asada is so freaken good!!!!! I highly recommend trying it out, you won't be disappointed!

Also for those of you complaining about the size of the menu, sometimes simplicity tastes better. This place doesn't need all the extra things on the menu because it doesn't need it. Plus it's not some fancy restaurant that needs to cater to your needs.
