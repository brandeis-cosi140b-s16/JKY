We loooooove Rubio's !!
My husband & myself miss this place all summer when we are home in BC. Everything is freshly prepared and seasoned just right,
Help yourself to cilantro, salsa, chipolte salsa and peppers at the salsa bar. I miss my Grande Bowl (consisting of black beans, rice, lettuce,with amazing dressing) with chicken and guacomole.My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
Healthy food and consistently great.
