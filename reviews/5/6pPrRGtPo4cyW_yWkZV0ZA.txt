Eric !!!!!! is amazing! My husband and I asked our server for the name of the guy that was buzzing all over the place, working like a slave - nonstop - constantly smiling, happy, asking if anyone needed anything, bringing refills, greeting people, clearing tables ..... he was absolutely the most wonderful, friendly,  helpful personality in the place!!  BEST service of any eating establishment we've been to in this area. Five star !!!!!!!!!!
