I literally book my plane flights home to Vegas to ensure I am able to make it to El Toretos. I now live in SD and there is nothing in the state that has come close to El Toretos. Greats staff, family owned for 40 plus years and the best food on the planet. 

THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD ON EARTH! 

No close second.
