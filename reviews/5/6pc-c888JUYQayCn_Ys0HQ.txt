The decor made me feel like I was in Mexico. My family all tried different entries. Everyone, EVERYONE was amazed at how great the food was. The price was reasonable and the service was great 

If people have eaton here and not likes the food, then they do not know authentic Mexican food. 

The items served with the food were all fresh (per my wife) and the chips were light and crispy, not heavy with fried oil.
