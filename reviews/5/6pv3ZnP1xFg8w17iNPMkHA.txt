For me this place is out in the middle of nowhere, but if you are anywhere within the 20 mile radius-you must go! 

Today I tried the take-out building for lunch/ 1 and the service was great! Very nice and knowledgeable about the menu.  BTW there are plenty of tables to eat in at.
I had the new salmon tacos with their mango salsa (that I crave regularly) and with a little green salsa to even out the sweetness they were perfect and plentiful.  The salmon had a tiny bit of crunch on the edge and the rest was perfectly moist.

Usually I can resist eating all the corn tortillas...not here! Too darn good. 

For $10 I got 2 huge fish tacos & an even bigger soda. Great value!
