I ate here recently for the first time and I am definitely a fan.

We came in looking for the prickly pear margarita, but unfortunately they were out at the time.  So we tried a couple other libations instead which were equally as tasty.  We tried the machaca and relleno and they were both delicious.  They had great salsa as well for the chips that you get when you sit down.  

I have no doubt that we will stop in here again when in the area.  If you haven't been and love Mexican food, give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.
