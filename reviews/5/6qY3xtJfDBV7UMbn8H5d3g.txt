I usually go for the garlic herb shrimp tacos- 2 taco plate. You get yourself some picante salsa, tomatillo salsa, pickled carrots and jalopenos, sit down and start eating. 2.5 seconds later when you've inhaled your food- you can thank me. swing by on tuesdays for $1.50 fish tacos (after 2PM). You're welcome.
