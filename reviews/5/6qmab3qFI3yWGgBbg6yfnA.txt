When it comes to ethnic restaurants, having people of that ethnic group approve of a restaurant is a pretty good sign. The last time I had a taco as delicious as the ones I had at Los Gemelos was at a taco truck in San Francisco. It was at night, after all the Mexican laborers in the area were off work, and the owners of the food cart didn't even speak English - I had to have a friend to order for me.

Los Gemelos is located within a grocery store in a plaza that specializes in ethnic foods and services. Walking inside, I could remember how, when I visited Mexico, the warm Gulf air would breeze through the palm trees as men sat in front of their shops waiting out the scorching noontime sun. There were burly Mexicans standing outside chatting in a staccato Spanish. In the store, you can buy authentic Mexican candy, and the Coca-Cola there is made from actual sugar instead of corn syrup. Stepping inside the restaurant, I was greeted by the elderly matron of the establishment. The menu was short, with the Mexican equivalent of comfort food. Soccer was being played on several televisions, and occasionally a long, drawn-out bellow of "GOOOOOOOOAAALLLLL" from the announcer would punctuate my meal. I came an hour after they opened, so there were very few people, but I can imagine coming here for to pick up a few tacos for lunch. For me, it's not how complicated or elaborate a meal is that makes it good. Simple is fine, just do it right. And here they do it right. This is Mexican food by Mexicans, for Mexicans.
