So I frequent the health food store next door to this place and when the lot in front of the health food store was full, I parked in front of Otro Cafe.  I was a bit hungry so I popped in for a bite.  
I had the grass-fed beef grilled steak salad and it was fantastic.. The beef was perfectly cooked to med rare and was seasoned to perfection.  The salad was made with fresh mixed greens, apples and gorgonzola.  Needless to say I scarfed I'd down like a wild monkey.   I will return.
