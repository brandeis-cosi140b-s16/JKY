Have you every had one of those experiences where everything at a restaurant truly was excellent? Well, that was Salvatore's. They take their menu to a whole new level. 

First there was the salad. I end up eating a huge amount of greens in the course the year, and that's fine. But it's a pretty rare day when I'm eating a salad and think to myself that the lettuce is just delicious. The salad also came with interesting vegetables -- like slices of purple carrots and speckled string beans (I HATE string beans by the way, but gladly ate these). 

After talking with the waiter I realized that they had just come back from the farmer's market with everything. A lot of food here either comes directly from the farmer's market or from the farm itself, and it makes a big difference.   

Then there is the beer: a very nice mix of small, craft breweries.

Then there is the pizza. If you are looking for just peperoni, this is not your place. I'm really up for creative pizzas, and Salvatore's doesn't disappoint. When there are too many things that look good on the menu and you can't make up your mind, then you are in a good place. 

I ended up with the Fig and Bacon (Cabernet poached mission figs, with gorgonzola cheese,  balsamic red wine reduction, and bacon). Excellent! 

Easily could have also gone for: 

Forestiere (Thinly sliced onions, bacon lardons, cr√®me fraiche, Pleasant Ridge Reserve,  fresh thyme and local mushrooms) 

or

Vegetarian (Roasted beet pesto, kale, goat cheese, parsley, red wine reduction) 

I'll just have to come back and try the others!
