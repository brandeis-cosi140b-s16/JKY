Great service,  Affordable, and delicious. 

Came here  for pupusas and was very pleased by the slightly spicy cortido (slaw) and awesome menagerie of salsas provided. 
Chicken tacos were very fresh, slightly smaller than you might be used to,  so order one more than you usually would, they are very reasonably priced.
