Just ate dinner at Mas Amigos for the first time, and I am definitely impressed. The food is super cheap, but the service and quality is the best I've had when it comes to the many Mexican restaurants in the C-U area. We had a brand new server, but he did such a great job that I never would have guessed if he hadn't told us. I'll definitely be going to Mas Amigos again soon. Maybe for lunch?...
