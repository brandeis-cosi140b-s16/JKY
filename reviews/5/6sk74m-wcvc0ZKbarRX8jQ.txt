Legit!!! You get all of the good New Mexico experience without having experience all of the usual New Mexico garbage- I moved from NM nearly 5 years ago and have been looking for some good NM food- this place hits the spot!  The owner is there most of the times I have been and comes out and chats with you.  This is a true family run business, which I am always a huge advocate... This place sits in a strip mall- nothing fancy- just good food.  Not a snobby or overpriced mexican food joint, just legit grub.  I like the carne dish with x-tra green chili- (always go with extra green)... Salsa bar is pretty awesome as well, although the food comes out too quickly for me to truly enjoy the salsa bar... :)  Awesome food- I enjoy going here once or twice a month.
