Growing up In SoCal has definitely made me a seafood snob, so after living in the valley of the gun, spun, and sun, I was quite surprised to find a seafood restaurant  with fresh seafood and with these prices right down the street from me.
 I know, I know. How fresh can seafood in AZ be? Not only is the food tasty, but the prices can't be touched by any other restaurant for the amount of "clean" seafood. If you've been to a buffet lately, you know what I mean by clean. On top of the prices, the staff is always so friendly that it makes the customer experience that much more memorable.
If you're so hungry that you have trouble choosing an item after perusing through the menu, you can't go wrong with marlin tacos or the the mixta tostadas.

Bon Appeitit !!!
