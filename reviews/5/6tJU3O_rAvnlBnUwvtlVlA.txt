A friend of mine and her husband and 2 kids went to this restaurant for the first time ever and just LOVED it!  My friend picked a bit from everybody's plate and has this to say:
Chicken tacos - fantastic!
Chicken and rice soup - tasted as good as homemade soup!!!!!
Rice - not too fluffy nor clumpy
Beans - very good (and my friend does NOT like beans)
Everything was covered with delicious white grated cheese.
Note:  very little to no English is spoken at this establishment.
