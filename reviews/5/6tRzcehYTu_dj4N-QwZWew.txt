I love this Rubios!!! The shrimp tacos, bean burrito enchilada style, fish tacos, and veggi burrito are AMAZING! I have never had bad food at this location and anytime I am in AZ, this is the one place I have to go. All of the different sauces on the items are great, all the food is really fresh, and the staff is always friendly. I love the four different kinds of salsa's they have at the salsa bar. For "fast" mexican food that is always good, this is my favorite and I would send anyone to this location.
