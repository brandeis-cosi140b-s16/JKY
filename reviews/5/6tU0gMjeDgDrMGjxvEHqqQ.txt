HIS: The chamango and elote en vaso are what we come here for. (Thats Mango with chamoy sorbet & corn in a cup for us white people haha). The chamango is made to order and every time they chop the mango right in front of us which we love. The elotes is pre-cooked and scooped into a cup for you but that doesn't take away from the taste! I think it's even better than the corn on a stick. Don't go here for a nice sit down or amazing service. This is a stop and go kinda place but worth the stop every time.

HERS: So, I think something my baby forgot to mention was how much I blew his mind and taste buds away when I brought him here. I'm Mexican and I grew up eating this food. This place sells the most authentic and delicious treats I used to enjoy growing up. All the desserts are amazing. From the ice cream to the corn. Like mentioned, we come here for the corn and chamango. If you want something fresh and more "healthy" I'd get the chamango which is freshly cut chunks of sweet mango with a chamoy sorbet and drizzled with more chamoy. For those of you who may not know what chamoy is, it's a sweet and spicy red sauce that elevates the taste of fruit to a whole other level. Your life will transform  when you try this, it's not over powering spicy. It's just the perfect amount of sweet and spicy. The corn in the cup is corn that has been cooked with some peppers and water then is put inside a cup and topped with mayo, cheese, and spicy powdered chile. All of the topping are optional but the way they make it is amazing. You can also ask them to put a little of each if its something you're not too sure you'd like. But I promise you won't me disappointed. I have not tried their food options, honestly, because it is a dessert place I don't know how comfortable I feel about having their food. This is a place you have to try if you want to taste a little bit of Mexican heaven.
