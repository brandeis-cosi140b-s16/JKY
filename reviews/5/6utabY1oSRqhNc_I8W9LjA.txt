I went for opening night.  The food was awesome and the d√©cor was stunning.  The servers were nice and well trained despite it being opening night.  I highly recommend Panchos.   I have been to Panchos in Manhattan Beach and this place like the original  will soon become the go to place for big parties, family celebrations, intimate dinners and a night out on the town with live music and great margaritas.
