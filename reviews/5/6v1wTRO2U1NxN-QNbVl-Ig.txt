Ate here for the fourth time today in a few months.  It was perfect. Every table was full the entire two hours we were there. A great mix of people and a great "chill" vibe to the atmosphere.  Awesome music playing at just the right volume. Civeche is awesome, so is the Lola salad and pork tacos.  Had a great time.
