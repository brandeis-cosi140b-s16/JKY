Why does Saborr have to be on the complete opposite side of town for me? If they were located any closer I'd probably be going at least every week... Or day. Seriously. Support this local joint! Tried their fish tacos and ceviche tostadas. Both were pretty great.. The service was very friendly, too. 
As previous reviews have stated.. Think Chipotle. But with no crazy lines, more affordable, and a great authentic taste. The flavors aren't typical like your average Robertos or mexican grill.. But rather much more homemade.. It's a no brainer to give this place a try.
