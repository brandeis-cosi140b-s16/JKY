Glad to see a Fiesta Mexicana close by.  We have one near our summer home in another state. This was our first time at this location. The facility has a fresh and pleasing decor. We were seated promptly and our chips, salsa and drinks came quickly.  Our food was very good.  The portions were generous. The staff was friendly and helpful. On the way out several spoke to us and one opened the door for our departure. Will definitely go back. The outdoor seating and bar will be a big plus in good weather.
