Coming for a visit with my adopted daughter and we had our large hairy beast with us. It was a hot day and so we wanted an outdoor cafe and Eva's had the dog bowl put by the table for us when we arrived. There were dog cookies out and the waitstaff was so accomodating even when dog drool landed on them. The food was wonderful too.
