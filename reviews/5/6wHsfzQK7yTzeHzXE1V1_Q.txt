Carne Asada fries for $5! This place is like Mexico, but in Las Vegas. Although they reasonably charge more for their food. Tacos were $2 bucks each. 

Star of the show was my taco abadado (marinated pork on a rotisserie)
It's not too often that I see it served right off the rotisserie. Not in SF or LA. The only place that does it like that is Mexico. (And also Las Vegas apparently.) These melt in your mouth little tacos were dripping with marinated (secret) juices.
