This place is absolutely delicious. Let's start with their extensive menu. Lots of seafood choices to add diversity to the menu. I'm more of a traditionalist, but love unique choices like mole. Their's is excellent, and couple that with the best homemade corn tortillas I've ever had. 
Excellent food. Great atmosphere and a staff that takes care of you. A great place to try.
