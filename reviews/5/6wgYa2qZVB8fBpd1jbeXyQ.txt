So today this chino finally met the Bandido, and it sure was good! My first time here so i got to try some samples of different concoctions of asian/mexican food to see what i would like. Now if you're looking for good chinese food this isnt the place, and if you're looking for good mexican food this isnt the place. This place was meant for the fusion of both together to create a new style of food. For example i had the emerald chicken, which was pan fried or steamed chicken breast with the green onion ginger sauce they put on chinese steamed chicken, it was ok i probably wont get it again because it was just something i could make at home, but then i had the roasted pork in a burrito, now if you know how the red chinese roast pork taste like try to picture this in your mind, the sweetness of the sauce that marinades the meat with the chewyness of the best kind of tortilla, the chewy soft not dry kind. And the flavor of the flour tortilla all topped with some salsa which i think they use sweet chili sauce, im not sure but it was dang good. But thats not all i got the pork fried rice underneath which was weird yet savory at the same time, the way they season the fried rice makes it taste different and unique. The plate i had also came with a side of black beans which were pretty amazing as well. I am by no means a bean liking person, however these beans were so good i had to eat em, they had a savoryness with some spice, almost like they made it with a little soy sauce and chili. Last but not least the sugar cookie, it tasted homemade and was soft, and chewy. Overall i think it depends on the person, it could be a hit or miss with this place because the flavors are so unique and different. Theres one thing for sure though, if you get the two item plate you will be stuffed, i was so full afterward i felt like i didn't need a dinner, but that didn't stop me from eating one anyways! ;)
