Excellent menudo. I took my dad for Father's Day breakfast. It was my first time there, his second. We had a long wait, and from what I hear, that's pretty common there. Very worth the wait, though. We both had been craving menudo and ordered some along with an entree. I ordered the small bowl which was considered large at many other restaurants, and it did not disappoint. Delicious menudo! I also got the chilaquiles; Dad had chorizo. Both were tasty, filling, and well done.
