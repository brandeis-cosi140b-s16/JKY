Brunch at the Border Grill in the Forum Shops at Caesars Palace.

How many of us wake up on a Sunday - last day of a weekend trip to Vegas - tired, hung-over, hungry, hating life, and have about 5 mins til check-out time???

I usually slug it over to the buffet to get some protein in my stomach to try to get over my hang-over and for bottomless mamosas for... no good reason whatsoever.

This was a great alternative. Its nice that the servers bring the food to you versus you having to walk back and forth to the buffet.  

Our group shared a little bit of everything (some things twice) and it was all good. My favorites were the Bacon and Egg Quesadilla, the Chilaquiles, and the Chrizo and Egg Tacos.  

The Michelada really hit the spot.  Great to get over a hangover while giving you that little buzz required to stumble back out onto the strip to find a place to hit the tables til its time to go home.

A little hard to find but its right past the entrance to the Forum Shops mall right next door to The Mirage.
