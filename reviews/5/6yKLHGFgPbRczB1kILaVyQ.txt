Stumbled across a Living Social deal and couldn't wait to try this new Mexican restaurant. 

Ordered the Stuffed Chipotle Chicken (chipotle cream, corn tamale stuffed, poblano) with a side of calabacitas and black beans. SO delicious!!! 

I came here during the lunch hour and our waitress Christin was friendly and knowledgable. Also, the food came out very quick and perfect for a lunch rush. 

Didn't get an opportunity to try any of the cocktails, but they seem to have a great Happy Hour menu with cheap drinks and eats. We'll be sure to come here for Happy Hour soon. 

They have only been open for 4 months and are having their Grand Opening at the end of March. Get in before it gets too busy, because this place is going to be rockin' in no time. 


Gracias Sir Veza!!!!
