I see five reviews here all five stars!? Somethings gotta give...  now before you start thinking this a is five star restaurant or some "fancy" place hear me out. I have never given a place five stars before, and truthfully I might have given my regular high review of 4 stars here, but I did not want to detract from the other reviews. I can say this place is one of the best places for "what it is". .. You know the type of fast Mexican food like Filberto's or Rigoberto's and the like? Maria's  is better than that but kinda like that... You got to give it a try! Just had the steak & egg breakfast burrito this morning... GREAT! the hot sauce is killer too.
