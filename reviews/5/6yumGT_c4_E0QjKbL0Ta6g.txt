I loovvvveee this place. So yeah, I will admit I've tried Cravings and Gecko and I thought this would never compare BUT I gave this place a chance and I will never give it up. There food is great, it has some gecko favorites (like the tomatillo salsa and the shrimp mango quesidilla) in my opinion this makes it better. Their mexico tacos are good and cheap! Perfect for family outings and I love their baja fish tacos, so yummy, Yeah they charge extra for chips buts its only a dollar...not such a big deal. If anything people should complain when a restaurant starts charging 14 dollars a plate. Oops, restaurants already do! People stop being stingy, we are getting out of a recession..Calm down. I love their food and dont think Ill stop going any time soon. Plus they serve mango margaritas!
