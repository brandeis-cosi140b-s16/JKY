I came here last night with my boyfriend to meet up with a couple of friends and I was really really impressed with the place.  Not only do they have an inviting atmosphere with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating but their food is as good, if not better than what I had heard.  

The interior has a casual ambiance with local artists' paintings as decor.  An open kitchen, so that you can see your food being prepared and a friendly staff to boot.

Upon sitting down you get a basket of their housemade tortilla chips and salsa (also made in house).  Make sure to ask for the spicy salsa too....you won't regret it (although, I thought it could be a little spicier).  

The menu is simple but filled with flavorful options.  I was torn between the quinoa vegan salad or the cactus tacos.  I chose the cactus tacos but did it without cheese.  I couldn't believe the flavor inside those little corn tortillas (which had a ton of flavor themselves).  They come small, so I recommend getting a few of them to start.

My boyfriend got the steak, pork belly, and chicken tacos.  I pretty much think he was in heaven.  He said his favorite was the pork belly and the steak.

We will definitely be back to try the quinoa salad and also because I heard they were going to be opening for brunch soon and I love my brunch...especially mimosas!   

All in all, you'd be doing yourself a favor to coming to Paz...can't wait to see what is to come!
