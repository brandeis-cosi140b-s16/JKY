I heard about this place from a friend who had been to the Scottsdale location and decided to try out the biltmore one since it's closest to where I live downtown. Had two happy hour margaritas....blood orange and Pom grapefruit. No complaints at all. Had the two drinks and free chips and salsa...bartenders were all attentive and polite. Will be back.
