I don't usually review places but this place was amazing! I was expecting the quality of the food to be similar to a place like Roberto's but it was much better than any fast food Mexican place I've ever been! In fact, it's better than most sit down Mexican food establishments I've been to. Everything tasted homemade and slaved over. 
Service was very fast considering how busy it was and prices were great! Glad we tried this place! We will definitely be going back!
