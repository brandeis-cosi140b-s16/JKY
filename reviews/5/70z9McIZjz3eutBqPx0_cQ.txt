OMG I love Mundo. Been here many times. To all the negative reviewers, are you sure you went to Mundo? Anyway,  the shrimp tamales may be the best thing I've ever eaten in my entire life, period. The service has always been great. Last night I had a Cut on my finger re-open so the server took me to the bar where the bartender squeezed lime on it and the other bartender put salt on it. Needless to say the cut was completely healed in seconds. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas hands down. True art in cuisine.
