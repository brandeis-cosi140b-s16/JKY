this review is based only on take-out orders, but man, i love this place.  as a los angelino with plenty of family in scottsdale, the food from el molino is a perennial highlight on my couple-times-a-year visits.  the tortillias are seriously incredible, and the green corn tamales are awesome too.  omg and the green sauce.  green chile sauce? i don't even really know what it is called, but it rules.  yay!! i'l be back for our annual christmas eve mexican fiesta!!!
