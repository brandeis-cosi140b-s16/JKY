Now when ever I get that craving for some real tacos... there is a place to go.  This place makes the best tacos I've had in vegas...  The tacos are just as good as the tacos from the taco trucks in L.A.

The only drawback to this place is that they don't open late ( sign in the window showed they close at 8pm) and it's cash only.

So if you're going to go ( and I highly recommend it), don't go late and hit the ATM before you go...
