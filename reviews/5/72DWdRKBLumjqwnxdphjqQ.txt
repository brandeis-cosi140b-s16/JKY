$1.50 is an excellent deal for a quality fish taco on Tuesdays. The fish comes out really crispy, so you'd better eat it at the restaurant to avoid loss of texture. Make sure to squeeze that lime onto the fish and throw in something from the salsa bar (four mild and not-so-mild options). You can have as few or as many as you'd like, so come here for either a late afternoon snack or a filling dinner.

Also, I've had a burrito especial and a baja burrito, both with steak. Probably enjoyed the burrito especial more, but they were both nice. The burrito is not as huge as Chipotle's burritos, and I definitely miss the corn salsa, but it's still yummy and comes with chips. I suppose it's a better portion size if you're not looking to stuff yourself at lunch.

Finally, the parking is always nice since they're in a small portioned-off strip mall with nothing else that's any good.
