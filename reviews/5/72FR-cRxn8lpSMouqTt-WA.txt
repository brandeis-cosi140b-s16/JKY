La Santisima is on the top of my list for tacos in AZ.  It's not in the best part of town and the parking situation is a little tough if it's busy, but the food is out of this world!  My hubby and I came once, and decided to bring my parents here for an early Mother's Day lunch.  

I go weak in the knees for restaurants with salsa bars, but this place has a salsa bar on steroids.  They cater to all tastes and all heat levels.  I am in love with at least 5 of their salsas, including the pico de gallo that is so lime-y and delicious that it's the first one that ran out during both of our lunch visits.  

My hubby ordered the Norteno burrito both times and I got a variety of street tacos.  The carne asada is soft and juicy and not the least bit tough like you'll find at most Mexican places.  The beans remind me of the ones that my BFF's mom makes in Nogales.  Delicious!!
