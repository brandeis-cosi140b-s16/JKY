Hey guys, so I loved this place when it existed. I went there today and was totally saddened that they closed BUT I asked the owner of the little snack place next to this place and he said they MOVED somewhere to MESA located on BROADWAY or something. We gotta see if this is true! I mean, it might not be open YET but this is the only lead I have! RIP HUACHINANGO (for now hopefully)


UPDATE:

I scoured the internet and found Huauchinango's facebook. They sent a message to Larry Dudley (of the Suns I think lol) saying "come try our food, 1620 W. University Dr. Mesa, AZ" 

So there we go guys, that's the last location, let's go eat there and support them!!!!!
