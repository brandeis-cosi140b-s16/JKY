This place was fantastic! If you came to this restaurant when it first opened and haven't had a chance to come back since, DO. The entire menu has been revamped, and it's a definite success. i ordered the Shrimp & Mango Enchiladas with the complementary side salad. I cleared both plates and am already craving another round. Check this place out!
