We were told to get the prickly pear margarita and it did not disappoint!

We had to wait a bit since the outdoor patio was closed. But that was a good thing as it was quite chilly outside.
One of our party doesn't like very spicy food and the waiter was very accommodating with putting sauces on the side for her.  The food was quick, hot, and delicious.
