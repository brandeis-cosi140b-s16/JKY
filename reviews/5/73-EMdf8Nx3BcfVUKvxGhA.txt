I have been going to Cafe' Rio for a couple years now and have been to several locations. Their food is always consistently good. One of my favorite dishes is the grilled chicken enchiladas with their "hottest" sauce which I think is mild along with a nice serving of black beans and rice. I love how you can see the tortilla's being made while you watch them prepare your meal! Nothing beats fresh tortillas!! Another recommendation would be the pork burrito made enchilada style. This burrito is huge but oh so yummy! Overall, you can't go wrong with any dish you order at Cafe' Rio. Their food is really fresh and tasty!
