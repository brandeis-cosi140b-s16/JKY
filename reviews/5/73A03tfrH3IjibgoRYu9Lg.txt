My husband, daughter and I decided to try this place out for dinner. We are vegetarians, so we are picky about where we go and what we eat. This restaurant has a lovely menu, and we were very happy with the vegetarian tacos. 

The atmosphere is wonderful, its very bright, open, and happy. Its a great place to have a birthday party  or other fun occasion. Our server was very nice, and came back lots of times to check and make sure our drinks were refilled. 

The pricing of food to quanity is a lot like if you went to the Cheescake Factory. I thought the pricing was fine, I would like to go back for happy hour, after all who doesnt like to get a deal.
