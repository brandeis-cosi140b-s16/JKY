The Mexican food Gods and Goddesses have possessed the mortal bodies of the people who work in the Los Reyes De La Torta kitchen to grace us with their magical food. 

I swear every time I eat here I am transported to another realm of taste bud enchantment.

The servers are super sweet and kind. So casual yet so much "sabor!'. I love Los Reyes De La Torta. 

I am still trying to figure out if it is the food that is soul shattering amazing, or that the fact that I watched Adam Richman devour a torta on Man Vs. Food made me love this place even more. I swear, there is nothing sexier than a man who loves to eat delicious food. I could watch Adam Richman all day omg... So freaking hot... Wow I'm so weird but whatever. This place is awesome, go check it out and gain a new addiction to your list!

Viva Los Reyes de La Torta!!
