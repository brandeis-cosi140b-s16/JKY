So my brother, a Vegas local, took us to Casa about 5 years ago and ever since then, we can't help going back. I have never once ordered a repeat item off the menu and have yet to find a dish I don't like to eat from this place. 
Look, it's just damn good Mexican food. What more do you need to know? The place has great ambiance, the staff are nice and the prices are good. Enjoy!
