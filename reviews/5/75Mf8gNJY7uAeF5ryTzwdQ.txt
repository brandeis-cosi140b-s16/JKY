I went here and I was impressed . I am mostly from MD and there are ALOT of tex-mex restaurants there but, Prickly Pear had my heart and I miss it...I wish they would put one in MD.  The Salsa is hot and tortillas are really really good.  We got fajitas and everything was fresh. Midwestern state and California do have the best Mexican food
