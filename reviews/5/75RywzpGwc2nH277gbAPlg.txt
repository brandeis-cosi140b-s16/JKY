I absolutely loved the food here. We had the, shrimp cocktail, which had a ton of shrimp,  1 carne Asada, 1 carnitas, 1 buche, 1 Cabezas tacos, the pricing was kinda weird,  but the food was outstanding!  Very fresh ingredients, all the meats were tender and everything had tremendous flavor!  You can't compare this place to Taco El Gordo, two completely different type of tacos, both very good in there own right. I will go back here again!  Seriously some of the best Mexican food, I've had in Vegas!
