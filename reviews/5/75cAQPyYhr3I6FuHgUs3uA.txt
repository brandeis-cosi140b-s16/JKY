this place was really good! the owners are very nice and it's got a real mexican home feel to it. I had the carne asada sopes, while my mom had the menudo. it was good and didn't take too long to make. it's also fairly inexpensive which is great. I'm glad I found this place, I could even walk here if I wanted to!
