I have been working near, and eating at Haba's for fir years now. In my office we tend to eat here at least one a week. Not only does it always impress, but it never gets old. 

Ask the food is prepared fresh using traditional methods and spices. Everything they serve its hot, fresh, and large in proportions. They don't have fountain drinks, which is fine since my food it's often to go, and the choices are plentiful. 

They just opened a second location near my house, it's dangerous for my wallet :(

Since I've found this place I've not been back to Chipotle out Qdoba.
