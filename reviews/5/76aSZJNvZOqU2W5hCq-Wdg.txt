This place sits right across the street from where I work and, at most, it's a five minute walk. While the place is usually busy during my lunch hour, that's to its credit because people want to eat there and they're willing to wait. I'm always willing to wait, but folks, they have an iPod/iPhone app and an order online feature that makes it so you don't have to wait. I frequently order my lunch hours before lunchtime. When I get there, it's in a sack with my name on it and I get to skip the line, pay, and eat.

Brilliant!

Also the staff here is easily the friendliest I've ever seen in a Chipotle. They know my name, even though I only go there once or twice a month, usually on a payday. I usually order my burrito with extra sour cream and they always happily oblige. The service is superb.

The place is kept very clean. Indeed, I've seen people come out from behind the counter to clean, wipe, and tidy when they have a brief lull.

In the end, I think it says something about the place when I will drive out of my way to go to this particular Chipotle than drive a shorter distance to a closer one.
