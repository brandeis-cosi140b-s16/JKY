Food: I absolutely love street tacos and I have no idea what El Gordo's doing but what ever they're doing don't stop the goodness! It really doesn't get better than this. Taco's El Gordo definitely sets the bar high. I've tasted tacos close to the border of Mexico in San Diego and all over Los Anegeles but none can compare to the flavors of El Gordo. 

Drinks: You have your selection of Soda's and tea's but also you have Mexican soda's and lets not leave out the horchata. 

Atmosphere: It's High school cafeteria style. You stand in line order what you want and then you go and pay at the cashier. Simple as that. This location has tables inside and out. The outdoor patio makes you feel like you're really in Tijuana Mexico. 

Tips: Keep in mind what line you stand in, they have different lines for different tacos with different cuts of meat. Also this place is located on the strip so expect Late night diners that I call "drunkeats".
