My girlfriend and I frequent here often either by ourselves or with friends. I have to say, they have the BEST CADILLAC MARGARITAS I have ever tasted. We buy them by the pitcher. Still trying to figure out how they are made. The food is good. I have had some better, some worse. Chips and salsa are yummy and the customer service has always been subperb. If you haven't tried Tamales, please do yourself a favor and stop on by. Start off with a nice Cadillac Margarita and enjoy the evening. If you have had too much, you can always go drunk shopping across the street at Target lol.
