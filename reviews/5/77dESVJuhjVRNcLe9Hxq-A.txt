This place is legit!  The flan is kick your mama's grand mama's ---- good!   Chef Paco is terrific as he takes his time to visit his guest in the bar.  ... Dino the bartender is very kind... Please ask for him.  He will hook it up, including eating fried grasshoppers with you.  Above all this, the street tacos at 2 dollars is amazing !!! It's all meat!  Unlike the others.  I'm coming back... I got to stop ... The tequila is kicking in!  Full bar... Just tell Dino to pour it !
