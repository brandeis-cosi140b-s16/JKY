This place is fantastic! I've worked in the area for over a year and had no idea it was even here. The food is remarkable! I had the carne asada burrito which was very flavorful and not greasy at all. The tripas (taco) was cooked to perfection, as well. I will definitely be coming again. Highly recommended.
