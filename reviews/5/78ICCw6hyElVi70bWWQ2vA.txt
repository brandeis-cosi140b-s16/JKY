Ooh..their shrimp tacos are to die for!  Bursting with flavor-I love it!  Fish tacos are good as well.  I agree with another Yelper that the shrimp is better than the fish.  Look forward to trying their special corn on the cob that looked so good when I walked by someone else's table.

The food tastes so fresh and you can tell they are made from the best ingredients.  The restaurant uses local and organic vegetables in their dishes.

This place can be considered overpriced, because the ambience doesn't necessarily match up with the prices.  It's like a casual funky cafe dining place with gourmet nice restaurant prices.  But the food really is wonderful--what I have had so far, so it's worth it.
