My parents spent most of their adult lives living in Mexico and South America. So, let it be known that Kayla J's momma does not tolerate crappy Mexican food.

Isla is the opposite of crappy. To start, we got a trio of salsa's and chips. I devoured them as hubby and I had been flying all day to get to Vegas.  We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and it was amazing. Hubby had beef tacos and I had a small fillet mignon that came with an enchilada. All were delicious.

The two best parts of the meal were hubby's raspberry mojito (literally, the best cocktail I have ever tasted) and the mango cake and ice cream that we shared.  

Isla was a fabulous start to a fabulous vacation!
