Hands down THE BEST Mexican food in Vegas.  We've been regulars for years.
The food, prices and service can't be matched anywhere in town.  I love the cheese and onion enchiladas !!  The salsa was so good we bought some to take home. 

I've seen many of a Limo driver wait out front as their fares dined.  

Granted the location is scary and the parking lot only holds a few cars but those are the only negatives.  We come here to dine.  Now remember this place was built in the 50's.  Nothing fancy here.  If you want ambiance go elsewhere. This place in not for the snooty.  If you want a delicious meal, you're in the right place.

For all the negative reviews, to each their own.  I, for one, am glad you won't return because that leaves more room for us regulars that enjoy REAL Mexican fare.

Mucho Gracias El Sombrero !!
