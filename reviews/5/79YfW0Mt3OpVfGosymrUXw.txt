I love this restaurant, the servers are awesome and the food is scrumptious! I hadnt eaten here for about a year because I had moved a significant ways away. I sure had missed the food! The atmosphere and establishment inside the Tuscany Hotel, is very relaxing and casual. Roll in, in your sweat pants and flip flops for a tasty authentic mexican dish. Love the fresh tableside guacamole!!!!
