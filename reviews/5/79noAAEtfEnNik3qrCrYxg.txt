I'm on a low carb diet and I had the fajitas sans tortilla and rice, added pico and avocado and it was delicious. 
I would give the food a 4 but Jen, the bartender, makes this place a 5+. I travel a lot and meet a lot of people. This gal is a quality gal. She catered to my diet and is the epitome of great customer service. This is by far the best Dos Gringos I've ever been to because of the people that work there. I'm not going every day because I don't live nearby but I'll make the visit for those steak and shrimp fajitas and the customer service!
