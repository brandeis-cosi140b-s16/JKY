Ahh tortas..  Had my first taste when I worked in Downtown LA.  The ones here are even better.  This was my first visit in about 6 months.  Forgot how good they are.  I had the Carne which is always a solid choice.  I took a co-worker who was a bit reluctant at first, but seemed to really enjoy the spicy pork.

Also, they have a munch of flavors of horchata, and Coca Cola with real sugar.
