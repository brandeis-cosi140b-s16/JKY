It really doesn't get much better than this. I could probably survive on their condiments alone, with the mountain of jalapeno carrots, cucumber slices, and delicious salsas! I remember coming here in high school after class and finding the place packed with people, all lined up for the California burrito, carne asada fries, and the carne asada super nachos. 

The California burrito has to be my kryptonite. Every bite has the perfect combination of carne asada, cheese, rice, sour cream, and guacamole. Everything else on the menu holds a special place in my heart as well, and it is often difficult to decide between chicken tacos, fajitas, or the savory menudo they serve every weekend. And the horchata is something to be loved as well!

All in all, the homey atmosphere of this establishment, as well as the friendly staff, make me feel welcome anytime, even up until closing time at midnight. Fausto's definitely beats out Roberto's in my book any day of the week. I only wish they served elote.
