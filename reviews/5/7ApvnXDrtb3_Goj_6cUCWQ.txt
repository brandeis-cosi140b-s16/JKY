I've eaten at plenty of Fili B's, but this one takes the cake.

As a general rule, Filiberto's makes delicious food in heaping portions for relatively no money.  I'm sure there's millions of calories in it, I don't care.  I recommend the Carne Asada Steak Fries.

What set's this one apart from the rest is their service.  A good friend of mine owns a private bar a three minute walk from this Filibertos, and we generally stumble through their drive-through on foot between the hours of 3 and 5 in the morning on our designated drinking day.  The first time we did this I was 100% positive that we were going to get shut down, but the owner of the bar said he does it all the time and they don't mind.  We tried to get the car sensor at the menu to work but we couldn't get it to register us, so we went up and knocked on the window.  I, even in my inebriated state was mortified at the notion that we were about to get told off by a Filiberto's drive-through worker, however, the lady running it just smiled at us and asked what she could get for us.

Awesome.  I go here just about every week on foot and they always serve me with a smile.  A smile that I don't get when I go through in my car, come to think of it.
