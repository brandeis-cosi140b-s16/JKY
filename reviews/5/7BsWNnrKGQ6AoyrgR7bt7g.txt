Absolutely the best mexican place in Vegas.  The atmosphere, the music and the food seal the deal.  I had the carnitas platter, and it is excellent.  the spices they use on the meat is wonderful, the chips and salsa are fantastic and the margaritas are perfect.  It's a bit off the strip, but worth the walk or the cab ride.
