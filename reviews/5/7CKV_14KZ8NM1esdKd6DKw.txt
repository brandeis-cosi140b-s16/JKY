This was about as good as it gets. 

First, I was happy to utilize the free valet parking, I really love this more and more as I become more pregnant. 

We were seated in the back section where Jamal and Chris were working together on the area. Both were amazing but we got to spend more time with Jamal and I have to say, I will be requesting him on our next visit. 

Having been wanting a margarita, I talked the hubs into getting the trio that was on special. Jamal helped with this persuasion and picked out a perfect combo for him. Since I was not able to drink any myself, I was happy that he seemed to enjoy them. 

We decided to split the fajitas for 2 and started with the salad. This was amazing. I was afraid I was going to be disappointed b/c I was not getting guac. but as soon as I took one bite of this salad I forgot all about it. 

The fajitas themselves were quite tasty and contained an array of veggies, not just the typical onions and peppers. The hubs enjoyed this but I am grossed out by mushrooms so I had to keep looking and picking to make sure none made their way into my mouth! 

We ended the meal with the Churros and it was a perfect end and totally satisfied my sweet tooth. 

I am excited to go back and try more things on the menu and, eventually, have some of those margaritas myself!
