My favorite Mexican restaurant.  Best salsa, especially the green. Staff is very friendly. Don't let the storefront scare you away.  It is in a rundown strip mall but the food is great. The flying saucer is a favorite and the sweet pork taco salad bowl is another go-to entree.  Very reasonable prices for large portions.
