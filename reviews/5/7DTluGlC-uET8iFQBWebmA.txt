This chipotle is one of my favorite ones because as most Chipotle fans know- they are usually pretty stingy on the protein of your choice. 

At this location- that isnt the case. They hook it up! Another good part about this Chipotle is that no one really knows about it so it's never too busy. 

They also always have Chipotle Tobasco sauce on lock- which can't be said about other locations
