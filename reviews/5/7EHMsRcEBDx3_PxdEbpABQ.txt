I have had a problem trying to find a place that has a good nutritious menu with good flavor. I had never been here until a few weeks ago. WOW!!! First of all, the workers are all friendly. The line can be long but moves quickly. The food is nutritious but full of flavor. The menu is limited and i like that. You can order a bowl and start with your choice of rice, then beans, pinto or black, then your meat, chicken, steak, spicy steak or carnitas( Pork). Well now the pork is off the menu as the company did not like how the pork was was raised. Then you pick a salsa, mild or hot, sour cream, cheese and for an extra charge, avocado. The salad has the same choices. You can also pick the worlds biggest burrito. This company is socially conscious and frankly I love this place. I eat here a lot and I am losing weight doing so. To people who complain about putting sour cream on by mistake, come on people, that is why it is called a mistake. This is fast, good fast food, not a 5 star restaurant.
