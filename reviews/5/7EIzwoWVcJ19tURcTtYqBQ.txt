I've been to this location a few times, and have always had a pretty good experience, but tonight the staff really went above and beyond. 

My boyfriend has a pretty severe dairy and egg allergy, and let the server know while he was ordering to ensure his food wouldn't have those things in it. When the steak burrito he ordered came out, it looked like it had some sort of cream or cheese in it so we let the server know our concern. The manager came to our table and apologized about not being told our table had an allergy and therefore hadn't done the normal allergy process with the dish and was taking steps to rectify it. 

The burrito came back pretty quickly. The chef had taken lots of care to put all of the salsa/pico on the side and changed the seasonal rice to fries (the rice had dairy in it as well). She then explained how z tejas has this whole non-contaminated area they prepare dishes like this and then comped the burrito which was really kind of her to do. 

We were so impressed with how the situation was handled, and are excited to know there's a place close by that takes allergies very seriously :)
