What more can you say about a late night taco shop located on the Las Vegas strip that has over 500 yelp reviews?

Well, let's start with: This place rocks. 

Let's get into it. You need some greasy food after an epic night, and sometimes Tacos are the cure-all. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here. It's located on the northern end of the strip just passed Encore & Wynn. 

There is usually a line, but it moves quick. 

You have plenty of meat options for your tacos (hey now). I prefer the more adventerous stuff like lengua, cabeza & tripa. Totally worth it because everything is seasoned to perfection and greasy enough to be amazing.

If you are on vacation and have no regard for your arteries (aka if you are like me), then try the carne asada fries. It's massive and something that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people. Or just split it with someone if you are both cool with a challenge.

Read some of the other reviews now. Then grab some tacos. 

This spot is bomb!
