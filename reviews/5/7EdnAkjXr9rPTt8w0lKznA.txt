I'm a huge fan and love this place, every time I come in I'm alway greeted by my name with a smile from everyone. Especially Lorena. She knows my order by heart and and is always super friendly. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's no wonder I come so often;) thank you Lorena for always making my experience great!
