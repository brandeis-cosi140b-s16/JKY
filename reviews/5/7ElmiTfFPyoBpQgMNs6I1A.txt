Wow I came into the new Dodge cabaret of food offerings and came across this gem of a find. This is asian meets Mexico.  Wow the Bao (Chinese style bread taco puff) was filled with delicious morsels of Pork and one with Chicken.  With a side of mixed unique greens and a light vinegar salad, wow.  I am so impressed with what they have done with food in less then 400 sf. 
I certainly will be back to try the Bento Box and the Tapas.  For $9.50 you can't miss.   Bravo to the owner Allan for his creative approach to two fusions.  I am sure he will come up with other tidbits over time. Need a sweet desert to cool down the meal.
