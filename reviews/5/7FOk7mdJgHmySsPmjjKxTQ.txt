Stopped in to meet a friend.  I had never been there before but loved the cool vibe.  Food was fantastic.  I was too early to try one of their 10,000 different tequilas (ok 10K may be an exaggeration) but will return.   I can see why so many of my friends who live in central Phx rave about it.   I will be back!
