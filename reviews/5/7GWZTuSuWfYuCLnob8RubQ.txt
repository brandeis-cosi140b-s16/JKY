We went here for dinner due to the top rating on TravelZoo. They did not let us down. The food, service and drinks were what you would expect from a top rated TravelZoo and Yelp rated restaurant. The atmosphere is cool and the marg was not light on alcohol.  We had the tableside guac. and the pork shoulder for 2 (with homemade tortillas [which were bomb]). The sauce with the pork was delish. The dessert did not disappoint either.  We would definitely go back when we travel to Scottsdale again !!!
