Hands down my favorite street taco ever! You're bar-hopping through old town Scottsdale when suddenly you smell burning meat goodness. Is it BBQ? Someone grilling steaks? You follow your nose a little further though the bars and it leads you to WAdAA! a cool little taco stand. There they're grilling up their meats using wood. Walk a little closer to where the action happens and you feel the aromatic heat hit you full force. How they work in that open oven I have no idea. But I'm glad they do it. The meat has this beautiful char, and as you bite through it, it's the most perfect tender/juicy meat you'll find in a taco. Add all the fixings they have on the side and you're golden. I can't tell you the name of any bars we went to that night, but WAdAA! is where it's at! We ate there 3 times in the 2 days we visited.
