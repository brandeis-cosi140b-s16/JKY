We were on vacation in Scottsdale and wanted flavorful Mexican food. This place has it all. We had dinner on a Saturday night- accompanied by a guitarist playing live music. Started off with a very yummy margarita and chips and salsa. For dinner I had stacked chicken/shredded beef enchiladas with a fried egg on top. Sooo good! My husband had shredded beef tacos he said were the best tacos he'd ever had. The shredded beef was my favorite. Also after asking for no sour cream and no cheese on my husband's dinner the waitress was thoughtful enough to come back and ask if he had a dairy allergy, which he does. She then pointed out to him that there is butter used in the rice. We were very surprised she was so attentive (most places aren't) and cared enough to bring it up. Overall extremely impressed with this restaurant. Good drinks, good food, good service, good atmosphere!
