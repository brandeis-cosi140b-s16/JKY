I am wiped out and feeling lazy after my daughter had a possible broken bone.  (she's okay but I was too stressed to even think about cooking dinner after waiting over an hour at the doctor's office!) We eat the breakfast burritos here ALL THE TIME.  They are beyond delicious,  and the green sauce ~ I could drink by the cup full!  I am serious!!!   Anyway, we are picking up the prescription at Walgreens and I suggested we grab food for take out.  We were NOT disappointed.  Hubby got the Chimichanga combo.. It could feed a family of four.. Unable to test this theory as he inhaled it ASAP.   :)  Daughter had cheese enchiladas and was perfectly satisfied. They both got the horchata for their drink (I snuck sips.. I love it but it's so sweet I didn't want to ruin my appetite) .  I ordered the Carne Asada  combo.  So amazingly Yummmy!  We will continue to go here again and again as they never disappoint!
