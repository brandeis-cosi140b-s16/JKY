The service is excellent and the food is great! The seafood nachos are amazing with delicious cheese sauce. The fajita quesadilla, fajitas, and marcos stuffed burrito are all excellent as well. Generous portions and quick to refill drinks. This place beats mad mex which lots of people like and I don't understand.  But then, people around here like eat and park too which is unimpressive. Hit up el toro loco for some tasty food and great service!  Two guys were checking up on us and they were super fast and pretty awesome!
