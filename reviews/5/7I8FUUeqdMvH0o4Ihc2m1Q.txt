My husband and I really enjoy On The Border.  The Taco Tuesday promotion is fantastic!  We split an appetizer, have the $2 tacos, a margarita and dinner is done!  And, after asking & asking for years--they finally have FLAN!  It's good, too! The service is always fast & friendly, the food is REALLY good and always comes out hot and quickly. The promotions are a great bargain.  It doesn't get any better than sitting out on the patio and enjoying good food and drink!
