Um YES!! We tried quite a few different items-- chicken, shrimp, mahi mahi, and bacon tacos. Of those the mahi was the best. We also got the veggie burrito which was surprisingly the highlight of the meal. Absolutely amazing. The only thing that I recommend improving is the corn tortilla which fell apart. Mucho Macho Taco is a great addition to the neighborhood!
