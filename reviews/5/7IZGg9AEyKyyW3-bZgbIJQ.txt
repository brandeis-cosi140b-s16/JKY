I've eaten here a couple times now & it's my new overall favorite of all the fast/quick casual Mexican places and by far the best value, however, I suspect they will raise prices once business picks up. The $1 special tacos are an awesome deal! The chicken soft taco one is just like Del Taco's but with way more chicken & tastes fresher, however, I do prefer Del Taco's sauce over the plain sour cream used in this one. The chicken taco al carbon looked plain, as there were only onions & no cilantro but once I added some salsa from their salsa bar it was delicious! I will be going back for these 2 tacos often. The order taker thought I also ordered a ground beef soft taco. It's not something I would normally order but the meat was flavored well. There was only lettuce & cheese on it.

My favorite Mexican dish is a chile relleno, however, they can be hit & miss. This one is prepared very nicely! Normally I'm not a fan of red enchilada sauce on them but this one pairs well! The cheese enchilada the #6 meal is paired with is very good also. Rice & beans are standard. 

And lastly, the 5 rolled tacos w/guacamole for $3.75 is a deal! They are very similar to Roberto's although Roberto's is more generous w/the toppings (not that Habaneros' is skimpy) & may be a little tastier but these are definitely worth ordering.
