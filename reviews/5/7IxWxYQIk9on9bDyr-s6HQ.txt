OK this is my new Fav place in the cosmo as of now !!!

ok so sout side looking it it LOOKS LIKE A HOLE IN THE WALL
i think thats the look and feel they were going for 
but this place is noting short of GREAT 
 the restaurant is split into two side one chinesse one mexican 
we dined on the mexico side at the bar the service was great friendly and knowledgeable 


this is a Jose Andres restaurant by the way 


i had the Silencio duck tongue it was great 

(they also have a variety of spicy sauces they can bring you upon request i highly recommend it ) 

i also had the   Carnitas braised baby pig/pork rinds/ 
spicy salsa verde cruda which was also good 

we also ordered the When Pigs Fly 4pc delicate steamed 
buns/Chinese barbeque pork    very different soft and chewy also very filling if you dont have ur A game appetite save room for other more delicious things i cal htis one a tasty filler :) 

the  Langosta lobster/salsa Mexicana
arbol chile sauce was ahhhhmaaazing a must id say 


the chips and the salsa were some of the best i have EVER had....

the Lengua beef tongue/salsa pasilla was ok 

the Pomegranate Margarita was a lil too fruity for my taste 
the Dan Dan Mian hand-cut wheat noodles/
spicy pork sauce/peanuts was great  


i will be back here maybe even this weekend vivaaa las vegas
