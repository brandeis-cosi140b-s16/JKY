I stopped by Rock Taco while in town for a long layover in September. The service was attentive and prompt. Our server kept us entertained, and I really enjoyed their margaritas. The chips and salsa are fresh and made daily and the jalapeno cream cheese chimichanga was DELICIOUS!

The 4" street taco menu is impressive and my husband sampled & enjoyed a few as well as their seasonal beers on tap.

I highly recommend this restaurant!
