This review is for the brand new building they just opened up across from the old one that was much smaller and only did take out. (I think)

So HAPPY I found this place.  This is my new place for Mexican Food in Queen Creek.  This food had such amazing flavor.  The sauce was amazing and the tacos were seasoned perfectly.  We had good service, there was a ton of people there - all who were raving about the place.  Anyway - if you are looking for great Mexican Food in Queen Creek you need to hit this place up TODAY!!!  Again so glad I found it ... Enjoy and let me know if you liked it as much as I did!
