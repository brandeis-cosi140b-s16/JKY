This place is AMAZING!  We've being eating here for years and have never had a bad meal.  The owners are simply the best!  They are the hardest working people I know and the quality of their food reflects their commitment to their business!  And oh, by the way, if you think they are the only restaurant in town that uses a microwave to melt the cheese on their enchiladas, you are wrong.  It's just that not too many restaurants have an open kitchen where you can see how your food is being prepared.
