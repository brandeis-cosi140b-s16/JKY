Amazing flan, great food, cheap tasty drinks.  Color me pleased.  During happy hour until 7PM or all day Sunday it is $3 for a top shelf mojito in Scottsdale, and $5.50 for 5 street tacos.  Seriously, what is better than that?  An early reviewer said expensive, but compared to what? Taco Bell drive thru?
