amazing food....i love mexican food n decided to try this place, and it tasted super good :) i really liked this pork dish they had, it was like a quesadilla w/ marinated pork and pineapple...YUM! my bf even says it tasted just like how he had his food in mexico. try this place, its pretty new so its not fancy but their food is very affordable.
