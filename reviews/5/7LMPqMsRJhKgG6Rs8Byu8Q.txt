Of all the Vegas restaurants we have been to, this is my favorite time and again. We always make sure our Vegas trips include a Saturday or Sunday so we can get the brunch and mimosas. We've been here 4 times already and have at least one more trip planned before 2014 gets here. The popularity has definitely been on the rise since we first tried this place and unfortunately it seems the quality of service is not keeping up with the trend. Brunch is served as small plates that you order, so you need your service to stay on top of both your current dish and your next dish or you wait a long time. Suggestions: 1) when they bring your current dish(es) order your next round 2) order 2 dishes at a time. As far as food: love the guava empanadas and fresh fruit to start the brunch; the PBJ with bacon, egg and jalapeno is incredible despite its unusual combination of ingredients; the skirt steak and eggs is not to be missed; make sure you save room for the churro tots! The menu has recently changed to add a few new dishes which we tried, but we weren't blown away by them. Though, everything is delish and you won't be disappointed. Highly suggest you make reservations!
