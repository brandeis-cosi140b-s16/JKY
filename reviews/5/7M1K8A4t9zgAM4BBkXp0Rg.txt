Love this place! Tortillas are excellent and are available in 5 flavors. So far I've had the open burrito twice. I can barely finish it. So much meat, topped with fresh lettuce, cabbage, corn, black or pinto beans, rice, pickled onions, onions, tomatoes and more. Great chips, too. Crisp and just the right thickness. The salsa bar is full of options as well. This one will be on regular rotation for a while until I've tried all the meats in the various options. So good. Like Rachel L. said, like Chipotle, but local! And with more meat options and more salsa options and just simply better.
