Excellent!!! Food was very good! And they are super friendly. They checked up on me multiple times and asked me if everything is okay with a smile. I ordered the bulgogi tacos with Kim chee and spicy pork bulgogi with rice. Better than any other fusion place I tried. Will be a regular here from now on.
