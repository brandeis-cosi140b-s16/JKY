First off, to that group of 30 who had such a bad experience and are now piling on the 1-star reviews: I'm sorry you had such a bad experience. You did your best to alert them to the size of your group and your needs, and they let you down. I get that. But piling on a ton of 1-star reviews, especially when most of you enjoyed your food, is over the top. IMHO there should be a single review for your entire group. But I digress.

I've been to this place 3-4 times now, and it has never disappointed.  The food has always been fresh and flavorful, and from what I'm told, it's truly authentic New Mexico-style.  The service has always been prompt and friendly. The only thing I don't care for is the noise - the place has a concrete floor and metal (low) ceiling, and it gets quite loud.. but not loud enough to subtract a star, the food and service makes up for it.  Give it a try, and unless you have a huge group that overwhelms, I'll bet you love it.
