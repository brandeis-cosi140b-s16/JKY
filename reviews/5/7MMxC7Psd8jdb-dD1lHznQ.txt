I know five stars seems crazy, but my boyfriend will tell you, I'm obsessed with this place. The waitstaff are friendly, caring, prompt, and efficient. I try to come here every Taco Tuesday, and have been like that for the past two years. There's a Loco in Tukee that I used to go to, but they charge more for drinks and the tacos are never as full. I'm always amazed by how well the staff handles the Taco Tuesdays, where I expect they are extra busy but always get my order out quickly and never seem stressed or rude. Whenever I'm having a dinner with friends or family from out of town, I come here. If it's a Tuesday, I can tacos for $1 and feel full, and a $4 margarita. I come on normal days too because i can always expect the food to be consistent, but I'm a bargain eater at heart. 

Just remember that tacos are normally more expensive, so when you tip, tip off of the normal price, not the Tuesday bargain. Especially if you come back often like me. 

My only real complaint is the DJs are often too loud. I get trying to make it more of a party place to compete with the other places on Mill.... but if it's too loud I feel rushed and can't talk to my friends! But if you come early enough, there's no DJ anyways, haha.
