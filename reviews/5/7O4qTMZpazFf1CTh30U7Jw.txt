Went here with my family last weekend. We were told the wait was about 45 minutes but we were seated within 20. The atmosphere was great! The decor made you feel like you were eating in an outdoor garden even though you were inside.  I love that they give you a bowl of fruit to start out with.  Our server was very helpful and they were very quick. The appetizer sampler was great as well as the nachos. Can't wait to go again.
