One of the better mexican places in central phoenix - and there are no shortage of them.

All the standards are great. The chips are always fresh. The salsa is HOT. Yum. Their guacamole is freshly made. You can't go wrong. So go. 

Some of my favorites
Cheese crisp w green chiles
Albondingas (mexican meatball) soup
Shredded beef taco
Green corn tamales

Some of the items on the grill menu are superb! 
Pork chops (with fries and beans - ask for cheese on beans!)
Short ribs 

You really can't go wrong. It's inexpensive, fresh, home cooked, clean, and delicious. 

Only downside - the margaritas are kind of weak. On the other hand, they are cheap, so you can have 3 and it won't hurt you too much. :)
