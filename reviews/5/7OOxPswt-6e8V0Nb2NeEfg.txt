They just opened a month a go. Cute concept. Reminds me of a cool food truck without the wheels. Had the Seoul burrito. The manager told me Korean sauce is the owners mother in laws family recipe. Good stuff!  My wife had the cancun salad... Fun presentation and the house made dressing is great.  Loved the drink selections!!
