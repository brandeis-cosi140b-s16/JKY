I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.
I am just in love with it.

Everytime I go to the US, I have to go there.
Cheap, super tasty and I love the salad bowl option they have (as I cannot eat wheat flour).
The meat is always tasty and fresh and again .....their guacamole ....the best !!!!

Always clean and fresh with friendly staff.

Healthy fast food .....

Just wish that we had it in Canada !!
