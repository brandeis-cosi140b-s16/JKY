BREAKFAST:  I ordered steak & eggs at the waiter's recommendation and it was delicious. The steak was tender and flavorful but not over bearing.  The server was helpful, friendly and prompt.  I asked for honey for my coffee and he delivered it quickly. Much to my surprise they serve my favorite coffee, Douwe Egberts!!  I took a cup to go.  I recommend this restaurant and I will patronize them again based on this great experience.
