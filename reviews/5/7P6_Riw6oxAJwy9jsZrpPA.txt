I enjoy visiting MC and was really excited when they reopened a few months ago. They'll make a burrito exactly how you want it, which, as a picky sometimes gluten/dairy free eater, I really appreciate it. My special tofu, mushroom and grilled veggie naked burrito is making my mouth water just thinking about it! (I love their rice too!) The staff are super personable and will remember your face if you're a repeat customer. 

Give this place another shot. They've had some growing pains over the years with a management change/closing/reopening but they're here for the long haul and willing to make changes to keep our bellies full and happy!
