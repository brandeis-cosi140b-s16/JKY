The wife and I love Mexican food so tonight since our normal place is closed Mondays thought we would try az kitchen.  It was great a family owned place from the start the greeter held the door open for us we sat down and were served with chips and salsa right away both salsas were very good, I ordered a chicken chimichanga and my wife ordered beef tacos both were very good. We're definitely going back and I'd recommend this place to everyone!
