love, love, love the street tacos.  the best are the chicken, marinated pork, and pork.  didn't care at all for the carne asada, though.  did not find the smoky flavor appealing.

my family ate here on a recent phoenix vacation and we loved it so much we came back for dinner the next day!  that's how good this place is.

wife loved the flan, also.

great food and low prices make this place a real winner.
