I've been bugging my husband to take me here and today we finally went to celebrate the kids going back to school.  It was lunch time and I had to go back to work so I didn't get to try the margarita but my hubby did and he said it was great.  We started with the chips and salsa which is a MUST at Pasqual's and I had the pork carnitas burrito and he had the steak fajita burrito.  Both were served very HOT (which I love) and both were fabulous!  The building is gorgeous and a must see... can't wait to go back for happy hour!
