This is for for the central location....I love it!   Everything is HOT, that's no exaggeration.  Flavor has always been great.  The cramped dining room has been an irritant sometimes, the Hostess has not always been that friendly (Chewing on a workers ass, not mine), the waiters get overwhelmed and forget about you at times, but I've never been disappointed with the food.  Never.  If you can handle the hot (snotty nose hot, not Taco Bell hot), and don't expect to be pampered, this place won't disappoint.  The hot is flavorful in a good way for me.  be forewarned, when I say hot, I mean HOT!  Not Taco Bell Fire Sauce hot (Joke), I mean bring milk in your purse HOT!!! And, (fifth star for this) the Chili Relleno!  Best I've ever had.  I have them everywhere I go, and none compare to this place....period.  Hatch chili's, hot as hell, big, the skin is like an omelet, not greasy batter, the sauce is divine.  No place compares so far....but I'll keep searching.
