They definitely do Tamales the correct way with the proper texture of the Masa.  They get extremely busy during holiday season and the line can be out the door.  It's wise to place your large order in advance, otherwise you'll just get angry waiting in line.  They serve them fresh off the steam table versus pre packaging them which makes for more waiting...The Pork, green Chile and Chicken Tamales are stellar despite the chicken ones getting a tad dry, just moisten the meat before you reheat...Probably the best place in The Valley to get Tamales.  This is their business, their speciality...
