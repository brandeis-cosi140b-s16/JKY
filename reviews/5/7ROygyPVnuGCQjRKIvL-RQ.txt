Found a new favorite. The Carne Asada Nachos. Loaded with meat, cheese, sour cream and chips. I assume they come with Guac too but I forgo that part. Be sure to get pico with it. 

The kids said the bean burritos were not as good as before. BUT said the tacos were yummy. David may be on to something.
