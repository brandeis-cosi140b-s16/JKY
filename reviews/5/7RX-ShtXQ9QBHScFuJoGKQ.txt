Tacos de Pastor were bomb! Staff is friendly and very on top of things. We waiting around five minutes for our food and had everything in our table warm and ready to eat. I recommend trying their Fresas con Crema cup is great to help with your sweet tooth at the end of the meal. Glad we came here instead of regular franchise "chipotle".
