I don't know which one I went to.
I went once a few years back, but ALL i remember is:

Pollo con Queso.
AMAZING.
and Cheese Crisps.
Californians.. you don't know what you're missing.
Just enough cheese.
Just enough crispy tortilla.


But the Chicken smothered in cream cheese and cheddar- is to die for. 
Or at least drive over the state line for.

The reason I go to Arizona [besides family] is all about the Mexican food.
