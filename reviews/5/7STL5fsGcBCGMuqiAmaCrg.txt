Working close by, I get takeout from here a lot. So, while I can't claim to know what their table service is like, their takeout always takes just about 15 minutes. Their tacos are amazing - I love the sauce that comes with the carnitas tacos. Anything else I've ordered has always been tasty, mostly enchiladas and their giant chimichangas. And as an extra plus, it usually lasts me for two days of lunches.

I walked down to the store and forgot my wallet once. The owner told me to come back later and pay for my check instead of rushing back and forth. He wanted me to eat my food while it was hot. You definitely don't see that level of trust and friendliness from most restaurants.
