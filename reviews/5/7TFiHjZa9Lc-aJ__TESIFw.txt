Extremely surprised,  this little store front is producing some fantastic mexican food.  It is all fresh made to order with a salsa bar that has some great flavorful salsas.  I had the steak street tacos which included 3 tacos, mexican rice, beans and garnished with a hand full of tortilla chips all for around $8 this included a complimentary bottle of water. I will be back!
