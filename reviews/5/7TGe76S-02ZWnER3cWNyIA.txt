This place was so cheap and so good. This is how you do it. step up to the counter order from the easy to read menu and pick up your food when its ready (chips & salsa included free). You can get your burrito Fried, Wet (enchilada style) or regular. I recommend the red chili sauce.  I will be back very often.
