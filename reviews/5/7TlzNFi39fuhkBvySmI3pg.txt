This is by far the best Mexican food I've had here in Charlotte! Everything about my experience stood out as above par: the food was excellent, the atmosphere was wonderful , and the staff was amazing! 

My husband and I decided to try it out one night while my parents were in town--which is always a risky move-- but it was well worth the risk. We were all extremely satisfied, and each had an amazing meal. All of us are extremely picky when it comes to authentic Mexican food (all being from Southern California), so to leave with all of us being more then excited is really a feat! 

We started our meal with a trio of Pico De Gallo, Guacamole, and Queso without Chirozo. Each dish was fresh and unique. And the chips had a flavorful salt on them that only added to the flavor of the dips.

Our server was amazingly helpful with the menu, and very friendly. He explained that each dish could be made vegetarian no problem, so we could easily order anything. I was very excited! He even checked to make sure their mole sauce was vegetarian, which it was! I love mole sauce, but rarely find a place that makes it vegetarian. So, of course I ordered their veggie mole enchiladas! Fantastic choice: full of flavor, fresh ingredients, and an unique pallet. 

Between all of us, we ordered Tacos, a Chimichunga, and Carne Asada. None of us were disappointed, and we all already want to go back. 

Also, shout out to the best margaritas! No mix, just lime, tequila, and triple sec. I'm pretty sure they go heavier on the triple sec then the tequila and that's why they are a little sweeter then most, but it totally works for them. Strong but sweet drinks: I can already see this being a favorite establishment, and I've only been there once! 

Amazing, just absolutely amazing!
