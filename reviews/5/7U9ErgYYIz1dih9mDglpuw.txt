My family has eaten here 3 times in the past month and both the food and service has been excellent. Fresh chips and salsa has been present each time, and wait staff have been attentive in providing more. I love the shrimp chimichanga and have ordered it twice. Generous amount of very fresh shrimp in a light yet crisp shell. The steak burritos are highly recommended - the steak used is much better quality than I have experienced in other area Mexican restaurants. This has quickly become our favorite Mexican restaurant!
