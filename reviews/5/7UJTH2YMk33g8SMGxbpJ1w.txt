So GOOD. 

Every bite was delicious. 

We ordered 6 carne asada tacos, 1 fish taco, bottled coke and a coke can....total was under $16 :) The asada tacos come plain but don't worry...there is a salsa bar with different salsas, onions, pico, lime, cilantro, carrots and jalape√±os (basically any taco topping you need). Asada meat is great...no fat....A lot of the the other taco places I've been to don't really seem to understand that gristle, is not good. The fish taco came with lettuce, tomato and red onion...very good.

The service is great.....seems family owned and operated....I love that!

This place hit the spot! We will definitely be back!
