Five stars for that guacamole and horchata. Maize is seriously good. Don't expect a great dine-in experience, the place is the size of a shoebox. But anything on their menu is awesome. It's not hard to please college students, and Maize could certainly get by with lower quality food being so close to campus town. Yet and still, they provide authentic Mexican cuisine at great prices.
