you know it's good Mexican food when only Mexicans are dining in!
At first, the prices were like "WTF!" (yeah I said wtf) BUT when my humongous carnitas gordita came out, I seriously was only able to eat that one item, the carnitas was loaded in that pocket!!!  (great maiz flavor of the gordita masa, by the way)
My guest chose the carne asada Hondureno and it had 5 large thinly sliced steak pieces and 4 large halves of delicious fried plaintain... very delicious.  The beans (frijoles de la hoya) had sooooo much flavor.

BIG prices but also BIG portions... it is afterall Madison Wisconsin ;)
