Great new place, had a large group of family in and it could not have been better.  Food was outstanding, really loved the tri tip nachos and the taco sampler platter.  Had a new beer I had heard about called Mex 1, it is a home town brewery and really was very good, would definitely recommend over corona.  Be on the look out for it!!  Service is excellent and friendly.  The owner Jeff even came by our table and made sure everything was perfect.  Next time you are close, it is a must try!!!
