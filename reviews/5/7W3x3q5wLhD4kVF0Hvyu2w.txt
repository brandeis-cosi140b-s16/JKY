The best Mexican food in Arizona.  Salazar Brothers is back and better than ever.

They reopened at Guadalupe and Rural in a stand alone building on the northeast corner.

The oil is vegetable oil and they serve breakfast items all day.  Some off the menu items include rice bean and cheese burrito, potato tacos .


The food is very good very clean I eat here at least once a week
