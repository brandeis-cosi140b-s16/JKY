Best Mexican fast food in the valley.  DON'T go to other Salsita's expecting what you get here at the 16th St location.  This is the best one!!!  We eat here waaaay to much to be unbiased, just so you know.....

Bean burritos, cheese quesadillas, and occasional shrimp burritos are our staples.  Make sure to order guaca-pico on your burrito...that's what they call it.  And, we think the day cook is better than the night cook, but they are both very good.

The inside is a fun, divey, middle of the night and your kid still isn't asleep-friendly kind of place.  Salsa bar and homemade frescas round out the Filiberto's style menu.
