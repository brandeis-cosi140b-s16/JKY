Third time here and no real complaints. Food is good and the happy hour margaritas have always been on point. Service has been friendly and courteous. I met the GM (Rana) this evening and I can see why I have always been pleased. Rana assisted me with seating and without my knowing of her position I offered her a tip which she refused. She simply asked that I extend it to the server. Will be back. Thanks Rana!
