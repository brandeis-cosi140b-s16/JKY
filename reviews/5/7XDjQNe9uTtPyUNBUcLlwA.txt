I LOVE the food here!  I think that they need to probably work on turning the tv to some thing everyone would enjoy and keep it off of Roping- Not to keen on that. Also as much as I love kids there are sometimes when you don't want them running through the dining room.  All in all the food is great but don't expect it to be a quiet romantic dinner :)
