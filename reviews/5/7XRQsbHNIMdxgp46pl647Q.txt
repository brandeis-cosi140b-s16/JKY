From the atmosphere to the food, everything always seems to be on point at Paz. I always opt for the tacos (duh). Their carne asada and taco del mar (calamari) are my go to. Special $3 margarita AND they have Mexican beers!! Victoria in cans! I'm sold. Always friendly waiters, too. Just wish they'd play more music that suits the atmosphere.
