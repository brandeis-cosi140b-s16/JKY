My brother come here all the time! The owner already knows us! The owner has such a great presence! My brother always gets the super Bueno burrito. Their homemade tortillas make the burrito! I love their homemade salsa! Mmmm I always buy it! And their chips too! I wish they were open on Sunday's but it's nice that they aren't as well so they can be with their families
