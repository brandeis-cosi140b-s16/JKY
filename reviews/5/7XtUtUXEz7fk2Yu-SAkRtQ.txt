Taste bud paradise! It is really hard to name my favorites, I've been there 4 times since they opened and it's true love. I've never had Spanish rice like this - an inventive concoction that includes chorizo and pineapple chunks. You must also have the short rib tacos. You're welcome. The carne asada and al pastor are also wonderful. The guac is acado-riffic and the fresh, limey, just-the-right-amount-of-everything, ceviche is going to be the absolute perfect meal come summer. Go on Sangria Saturday for the perfect experience. The best part are the prices - completely reasonable. My husband and I had an app, an adult beverage and a whole lot of tacos and rice for about $30. There's not a lot of seating inside so get there early in the 100+ degree days. Enjoy!
