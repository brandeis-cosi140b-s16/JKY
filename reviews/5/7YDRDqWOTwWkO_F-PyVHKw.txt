I love zabas, its one of the few places I can eat repeatedly.

The chicken has this wonderful seasoning, its subtle at first, but the more you eat, the better it is.  

I find the steak here to be a bit bland at times, so I save that for when I'm just looking for a little bite.

They added shrimp a few months ago, omg, I don't even like seafood, shrimp, anything like that, but shrimp tacos here? Wonderful.  A very nice alternative to the beef or chicken I normally eat.

I like to make my own combos, so here are some of my favorites.

For breakfast I like a breakfast burrito on a wheat tortilla made with chorizo, real eggs, potatos, a teensy bit of pinto beans, and a lot of cheese.

For lunch I tend to get flour tacos with chicken, a little bit of pinto beans, cheese, and cholula.  

If I'm in a "different" mood, I might get a steak chesadilla, drip some cholula on it along a little bit of pinto beans on the side.  Its awesome.

Many of my coworkers, like another commenter, love the fish tacos, personally I'm a bit afraid of sea food, but one day I'll take the plunge (maybe). o_0

Everything here is made fresh, the chips, the guac (the fresh guac is awesome, unfortunately being allergic to onions, I have to avoid it except in small amounts), the salsas, the chicken, the beef.  Nothing comes out of a bag premade except for the tortillas!  

Wow, wish I could get over there in time, I'd have some tonight. ^_^

Oh, and for iced tea lovers, they use fresh brewed shrangri-la brand iced tea, which personally I find to be nonbitter and I drink without any sort of sweetener.
