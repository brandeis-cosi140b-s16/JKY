Fantastic burrittos! And a great delivery option if you're staying downtown. We put in an 11-burritto order and Burrito Factory got it to us correct and hot. While I thought they were right on time, the man delivering our order thought he was too late and refused to let me tip him. I wanted to write this post to say thank you and I will definitely be back in the future.
