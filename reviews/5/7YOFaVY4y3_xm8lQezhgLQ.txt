We stumbled across this little place because our typical Sunday breakfast place, Vovomeena, was packed. We decided to hop on yelp and saw this place pop up nearby. It's not much from the outside but don't let it deter you from going inside. The people are so warm and friendly! This is a mom and pop small business and they are just getting started but the food was very good. We ordered the breakfast burrito and chilaquiles and they were both delicious. I like my chilaquiles spicier so if you want more fire make sure to ask. The salsas that came out with the chips had a great kick. The menu was simple and had 5 or 6 things listed for breakfast, lunch and dinner which made deciding a lot easier. I then made my way across the street to treehouse bakery for a cookie. Great little location.
