I'm a hard to please guy..look at my prior reviews, you'll see, and I love this place.  So much more than the typical Phoenix Mexican fare of everything bland, slathered in refried beans and cheap greasy cheese...the food here has flavor and reasonable prices.  The salsas are typical cheap bottled, mass produced tasting, and sadly no pico available at the salsa bar, but I rarely find myself wishing for it here anyways.  I keep coming back for more though :)
