So I saw this place when I was out driving around and decided to take a chance on em... I wasn't disappointed! I got the sopes and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The meat was flavored well, the sopes wasn't hard and dried out, the beans and rice that came with it were quite tasty as well.  What really made them stand apart was their service though. Everyone in their was beyond friendly... So much so I was gonna give 4 stars but I had to give em 5! Go check em out!
