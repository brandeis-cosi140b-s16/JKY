I love Chipotle.
The food always tastes fresh and the ingredients are the above standard. The design of the great, simple, modern and ergonomic.
Chipotle uses only natural meats, not factory farmed hormone injected animals. And some of the beans are organic. 
Although the menu choices seem limited, burrito, tacos or bowl, the combinations are endless with the different types of meat, beans, salsas, etc. The menu is more than accommodating to vegans, vegetarians and carnivores alike. They serve domestic and Mexican bottled beers as well as fountain drinks. The portions are huge, the burritos could easily be mistaken for a newborn baby wrapped in tin foil.
Don't be put off by the lunch line. No matter how long the line is, which it is usually really long, you will get your food fairly quickly. I have spent many lunches here when the line was nearly out the door I was still in and out in a reasonable time.
It is refreshing to have a business that actually cares and at the same time serve an amazing product.
