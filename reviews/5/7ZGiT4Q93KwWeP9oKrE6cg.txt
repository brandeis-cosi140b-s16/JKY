A very little known but great Mexican restaurant in Surprise. Easy to miss, it's tucked away next to the UltraStar threater. 

Far better than any of the other local alternatives (Rio Mirage, Macayos). Food is great, salsa is incredible, and staff is very friendly. Great environment too. A must try, you won't be sorry.
