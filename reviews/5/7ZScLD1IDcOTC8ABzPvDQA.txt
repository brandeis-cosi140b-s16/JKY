This little place has the best tacos I've had in the area.  The way they cook all of the meats right on the coal fired grill behind the counter, along with the various toppings, makes for a brilliant little place to stop in for lunch.

My only regret about Ta Carbon is there is no location in the east valley!   I have a feeling they'd make a ton of money out here, as there aren't a lot of taco shacks with amazing food.  I just wish I lived closer.
