IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
If you have a gluten allergy, COME HERE. They know exactly what you can eat. They gladly point out the various DELICIOUS options :) 

I highly recommend it!

The dish was a GREAT deal for what was given! The service was great also, my cup never stayed halfway full. And having an allergy, they quickly showed us what we could have. The food was cooked perfectly for my liking and was so filling I couldn't finish and had to take it home. 

Everything was up to my standards if not above!
