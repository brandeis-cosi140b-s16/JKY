I just don't know what happened! This was one of the best kept secrets in Phoenix and now it's completely MIA. La Parilla Villa was home to the best street tacos in all of Phoenix. It was simple, consistently delicious and tacos were only $1! They were only open on the weekends and were located right outside of Charlie's, but the truck is gone and has yet to return. I am saddened...
