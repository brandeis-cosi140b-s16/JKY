Don Panchos Taqueria is the sole reason why I am addicted to tortas. This place is beyond delicious and is the best Mexican food joint I have ever had to the pleasure to eat at to this day. I have been visiting this place for over nine years. They not only have a salsa bar, they have a vegtable bar where you can load up on unlimited carrots, cucumber, lemons, oniions ect. The service is always welcoming and genuinely friendly. I have a little place in my heart for Don Panchos Taqueria, I would urge anyone to take the trip and enjoy this amazing little place :) The restaurant is pretty hood, but that is the least of it once you try it! Your mouth will consistantly water for it.. :)
