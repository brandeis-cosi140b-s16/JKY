I'm here right now..third time this week. Small but clean and newly renovated ...the food is outrageously good..I have had their carne asada torta(my favorite), carne asada buritto and the adobada buritto , bean and cheese burrito(best I ever had) and now the breakfast burrito( not big but still good) and horchata . Everything is great and you can definitely tell its fresh. There salsa is also freshly made everyday ..its a little hidden between the 76  gas station and creative kids learning center.
