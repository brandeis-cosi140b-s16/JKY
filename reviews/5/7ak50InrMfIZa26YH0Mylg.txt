Wow.  Definitely a place that is known by the locals.  It's far from the strip and worth the trip....When u eat the chips u r already pulled n...When u taste the Frijoles that come with the chips u ' re thinking,  okay, I really like this. ..order the guacamole and fall in love...it's creamy and immensely flavorful.  It was lunch so I ordered a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. ..I don't know how to describe it but every morsel of that taco was tantalizing!  The Cadillac margarita was smooth. ...AND the had the US Open on the big screen!   Honey,  I'm home!
