We frequent this place often enough to have tried several of the menu items. All have been awesome! The manager is super friendly every time we have gone in and plus military gets free drinks! Way to go Fredericos!  Breakfast burritos rock too so go in the morning too or order one any other tine as the menu is available all day which is nice.
