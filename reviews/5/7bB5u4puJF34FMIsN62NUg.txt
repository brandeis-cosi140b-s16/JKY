i think this is the one for premium outlets south. amazing they have lobster. but $13 for a lobster burrito. oh well its vegas. kinda redic for fast food. but when ya starving ya starving. asked for extra guac and they actually put it in ( very little lobster of corse) they cut my burrito in half which was a nice touch none of the other ones do it. the guy even spelled my name right. i didnt look at the other places to eat there. but yes i love rubios but ya its not cheap. love the salsa bar and chips
