Let me start off by saying... I don't give five star reviews often, but when I do, it's with a purpose! 

When you come to El Chino's, it's not in the vest of neighborhoods or a mega shopping center, who cares about that??!! When I am hungry,  the only thing that I care about is GOOD food and a clean restaurant, and quality service is always a plus. I will tell you this place has ALL THREE! The owner was super appreciative that we went off the beaten path to come to his restaurant. I would tell you to close your eyes and read this review as if you were me, but that would make much sense! 
I had the carne asada burrito and I have to say... hands down, second to none, and without a doubt, this is THE BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had in my life! They make the steak for you and put the rice and beans on your burrito and then you add all your toppings (kinda like a self-serve Chipotle) then you give it back to them and they wrap it for you. My burrito ended up being about the size of my forearm! 
I literally thought about this place all day... the best meal that I have had in a long time, and if I was anywhere close to this place when I return to AZ I will go out of my way to come back here. Without question. Without hesitation. 
Awesome job El Chino's... you gave me a complete different appreciation for authentic mexican food. 
I. Cant. Wait. To. Go. Back. 

Now....... I am drooling
