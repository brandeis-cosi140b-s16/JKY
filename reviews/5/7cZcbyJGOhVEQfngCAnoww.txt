This place is hidden and worth the trip.  I have been here several times.  We tried the bean and cheese burrito, carne asada burrito, coconut shrimp and a chicken quesadilla.  The food is fresh and tasty.  I like the green sauce and guacamole they give you.  Even the chips and salsa are great!  The place is nice and clean and the staff is really friendly.  They now have happy hour 2pm-6pm with half off appetizer and $3 drink specials.  I still want to try the breakfast omelette's as I hear they are really good too.
