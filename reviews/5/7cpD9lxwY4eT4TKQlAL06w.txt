Tacos Atoyac is in a very unassuming location next to a 7-Eleven and a smoke shop but don't be fooled the food is lights out!!! Tried most every item on their menu and have been pleased with everything that I've tried. The Pastor and Fish Tacos are some of the best you're likely to find anywhere, the burros are killer as well! One suggestion is to call in your order ahead of time if you are going to try and go during the lunch rush, can take as long as 30-40 minutes for your order to come up. That being said there are certainly times where you can walk right up and order and easily find a place to sit, I've found that's usually after 2:00 p.m. Grew up in Southern California surrounded by incredible Mexican food, this place could hold it's own against the best out there for sure!
