Very top notch experience here, so much so I'd even say it caught me a bit off guard. As a frequenter of many local Mexican food restaurants around the valley I've been accustomed to somewhat mediocre service followed up with a sub-par product. However, special thank yous go to Tonya, Daniela, and Tony (I am 99.9% sure those were the names) for making last night's dining experience one that felt above and beyond in comparison with it's many competitors and counterparts. Will be back soon, thank you again!!
