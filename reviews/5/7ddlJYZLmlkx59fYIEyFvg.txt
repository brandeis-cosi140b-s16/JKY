This place is really quite good ! Scottsdale is not generally the best city for food, but This one is really delicious. I've not tried one bad dish yet. It's very consistent! It's also kind of nice that the portions are small ! It's just perfect for people that are looking to enjoy a classy setting with some gourmet food that isn't going to make you regret your caloric intake! The owner has 2-3 more restaurants in the valley (different types of cuisines) and every restaurant he is involved in is delicious !!! I guess it pays off to live and study in Europe :) .
