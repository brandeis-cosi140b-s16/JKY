So we're new to the area and looking for a good authentic Mexican food spot. This Lil hole in the wall place is legit! It is small and there was only one waitress but the food is delicious. My bf had the pupusas and they were delicious. I had the shrimp cocktail. Amazing!! Oh and their michelads are perfect. We are definitely coming back here.
