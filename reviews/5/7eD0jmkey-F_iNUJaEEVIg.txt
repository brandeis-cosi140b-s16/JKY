I don't know exactly what it is about this place.  It certainly doesn't offer much in ambience or service,  and the menu is not gourmet in any sense,  but it simply consists of great Mexican food - and there is just no way of getting around it.  Simple, inexpensive,  filling, reliable, and addictive.   What more can you ask for?
