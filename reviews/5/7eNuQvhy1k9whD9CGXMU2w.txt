We were searching for some decent food at a decent price in the shoppes at Mandalay Bay. We were very impressed with the service and especially with food at Hussong's. We found the prices to be reasonable, offering a good value for the food provided.The Guacamole was excellent, but they serve you a mountain of it so it was more than me and my friend could eat. Maybe a group of four could have eaten all of it. It was nice to have some complementary chips and salsa, which is the standard for Mexican food restaurants, especially in a place like Las Vegas where everything costs something. Everything we had was intensely flavorful and well-prepared. The service was prompt and courteous.
