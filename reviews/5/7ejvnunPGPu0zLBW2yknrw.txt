Love this place! I keep thinking I'm going to try their barbecue but when I get there I just have to have the green chili shredded beef burrito again! It is so good. I'm also addicted to the gringo green salsa! I usually get my food to go but I am looking forward to eating there when the weather cools down a little more. It isn't too bad with the mist system on even in the summer though. Try it!!
