I ABSOLUTELY AM OBSESSED WITH THIS PLACE!! 

Went here for the first time with my boyfriend. We got the redondo & long beach. I am now completely addicted. 

It has that chipotle feel where you can build your own burrito but on a way better level because it's sushi! 

The staff is very nice and they're helpful when you ask questions about substitutions and such. 

I hope they open one closer to where I live. South side needs one! Sahara is so far and such a busy street all the time and there's always construction! But for the time being, it's definitely worth the drive!
