I went in expecting a tasty sandwich. This place delivered a masterpiece. I ordered the Del Rey and was not disappointed. After ordering, the food arrived within 15 minutes and was bigger than expected. The atmosphere is really casual, and the wait staff is very polite. I had no idea about the Man vs. Food episode when I visited, but the reviews on Yelp were enough to persuade me here.
