This was my first time here and all I can say is wow! The food is really delicious and you won't be disappointed. I ordered the chicken enchiladas verdes combo plate and my hubby had the carne asada plate, while my child had the quesadilla kids plate. We all were really happy with the quality of the food, it's just so authentic. Oh yeah, we also ordered the horchata, and it was absolutely perfect, not too sweet and oh so good! 

If you aren't sure about trying this place I suggest you just give it a chance. You will be glad you did.
