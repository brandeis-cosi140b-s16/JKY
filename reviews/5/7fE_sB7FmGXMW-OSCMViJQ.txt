...  so you have been frustrated with the lack of any good venues in Phoenix since Nitas closed...  a gazillion years ago.

Enter The Crescent Ballroom.  This place is unbelievable.  I clocked in 3 shows the opening week and was VERY impressed.

When you enter the venue you are first in the front lounge area.  Two front patios pair the door and are ample size for open air drifters and proud smokers.  Inside the lounge, there is an airy feel due to the huge un obtrusive  door that open to the patios.  It is appointed with a nice piano for piano happy hour and DJs are occasionally assigned to play the hippest tunes.  

From here you can enter the main room of the venue where the main acts play.  The stage is to the right and huge.  There is bleacher seating (like nice rich wood bleachers) along the left hand wall.  Straight ahead you will find another large bar...  don't worry about not getting a drink quick here.  

The sound is amazing.  It is loud, but not hurt your ears loud.  Most likely due to the master crafting Sound man who is the resident there.  They spared no expense in equipping this place, because first and foremost, it is a music venue.  They take that business very seriously.

The show I saw were perfectly balance and a pleasure to watch.  

My favorite part about this place...  you don't get pushed out the door when the show is over.  It almost feels weird to not get herded out.   The front lounge offers up the best post show spot where show goers can chat about life, music and bikes...  I have never seen such an impressive mass of hip bikes in my life.

Do yourself a favor, pick a show - any show and make a night of it at the Crescent.  It is awesome.
