If you are looking for EXCELLENT Mexican food - this is your place. The prices are great and the food is terrific! Nowhere in town will you get better refried beans - yes, they use lard but if you are wanting health food go to a salad bar!! If you want the best mexican food - go to Mucho Taco. My favorites are the #1 Taco, Enchilada, Rice & Beans or the Carnita Torta!! Yum! Yum!!
The employees are great and attentive and the restaurant is clean - big bonus!!
