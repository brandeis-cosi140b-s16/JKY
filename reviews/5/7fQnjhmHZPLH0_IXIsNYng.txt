Barrio does not take reservations.  I was a little apprehensive about throwing a surprise birthday party there.  We showed up, announced I needed seating for eight at 6:30... and was seated about 90 seconds later.  

What do you say about the food?  Not sure how it could improve.  Best guac (I hate guacamole) on the planet.  My foodie guests were delighted.  

We will be back.
