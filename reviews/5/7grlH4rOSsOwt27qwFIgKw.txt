This has to be one of the best family restaurants I have ever been to, and I have eaten all over the world.The place is so clean you could eat off the floor, the food is magnificent to say the least.Me and my family eat at this restaurant every time we come to North Carolina and that is about 4 times a year.The owner treats you like family and the staff treats each customer as if they were a movie star visiting their restaurant. Belive me this restaurant is the best that you will ever encounter .Do yourself a favor and visit this place .you will keep on coming back.
