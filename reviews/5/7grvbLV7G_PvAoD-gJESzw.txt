Went to the Sat. Brunch. For around $14 u get all you can eat, 1 Alcoholic drink, Unlimited Drinks(including mexican drinks like Horchata, etc) Unlimited fresh handmade tortillas & Salsa/Dips. 
The food had plenty of choices and were AUTHENTIC homestyle cooked foods. Some of the Choices included: Scramble egg dishes like "a la Mexicana" & "with Chorizo", They had salad & Nopales. Chilaqueles (Red & Green), All kinds of Mexican Stews like "Beef Chile Rojo", "Chile Verde(Pork)", FANTASTIC Carnitas(Bone in), Chicken Mole, Camarones ala Diabla and other classic mexican Meat stews. The BIRRIA de Chivo(Goat) was my favorite dish(topped with Onion, Cilantro and lime), my running mates said the MENUDO was fantastic but i couldnt stop eating the Birria so i didnt try it. It was so good all my buddies went again on Sunday but i decided to skip brunch and just workout the hangover lol. The Brunch ends at 2pm so my buds ordered Enchiladas verde de Pollo(Chicken/Green), Carne Asada Soft tacos(with Handmade tortillas), Caldo de Res, Enchiladas Rojas de pollo(Red/Chicken) and a Chicken Quesadilla to go. Everything was between 4-5stars, The Green Enchiladas & the Caldo de Res were perfect 5 stars. I also enjoyed the fresh table-made Guacamole, the salsa & bean dip with chips and the Flour hand made tortillas are awesome!!(corn are good too). The bathrooms are great and the atmosphere is very homey.
SERVICE WAS SUPERB!!! The food was 5stars but when combined with the GREAT Service guarantees i will come here atleast 2 times everytime i head to vegas!!
MUST TRY!
