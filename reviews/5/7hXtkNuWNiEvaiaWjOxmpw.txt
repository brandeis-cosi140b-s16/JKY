5 stars doesn't properly sum up my affection for this beloved establishment. While just a prepubescent teen I discovered the wonderful world of Taco Bell. It was a gringo heaven. All the delights of Mexican food without all the cow stomachs and germs. Wrapped in a beautifully soft flour tortilla that I could use to wipe my posterior if needs be. Once upon a time I did a fairly accurate fiscal analysis in regards to how much money I had spent at T-bell in my lifetime. Figuring that I've eaten there at least once a week for the majority of the years that I've had hair on my schmeckel, and extensive periods where I ate there nearly every day, I projected an approximate number that rings out at a cool $4,700. I don't know if there are any specific accolades for this fantastic achievement, my only suggestion would be that they come up with one. Until then, continue wrapping your mystery meat in those beautiful tortillas and fill them with your molten hot beans. I will continue to deep throat those burritos and spend the subsequent hours on the toilet, but I'll do it with a smile the whole time.
