The food is the best Mexican food in the valley!  I take my out of town guests here all the time.  Wish it was closer to me, I have to drive 15 plus miles, but it's worth it!  The food is fresh and the salsa and chips are amazing.  My favorite place for good quality Mexican food.  Please open a location in Scottsdale!!!
