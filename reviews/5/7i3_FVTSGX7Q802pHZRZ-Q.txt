I'm not sure where some of these negative reviews come from. Went there last night and the experience was awesome. From the walkway to the front door, the decor, ambiance and vibe was stellar. Food was delicious, portions were perfect and service was top notch. Our server Gerardo was very attentive and checked on us frequently even with a full house on a Saturday night. I left feeling like a regular. I'll definitely come back and will tell friends to go check it out as well!
