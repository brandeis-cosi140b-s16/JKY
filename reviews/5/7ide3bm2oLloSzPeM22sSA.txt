Hidden GEM, is definitely worth checking out. Authentic Mexican cuisine with an exotic twist, love this place and it's amazing family service from the moment you walk in. All items are delicious, yet the corn will definitely hit the spot. If your from the Midwest and ever had an Elote, this will take you back!!! A+++ Business!
