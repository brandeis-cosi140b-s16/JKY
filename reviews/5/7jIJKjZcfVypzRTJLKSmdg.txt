nothing like chicken soup from a central american joint to bring you back to life after a rough night. 

Obviously I had the sopa de pollo and it was pretty delicious and an absolute monster of a portion. hangover aside, finishing more than half of it would be some kind of challenge. It came filled with chicken, potatoes, carrots, squash and a big serving of rice.

I also got a baleado, which is sort of similar to a quesadilla but with a different sort of fluffier thicker tortilla which at $3.25 filled with cheese, beans, eggs and sour cream is a real steal.
