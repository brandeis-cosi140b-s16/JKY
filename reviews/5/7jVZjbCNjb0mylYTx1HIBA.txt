This was the location where I fell inlove with Chipotle. This is the most authentic Mexican chained fast food restaurant I've been to. I've tried almost everything on their menu and its very tasty for such low price. They also offer quesdillas which is not on the menu which is pretty good. 

Their homemade gucamole seals the deal. its d-e licious! its good with the burrito, taco, burrito bowl, or as a dip for the chips! 

IM SO GLAD they have recently opened locations near san francisco!
