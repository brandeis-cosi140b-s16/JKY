I haven't been disappointed ever! The people, the food  and the music(weekends) add up to a pleasing experience time and time again. i sit in the bar area booths and can see the T V's plus I especially like my server Tabatha. Tabatha works exclusively in the bar area; she  is friendly competent and caring. Tabatha gets it right and is an Asset to Manuels. Even when she is busy she gives the attention to make sure you feel welcomed and are pleased with your meal.  For excellent Mexican food and good peoole-especially Tabatha - try Manuels -you will probably come back over and over like me! btw I am a lover of chili rellenos - love theirs!
