I've had this place bookmarked on yelp to try for awhile so I was excited when to come here with my boyfriend last night. This place is located in downtown Gilbert right next to Postinos. Since it was a Friday night the wait was long but We got there just before the rush so we only had to wait 40min. The inside was very hipster and the servers were all very friendly. They brought out the chips and salsa right away. It was so good we got seconds :) I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we started off with the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. It was a nice twist using ahi tuna on the ceviche instead of the usual shrimp. I got the crispy fish,chicken Tinga and short rib tacos. My boyfriend got the carne Asada, shrimp and Baja fish. I would defiantly recommend the crispy fish and shrimp tacos!!! The tacos were the perfect size and very flavorful. The only down side is that the tacos range from 3.50 to 4.50 per taco. A bit on the pricey side for the small tacos but there so tasty ;) then they gave us free dessert because of how long we had to wait to get our table. They didn't have  to do that for us but we defiantly appreciated it. We ordered the churros and took it home to eat. The churros were nice and crispy! I defiantly would come back & recommend this place to try.
