The perfect storm of circumstance, opportunity and Yelp Talk all came together today:)

The resulting irresistible mountainous wave of food based desire pushed me down the street, and back to David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food:)

I've been there several times since I wrote the original review and I will submit that there aren't many better spots for a burger, vanilla malt, or chicken mole` in Scottsdale (and I think I would bet money on the fact there aren't any other places where you could get all three in the same lunch order:)

Today was special, I saw a talk thread started by Samantha O, asking about chili, and remembered (that's right...so good I remembered it:) a chili-size I had there a couple of months ago...chili-licious:)

I also ran my morning route along the canal (6 miles, didn't get mugged, decapitated or any of the other things that are rumored to happen to unsuspecting canal joggers...perhaps it's because I'm a suspecting canal jogger:)...at any rate, I was sorely in need of a retox:)

And Pure is closed (another 1/2 written review, down the drain...oh well:) and it was probably too early to have a cocktail at Brackin's (even though it appears they are now open at noon! :-)

So I thought, "OK, I'll take the bullet and try the bowl of chili at David's, to see if it's really that good"...that's right, I threw myself on the chili bowl so you, my fellow Yelpers, would not have to...

You're Welcome!

David's chili is as good as the rest of their offerings...spicy, no-bean chili, plenty of heat for most flat-landers...if you are like me, you need a bit more heat and David's will hand you the bottle of hot sauce to get you there:-)

Add a vanilla malt and great and friendly service and what more could you ask for from your lunch?

Well, I'll tell you what more you could ask for...you could ask for Tom Jones in Las Vegas, circa 1974, playing on the 4 flat screens, in living, dazzling color...and that's what you would get...yup, "Delilah", She's a Lady" and, interestingly enough, his version of "Lucy in the Sky, with Diamonds" serenaded me during my delightful lunch today:-)

Vintage Tom Jones, new art on the wall and consistently terrific food and service move the needle to 5 stars for David's:)
