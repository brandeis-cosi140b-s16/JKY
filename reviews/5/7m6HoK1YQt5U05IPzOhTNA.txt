We've been waiting for this place to open. It finally did about a week ago & tonight we finally got to drop in. The place is sparkling clean and very quiet. We surveyed the hanging menu for a bit & then went to the counter and ordered. A chicken empanadas, a beef empanadas, chicken enchiladas in green sauce, 3 hard chicken tacos, a carnitas taco, 2 carne asada tacos, and a bowl of chips. 

Every item is prepared individually so the food becomes ready at different times. They kindly delivered each item to our table for us. All of the food was wonderful. Not one of us tasted a dish that we didn't like. We each left stuffed. 

The service was so kind and yet low key that it felt as if we had been welcomed into the proprietor's home to eat with the family. The food was fresh, authentic, and made from the heart. Our family will return to this family owned business to dine on their simple Veracruz cuisine.

Edited to move up from 4 stars to 5.  I've moved away and miss this place.
