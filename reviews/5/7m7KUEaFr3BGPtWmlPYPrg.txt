What is not to love about Chipotle!

Awesome fresh ingredients, plenty of choices fresh delicious guacamole!

What I love most about this place is that even though the menu is not extensive you know every time you go you will get the freshest products made the way you want it!

Today I decided to get a chicken bowl...skipped the burrito to add extra cheese and sour cream (at least saying it that way makes me feel better). I had it topped with the hot salsa, corn salsa, sour cream, cheese and lettuce....chips and guac on the side and you have yourself a great meal!

And it's so filling....I promise you will have enough for two meals...great meal and great experience! 

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
