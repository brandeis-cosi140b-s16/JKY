This place is incredible. My husband and I have been going here for years since it was named "Salsa's". Their nachos are to die for. Best nachos in town. They have huge portions and tasty margaritas. They always have drink specials so be sure to ask. Fun atmosphere and they have a patio for the summer months. This place has become a staple for us in Charlotte. Best place around!
