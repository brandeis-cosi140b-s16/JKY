I have been coming here for lunch weekly, some weeks multiple times, for almost 6 years...there is a reason!  This place ruined all other Mexican food for me because now I compare everything to Cafe Zamora.  The carnitas is fabulous, the green chili is excellent, and if you really want a spicy treat get the Shrimp ala diablo!
