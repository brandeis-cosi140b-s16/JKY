This was my first Chipotle experience.  Limited menu although lots of topping options. I ordered the vegetarian burrito bowl. Very big and guacamole is included! It was delicious! They even gave me a side of medium salsa without a charge.

Staff was very friendly, welcoming and accommodating! My only negative would be seating. Restaurant is small, but the tables are secured down so you had to share with others. I was by myself and got one end of a 6 top table while 2 women and a baby were at the other end.

I will definitely be back! If you are in the mood for a quick delicious Mexican meal, I highly recommend Chipotle!
