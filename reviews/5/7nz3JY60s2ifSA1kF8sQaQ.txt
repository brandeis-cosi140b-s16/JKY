The food was decent, but the customer service was amazing! I went through the drive-thru and they got my order wrong. I went in expecting a reluctant employee to remake my burrito. Instead, I encountered an employee who was extremely apologetic and very eager to remake my order and get it right. Any place with customer service as good and pleasant as this deserves 5 stars.
