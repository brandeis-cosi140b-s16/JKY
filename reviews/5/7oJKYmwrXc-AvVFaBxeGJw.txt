(Lyrics - Ricky Martin - Livin La Vida Loca)

I'm into carne tacos hot sauce and horchatas
I taste a quesadillas that place's gonna make me smile
I'm into new sensations new foods in the Phoenix streets
I've got a new addiction for every day and night

It'll make you take our clothes off and go dancing in the club
It'll make you live that crazy life but it'll take away your hunger pain
like a bullet to your brain. Come On!

Upside, inside out I'm hitting up a Taqueria
I'll eat and drink some down, hitting up a Taqueria
It's lines are crazy long and it's sauce is color Roja
I will wait you it out hitting up a Taqueria....come on!
Hitting up a Taqueria, come on!
I'm hitting up a Taqueria.


Probably one of the best taco shops I've had in a long time especially in Phoenix.  

Taqueria is a taco food truck parked right outside of a night club.  Overall, it's pretty darn tacky in my point of view, but damn does it work!  Lines here can get really crazy and long plus when it's summer time; it's just darn redonkulous!  

Needless to say, it was worth it!  For only $1 a pop these tacos were amazingly good!  I ordered 5 Carne tacos which came with beef, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Basic to the point, but that's how it should be!  Sprinkle some lime atop and let your palates sing.  I didn't even use the salsa that came along with it since I thought it was pretty tasty without it.  The corn tortillas was soft and warm wrapping the tender beef, while the onions provide a hint of crunch.  The cilantro was aromatic while the lime and salsa ended your final bite with a sour and spicy punch!  

In the end, Taqueria is not located in the best spot in town, but it's definitely worth a visit at least once regardless. - Enjoy!
