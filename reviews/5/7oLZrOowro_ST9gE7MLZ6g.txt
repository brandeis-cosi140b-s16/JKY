So I checked around yelp for a new place to try for tacos and i came across Tacos De Jaurez. I was downtown so I decided to check it out with my sister.... I ordered the #5 carne asada soft tacos off the lunch menu and a large horchata ($5.99 and $1.99) and my sister order just one chicken soft taco............probably because I brought her to a place she's never been before, plus there were a few guys outside working on a vehicle and it sat in an open lot between two odd buildings... haha. So we got our food within 8 mins, not bad at all... she opened her bag and took one bite then scarffed the rest. I gave her a look as I was opening my food, as if to say your not touching mine because I had enough faith to order alot and i'm going to eat it all look.... It came with very delicious pico de gallo and red and green salsa. All three combined in my taco was awesome:).... full of flavor! The tacos came with rice and beans, both cooked perfectly... We didnt dine-in so i can't comment much about the service, but cashier lady was helpful and nice. 

So yeah I enjoyed it very much, although I didnt get to finish it all myself because I decided to share with my sister...yeah I know..snooze you loose, but I did.  I can tell she enjoyed the unexpected stop at Taco De Juarez, so we will be back:)
