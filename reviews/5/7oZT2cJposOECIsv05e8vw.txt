Tiny little restaurant tucked away in a strip mall.  Our server was solo for a bit so service was a little slow, but then back up entered and all was great.  Large selection of seafood dishes.  Our food was fantastic.  Fresh and tasty, and clean presentation.  Many mexican restaurant food looks all the same....red sauce and cheese poured on top of all the food, not here.  The food is the star....shrimp tacos and 7 seas soup and shrimp cocktail were our choices....would definitely order again, but there are so many other items I'd like to try.  I will be back...and will bring others with me...but not too many at a time.
