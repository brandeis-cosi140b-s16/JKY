I ALWAYS GO HERE! I always order the bean and cheese burrito, the Super nachos, or the 3 taquitos . I love depending on how hungry or what I'm feeling. I feel like they do have cheap prices which is always good. I also love their green chili! Goes great with my food. It is the BEST Mexican fast food place I will goto.
