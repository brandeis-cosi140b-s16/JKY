What's for dinner tonight..... I don't know, just Yelp it. SO we find El Picante... Reviews look good, nothing to crazy, So we headed a few blocks away to try out this Mexican mecca.  We pulled into an empty parking lot and walked into an empty El Picante.. The first thing we were greeted by was a very friendly Hispanic woman, asking us what we would like and offering us a menu because in her words, " We cant fit it all on the board". So we Decided to try out the Burritos that we read so much about. Scored the Grande Carne Burrito with the HOT salsa wheat tortilla and all the fix-ens, it was DELICIOUS.... The wife Pounced on a shredded beef burrito and the little one had a very very very little quesadilla, This is the only complaint I had, her mini meal was $1 less than our Colossal Concoctions of Mexican goodness and was about 1/20 of the size. She happened to drop a piece on the floor resulting in a %50 loss of her dinner......... No exaggeration... The Food was amazing, Both the Carne asada and the shredded beef were perfect and the atmosphere is not to bad either, it is not the Fluorescent Forrest like a chipotle, you actually get to sit in a regular table and enjoy some semi authentic Mexican food while listening to authentic Mexican music, and all the while i was sitting in there feeling like i got some special deal or something due to the more than reasonable pricing. This is worth a visit or 2 or 3.......no ones judging!
