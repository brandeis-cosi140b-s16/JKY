I love this place..I tried it because I went to its other location in Queen Creek and decided to give this one a try too. LOVE IT! Their hotdogs and tacos are to die for!  Its a small place but clean and I also really like their ceviche tostadas, they are really refreshing on a hot sunny day. Its pretty good.
