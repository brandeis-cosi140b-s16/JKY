My favorite Mexican restaurant in North Las Vegas!! Very friendly staff!! I do feel sorry for the Subway and Cony Island restaurants on the sides because Don TorTaco steals all the customers because the prices are well worth it!! Everything is made fresh right in front of you and is so very delicious!! My favorite is their fish tacos
