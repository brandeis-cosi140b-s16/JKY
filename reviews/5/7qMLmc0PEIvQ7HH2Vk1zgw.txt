Is this a gourmet restaurant? No, it's a bit of a dive. Is this my own personal cafeteria? Yes. I live here, I spend so much money in this store that my Quicken thinks Chuy's is a bill.

Chuy's keeps me nourished with grilled fish and meats, healthy beans, all-you-can eat chips and the best mild pico de gallo this side of the Border. Throw in cheap margaritas, nightly meal specials and the AWESOME friendly staff and it's easy to see how Chuy's maintains loyalty with its devoted fans. At $20 for drinks and dinner for two, I will weep buckets of tears if Chuy's ever goes away. 

My only complaint is they really could use an overhaul on the bathroom, it's just a wee bit dumpy.
