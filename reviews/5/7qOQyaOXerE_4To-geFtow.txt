First time here and I love it ! I will be back for sure. The food tastes great with the Asian/Latino blend.The staff is friendly and their area is very clean. This is located at the Desoto Central Market along with a number of other restaurants. I love the atmosphere of the Market. They have retained a lot of the looks and the features of the building which was built sometime in the 1930's! They have a parking lot on the south side of the building which is located at Central and Roosevelt in Phoenix. There is overflow parking lot at an adjacent church.
