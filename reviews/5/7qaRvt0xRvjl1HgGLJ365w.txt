This place is Mexican/Chinese....hence the name. It was my first time there and I really liked the atmosphere. It's very casual considering the location. It's an upscale place but at the same time you can go in with shorts/shirts. The services was great.  We had the queso fundido and had the fried wontons and they were great!! Their tortillas are hand-made!! I think the prices are reasonable. Even though I can only judge on the appetizers, I think this place is worth it.
