My husband and I were in a quick pinch tonight for dinner and decided to go here as we had seen is driving by. We're new residents to Las Vegas, and are still trying to find our bearings. 

My husband had a shrimp bowl and I had the carnitas nachos. The food is amazing! The homemade queso on the nachos is to die for. I want to dip everything in it. The shrimp on my husband's bowl was also perfectly tender.

I like it better than Chipotle. Just being real.
