How does this place not have 5 stars? Come on Buckeye, you can't be that hard to please. This is effing Buckeye.

BUT

Dee Dee is a star manager. 

The ONE time my order was incorrect, I called after I got home and let them know. Dee Dee more than corrected the problem the next day. I wish she was my mom, she seems so nice. This place rocks. 

Vegans, come here for lard-free bean burritos! Woooooo!
