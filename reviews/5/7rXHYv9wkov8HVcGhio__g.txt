Great north side stop after day exploring the Mexican war streets.  Chips and guacamole were fabulous.  Mahi Mahi tacos were perfect -- deep fried fillets on top of raw cabbage and onions, with a really nice sauce. Carne asada taco was spicy and we closed out with a nice pork taco.  Absolutely fantastic and authentic.  New fav in Pittsburgh.
