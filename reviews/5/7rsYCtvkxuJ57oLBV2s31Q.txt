I drive far to get to Lindo Michoacan, but it's so worth it! Not only is the food awesome, but I was blown away by the fantastic service! You will walk out with a jaw drop! I went with my handicapped 4 yr old niece & there were no problems accommodating her! They even brought out some soup immediately along with the chips, beans & salsa, so not once was the kid bored. The price is good & the portions are big, so you can take half home for another meal! It's eye-pleasing too, it's no whole in the wall, for those of you who like "a nice place" to go to. You just gotta try it!
