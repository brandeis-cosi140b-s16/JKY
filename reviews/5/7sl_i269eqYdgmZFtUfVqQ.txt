I rarely review chains and its even rarer that I review non-authentic Mexican fare seeing how I married a hot Mexican man 10 years ago, but.... We were very satisfied with our visit Sunday night. Its true, it isn't authentic Mexican food, its more Mexican American, but that doesn't mean its bad. The last time we ate here was about 4 years ago and it left a lot to be desired. They must have a new manager because the food this time was fantastic! Even the kiddo gobbled it up and he can be picky.  I had the ultimate fajitas and omg the veggies that come with it are amazing! All the meat was tender and the shrimp was fresh and not fishy tasting.  Hubby had a burrito or enchilada of some sort, I dunno, I wasn't paying attention as I was too busy making love to my fajitas. But he said it was fantastic and he ate every single bite.   Kiddo had the fajita quesadilla (minus the onion and peppers) and he said it was so good that he wished he had room for another! Service was great, too! I wish I could remember our server's name cuz I always like to throw props out to a good server.

Giving it 5 stars because I really can't think of a single complaint, from the service to the food. Again, its not authentic but if you go into a chain Mexican place in Phoenix and expect authentic, well all I can say is you must be new here.
