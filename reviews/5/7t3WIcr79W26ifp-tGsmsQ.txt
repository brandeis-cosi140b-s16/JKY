While riding back from the Laughlin River Run we stopped for lunch at Anita's.  Being a Southwest native, I thought the food was fabulous.  Firstly, they brought out two kinds of salsa (service was awesome, BTW) - hot and mild.  I ate a lot of each and really enjoyed both.  The hot was not too hot, and had lots of flavor.  The mild was excellent as well.  I especially loved the chips - nice and crisp with a little bit of oil and salt - perfect for my "Devil May Care" diet.  I ordered the number 11 plate - Chile Relleno, Taco, Beans, Rice, Tortilla.  It was huge, so I ate half and took the rest home with me on my motorcycle!  Did I say the service was awesome?  It is some of the best service I have yet received at any restaurant.  Also, we found lots of parking because it was a Sunday.
