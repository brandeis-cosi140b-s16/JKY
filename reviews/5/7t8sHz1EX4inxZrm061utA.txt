What do I like about the Rokerij?  The question really should be what do I not like about the Rokerij?  The answer to that is absolutely nothing! 

From the moment you walk down the steps underground to the Rokerij you are about to be transformed from any experience offered in the Phoenix metro.  The place is so intimate with no windows,  lit candles everywhere and even a couch that you can cozy up with someone special next to a fireplace. 

Food choices are great, not cheap unless you take advantage of their happy hour.  The wine list is very diversified with many selections.  The servers/bartenders take care of you with a pleasant smile and know how to make everyone feel special.

The Rokerij is definitely a great place to take your spouse or date to in an intimate setting unlike any other places in Phoenix.  If you'd also like to impress some out of town friends this would be a phenomenal choice to wow them.

If you haven't been here, Go.  No excuses!
