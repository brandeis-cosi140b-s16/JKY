The best part? The people working here!! Great server, Margaret! She made the day for us!! Ask to sit in her section! Very professional and knowledgeable! Also, if you sit at the bar you will love Cesar! All the bar guys were a delight! All very professional and nice! 
The bar food was cheap and awesome!! The chips, salsa, and guacamole so good. As well as the tacos and nachos! All the tequila bottles are beautiful. Lots of drink chooses! You can't go wrong with these people as well as the food!
