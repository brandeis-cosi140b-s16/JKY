Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. I do have to point out that the food is only good if you order the real stuff and non of that "flour tortilla please" crap. The chips are nice and crispy and if you get the spicy sauce, even though not spicy enough, it had good taste that satisfy my trained taste buds. The margaritas are awesome and the service is great; I can always ask any of the guys for help and they are there right away. Also, I should point out that if you have NOT had real Mexican food, you will end up ordering the typical American disgusting version and will be dissatisfied. I on the other hand have been here multiple times and can say the food and service has been great because I know what to order and expect. SAY NO TO FLOUR TORTILLAS!!! That is not Mexican.
