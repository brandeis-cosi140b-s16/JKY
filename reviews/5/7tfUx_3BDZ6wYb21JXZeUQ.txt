Came by recommendation of a friend and I am far from disappointed. This taco shop has done something right! Usually with Horchata it can be too sweet or too cinnamony (if that's a verb?) but the Horchata is perfect. Chips are crispy, litely salted to perfection, and the chorizo in my breakfast burrito was just right! Definitely recommend getting the breakfast burrito! So far my favorite one I've found locally :)
