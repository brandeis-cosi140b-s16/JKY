Mondays are the best night to go, because the margaritas (which are pricey at $6 a pop) are half price.

The Chile Relleno is fantastic, but what I crave the most is the honey-lime-cilantro slaw with fried plantains.  I can't describe how fantastic that combination is.

Their salsa is fresh and homemade (could be spicier, but I love heat!)

Honestly, in my 10+ visits, I've never had something I didn't love.  It's a great spot, and some of the best Mexican-fusion I've ever had.
