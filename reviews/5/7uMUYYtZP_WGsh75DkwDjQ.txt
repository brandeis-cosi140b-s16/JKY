Love the free chips and bean dip! The happy hour is from 3-7 with amazing deals on their food and drinks. Service is always good and the place is never too busy. It's a great place for a meal with your date or a quick drink with friends! I would recommend the pollo fundido (chimichanga with cream cheese and melted cheese) delicious! I love how they have San Tan Devils Ale on tap so youre not forced to stick with a margarita because it's a mexican joint.
