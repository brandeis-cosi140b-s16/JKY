I came here two nights in a row! I was visiting from out of town and was staying right across the street so this was very convenient. Lucky for me it was also delicious. I sat outside both nights and it was warm under the lamps. I had the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, which was delicious (both times). Highly recommended!
