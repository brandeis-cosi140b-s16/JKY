Went here with my family tonight the staff was very welcoming of us. The young lady server was such a sweetheart. The owner also struck up a conversation with us, very cordial. The place was very clean and cozy. Beers were a very good price! The food was also very very good had the steak tacos. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!
