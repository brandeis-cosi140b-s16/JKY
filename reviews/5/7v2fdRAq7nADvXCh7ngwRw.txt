This is not your upscale bar in Scottsdale, which is why I like it a lot (that and the $2 Coronas...).  The food is serviceable and not expensive, the people are real and down to earth for the most part.  Because of it's location you do get quite a mix of people.  It can get pretty crowded in the evenings.  They have a great outdoor seating area, and if you're in to sports, several large screen tv's.  I love it as a place to meet people...
