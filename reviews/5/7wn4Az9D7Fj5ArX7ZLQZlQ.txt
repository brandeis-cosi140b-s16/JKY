Chef Kelly consistently hit it out of the ballpark tonight. The Revival is even better then tricks- and I used to eat at tricks a lot. As always the pork belly was out of this world- as was the duck and the scallops. Nice wine list, and great cocktails. I was even impressed by the coconut cream dessert. The neighborhood needs a chef like you who has vision and can really cook. Yes, it is a little more pricey then other neighborhood restaurants, but it is well worth it for the quality, artistry and thought that goes into the dishes.
