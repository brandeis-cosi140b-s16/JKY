So we have passed by this spot for what seems forever, finally decided to give it a go. Very clean, friendly, and muy Bueno! Had the champurrado just like my nana's! Delicious! Menudo which I very rarely eat any menudo other than my mother's but I had a craving... very good!!! I can't wait to come back tomorrow and try the breakfast!!
