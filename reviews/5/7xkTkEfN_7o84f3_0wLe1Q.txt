This place is great, my wife and I went to try it in our visit to Las Vegas and will go back every time we visit Vegas. My wife had the mojarra loca plate, not only did it look delicious it actually was. Servings were plentiful and flavor was awsome. Great food and service at a fair price. It is authentic!!!!!
