At one point in late 2009, I was going to this location at least twice a week for a month. It was not good for my wallet or my health, but my taste buds were not complaining. 

This Taco Bell has great customer service. The employees work really hard to get your food out to you in a timely manner. I get out of here so quick via drive-thru that I don't even remember paying sometimes.

I always order off of their value menu. The Frutista Freeze slushies taste really, really good.

This location is awesome!
