I have been eating at this location twice a week for about four months now. The food is always fresh and delicious; the employees always kind, helpful, and efficient.

I love the fish tacos, add a squeeze of lime and WOW. Very yummy. The grilled salmon burrito is delicious, very big for the price. I have yet to be able to eat an entire one in one sitting. My boyfriend is a fan of the chipotle shrimp salad.
