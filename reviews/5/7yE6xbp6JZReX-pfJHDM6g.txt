This is now my FAVORITE place for quick food on the strip. The taco salad is very easily enough food for two people for $11.00. The sweet pork is AMAZING. I mean it - and I live in Texas. I know Tex-Mex. This was so good that I turned down a couple of buffets to go back to it. Since it is such large portions, and they are carb-heavy, they make for terrific hangover-prevention. (Along with plenty of water!) Easily one of my favorite food memories, I sincerely hope that this place is still open when we make another Vegas trip next summer!!!
