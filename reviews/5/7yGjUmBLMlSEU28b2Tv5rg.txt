Went this weekend with the groupon. Was very good. And the price is awesome!! I'm telling everyone at my office and am actually going back for lunch today! I got the fish taco and the machaca taco both were very good we also had the fries they were also very good however I could do with out them 2 tacos are plenty for a filling lunch. Very small menu but it makes it easy to choose and what they do they do very well. Today I plan on getting the machaco taco again and I'm gonna try the shrimp taco and just looked on their website and on Tuesdays it's buy 2 get 1. Not sure I can eat 3 tacos but I'm happy to see I get my monies worth.
Update: After going back for lunch today the shrimp taco is my favorite. Soooo good!!
