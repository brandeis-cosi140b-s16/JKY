This place is beautifully decorated and very colorful. It's a fun and cheerful atmosphere. The food and drinks were delicious and very authentic. I had the 3 small lime ceviche tostadas and their regular margarita on the rocks w salt. I'm not a margarita person but this was really good! I highly recommend it! They give you complimentary chips and salsa and their salsa is mild but very flavorful. 
I love their colorful plates, glasses and colorful cloth napkins!! Brought us back to our trip to central Mexico- LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
The service is great and the staff is super friendly and attentive!
We'll be back w/ our friends and family!
