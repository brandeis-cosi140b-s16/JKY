Chipotle is my best friend for life! I could eat chipotle everyday!!!!!! It's so amazing! Chicken tacos are my fav but add rice because the cilantro lime rice is the best! Steak burrito is my husbands favorite! The steak is so juicy and moist! If I could choose a restaurant to eat at for life, it would be chipotle!
