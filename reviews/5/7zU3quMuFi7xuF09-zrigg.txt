I can't even begin to explain how amazing this place is! The service was great! The tacos were to die for!!! My friend and I wanted to eat good tacos and coming from Good ol' Texas we know good tacos and expect a lot. We tried tacos el Gordo the previous day and where completely disappointed so we looked for a different place to give Vegas tacos a try. Thank god we found this place. I have never had tacos as delicious as these. The guy cashing out gave us so many samples just to make sure we liked what we were about to order! I can't wait to go buy some more tacos before my long trip home!
