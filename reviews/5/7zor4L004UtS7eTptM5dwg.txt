Went there for the first time yesterday and I'll definitely be going back.  I had the super nachos while my buddy had the burrito, both were fantastic.  Their chips are awesome.  My only gripe there was no salsa; however, you can order pico de gallo and add their sauce to it.

There special on Tuesdays, Rock!

As for the comment about "being worried about the area", perhaps if you are alone at night walking, it might be a bit sketchy since there is a liquor store just across the street that tends to draw a certain crowd, but I would not let that deter me from dining here.  Besides, you are parking in the lot, not walking the streets.
