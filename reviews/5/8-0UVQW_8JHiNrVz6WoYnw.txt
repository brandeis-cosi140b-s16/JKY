Yum Yum Yum!  Found this little place through Yelp (thank you!) and to the advice to get a to-go order.  Had both the Red Chili & Pork Tamale and Sweet Corn Tamales, very good!  Also got a couple of Empanadas and they were my favorite for sure!  They are a small snack size, with a lite crispy shell.  Tried the savory chicken, which was not too spicy and almost melted in your mouth, and also the sweet pumpkin one which tasted like a homemade pumpkin pie!  A perfect treat!  

The prices were very reasonable, and the service was very nice!  Will so be going back there again!
