The name of this truck drew me in.  I LOVE green chile.  The gentleman who took my order was friendly and my order came up quickly.  I ordered the chicken nachos, which are $8.  Upon first sight, I knew I had gotten my money's worth.  The portion was huge!  They give you the option to choose your heat level, and I'm glad I chose medium.  I love spicy food, but not so spicy that it hurts.  Medium was perfect.  You feel the heat, but it doesn't stop you from going back for more.  If your tolerance for spicy food is low, I'd suggest asking for extra sour cream.  In addition to the wonderfully spicy chile, there were big chunks of super tasty chicken, a perfect amount of cheese sauce and a nice dollop of sour cream atop a huge pile of chips.  All wonderful!  Can't wait until they return so I can try the carne asada. :)
