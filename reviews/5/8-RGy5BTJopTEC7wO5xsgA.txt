I love Roberto's in general, but this particular location is FABULOUS. The staff is friendly and helpful with good attitudes. The eating area is huge and there are tables outside as well. But the best thing is the speed. They are ridiculously fast with getting out the orders. I eat here all the time and my orders have always been perfect with no mistakes. If you are in the area and you like Roberto's, this is definitely the location to go to.
