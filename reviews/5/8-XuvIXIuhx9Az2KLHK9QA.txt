Immediately on arriving at Filiberto's, I was instantly concerned with what to order. All of their options looked good and I was starving. I saw they had a Chili Rellenos burrito, and coming from New York, have never heard of such a thing (which may actually be a staple in the south west). I ordered the chili rellenos burriot and added ground beef. When it arrived, the tortilla was toasted and fresh and was like a tortilla i have never had before. i got it all over my face and it was one of the best thinigs i have ever eaten. I will remember it like I remember eating this bowl of spegehtti covered in butter and cheese i once ordered at a restaurant with my grandparents. It was a great meal. Top 20.
