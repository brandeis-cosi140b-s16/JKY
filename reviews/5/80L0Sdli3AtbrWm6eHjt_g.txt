This place is sooo good. A family restaurant with great Mexican food and awesome, friendly service. I like putting my dollars back into the local community, and the food here is just plain better than the big chains. Don't let the homemade signage  and small dining area fool you. This place is clean and the food delicious. Eat here; you won't regret it.
