I lived in Las Vegas for a few years and was never satisfied with any burritos I tried...Until I found Phrank's!  

THE BEST BURRITO IN TOWN!  At least out of the places I tried...All the meats are heavenly!! The green salsa is so good and thick it almost reminded me of something you would get at an Indian restaurant. Really good.

I only tried burritos there the few times I went. These are really big burritos with rice & beans.  But it is done to perfection!!! I wish Phrank a long and wildly successful career!  Thank you!!
