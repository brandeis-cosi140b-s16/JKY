Stopped in this morning around 730am for a breakfast burrito.  Best I have ever had.  They could make it however I wanted but I had it with eggs, bacon, ham, tomatoes and jalapenos.  And the salsa fresca was off the charts.  Sat on their patio, read the paper and watched ESPN highlights on one of their 55" color TVs.

I will be back soon.
