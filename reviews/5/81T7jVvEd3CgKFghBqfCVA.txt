Awesome and Authentic! 
~I Loved this place just upon entering, beautiful fountain and courtyard, a row of souvenir vendors. 

You definitely feel like you've left Phoenix, which can be a good thing!

I didn't realize how huge this place was! 

~Once we got inside, we were greeted and seated. Service was great. 
~Fabulous chips and Yummy Salsa! 

I ordered the Gringo Loco Enchiladas(see pics), which were stuffed with chicken,corn , black beans and cheddar cheese and smothered with your choice of red or green chile colorado..................I chose red.........Lucky for me I was served green by mistake, I didn't want to say anything I just figured I'd eat it, and let me tell you I'm so glad I did......That was some of the best green Chile pork I've had and it was sooooo much better than the red sauce the Mr. had on his cheese enchiladas (my preference of course he loved his too) 

Everything was perfect, unfortunately I didn't have time to check out the market side but I have a feeling I'll be back very soon!
