As of this weekend, LPV is officially back.  It looks as though they've been forced to stay in their truck, so you won't see the guys grilling outside anymore.  Don't worry, the food is just as good as always.  I've been told they will be back Thursday-Saturday 8pm-4am, and Sundays from 5pm-2am.  Thank God!

Seriously, this is some of the best food in Phoenix.  Cheap, hearty, and delicious!
