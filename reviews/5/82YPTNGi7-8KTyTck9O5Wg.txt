My husband and I have been trying to find a place on the east side where they do pastor "the right way". The meat was so flavorful and juicy! These are the best pastor tacos I have had outside of Mexico. We were so impressed! Clean little mom and pop shop. We had great service too. We will definitely be back soon!!!
