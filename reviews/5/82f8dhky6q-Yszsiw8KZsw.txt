This place has the best lengua tacos in the land. For any other meat, Tacos El Gordo still takes the crown but the lengua here is flavorful, juicy, and on point. $2 each and I'd get 5. Comes with all the toppings and hot sauce. This is a food truck in a parking lot and there are no seats so order to-go or expect to eat in your car. Cash only.
