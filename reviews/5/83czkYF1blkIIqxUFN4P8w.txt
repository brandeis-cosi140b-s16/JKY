Just wanted something different for lunch so I thought I'd take a small risk and swing by here even though I only had 30 minutes. I got the special oyster and regular campechana. Everything was delicious and the service was great and everything came out quick even though I ordered to go. Definitely going to go back this weekend with my family to try some more dishes. I didn't get back to work on time but it was all worth it.
