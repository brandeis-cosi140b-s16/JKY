Nothing wrong with this place, it's relatively cheap compared to just about anywhere on the strip (well it's not exactly on it, it's inside the Excalibur hotel on the upper level where the shops are). The food had good taste and it felt good to eat something that wasn't fast food. My wife and I had two coffees, breakfast and a side of beans we shared it because they gived you a lot and everything was about 13 dollars and we still could not finish everything. Highly recommend it!
