Thanks to you Yelpers for your reviews.  I had driven or ridden by this place several times (don't drink and drive, kids, unless you're very good at it) and wondered whether it would be worth stopping by.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a shot.

I arrived at 11:30 on a Saturday morning.  It smelled WONDERFUL.  Three or four tables were occupied, and it was evident that all of the patrons and the waitress knew each other.  A middle-aged man could be seen cooking in the kitchen.  

I ordered a Pacifico and a pork burrito smothered with chili verde.  The friendly waitress brought back my Pacifico and chips with two types of salsa.  I expected the smooth, red salsa to taste like tomato paste; much to my surprise, it had a complex flavor and tasted fabulous.  I could drink this shit, I'm telling you.

The pork burrito arrived - it was simple and filling.  The chili verde was outstanding.  Probably should have just had a bowl of chili verde instead...oh well.

The waitress was totaling up my tab and preparing to drop it on my table.  NOT SO FAST, MY FRIEND!  It's time for some dessert.  I read an article somewhere about their sopapillas, so I decided to go with an order for $5.

The sopapillas quickly arrived in a basket...and there were seven of them.  I can mow down grub with the best of them, but I am NOT eating seven sopapillas.  These were heavenly, words cannot express their goodness.  I tore off a corner and filled the first sopapilla with a slab of butter and some honey, and sprinkled some cinnamon on top.   Fabulous.  Just fabulous.  You have not eaten a sopapilla until you've eaten them at El Sombrero.

I got through three of them, and would've eaten more if I could.  The waitress seemed slightly chagrined that I didn't eat more.

The sopapillas take this spot from four to five stars.

When I return to The Hat (and I will), I will bring people with me so we can finish the sopapillas.
