Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was delicious with such a great environment! I love the decor and the food is delicious! I got the smoked brisket taco and it lived up to all the rave! My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita bowl with the creamy rice and it was so good! I fell in love with their dessert blossom tea, if u love u sweet teas this is a must! I will be returning and recommending to friends! Great job!
