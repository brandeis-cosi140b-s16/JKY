After watching the new and improved Pirate show outside of TI, I found myself at ISLA. Now, the dining area was closing up and so the bar was the only place we could sit, but they still offered a full menu. We ordered the Filet Minon Burrito and some chipotle pineapple tacos. Talk about the best burrito I have ever had in my life (which I expect of it if it had filet minon in it!) The tacos were great as well. 
Its average priced for a restraunt in a casino. I had only wished I sat in the dining area because the bar area had very low table tops.
