The specials of Burrito Drive are (you guessed it) burritos! They serve up some interesting variations on this Mexican staple, my favorite being the She-meh-neh burrito. This combination of chicken, bacon, sweet potato filling, rice, cheese, and onions fulfill the sweet, savory, and umami flavors that make me crave food from here more often than I like to admit.

They have good tasting meat here, which is something I consider very important while grading any restaurant. It's succulent and charred meat has been much more of a hit than a miss for the many times I've ordered from here. 

This is one of my main go-tos for delicious and unique food in Madison.
