Holy cow this is my favorite restaurant!!  Their grilled chicken salad is so amazing!  My honey always gets the sweet pork burrito & I have to snag a few bites of it because it is ALSO amazing.  
Their house dressing is so good & if you are trying to go healthy you can always just get the salsa fresca as the dressing. It adds a nice little bite to the salad to give it the best flavor around.  
I think I've gone through 5-10 of their punch cards for a free meal & have enjoyed every single meal along the way.
Go there! Seriously, you won't be disappointed. But watch out for friday & saturday night........It is date night & man does it get packed in there. Totally worth it though!!
