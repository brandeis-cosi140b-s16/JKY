First time trying this place and I loved everything about it. I don't live in Arizona so when I heard about chino my boyfriend and I came down and had to see what the buzz is all about. I got the jade chicken with beans and jerk rice and It was absolutely amazing! Service is great and friendly. Definitely coming back whenever I'm in town.
