One of my favorite joints in Vegas. This is our go to place when we're super hungry, because we can get amazing food for the price. Not once have we ever been disappointed. My favorite is the bulgogi fried rice and calamari tacos. They have a house salsa that is spot on with the Korean/Mexican fusion. I dump it on everything!
