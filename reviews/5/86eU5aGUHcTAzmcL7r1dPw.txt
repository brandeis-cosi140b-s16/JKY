My son salivates over the bean and cheese burrito on the Kid's meal menu here! He adds a churro and applesauce for a special treat. Great place for a meal, great service, and conveniently located 2 doors down from my massage studio at L'Mage Salon Suites! I pop in between clients for a quick meal fix. Thanks guyshttp://www.yelp.com/writeareview/biz/rb9B9v8TJk-sjpJe3BbkBQ?return_url=%2Fuser_details&review_id=77CDGf0nJS69LZw8eWLSVA
