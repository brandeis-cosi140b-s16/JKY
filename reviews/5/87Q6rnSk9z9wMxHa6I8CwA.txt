We love this place.  The best Mexican or TexMex we have found in the NE Valley.  Our absolute favorite is Courtney's Inferno burritto - it has just the right amount of spice and flavor.  So yummy!!  We love it so much, we have a really hard time ordering anything else.  But when we have branched out, its always been fantastic too.  Also love the Prickly Pear margarita (and I'm not really a tequila fan).  They have a great patio and did a great job with the remodel of the bar area too, which now opens to the patio.  Check it out!!!
