Best Mexican fast food ever and good prices. Mon-Wed taco and burrito special prices increased a bit but 1.25 for a hefty delicious red chicken taco is a great value.  No frozen prepared food; you can see the vat of chicken cooking. I especially love the beef tostada with saut√©ed onions, peppers and tomatoes.  A $3 meal and so filling!  Clean and good service. We will go back often!
