Had an awesome meal here!  The salsas were great and the guac and black bean dip are delish!  Must haves!  That and a couple blood orange margaritas and I didn't really need anything else. But of course tried the carne asada quesadilla. Everything was so good and Sunday was our server. Would for sure go back again!!  Great night with gal pals!
