I have been coming here for a few years now and yes it used to be slow. USED TO. There is a new manager there named Adam who has been doing a great job and ever since him taking over its becoming more organized and much faster. Due to this being located where it is you have to understand how many people are getting food and that it nearly impossible to walk right in and be first in line. Again Adam and his team are doing a great job.
