Absolutely Stunning Interior! 5 STAR dining experience. The menu is just the right amount of perfect and not overwhelming. Went in for lunch on this Monday 4-13-15, and was a nice professional crowd with the noise level being very suitable. Mondays is 50% off for locals, so bring your local ID and enjoy! Check in and get a free Flan! the Flan should've been my main course, seriously it was more than delicious! Paco the Chef, said it was his Grandmothers recipe, and Damn I l LOVED it in my mouth! Very nice gesture for the Chef to come say hi at our table! Thank you Paco, and to Shaun the manager, not sure of the servers name, but she was awesome too. The food was delicious, as I have posted a few photos, its looks as good as it tasted. I really enjoyed the three different salsa choices with the chips, yummy.

Thanks again for the enjoyable lunch experience.
Oh.. ITS 24HRS! What a Gem in our city of Las Vegas!
