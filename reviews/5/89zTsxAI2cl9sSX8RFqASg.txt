I passed by this restaurant hundreds of times before I tried it. So one day I wanted something different and decided to give it a try. I actually ordered online and picked up my food. I love the ordering online though! I was amazed at how great the customer service was just for my short time being there and the food was delicious! This is definitely my new favorite Mexican restaurant. I am also very picky about churros, but there's were good!
