A friend of mine insisted I meet her here for lunch. I don't think I would have wandered into this neighborhood without convincing lol. The decor was refreshingly vibrant, loved the day of the dead deco. Now for the food... I tried the ceviche, the pork belly tacos and the vegetarian tacos. Every dish was so well thought out from the unique addition of radishes to the tacos all the way to the precise cut of the veggies adding the perfect amount of crunch. The flavors of the veggie taco were layered in rich mushroom heartiness and balanced with the acidity if the lime juice and crunchy veggies. The ceviche had huge plump shrimp that were perfectly cooked (by the lime juice) without that tough texture you sometimes find in such dishes with shrimp. The portions were plentiful. The pork belly was seared so that the fat was crispy while the meat stayed moist and tender. Their homemade sauces were equally amazing. I tried a habanero sauce that delivered the most unique combination of heat and creamy flavor. I can't wait to go back!
