Believe it or not, I believe it is hard to find good quality, spicy, non-greasy, mexican/new-mexican food in Phoenix.  However, this place has passed the test.  The food truly has a kick to it, and the best part: they left out the chewy fatty meat bites, and greasy make-you-feel-sick-afterwards slime.  Have you every seem a non-greasy chimmi? If you like spice, you need to try Los Dos Molinos.
