So my girlfriend and I were on our way to have some Indian food when I found this Mexican Restaurant with a five star rating on Yelp. We thought we had to give it a try and I am really glad we did.

I was at first worried about the location but when you walk in it was nothing like I expected. What a great decor this place had. It was open, colorful, and comfortable. The service was great  and the staff was friendly.

I am not a Mexican food specialist and can't tell you what authentic is but I can tell you what taste good and  this place had it all from warm chips and a fresh pint of salsa, rice and beans to kill for, a flavorful red sauce, and just delicious food. 

We will for sure be regulars here and have already passed the word to friends who have enjoyed this restaurant as much as us.
