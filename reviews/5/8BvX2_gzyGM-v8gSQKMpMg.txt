Ate here with a some girlfriends Thursday night. Staff was very friendly and made recommendations when asked. The food was excellent, especially the corn on the cob. Drinks were good, but perhaps a bit expensive. They do have a happy hour though and margaritas are half price. The waiters were very attentive. Definitely looking forward to returning!
