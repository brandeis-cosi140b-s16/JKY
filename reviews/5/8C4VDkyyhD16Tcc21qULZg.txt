I'm pretty sure Roberto's is a franchise and I love their food in general - but this particular location stands out and I've had the best food here. Their food quality is consistent! Some other locations had good days and bad days on the food depending on who's in the kitchen, but the Cheyenne location has been nothing but good days for me. 

And they are the only location in Vegas that I've found to have POLLO ASADO, not just shredded chicken. I don't eat beef so having the option of pollo asado fries is amazing! Thanks Cheyenne Robertos!
