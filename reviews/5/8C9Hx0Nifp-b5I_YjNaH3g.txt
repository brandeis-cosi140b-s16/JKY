There are lots of things to do in Las Vegas, but there is only 1 thing that is mandatory on our list: dinner at Bonito Michoacan. For me it's all about the carnitas. My wife it's all about the handmade flour tortillas. A trip to Vegas hasn't even begun until we've had our fix. We just love, love, love it.
