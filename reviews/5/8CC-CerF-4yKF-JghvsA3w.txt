So as new Boulder City residents, we have been looking for California quality Mexican food. Have tried 4 different restaurants, without satisfaction. Drove by this one and based on yelp stars, decided to try it. Loved the decor and it smelled good. Hubby says the way to find out if a Mexican restaurant is good, is the salsa, chips and their house margarita. He gave them all a 6-7. I ordered the chili margarita. I've had a jalapeño margarita at a defunct restaurant in Palm Springs called Pepper Maggies. They blended jalapeño in the margie and it was fantastic. (Only time I will drink a blended margie, btw. On the rocks only for this girl) But this chili margie had no heat whatsoever. I guess the chili was supposed to come from the chili powder/salt rim.
Now the food. Chicken taco was pretty good. Fish taco was really good. Carnitas taco was way dry. We both got the carne asada taco and it was fantastic! Sopa de fideo (tomato based soup with thin noodles) is new for us. Not in California Mexican restaurants. But we both like it. 
Now the service. Fantastic, amazing and unexpected. Our TWO servers were so attentive, helpful and happy to serve.  We will be back and probably bring out-of-town friends. Including the ones from California.
