Authentic, amazing and real Mexican food. Having been to a few places in South America and to other Latin based countries the food has a real flare for authenticity. Down to the small visible tortilla maker, where fresh tortillas are made. 

Clean bathroom on the men's side, cold condiment bar and the staff taking care of sweeping the floors continuously with pleasant smiles and a willingness to serve. 

Tapatio burrito and their pastor meat is awesome!!
