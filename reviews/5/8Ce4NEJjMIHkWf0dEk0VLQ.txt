Came here to try their weekend menudo. Not as good as my mother-in-laws, but up there with the best of them. If you call ahead to make sure there's enough, you can bring in a pot to take home for your fam. The environment has a very ice cream shop feel to it, much like paleterias in Mexico. Bomb Sonoran Dogs and horchata. Coming back to try the tongue tacos.
