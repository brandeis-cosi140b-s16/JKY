I went here yesterday, at peak lunch time, and was pleasantly surprised to find that there were only two other people in line. I feel like this location is pretty hidden, because I've also gone during peak dinner hours and there was only a few people in the whole establishment. I really like the workers here, and they're always super polite and willing to do whatever you ask. Definitely a favorite location out of all the locations in Vegas!
