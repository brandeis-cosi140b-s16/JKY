La Perla has been around since the 1940's, and there is a good reason for that: They serve up excellent Mexican food!  When we lived in AZ my wife and I ate here only once (she had eaten here many times before) and we both loved it!  We moved away to Boston, and we came back recently to visit friends and family in AZ 3 years later.  Of all the places to get our fix of some real Mexican cuisine, we chose LA PERLA!  This place serves up authentic Mexican food with no frills.  They keep it simple, fresh, and delicious, and everything is reasonably priced.
