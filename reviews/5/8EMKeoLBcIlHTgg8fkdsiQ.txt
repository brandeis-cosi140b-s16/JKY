Love this place, great home made Mexican food in a place that is quant and would be considered a hole in the wall that you would pass up because of the neighborhood and the looks of the place. Don't pass it up,stop for the breakfast burritos, yummy or the chili rellano and of course the tortilla chips and salsa. Be sure to try the homemade flan and the horchata.
