Amazing Mexican food. Not the healthiest of menus, however this place has great customer service and the food. I really love the chicken tacos and they shockingly have great wings and fabulous ranch. 

They also have amazing breakfast burritos. For a chain restaurant this place is A Okay in my book!!!
