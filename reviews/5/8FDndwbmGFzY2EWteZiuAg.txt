Exemplary tacos.  They are tiny but tasty. (That's ok, I can always head to Naty's for a large-and-in-charge al pastor!) In a world plagued by uninspired veggie tacos, even the veggie taco was terrific. The truck and trailer are also a sight to behold.   When does the brick and mortar place open up? I'm there.
