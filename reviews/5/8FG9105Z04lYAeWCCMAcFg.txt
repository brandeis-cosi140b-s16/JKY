First off - it's Chipotle... super good grub - nuff said.

With this particular Chipotle, which is closest to my house, I was greeted with thanks and a few questions about my experience using their new ordering system.   Which one is that?  The new Chipotle iPhone app!

App is obviously in the itunes app store and free.  Open it up, finds the closest location to you and has the whole menu to where you can build your order and submit it to them and if you'd like even pay right online with your iphone....  SWEEEET... 

So downloaded the app, ordered and drove down there to meet a buddy and walked to the front of the line and grabbed my burro, paid (because I was lame and closed the app before I could enter my visa) and the guys were all making sure the app and ordering process were to my liking.  While eating the guy asking everybody how the food was made his way over to me and asked me a few questions about the process.

Either way good experience and I will be using their iPhone ordering again in the future... order was correct as ordered and simple as pie.
