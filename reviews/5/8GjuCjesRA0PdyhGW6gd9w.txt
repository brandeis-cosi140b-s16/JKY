zowie!   this is as good as it gets for NV.   i'm from san diego & the cuban was the best cuban i've had. cuban sandwich above average.  chrochetas better than habana's(a closed restaurant in sd).  tasty/quality yucca con mojo.  they have those awesome home-made/fried tortilla chips & excellent salsa. some of the portions are smaller than i prefer, but prices are great & outstanding quality.  i sampled a bud's mexican tamale & it can compete w/many tasty mexican joints in san diego CA.  we were the only white dudes there(a sign that this place is the real deal & where local latinos go).   i'll be back  primas!
