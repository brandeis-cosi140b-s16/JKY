Q doba has no limits!  Get as much as you want!  Chipotle doesn't carry any queso sauces of any kind.   Chipotle charges you for guacamole.  You get all the guacamole, FREE at Q doba!  At Chipotle, they give you the standard coke selection, at Q doba, more than 100 kinds of drinks!  There's no ecoli, and no stores closing, like Chipotle.  If you want to trust Chipotle, I wish you luck.  I get better service, more food, free guacamole, 20x the choice of drinks, and no ecoli at Qdoba!  Q doba ROCKS!  I was there for lunch yesterday, and it was perfect as always.  I live at Cornado and Eastern, where there is a chipotle a few hundred yards from my apartment.  I would rather drive to Q doba where they appreciate my business.
