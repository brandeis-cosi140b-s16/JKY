AWESOME AWESOME Mexican food.  It's what makes Mexican food so great:  cheap, filling, delicious, satisfying.  

They make a really great torta here that I've never seen before (and believe me, I've had my fair share of tortas).  It's some kind of fried steak, with avocados, beans, sliced jalapenos (not pickled, like on your nachos), fried onions, and cilantro.  Really frickin good!  Like 5 bucks.  

They've got everything else.  Burritos, tacos, other more involved dinners, like chiles rellenos, etc.  I think they've got pozole on the weekends.  

The night I was there it was a bit chaotic.  The staff were having dinner, someone's baby was hanging around, and maybe it was a little bit dirty.  So what.  That's ambiance, muthafucka!!
