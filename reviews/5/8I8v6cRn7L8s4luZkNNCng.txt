I saw there wasn't a listing for the new location, so I figured I'd add it!

Being a regular, I visit this place just about every Thursday.

The staff is excellent, while the tables can sometimes be a little messy, their are plently of napkins to clean up.

Their food is always great, the chicken can be a little dry sometimes, which is why I always get the grilled fish tacos, with a side order of hot shrimp.

Their salsa is excellent as well, and their beer selection is modest, but they have something for everyone.

This is an excellent place to go and decompress after a hard day of work.
