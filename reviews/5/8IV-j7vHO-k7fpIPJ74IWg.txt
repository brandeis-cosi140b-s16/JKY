This was my first time here and it was great! I got the enchilada tequila and my sister got the burrito tequila and then our friend got the arroz con pollo. All of these dishes were delicious! I didn't think that the dishes would be the size that they were, they were gigantic. And now with the cheese enchilada... I've never had a cheese enchilada taste like that before it was amazing. I recommend everyone to come and try this restaurant! It is amazing!!!
