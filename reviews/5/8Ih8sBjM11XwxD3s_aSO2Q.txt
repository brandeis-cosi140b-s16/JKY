Had dinner there last night the food was excellent so much so the appetizers were so filling I was unable to order a main meal.  I would recommend only ordering appetizers initially and seeing where that takes you. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas as an appetizer along with the green chili verde. You can't go wrong with the two appetizers.

The frozen margaritas at five dollars apiece were very good, a bit small but you cannot go wrong. The bartenders and managers were all exceptionally polite, made me feel welcomed and offer me suggestions on the different types of food or drink they served. 

The location is on sixth Street and parking is limited however they offer free valet service
