So delicious!
I want it everytime I come down to AJ for the weekend.

Their food is better than Erikberto's and Filiberto's and at a lower price.

It doesn't look like a lot when you drive by it, but believe me you have got to stop into this little hole in the wall.

Truly the gem in the Apache Junction mexican food scene.
