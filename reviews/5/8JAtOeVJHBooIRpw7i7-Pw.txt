who else to make the best mexican food but a greek guy?  this place is buried in plain sight in dormont on west liberty.  started out as a little burrito stand and is now a full blown mexican restaurant.  excellent menu and vast selection of hot sauces.  great bar.  anything from this place is as good as it gets.  fresh home made guac too.
