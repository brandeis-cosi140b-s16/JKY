Extreme hole In the wall very easy to pass by. With that said, it's amazingly good. I recommend getting the mulas and the cemitas. Very fresh quick and flavorful. And if you are anal about cleanliness it too is also. Give it a try you won't be regret it. Oh and by the way the tortas and cemitas use fresh bread baked daily, I beleive they get it from the Mexican bakery next door.
