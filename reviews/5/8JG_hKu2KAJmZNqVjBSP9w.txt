New favorite restaurant! The location is so stinkin cool and the food is unbelievable!! I could have drank the salsa... The staff there is just phenomenal, everyone treats you like you are a regular, so friendly and when the ask if you need something or how the food is, it's like they REALLY care! Seriously. You can tell they all care about their jobs and care about their customers. Love this place and can't wait to go back!
