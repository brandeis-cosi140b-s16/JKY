Bomb tacos cool staff. Lady at the counter was super nice, even though she had her hands fully. The tacos were fresh and the shell was still hot from being fried. The shreaded beef inside was seasoned well and the beans and rice were and excellent topper. Over all best Filiberto's I have been to. Also not shady like everything else around this neighborhood.
