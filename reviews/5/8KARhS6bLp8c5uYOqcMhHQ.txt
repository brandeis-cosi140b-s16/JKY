I only came to this restaurant because I grew up going to Lazy Lou's, the previous restaurant owners. I walked in mostly interested in how it had changed but ended up ordering carne asada tacos and a tostada de ceviche... amazing! Not only was the food delicious, but they had EXCELLENT customer service. I was very pleasantly surprised! I'm already going back for the 2nd time this week.
