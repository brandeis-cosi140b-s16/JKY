I stayed at the Graduate Hotel this past weekend and had a chance to finally check out Tapacubo. The staff was really friendly and able to make one of my favorite drinks when at a mexican restaurant. The michelada packed a lot of flavor and some heat too! I also tried the carne asada torta with their house chips and it was delicious. I will be returning here often!
