Wow! My hubby is not adventurous, when I said I found a yelp place he sneered and asked why I try to poison him!  But he relented. The fresh salsa, cactus salad and pork enchiladas converted him to believer!  Great fresh food. Excellent price, not so great atmosphere, so take it home and snuggle by the fire...or the pool whichever is appropriate!
