I like bean and cheese burritos.  

I haven't tried any other food at Elvira's but the bean and cheese because they're so good.  I always do take-out orders and they're always friendly on the phone and quick with my order.  I don't live close, but I work just down the street, so it's a good place to go for lunch.

If you're looking for a recommendation, this is it.  I'd pick Elvira's over any place.
