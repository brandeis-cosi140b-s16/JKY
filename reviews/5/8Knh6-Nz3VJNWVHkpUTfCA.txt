Really good food and wonderful customer service! Will definitely be going back here. A friend and I went for lunch on a Saturday. Right away our server brought out tostadas and ceviche. The ceviche was to die for! I ordered the shrimp burrito and she the shrimp tacos. We ended up swapping our meals half way through. Both dishes were amazing!  All throughout our meal the waitstaff was checking to see if we needed anything even though they were very busy.
