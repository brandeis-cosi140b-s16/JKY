It's Chipotle. It's amazing. Burrito bowls are the greatest invention since... Consistent hot water from taps. I would give any Chipotle location 4 stars just for the food. But this one gets the extra star because for the first time in my burrito bowl devouring lifetime no one said it was extra for the guac. Maybe it's because Madison is a college town. And they've gotten tired of saying it. I wish my local locations also got tired of saying it. It is what it is... Which is amazing fast food!

Other points of interest: this was a clean location and service was fast and efficient.
