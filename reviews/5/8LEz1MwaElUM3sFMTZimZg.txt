I and my family were blessed enough to be invited to the pre-opening night dinner service and it was impeccable.  Everything down to the atmosphere, the service and especially the food.  The chicken with tamarin sauce over grits was amazingly moist, the fluke carpaccio marinated with ginger was great and I usually don't like carpaccio.  The four leches cake with just enough moisture and sweetness served with strawberries wonderful.  My brother went on about the oysters.  My sister Michele loved the marinated beef carnitas quesadillas.  The service wonderful and a thanks to Marcus our server who was very attentive.  And a wonderful thanks to the General Manager, Jennifer, who was sincerely kind and so passionate about food and people and her new role at this establishment.  I was pleasantly surprised by co-owner Susan, who was especially kind and came up to our table and started talking to us and asking about the meal.  She even gave me a signed copy of her book.  What an amazing birthday!!
