Awesome place!!! Food is cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the service we received from Sam and Kelton was personable and flawless! Came in on a Friday night for karaoke and Dex rocked the house! Would recommend this to anyone looking for a new place to try in North Phoenix. Will definitely be back soon!
