Last week I rated this place and now I wanted to add more to the review.

I have just finished my last two tamales of the dozen I bought.  These were so good, they tasted as if they were made in someones kitchen at home and not in a business.  I have never eaten store bought tamales of this quality.  The masa was perfect and the meat was tender and flavorful while still being very lean.

People have complained about the size of these tamales, but for not home made, these are a very good size.  I will be trying other styles next time I go (maybe tomorrow).
