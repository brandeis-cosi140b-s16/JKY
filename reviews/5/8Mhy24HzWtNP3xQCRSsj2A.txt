Altata requires a minimum of two meals every time I come to Phoenix. Best Mexican seafood I've ever had and I've been to a lot of places.  

The place usually has live music and it's LOUD! Definitely not for the faint at heart. 

If you can power through the music then you'll LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.
