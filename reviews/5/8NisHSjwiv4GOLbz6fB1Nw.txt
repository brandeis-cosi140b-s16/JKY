The dish called Pollo Fundido might be one of the best Mexican meals I have had in a long time. In this lunch size version for $7.99, you get a good sized semi-crisp burrito (only heated in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese on top) and it was filled with tons of glorious roasted white meat chicken, onions, peppers and spices. Served with a side of very authentic Mexican rice, the key to this dish was the mild Jalapeno Cream Cheese sauce that usually comes on top, but can be ordered on the side. This sauce is addictive and I say get it on the side so you can dip the chips and everything else into the cheesy mixture. Truly a great meshing of ingredients. Friend got a large carnitas burrito with rice for $7.99 and she had no complaints and lots of leftovers. They start you out with three salsas and free chips and since I'm more of a mild dude, I focused on the green, which was full of great flavor. None of the sauces were chunky style, but the medium also was good with a nice bite. Everything was quite tasty and they give you a pitcher of water which was nice because this was the 4th hottest day in Phoenix history. Also, even though the lunch specials are limited (chicken sandwich?), you can still get smaller portions of the dinner menu, but those choices are all over ten bucks. Go for the Fundido.
