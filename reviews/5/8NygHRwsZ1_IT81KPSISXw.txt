Wow, The shredded beef is absolutely Fabulous. The Marinated Asada is very good. I recommend anything with beef I have heard their chicken is delicious also I just have not tried it yet. The way I found this restaurant was on yelp. I typed in delivery food, And this is one of the places that popped up I look at the reviews and like what I saw. I Ordered the food at 4 PM the Man taking my order said it would be about 30 minutes. I Hang up the phone went to my back porch and smoke a half of a cigarette. I paid by credit card so I was thinking maybe They may need to take a impression of it. Before I was able to walk from the front door to my bedroom to Get tip money. The door bell was ringing and I'm thinking to myself who could this be can't possibly be my food almost exactly 15 minutes from the time that I ordered my food it was at my door wow now that is fast food I've waited longer at a McDonald's for a quarter pounder with cheese the delivery man Paul which Found out later also works in the kitchen absolutely brought me everything that I need chips Sauza everything you're Lucky to get this kind of service at the restaurant let alone for delivery absolutely best delivery experience ever thank you Paul the managers of the restaurant and the owner your food is delicious and your service is phenomenal
