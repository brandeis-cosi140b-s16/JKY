Wow! I can't get enough of this place. I went two days in a row during my last Vegas trip. 

We were a group of 4 so we had a chance to try a lot of dishes- everyone was top notch. I recommend the chilaquiles, queso fundido and the wonton soup. 

Note: The prices are high relative to the portions but I can live with that since it's Vegas baby.
