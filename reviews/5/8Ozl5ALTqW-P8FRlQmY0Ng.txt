Best Mexican food in town! My family is from Texas and it's the closest to true Texas Mexican food we can find in the valley. I could live on the chips and salsa and my husband loves the beer specials. The carne asada is probably my favorite- love the shredded beef also. The Baja sauce is a must-make sure you get it warmed up if you order a side. 
Service is always good and it's nice to be able to sit on the patio, too.
