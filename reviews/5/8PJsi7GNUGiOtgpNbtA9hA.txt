Wow. It's not the first time I eat here. But has been definitely the BEST.... Our server was Jeanette. She was awesome, and very knowledgeable of her menu. She also suggested raspberry margaritas for my husband and I and those were great too. The food was great, service and atmosphere were good too.  I really recommend her to be your server next time you visit Cabo. Thanks Jeanette for your service.
