As a first time customer it was a little overwhelming as they have a few different lines where you order different types of meat for your tacos. However, the staff was great and they clued us in on how everything worked and we began to get in the lines for what we wanted. Food looked and smelled awesome. We paid ($36) for a family of four and took our seats. Excellent food. Not a single person in our party had anything negative to say about the food. The handmade tortillas were amazing! Had to go back for a few more tacos after I finished my first three. Great atmosphere (a little loud but if you sit closer to the door it seems to be quieter), very clean, and fun place to have a casual dinner. Also, because today was Mother's Day, all moms received a free drink (Mimosa, glass of wine, Horchata, or soda). I'll be back for sure as there is many more items I want to try!
