This place has NEVER failed me! Even when I was pregnant and sick, I could eat Eribertos! The staff is always courteous and so sweet! Food is prepared quick but is always steeping hot. They always offer sauce and will LOAD YOU UP without charge. Everything I've ever had here is amazing. Highly recommend the nachos! Their meat is always tender and perfectly flavorful. My two-year old even loves everything here! They even have dessert and of course horchata. They seem to always be open as well and there's never a huge wait. I've never eaten outside, but they have a nice outdoor area!
