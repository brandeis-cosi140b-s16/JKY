Have you ever thought about getting bulgogi Korean beef and putting it in a nice soft tortilla taco with a splash of pico de gallo and kimchi? This restaurant did it perfectly. There's nothing like getting down and dirty with these tacos if you know what I mean. But seriously, one bite you can taste two different countries South Korea and Mexico. The beef is cooked just right, when the beef hits you  it that bam feeling like a A-rod hitting a homer, then the pico gives you that tropical feeling as if you were on the beach in cabo, don't forget to add lime to get that sprite going, and of course the kimchi that will really take you back to your roots. Great place to eat!
