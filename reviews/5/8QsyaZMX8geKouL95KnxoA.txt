I highly recommend El Tlacoyo! I am not qualified to say this place has "authentic" food, because I'm not Mexican and it's not for me to say. But I've had a lot of Mexican food and this place was probably the best I've ever had. We had to try their signature dish, the Tlacoyos. So unique - and REALLY GOOD! We also ordered the Azteca torta (absolutely delicious), tortilla soup (interesting, really flavorful without being over-seasoned like it was trying too hard), a couple of soft tacos, and a lingua (tongue) burrito. I managed to get a bite of almost everything and it was all top notch.

I don't get the comments about lack of atmosphere. The place was simple, but full of rich color. It did not distract from the food and that was fine.

To the gal who could not eat anything because her mouth and throat were burned and blamed the waitress for it, understand this: To ask "how hot is it?" is a stupid question (yes, there are stupid questions). Perception of "hot" is completely relative. I will just say I don't like intensely hot (spicy) foods, yet I found nothing here that caused discomfort at all. You might want to watch out for the very pale colored dip that comes with the opening chips - it looks creamy, but it will kick your butt...but still managed to be flavorful. It's relative. If you don't like spicy foods don't go to a freaking Mexican restaurant and then give them a rotten review, OK?
