I was a long way from home today and stopped to bring home some burrito's. This place did not disappoint. Really loved the chile verde pork the best, but the beer and chipotle pork was also right there. Did I mention the fresh tortillas?  Enough said. 

I wish it was closer so I could eat there on the regular. The prices are unbelievable for the quality as well. This is a family owned joint and everything is fresh. Excellent people, recipes and food!
