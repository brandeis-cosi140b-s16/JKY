Great local hole in the wall. Staff is always friendly. I'm not huge on their sea food but their carne asada is amazing! I usually stop in for a breakfast burrito or breakfast dish (which are all very reasonably priced) or grab the 9 carne asada taco platter and save some for leftovers. Make sure you try out their salsas when you go in. For me at least, the salsa is what makes the food. Been going here regularly for over 6 years. I have yet to take someone there that didn't want to go back.
