I am so HAPPY Mattas opened up a new location in Gilbert! I have tried many Mexican food restaurants in Gilbert, San Tan,and Mesa and none really hit the spot! I now don't have to drive the distance for great Mexican food. I love their hot sauce I always pick up an extra bottle to go! The service was great and the staff is very friendly. I have eaten at this location 3 times and the food came out fast and delicious every time!
