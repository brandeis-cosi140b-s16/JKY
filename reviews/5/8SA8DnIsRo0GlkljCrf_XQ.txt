First things first: the make guacamole at your table....right there in front of you!!! :) It is $12....but typical for Vegas prices.

We enjoyed what I would called "Mexican cuisine" as opposed to Mexican food. We both had a fancier dish, creating a higher bill, fuller tummy and more satisfied well being :) I had the chicken dish and my husband had pulled pork. They were both tender, with delicious sauce!

Our staff was friendly, helpful and FAST! They were very attentive and answered all of our questions. As we are huge salsa fans, they were sure to refill our salsa (and only the ones we enjoyed most). What we liked most about the salsa was that eat salsa was accompanied by a salt that complimented the flavor! Delicioso!!

We also enjoyed their homemade sangria. Aged fruit and wine!! :) And, as it was Vegas and we did not finish, we got to go cups!! Unheard of in Massachusetts, but as absolute blast.

Zero complaints = 5 stars!
