Great place for authentic Mexican cuisine!    We eat on a Saturday at the beginning of the lunch hour.  We were immediately greeted and seated at a booth.

The menu is expansive.  My only complaint was the restaurant is dark and the print is small so for those of us sight-challenged....life line please!  :)

The margarita selection is nice!  We tried the tamarind and the prickly fruit on the rocks.  Both were great. For $12 you can keep the glass.  The chips are ok..I like more seasoning, but the salsa and beans were good.  All come as a complimentary appetizer.

The service was prompt and attentive. We got the carne asada tacos and the chicken cognac.  Both were cooked perfectly and arrived piping hot!

Oh!  And did I mention the live Mariachi band??  Beautiful music that really sets the tone for an excellent dining experience.

This place is top notch and deserves 5-stars!!
