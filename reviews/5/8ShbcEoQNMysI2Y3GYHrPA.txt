Senor taco is a great Mexican food restaurant! Even after only going there 3 times I can say its one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been going back for the price and service it gives you. When you go you will get the feeling of being at a place where yo can  relax and hang out with your friends and just have a good time. There are outside and inside tables for you to sit and eat along with native music in the background. My friend and I decide to go eat at Senor Taco for breakfast, yes I said breakfast this place is just that good. We both order huge burritos. I ordered a California Carne Esada, which is a huge burrito the size of your face stuffed with many ingredients. Such as juicy carne esada meat, french fries, bell peppers, diced tomatoes, cheese, and shredded lettuce. After we both get done ordering we are sitting in anticipation for our food. About 10 minutes after we order we get our food hot off the pan. We both take out first bites and look at each other in agreement with how good our food tastes. The burrito I ordered has been cooked to perfection. A soft warm tortilla that has been expertly wrapped and overstuffed, plenty of warm juicy carne esada meat, evenly spread cheese with a chunk of it here and there, small tangy diced tomatoes, the occasional hint of a bell pepper and lastly the taste of the french fries that have been put in with everything. The taste of my cold beverage helped wash all the goodness of my burrito down and then I enjoy the end of my meal by conversating with my friend while enjoying the chips and salsa that have come along with my meal. If you want a good meal you must got to Senor Taco. It is the kind of place you will want to go back to again and again. I have never had a negative experience here so I definatly recommend it to anyone.
