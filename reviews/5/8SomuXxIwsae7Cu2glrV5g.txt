So, can I come here every weekend for brunch?  How did I not know about this place until recently?

Great outdoor patio, beautifully decorated interior, amazing staff...every last one of them, an extensive, unique menu and truly delicious food.  

My hubby tried the crab benedict and couldn't get enough of it and I tried the crepes supreme...flavorful, fresh and very filling.

I can't wait to come back and try other things on the menu!
