Great Mexican Restaurant chain.  Most of their restaurants are family owned. They have fast service and great food.  I am in the Charlotte area from time to time and often eat here.  This one is no different than the others as far as service and food go, its great.   There is a fan site dedicated to this restaurant chain that has a lot of info about the restaurant and their locations.  Check them out, http://eatmonterreys.com
