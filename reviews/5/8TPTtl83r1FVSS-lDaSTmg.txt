I love it here. If you know what to order and how to order (which I think is the MOST important) then you're in good shape. I've had their al pastor nachos, carne asada burrito, street corn, and their breakfast chorizo burrito. I love their salsa bar as well as the fact that it has both black and pinto beans at no additional charge. No, the workers are not the friendliest, but if you've ever been here during peak times, you'd kind of understand why they don't bother chatting it up, they have tacos to move!
