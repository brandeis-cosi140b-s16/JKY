Wow. Why all the bad reviews? I eat here every time I go to Vegas! China Poblano is pricey, but I definitely think it's worth it. The service is pretty slow, but the restaurant is usually packed and the servers are nice. I always have the chips and guacamole, the lettuce wraps are my favorite, and the papas fritas with mole sauce is pretty good too. Everything is shareable, so we usually get a few other items. I love this place.
