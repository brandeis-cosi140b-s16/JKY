such a good place. my parents know the owner bart personally and he is always really friendly talkative and always has a smile on his face. kind of hidden from more of the desert ridge area and kierland but it definitely is worth the drive if you live far! fry bread, tacos, and burritos are definitely the best here. super cheap which is better. employees are always working hard and smiling so thats a plus. food comes out very fast and theres seating out and inside. there is a bathroom which doesnt look like there is one but there is and thats a good thing for a carefree restaurant!
