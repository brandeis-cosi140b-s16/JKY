I've been eating at Taco Bell religiously for the last 8 years (mostly for the Mountain Dew) but this one is by far the best! It is always clean and the food usually comes out before you even fill your drink! They don't skimp on filling the tacos and burritos (a lot of taco bells do) which is always good. I'm not a fan of the new red Mountain Dew but the baja blast is very good. As with all franchises some are better than others and this location is by far the best in Vegas!
