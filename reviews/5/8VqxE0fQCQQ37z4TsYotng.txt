I have twice been to this location and received excellent customer service!  The young guy at the front recommended something on my first visit and I am hooked!  I went a second time less than 1 week later! I ordered the 2 enchilada special. ..1 chicken and 1 shrimp. The taste was great, even loved the rice and black beans. On the 2nd visit I decided to try a fish taco too. I am very happy with the food here and will go back often!!!!!
