Hidden behind a gas station in a run down strip mall, Tacos El Compita #2 does not make a strong first impression.  The restaurant itself feels a little run down with a very cramped space and a tiny amount of tables, which appear to only occasionally be wiped down.

Given all of that, Tacos El Compita #2 requires a leap of faith.  But give the place a chance and you will experience the best carne asada burrito in Las Vegas.  Yes.  The BEST.  Now, I don't give that title out lightly.  There are some good Latin places around this Valley, but this taqueria's cooking out does them all.

Why?  The secret is how the place cooks the meat for the burrito.  Rather than tossing the steak on a grill as orders come in, Tacos El Compita #2 keeps the steak mixed into a spicy soup.  Kept on a separate stove just below simmering, the steak has been stewing in a delicious, spicy tomato-based soup.  And when the sauce is drained off and the carne asada is placed alongside the rice, beans and cheese, it's over-the-top delicious and spicy and flavorful.  You will have to remind yourself that you're in a taqueria after you start eating because you just don't expect this level of flavor from a small hole in the wall.

Since I moved to Henderson, this place is about 40 minutes away from me.  But it doesn't matter.  We make the drive.  It's just that good.
