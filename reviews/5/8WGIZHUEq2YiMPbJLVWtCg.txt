We've been going here for 20 years and love the place. The machaca is great, the whole bean burritos are good, as are the potato and bean burros. The chili rellanos are good. The salads are only OK.  All salsas and sauces are made that day and are fresh. Beans aren't cooked with lard, but are cooked with vegetable oil. Portions are small, taste is flavorful. Rosa the server/owner is friendly  and Maria her mother is the cook.
