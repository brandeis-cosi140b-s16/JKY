Excellent meal and dining experience. Salsa and chips were great. Salsa fresh and not too spicy and the chips were also fresh. Had the chimi and a combo of appetizers for dinner. (nachos, sopes and tostadas) All was excellent!! The flan for desert I brought home and it was just good a few hours later. Maybe better fresh. Will definitely be going back!
