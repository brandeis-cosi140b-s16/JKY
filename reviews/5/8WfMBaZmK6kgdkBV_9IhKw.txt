Delicious !
The Quesadilla, 3- knock out tacos we had were very good. Food is not greasy and full of flavor. We also tried chips with Queso Diablo yum! It was a bit spicy as it has chunks of jalape√±o.
If u are around try it.
Next to the Henderson DMV after being there for 2 hours this meal was worth it ;)
