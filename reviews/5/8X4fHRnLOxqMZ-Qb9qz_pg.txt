Everything I've eaten there has been great...but the one dish that stands out above all others is the Sopa de Marina...A hearty seafood stew...It is really hard to put into words all the flavors that go into dish. It's a thin tomato/seafood broth, w/ nothing but seafood...Shrimp, scallops, fish, calamari, etc...A squeeze of line and you set. If you like seafood, you MUST try this dish...The staff is always great.
