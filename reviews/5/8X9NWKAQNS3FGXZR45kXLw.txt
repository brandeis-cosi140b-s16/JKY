WOW !!!!!!  Just a short note here on YELP  in regard to Gerardo's Taco Shop.
This place has GREAT I mean DELICIOUS  food....and variety + with GREAT PRICES.
This place is SO CLEAN one could eat off of the floor (lol)  as this expression means CLEAN AS CAN BE. 

The PEOPLE WHO RUN Gerardo's are out of this world POLITE, customer satisfaction a major +

With all of this said.....I recommend this restaurant with one hundred stars.
THE FOOD IS EXCELLENT, staff are friendly, mannerly  and welcoming.
