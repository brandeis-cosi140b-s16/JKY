I'm hooked on Pepper's bean and cheese burrito. Awesome flavor and portion for a great price. The same girl is working there every time I go in, and she's always so friendly. She knows me by name, and she has my order down. I have yet to try another dish (aside from the cheese fries, which are delicious!), but I'm sure it's just as fresh and scrumptious as their bean and cheese burrito.
