I love coming to Crescent mostly because I get to hang out with loved ones when I'm here. My bf's hipster brother lives closeby and we don't get to see him often, so I've always had a good time catching up with him here. We've always sat outside in the patio area and I love it. You can hear the live music from outside but you can still have a conversation without yelling. The servers are super friendly and always bring drinks out fast. I recommend getting some trail mix to munch on with some beers.
