The best freaking tortilla I have ever had in my life, hands down!  Yes, I'm a ****bertos addict and just when I didn't think it couldn't get any better it did!!!  I just got back from Mexico and this is still the best burrito I have EVER HAD.  Adobada ROCKS!  I have seriously eaten at almost every dive mexican joint in the Phoenix area and will go out of my way to eat here from now on.  

Great drive through service and the LARGE size red AND green sauces are the bomb!!!
