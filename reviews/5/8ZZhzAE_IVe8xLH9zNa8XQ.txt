So...I hadn't noticed that this place had changed from Revo burrito to MEXX 32, I knew it was under construction, but finally went here on Saturday night, I was going to go to Delux, but it was pretty packed so we walked over here, we just wanted a few cocktails. 

So as we sat and enjoyed our complimentary chips and salsa over a beer and a strawberry daiquiri, and we admired how nicely this place was put together, very upscale, plenty of room and seating. And clean. good music, great atmosphere. A pleasant experience all around. 

So it got even better when the owner Lenny dropped by our table to ask how everything was, I have met Lenny several times thru out the years when I worked for 944 magazine and Destination.tv and we reviewed and frequented Zen 32. We had a nice conversation with Lenny where he explained that things are going very well and he was extremely happy with the turn out so far, they have not even had the grand opening yet.  We had already eaten at Ra, earlier in the evening so we were not really hungry but Lenny said we should try the street taco's if we had the chance.

We tried them, we got the sampler plate and tried three different taco's and we really enjoyed them, I particularly enjoyed the Mushroom tacos, something a little different but very very good. 

I live within walking distance of this place. So I can't wait to make this one of my new favorite haunts.  The bar is great and has a huge selection of tequilas. 

Lenny has hit a home run with this concept, I think it is going to do very well and I will definitely be back with friends.
