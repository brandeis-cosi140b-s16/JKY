After our mediocre Mexican meal yesterday, hubby looked around for a new restaurant to try.  He stumbled across this place, so we decided to try it out.

It's a small restaurant in a strip mall, but those are usually the best places to get authentic food.  And, this was no exception.  The place was hopping, so we were glad to get a table.  You order at the counter, then they bring you the food.  Everyone working there was so friendly, that's always a plus.

After ordering, we got our drinks and sat down.  A young lady brought over the chips and salsa.  The chips were very good.  Hubby liked the salsa a lot.

A little while later, our food was brought out.  Hubby got the green chili burrito and loved it!  I just had to try the carne asada, again (since yesterday's was a miss).  This was just the way I like it.  The beans were runny and fresh, the rice was flavorful, there were grilled onions on the plate (bonus!) and the meat was delicious and tender.  I also liked that the beans/rice didn't overtake the plate, like they do at some places.  This was the right amount, and it was perfect with my meal.

We also decided to try the flan (yesterday's wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best, either).  This time, the flan just melted in our mouths.  It had that light, airy quality that I associate with a really good flan.

All in all, it was the perfect Mexican meal.  We both enjoyed it immensely, and will definitely be coming back here.
