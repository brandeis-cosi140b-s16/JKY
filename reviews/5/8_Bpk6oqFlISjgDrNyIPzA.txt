Who knew the mall could have something so yummy!!
I recommend the avocado salsa and the sopas. I usually get a steak and an el pastor. But the nachos are yummy too. 
There are roasted jalape√±os near the salsa. I try to limit myself to three (trying to share, it is difficult). 
Everything I have had is good! And the girl at the counter is super nice!
