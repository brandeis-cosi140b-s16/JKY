This is not a fancy place. Do not expect to come in and be wow-ed with charm or ambiance or anything other than what it is: delicious and authentic Mexican street tacos. 

I have had the tacos adobada and the carne asada tacos. Words cannot express how delicious the adobada tacos are. The description says "spicy pork" but I do not find the meat to be spicy at all. The pork comes off a huge piece of meat that is hung rotisserie style and then carved by hand onto a corn tortilla. This is topped with a green sauce and cilantro and pineapples (upon request). I don't know what is in this green sauce, but it is beyond delicious. I think the sauce and meat combination is out of this world. I really cannot up-talk it enough. 

The tacos are slightly small, so I suggest ordering at least three. 

You know a Mexican taco place is good when there are tons of Mexican people eating and working in the restaurant and Tacos El Gordo is no exception to that rule.
