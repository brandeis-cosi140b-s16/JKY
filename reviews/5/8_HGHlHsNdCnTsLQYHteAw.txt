If you are looking for Authentic Mexican food that is delivered super-fast, in a clean setting and well priced,  then this place is IT!  I have been there a couple of times, and it was without a doubt, Delish!  The first time I had the Chimichanga, and it was very good, delivered in under 10 minutes.  The next time I had the Carne Asada Torta, and it was so amazing that I ordered a second one... They have it all; fresh limes, tasty Salsa, and the food was to die for.  The Torta was served on a bolillo bread that was gently toasted, had marinated meat, and also some Jalapenos to spice it up.  If you are in the area, don't pass this up.  This is fast- food without it being a fast food restaurant. Yummy...
