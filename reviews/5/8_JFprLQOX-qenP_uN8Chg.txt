I love this place. The atmosphere is great, the service even better and the food is fresh, tasty, and reasonably priced.  My husband and I went on a Sunday afternoon and they had a martini bar.  Loved it!  I had the under 550 calorie fish with pesto and cilantro. It seriously tasted like way more calories.  I totally recommend this to anyone who likes fresh dishes, good service and a relaxing atmosphere.
