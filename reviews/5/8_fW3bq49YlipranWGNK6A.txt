FOOD:
I haven't found a single thing I don't like from the menu. The only thing that's kind of a rip off was the Fish Tacos. They're pretty much a fish stick with dressing, lettuce and a taco shell. I will mention that the Chicken Chimichanga is unbelievable. Best mexican food thing I've ever had. Only problem with the food is that they put Guacamole on everything which I don't like at all. You can easily order it without.
Also once the Mountain Dew wasn't actually Mountain Dew and was orange.

EMPLOYEES:
Don't go during the day! There is one of the nastiest cashiers I've ever met there. She doesn't where a name tag but she is a 20 something year old mexican girl. My girlfriend changed her mind last minute that she wanted a drink and the girl rolled her eyes and was completely inappropriate about the whole thing. We now only go at night and the girl at that time is as nice as could be. 

ESTABLISHMENT:
It's never been dirty when I was there but it is a little dingy and dark. We usually get food to go though.
