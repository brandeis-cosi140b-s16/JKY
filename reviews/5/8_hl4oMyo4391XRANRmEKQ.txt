AWWW YEAHHH.. this place is my go to mexican restaurant! SUCH delicious food, from the chips and salsa to the drinks to the food! I honestly can't believe the negative reviews, and I think they're incorrect. I've gone here MANY times and NEVER had a complaint. For instance, 'I don't like rice or beans'... thennn don't go to a mexican restaurant. Definitely go to this Patron in particular, you won't regret it.
