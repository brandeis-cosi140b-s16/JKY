This is a really nice little Rubio's.  The employees there are super friendly.  The place is spotless clean too, and the salsa bar is hella fresh, clean, and well stocked.  My burrito was bomb.  I like going there when I want something under $10 and not super heavy.  Location is great too cuz it's in a nice shopping center and starbucks is right next to it so you can get your frapp on after eating.  Keep up the good work!
