Chef Kelly is an amazing chef and working his magic at the Revival now.   Had dinner here with some friends a couple nights ago and it was amazing.    We started with the chorizo/shrimp and sweet potato croquettes for appetizers which were out of this world.   Dinners were the tuna, salmon and the short ribs.   We all ended up sharing entrees with each other as we couldn't decide which entr√©e was better than the other.

Great atmosphere and super attentive staff!
