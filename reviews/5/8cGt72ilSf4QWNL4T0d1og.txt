I woke up craving a good old homemade breakfast burrito with sausage, eggs, potatoes and cheese. Even though it was a little past breakfast time, the ladies at Villa hooked it up!!! My prayers were answered and now I am happy as can be. Thanks Kara!  My new quickie go to place when I need something that feels like mi Casa.
