My kids LOVE this place. The burritos and servings are HUGE! My kiddies love the super nachos, rolled tacos and the carne asada fries. 3 of us can all share one meal, lol sometimes. Dont think your gonna be able to eat a burrito solo. I tried it once with a breakfast burrito and didnt even make it half way before the "itis" had me falling asleep at work! Never again, lol.
