We are in town for a tournament and needed a quick bite before the game. This was nearby and the prices were very reasonable and the food was awesome. My son is a picky eater as well and the waitress was very happy to run to their burger place next door to pick up an order for us. If you are ever in Phoenix this is a place to go and you can enjoy the sports game as well. Great vibe and atmosphere.
