This restaurant is the reason I Yelp.

Visiting Phoenix from out of town, I was dissatisfied with the options for "good Mexican food"  on the recommendations list from the 5 star resort I was visiting (mainly overpriced, high class and showy, but overall weak review joints) After scouring over the descriptions of 7 or 8 options, I finally found Mexx32.

Had I simply walked by the establishment, I probably would have ignored it due to my strip mall restaurant judgmental tendencies.  However I am so glad I trusted it's 4.5 star review instead!

The food is exactly what I craved. Delicious light corn chips with fresh guacamole, wholesome indigents filling flavorful tacos, and a perfect, classic, sipping margarita to wash it down with.  The entire menu is labeled with gluten free and vegan options (endless appreciation for that!) and the service was exceptional. The ambience is casual, but warm and inviting with soft lighting and comfortable tables. 

While I was there I even got the meet the owner, who was going table to table ensuring guests were satisfied and being well served.  How often do strip mall restaurants feature that kind of attentiveness?!

If I lived in the area I would definitely be a repeat customer many times over. They even have a convenient  to go window, which would no doubt fuel my stomach and soul on a regular basis. 

I can't comment on the "authenticity" of the food, however if you want a solid fish taco and great service, look no further.
