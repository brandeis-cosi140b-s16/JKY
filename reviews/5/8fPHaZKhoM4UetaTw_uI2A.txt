This is my new fav place! It is definitely a hole in the wall. The menu is a little hard to decipher because it just has the basic item and prices. There are no descriptions or information about what comes on/with each option. The tacos are wonderful! I love the fresh tortillas. I was a little surprised that they only had onions and cilantro on them. I think some guacamole or cheese might make them better, but maybe that is purely an American thing. There is plenty of room and big tables in the dining area... Not the fanciest, but functional. There are a couple of TVs, but they have been on the Spanish channel every time I've gone in. They charge $.50 for credit transactions. There is a sign on the door that is all in Spanish, so I'm not exactly sure what it says, but I think that it is indicating that your car may be towed if you park in the spots designated for the business to the right of Sahuaro Tacos. There is additional parking behind the restaurant.
