Won't be going anywhere else for Carne Asada Fries.... This place makes them perfect. A meal that you would assume is for one, actually can be for two. They pack the to-go box completely with french fries, guacamole, sour cream, and cheese!! It is so good, that it is what I choose everytime we go... which is about 3 - 5 times a month.
Their shrimp burrito, steak/egg/cheese burrito, and egg/cheese/potato burritos are also delicious! 
Give them a try!
