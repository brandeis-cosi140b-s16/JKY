My favorite Mexican restaurant in the whole state of Arizona thus far. Fernando (the owner), knows exactly what I want when I come in and wastes no time in preparing my meal. I recommend the fried steak, or the pork ribs in tomatillo sauce. This place has THE BEST hortchata I have ever tried in my life (they also sell it to you by the gallon to take home). DOO ITT!
