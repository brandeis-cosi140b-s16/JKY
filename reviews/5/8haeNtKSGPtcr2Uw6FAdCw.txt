Fausto's is great.  Breakfast burritos are awesome; chimichangas are delicious, tacos very good, if a touch greasy, tortas are good.  The carne asada is good, the chicken is ok (not pollo asada).  The carnitas is quite good.

Salsa is very good.  Spicy carrot & jalapeno bar.  Prices are reasonable.  Service is competent and fast.  This is one of our go-to places for a quick, tasty meal.
