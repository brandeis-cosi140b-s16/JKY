While staying in Concord to visit the Speedway, we stopped in for dinner. As we were staying at a hotel just down the street, it was convenient for us, because we didn't know our way around and it was simple to find, even though it is located in a shopping center. 

I love mole poblano, and not every "American" Mexican restaurant serves it. In fact, few do. Cinco de Mayo does serve it, and the mole sauce is excellent. It is one of the best moles I have ever eaten. Chips were hot and fresh, salsa was mild but very flavorful. Mom loved her chimi, too.

Service was attentive and efficient, not at all "hover-ish". We were there on a Saturday night and although the place was busy, everyone seemed to be well-fed and enjoying themselves. Nobody looked as if they were waiting overly long for food or drink refills. We sure weren't.

An excellent meal at a very reasonable price. If we're ever in the neighborhood again, we'll definitely stop by!
