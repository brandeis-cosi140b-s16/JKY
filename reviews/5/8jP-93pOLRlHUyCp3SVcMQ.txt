I eat there all the time, almost once a week. I love sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen. They have a great porterhouse that my daughter & I love to share AWESOME!  I usually have their seared Ahi salad ( salad is a little plain) and a side of vegetables. Love the variety of fresh vegetables. Also just recently tried their double bone in pork chop-very good. Service is usually good, not stellar.
