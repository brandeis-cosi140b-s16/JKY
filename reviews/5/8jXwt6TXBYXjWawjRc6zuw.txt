DELICIOUS FOOD.

Don't go here if you're expecting a beautiful establishment- it's on the corner, has no inside restaurant, is cash only, has a covered patio thing to eat in and a window where you pick up your food...BUT IT IS SO GOOD.

The portions are great, it is very affordable, they have a lot of different options.

Definitely a gem of a hole-in-the-wall and I am so glad I found it!
