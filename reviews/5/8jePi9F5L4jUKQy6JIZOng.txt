If I could give this place ten stars, I would! Was just in Vegas for a bachelorette party this weekend, but my buddy and I snuck off from the activities  so we could try this place. It was sooo worth it! I love everything about China Poblano, the ambience, the staff, and of course, the food. I am so sick of fusion places, so this was a breath of fresh air. They managed to bring together two  unique cuisines under one roof, and they did it in a very elegant way.

Our server was very attentive and very knowledgable of their menu, he gave the best recommendations and checked-in on us regularly. I was quite impressed at how each dish was explained to us as they were being served.

As for the food, we ordered the pork belly tacos, chicken wings, 21 vegetable fried rice and golden pork buns with condensed milk. Each was a winner, but my friend and I both agreed that the golden pork buns were little pieces of heaven. I would drive back to Vegas anytime if it means I could have this dish again.

Overall, do not pass up on China Poblano, it's one of the most memorable meals I've had for this whole weekend!
