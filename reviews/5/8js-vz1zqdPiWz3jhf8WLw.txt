We have been going to Senor Taco for a while now, and never a bad experience. I nearly always order a cheese quesadilla and rolled tacos, and they are wonderful. The tacos are either chicken or beef, and are delicious either way. They come with a generous topping of tasty guac and cheese. I usually end up scooping the extra guac with my quesadilla, which is amazing. I don't know what they put in there, but it's absolutely my favorite part of the meal. And all of that for a little over five bucks. Yummy!
