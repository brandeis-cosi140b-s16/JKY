One of the best filibertos that I have been to, hands down. Carne Asada fries are actually made with the chunky crinkle cuts, unlike the wimpy tiny side fries like the ones found on apache and Dorsey's filibertos. Love the service, love the chip bar and the sauce bar, the girl who took my order at like 3am was nice, and every time I go there I have a good time, unlike the one at Apache and Dorsey! The place is clean and well maintained too.
