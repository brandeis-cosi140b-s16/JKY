We didn't know what to expect so we got burrritos: Carne asade and el pastor. Plus the three combo plate: enchilada, Chile relleno, and taco. Overall food was delicious, quick and affordable. Close to the strip if you have your own car. 

These types of small good eats spots are what cities like vegas need. 

Also has a bar and a pool table room connected so if want to have a chill low key night, there it is.
