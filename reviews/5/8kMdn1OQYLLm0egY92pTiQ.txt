Salt & Lime makes me happy for so many reasons....

Guacamole - delicious, fresh, big portion, about half the price of guac elsewhere.

Queso - we had the chorizo version once and it was very good but we have had the plain cheese the last three times and it is really delicious.

Quesadilla - tried it without the chicken, portion is huge and stuffed with cheese, not too greasy...just enough to make it indulgent.

Nachos - we have had them a few times (minus chicken) and they really do a nice job here.  The chips are freshly made and they load them up with cheese, pico, sour cream, black beans, corn, and an avocado cream topping.  I feel like driving back for more nachos after typing this they're so good.

Salsa - if you like salsa, do yourself a favor and get the 3 for $5.  Tomatillo salsa is better than you think it's going to be, it's thick and rich and tangy...not the pale green watery stuff you get at other places.  Pineapple - get it.  Habanero - to get such a great smoky flavor with that amount of heat is not easy, this place gets it right.  Chili de Arbol - I was bold on our first trip and said "no place really serves very hot salsa" (as it is listed on their menu), I was wrong.

Tacos - Beef Barbacoa taco is the best of the bunch as far as I'm concerned. Carne Asada was good.  Pollo Mole - my husband still talks about this one, he loved it.

Short Rib Barbacoa - we got this for the first time a few nights ago as take out...when I opened the container it was like some wonderful grandma was in the kitchen all day making a delicious Sunday dinner for us to enjoy.  It was a gigantic serving, fork tender, seasoned beautifully with potato and carrot in a brothy gravy.  

All this and the prices are outstanding.  Parking can be tough in this busy mall but there is parking in the back.
