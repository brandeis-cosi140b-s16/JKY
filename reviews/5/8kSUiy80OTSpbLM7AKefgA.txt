Excellent food and the best caramel churro I've ever had. Ever ever. If you order after a night of weird liquor drinking at Money Plays (story for a different time...), they'll deliver it to you in the bar. Food was good, nothing came back up to haunt me, and the caramel churro is something for the Fat Kids Hall of Fame Cookbook. Serious business.
