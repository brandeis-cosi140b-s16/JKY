Kept passing this place by in the strip mall as it is close to home, so thought I would give it a try as reviews were good from Yelpers!
Sure glad I did! 
Decided to do take out, so phoned in my order from home. Pictures dictated my first order, went with the chicken verde enchilada combo, an order of the shredded beef taquito's and of course some chips and salsa.
Place was really clean when I walked in 10 min later.....star number one! Owner was at the counter, he had taken my order personally on phone (nice guy)....another star!
Food was hot and ready to go, he even opened and showed me each item making sure it was right...star number three!!
Got home and dug in....two more BIG stars!!
I'm sold!!
