We will miss you EL Torito !
We had so many great times ...we celebrated new jobs, decided to quit jobs, had serious discussions, decided to move out of state, decided to move back..all in the cantina (w/ margaritas of course!)
I felt so sad when I drove down Scottsdale Road and saw the construction equipment.
***raise margarita glass*** here's to you EL Torito and the kind people who worked there..
