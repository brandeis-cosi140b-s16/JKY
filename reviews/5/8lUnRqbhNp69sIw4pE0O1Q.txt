We frequent this establishment 1-2 times a week!
We love our Mexican food and this place has been a superb find.
Probably some of the best enchiladas (chicken) we have had in a long time.
I tend to order chicken-steak fajitas.
We always get beef nachos. Good salsa...not too spicy.
We always get our food to go, but if you want to eat in there is plenty of room, it's clean and the service is always good and friendly!
So from a big Mexican food fan who is used to food in Chicago, go ahead and give this place a try. I am sure you won't be disappointed when you realize it's affordable and you have leftovers!
Be alert though when you drive to this place, it's in a strip mall on the right-hand side if traveling East on Independence...just before Brazaz
