I would have to agree with everyone else's reviews...this place is incredible. Hands down the best Mexican fare in Charlotte. I had only driven past it a thousand times before I looked it up on Yelp and couldn't believe the reviews for this hole in the wall cantina! We ordered take out and picked it up with high hopes. 
Needless to say, we weren't disappointed in the least! The food was fresh, hot, and most importantly, delicioso. I think every single employee said hello to me when I walked in the door and they had my food ready and waiting when I got there (10 minutes after ordering). I had been told that the green salsa was something you wouldn't get without asking for, so I mentioned it when I went in to pick it up. They gladly got me a few cups of it and put it in with my other food. WOW! So GOOD! It surprises you with a crazy after-burn, but the taste is crazy good. My only complaint...they forgot the chorizo in our cheese dip last time. I hesitate to even mention it, b/c everything else was so great, but I have to say I was pretty sad when I opened our cheese dip like a kid on Christmas morning and the main attraction was missing. I told myself it was my fault for ordering later in the evening & forgot all about it. 
Two more key points...It's only been a week since our first experience and we just placed another take out order. Second, about 2 days after our maiden T.A. voyage, a co-worker of mine felt compelled to pull me aside at work and tell me to run, not walk to this tiny little mexican joint in Plaza Midwood that she had discovered. I smiled and told her I had already found it. Do yourself a favor...check it out.
