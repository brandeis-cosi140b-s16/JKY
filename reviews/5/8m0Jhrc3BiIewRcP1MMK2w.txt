Taco y Taco is becoming an addiction. I have started to crave it. Terrible, yet SO good! 
If its your first time, the process can be a bit confusing compared to the normal sit down restaurant. The food is setup into stations, each serving different specialties. Start at the front and work your way to the cashier. Once you decide on your beverage of choice and pay, I suggest finding a place to sit and heading straight back to the complimentary salsa bar! 
As for the food, I don't think you can go wrong. Ordering fresh chips (under 2$) to share with your table is never a bad idea! They're thick, crunchy, and help you taste test the entire salsa bar! The only meat I have ordered thus far has been the al pastor (the addiction), and it is amazing in both the tacos and vampiros (pretty much a tostada sandwich). 
The cooks are helpful too, even if you are as confused as I was the first time ordering!
