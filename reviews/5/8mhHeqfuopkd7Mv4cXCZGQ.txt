This place beats my old favorite in downtown Matthews (El Valle).  Great good with unmatched customer service.  Even the owners came out and asked what we thought about the food.  $2 Blue Moons on special, salsa was amazing, supreme nachos were awesome.  Wife had the carne asada tacos and loved them.  Plenty of open seating available, nice set up, give this place a try.

What's with all the negativity people?  You out to get this place or what?  

Food is YUMMY!
