My favorite fusion restaurant. The pricing is great, food tastes phenomenal!!

Here are my favorites:

Fusion Taco
Fusion Enchilada
Jim's Bulgogi Fried Rice
Fusion Torta

I do not recommend the quesadilla, it was too heavy with cheese for me.

One of my favorite restaurant to take friends that are visiting Las Vegas. Every single one of my friends loved it, even with me hyping up the food so much
