What a delightful meal! Cabo is nestled into a quiet corner of Sunset Station Casino, and is furnished with beautiful and rustic Mexican decor. The menu has enough to satisfy any palate searching for a good Mexican dinner, but not so much as to overwhelm you. 

Our server was Daniel, and he was delightful. He was attentive, funny, knowledgable, and helpful. Truthfully, he is the main component of what made our dining experience so memorable.

I couldn't decide between the chicken tamales and the chicken enchilada, so Daniel suggested I get the combo platter as to enjoy both! I did prefer the enchilada to the tamale, but both were great, filled with shredded chicken and topped with a mild green sauce. 

The manager, Mike, even stopped by our table to insure we were having a good dining experience. I was so very impressed with service. 

I would definitely suggest Cabo. Go in and ask to be seated with Daniel!
