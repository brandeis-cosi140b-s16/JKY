What a great dining experience...I was in town for Vegas with my Rusk team members and we had our team dinner here.  The margarita's are huge and after a long weekend of working our asses off in 110 degree heat.  A nice margarita did the trick to cool me down.

Everyone's meals came out in a timely fashion, and looked delicious as they were coming down onto the table.

I had the Salmon Tropical.  I can honestly say that this was the first salmon meal I ever ate at a restaurant that wasn't dry.  IT was the best salmon I had ever eaten.  Even mine at home couldn't top this one.

The salmon was not only moist, but the sauce around it was devine.
