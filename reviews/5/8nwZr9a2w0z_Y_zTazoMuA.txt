This is my go - to, what are we going to have for lunch or dinner place.  This is hands down my seven year old's favorite restaurant.  The employees are really friendly, the menu has lots of choices to suit all kinds of tastes, the restaurant is clean, the prices are reasonable...what more could you want?  I'm usually here at least once a week.
