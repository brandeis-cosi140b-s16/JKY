My first order: a Charred Skirt Steak Bowl with brown rice. 

Everything from the steak to the beans were prepared amazingly. I don't even know how to articulate how incredible everything tasted. I ended up coming back again the next day for dinner. That night, I decided to try a Bowl with a different protein: the Braised Green Chili Chicken. And my verdict is: just as incredible.
