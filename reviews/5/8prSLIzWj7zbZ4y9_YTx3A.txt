Stopped in on Ash Wednesday and was please to see that the cashier was not startled by my ashes.  (It happens).  I was very pleased to see so many other ash bearing families there too.  I had California bowl with blackened talapia. It was awesome with just the right amount of kick without any salsa.  My husband had the original fish tacos with everything on the side as he is such a picky eater.  The kitchen obliged and the meal was perfect for him too.  We've been back another time for the same meal and were very satisfied.  And even though the Sangria is bottled, it was very delicious!
