Drove by Dick's Hideaway for years and always wanted to try it.  Well, my sister-in-law and I finally did. Had breakfast this morning. It was fabulous!  I don't even like eggs and I ate more than half of the 3 that were served on the dish I ordered.  My breakfast was Carne Adovada and it was fabulous!!  We are making it a point to go back in a couple of weeks with a relative who is coming in from England.  We know he will love it!  We can't wait to go back! Both of the people who waited on us were wonderful and very pleasant.
