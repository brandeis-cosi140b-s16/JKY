This is the second year I use them to Cater our end of year company event. [I've never actually ate at the restaurant] 

About the Catering:
They were awesome! so professional! they came to our job with everything ready to go, they set up and served all our employees. The food was great and had a lot left over, even though we ordered lunch portions. I also ordered a Flan, which was delish! I would definitely recommend them as caterers.
