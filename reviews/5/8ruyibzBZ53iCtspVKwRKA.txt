LOVED LOVED LOVED IT! Came on Saturday night for my cousin's bachelorette weekend celebration. We were in a group of 9, and all of us loved our meal choices! Definitely worth the price! I had the tostadas, delicious, and a few of us had the short ribs...AMAZING! The restaurant on the indside is really beautiful and great ambiance! I had asked for them to have balloons and flowers on the table when we arrived and it was really pretty, they did a great job!! Our server was sooo sweet!!  We had a great time! Highly recommended!
