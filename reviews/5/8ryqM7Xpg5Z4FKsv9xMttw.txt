I've been here four times and going again this week.  Haven't been disappointed yet. 
Even tried their $10 weekend lunch special...chicken nachos.  Was going to order something else with it since I saw it was also listed on their appetizer menu but the waiter advised me not to.  It was Huge!  My wife and I couldn't finish it.  Blue Moon beer was great and seemed like it just came out of a freezer.  Never once had a bad experience with the wait staff. They seem to go out of their way to please.  Once my 'free' chips seemed a little leathery and they quickly brought me out a new batch.
Oh, and great decor.  Never get tired of looking around.
We used to go to the Mexican restaurant at the Southpoint but this place, located in the Silverton Casino, is heads over heals.
