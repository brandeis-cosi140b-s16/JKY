This is my favorite mexican place. The shredded beef is a must... I highly reccomend the ropa vieja w/black beans and plantains. The meat is super tender and has excellent flavor, well seasoned black beans and plantains are nice and crispy and sweet. I love their cheese chili rellano as well, the combo plate is the way to go with cheese chili rellano, shredded beef burrito and chicken taco.. the best of everything. The service is good, they are quick and its a good place to sit and chill. I will say to avoid Sunday lunch unless you have kids and are headed there after church. Went this past sunday and kids were running around like crazy... wasnt very relaxing, there was also a wait.
