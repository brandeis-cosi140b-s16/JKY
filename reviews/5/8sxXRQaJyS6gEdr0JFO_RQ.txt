Visited the one on JW Clay Sunday, they always have the best and (strongest) Margaritas anywhere. The buffet was good with lot's of choices and all very fresh. I miss the old Los Arcos location but this one is brighter and better selection. Phillepe is awesome and I congratulate him on his new arrival. Awesome food, drinks, and always fresh.
