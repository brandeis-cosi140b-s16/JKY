Rolled by this place on my way to San Diego and there is literally nothing around! Not wanting McDonalds, tried this little gem out. Lost confidence as we drove up to it but reGained confidence when we read other Yelp reviews. 

Had an array of yumminess- beef taco roll ups, nachos, carnitas taco. Staff was friendly, place was clean, food was awesome! They have a drive thru if you don't want to dine in or a patio to eat in the sun. Will definitely go back!
