My coworker told me about this place, so glad she did. Great Mexican good and made from scratch. No canned stuff here. Even our chips were handmade. What was most impressive was the waiter. He couldn't be older than 15 and was helping his mother run the entire restaurant. He was very professional and even working on a Saturday! I can't wait to go back.
