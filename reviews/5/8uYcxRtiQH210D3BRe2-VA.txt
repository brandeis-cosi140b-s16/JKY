SOOO GOOD! My boss suggested to eat here after clubbing at Marquee and we came around 2:50am before closing and there was no line at all. :) I only tried their adobada (al pastor) and their carne asada fries. mmm & I love their sides! Especially their fresh grilled onions! :9 watch out on their grilled jalapenos...its super spicy! My friend started to cry. :( lol

For only $2 a taco, I am definitely coming back here!
