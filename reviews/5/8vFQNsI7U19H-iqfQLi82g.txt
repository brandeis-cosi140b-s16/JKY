We had a party of 6 for a "meet the family" sort of event and showed up at 9 PM on Saturday night, and we received absolutely stellar service from our waitress Lincoln. Our original server disappeared after saying he would be right back, and Lincoln stepped in to pick up the slack, first taking our drinks and appetizer orders while she looked for our server and then taking over our table for the rest of our visit when he never returned. Everything came out quickly, all of our orders were accurate, our drinks and chips/salsa stayed refilled all night, and the food was great! Both the mothers that tried dishes with the Baja Sauce raved about it, and the two people that ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler were very happy with everything. This was my most pleasant visit to Macayo's yet, and I can't say thanks enough to Lincoln for the top-notch service she provided for us! :)
