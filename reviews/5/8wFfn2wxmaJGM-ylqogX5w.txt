Really good! I stopped by to kill some time and get dinner. Ended up with chicken enchiladas which were delicious. Served on a sizzling skillet with plenty of fajita veggies underneath. Guac was homemade and very good. Salsa was very good. Service was good. My only semi-complaint was that the sangria was mediocre- but I still drank two! Will be recommending and will be back!
