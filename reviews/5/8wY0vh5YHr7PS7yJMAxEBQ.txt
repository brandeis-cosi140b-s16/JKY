One word: delicious! We were hungry, so naturally we looked at yelp for late lunch/early dinner ideas. I stumbled upon Escobar, a place with not very many reviews, but all high, less than a mile from our house. How could we go wrong?

We were promptly greeted upon entering and seated at a table in the dining area. The very nice waiter (and possibly bartender? wish we got his name!) informed us that it was happy hour (yay!) and told us the daily specials.

I ordered a margarita ($3 during happy hour) and C ordered a blue moon ($2 draft during happy hour). We ordered the guacamole based on the other reviews. The drinks were fantastic, as was the guacamole - would definitely recommend.

We decided to order dinner from the street items menu so we could try a variety of things. C ordered 2 chicken street tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. I ordered the chorizo gordita and a chicken and green salsa tamale. My items were very, very good, but C's street tacos were AMAZING. The chicken was super moist and tender, and it had been marinaded in something that gave it the most delicious flavor. A must try, indeed! 

This is a wonderful, hidden gem in the north central neighborhood that is worthy of a visit!
