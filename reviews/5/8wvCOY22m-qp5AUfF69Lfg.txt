Great service and kind owners. This is a family owned branch. It looks like a little like a hole in the wall tucked in the back of the AM PM gas station. But don't be discouraged. Try one of their authentic tacos, tortas or the delicious carne asada fries. On weekends they make fresh menudo. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed if you are looking for authentic and hearty portions of food.
