This place has all you need: full service bar, food and hookah. Two thumbs up! The drinks are very reasonably priced, $4 for a glass of wine? I'm definitely coming back. Our hookah server was very attentive and friendly. Large lounge with an outdoor seating. 

I wish they would play something different than ghetto rap...
