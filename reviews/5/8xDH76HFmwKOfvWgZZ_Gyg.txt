This place never disappoints. By far the best Tex-Mex in town. Quick service with friendly staff. The difference is in the food, all-natural no added crap that most of the chains have. Homemade guacamole is amazing. Best hot sauce around!  I will never go to Qudoba or Chipotle ever again. It just doesn't taste as good and I prefer to support a local company. If you haven't tried them you're missing out.
