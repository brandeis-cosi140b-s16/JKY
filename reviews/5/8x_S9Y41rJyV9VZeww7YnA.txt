Let me just tell you: after years of enduring AWFUL Chipotle locations in Columbus, Ohio I was in HEAVEN at this location! 

It was so clean, the staff was extremely friendly, the ingredients were fresh, my steak wasn't a salty mess. The burrito was rolled beautifully and my bowl was perfectly proportioned. The black beans weren't runny. And the guacamole had just run out and been replaced with a fresh batch and it was almost as good as my own, homemade guac. (Almost.)

Although I do have to make a drive to get to this location, I will ABSOLUTELY be returning! 


Re: review by Chris, my steak was on the rare side but I LOVE it that way!! Different strokes.
