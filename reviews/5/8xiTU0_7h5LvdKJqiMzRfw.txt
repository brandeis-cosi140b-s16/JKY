For the person that said this location was closed, I am positive it's still open. I think you are thinking of the one on Ray and McClintock. Anyways, I know this isnt exactly fancy dining but I saw another person review it and I couldn't stand by and not have a word on this place. EPL is cheap and delicious, two things I love in a meal!!! Ive tried numerous items on the menu and almost all have been delightful. My favs are the pollo bowl with flour tortillas, the chicken tostada salad, and the chicken with a couple of sides. Their tortillas are really good, soft and warm. If you are going to get their sides, get either the pinto beans, mac and cheese, rice, or corn. I had the coleslaw a long time and remember it being dry and flavorless. Their churros are really good as well if you are looking for something cheap and sweet. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and all of the salsa's are very tasty. I especially love their house salsa and the verde avocado salsa. Other entree items that are good are the chicken taco's (though pretty greasy) and the green chili quesadilla. An item not worth getting: the classic chicken burrito. Kinda dry and sad. Haha. Anyways, if you have not tried EPL, you must!!! Its not at all like KFC and the food is fresh and delicious.
