My husband and I dine out quite often.  JJ's is always on our list every week or 10 days.  The food is always consistent.  No, it's not flashy, but you can count on a solid meal.  

Besides the food and atmosphere which we enjoy, the staff is, in our opinion, top notch.  One person in particular knows exactly what we order, unless we throw him a curveball.  But the other waitresses come very close and are good.

So dinner for us, including alcohol, is around $25.  Where else can you have a solid experience, great food and service for that price?   Thanks JJ's!
