I have driven by this place numerous times and never thought about it. I've been missing out! I saw many good reviews about this place, so thought I'd check it out. Think a Chipotle like experience- first pick a burrito, salad or bowl- pick your rice ( I don't think I can do seaweed so brown for my salad. I got to sample the pork and the chicken they were both good- but I especially liked the pork . Then you pick your veggies and dressing/topping. Such a great experience and the coconut bark may change your life ! Ok... maybe not... but it's amazing!!
