I wish I could give them more than 5 stars. 

By far the best authentic Mexican Grill in Madison that I have tasted. Plus you get a stamp card. Once your buy your 10th entree, your 11th is FREE! 

Just amazing simple food. Tacos, burritos, fajitas, etc. Nothing too fansy but that is what makes it great. They are just doing the basics but it's done so well. 

I go there at least once a month. 

Try them out. SOOO worth it and the $$ are EXCELLENT!
