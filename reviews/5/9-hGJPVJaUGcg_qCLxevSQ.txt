Ok I'm impressed, and I ain't that easy to impress when it comes to food.  I visited on a Sunday night when it was probably not the busiest, so hard to judge service timing.  It was good enough for me.  I chose an appetizer, achiote/pineapple glazed baby back ribs, and the cucumber-avocado crabmeat gazpacho soup.  Both were creative, tasty, and well executed and served renditions.  At $8 each, what's not to like?  This was plenty of food, but I couldn't resist ordering dessert because it sounded so good even after a filling meal.  It was.  Subtle mango chile sorbet paired with coconut-pineapple macaroon cake was light enough to reinforce that I made the right decision to order it.  Couldn't have tequila since I was on call for work, but I will definitely return for the opportunity to sample one of my favorite spirits.  Decor seemed pretty cool with clean lines featuring wood, leather, and fabric.  Courtney, my server, was pleasant, offered good recommendations and made sure to let me know about the happy hour 4-630 on weekdays, with half price tacos and tequilas.  I'll be back
