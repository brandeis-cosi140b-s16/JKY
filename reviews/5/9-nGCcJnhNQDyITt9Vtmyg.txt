I went with my husband and my best friend on Friday to check this place out. Initially, it was hard to find because First Friday was in full swing. Once we found it, we were greeted right away and seated at a nice table with a lot of room. (I hate sitting elbow to elbow with the table next to me!) The decor is really nice. Very artsy and fits in perfectly with other downtown restaurants. Between the three of us, we got practically everything on the menu. Our favorite thing on the menu was the queso. So freaking good! We couldn't figure out what cheeses were in it, but it's really yummy. We all got the house margarita, which was super fresh and had real lime juice, not a crappy sweet and sour mix. And they were only $3 a piece!! Can't beat that. We had excellent service-no complaints. We are really looking forward to going to Paz again when they have the full menu!
