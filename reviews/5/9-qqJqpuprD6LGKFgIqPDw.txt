I haven't been here in 10 years.  I don't know why I waited to come back.  My parents were in town visiting, and I wanted to take them somewhere they hadn't been before.  After thinking about where to go and looking on Yelp, I remembered Lindo Michoacan.  EVERYTHING was good.  I had a combo plate with a taco, a burrito, and an enchilada: Superb.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.  Rest assured I will not wait another ten years to come back.  I'll come back again and again.
