I have truly missed Cafe Rio until this one opened up!!! So much better than chipotle! Love the steak salad. If it's your first time going to a Cafe Rio, do yourself a favor and just pick a meat, pick a salad or burrito and let them make it the way it was meant to be made. They know what they are doing, it's really great stuff!
