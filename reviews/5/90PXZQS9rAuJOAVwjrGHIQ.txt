I'm going to agree with SK. I live real close and I've been raised on Authentic mexican food and this place is great. I'm also in the food service biz, experienced some fairly frightening/disgusting things, but julioberto's $1 taco's are my favorite in Phoenix. Favorite taco's. not cheap tacos, favorite altogether! I've been coming here for years and have yet to be disappointed. When my order has been messed up, they were quick and happy to correct it. I'd drive here, but I'm lucky enough to be able to get there in less than a 5 minute walk.
