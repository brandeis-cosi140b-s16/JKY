From beginning to end this was an outstanding dining experience. The table side guacamole is so amusing to watch and so fresh, the butternut squash tacos are light and flavorful, and desert with French press coffee is on point. Even more so than the food, the service is highly impressive! Our server Jeff was very attentive and made us feel special even while he was busy. Isaac, the expert guac maker, was so kind, professional and fun. They are both true assets to the place! I recommend the mission for a delightfully memorable meal!
