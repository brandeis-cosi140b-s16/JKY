Thanks to yelp we found a decent place to eat in Vegas.
Fresh, delicious and cheap.  Good food, although the service is a little slow, but the sign already warned us it could be slow.  The food was good.  Not over salted or too greasy.  Excellent fusion tacos, we had the beef and pork.  Both my kids liked their tacos.  Enjoyed the Kimchi fried rice with eggs, portion large enough to feed a family of four.  Excellent combination of flavors and spices.
