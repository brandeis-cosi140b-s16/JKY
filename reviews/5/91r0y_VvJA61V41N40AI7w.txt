My wife and I came here for our first time and were not disappointed! The only negative thing I have to say is the chips were a little too greasy.  Amazing beans and rice and so much flavor in the steak fajita! The cheese enchilada was the best I've ever had and of course we got a fried ice cream! Amazing! 2 thumbs up for Ajo Al's!
