Good food and service. We tried a little of everything since this was our first time here.  The best part was the carne asada quesadilla.  It had so much meat and cheese.  The salsa bar is pretty legit also and it has 5 different salsas.after I selected my salsa the nice cashier lady came over and brought me a bag to put them in so they didn't spill.  Next was the bean and cheese burrito enchilada style.  The carnitas weren't that great but they weren't bad.  The carne asada taco was good but Would of been better With some avocado and less onion.  If you're in the area you should for sure Check them out.
