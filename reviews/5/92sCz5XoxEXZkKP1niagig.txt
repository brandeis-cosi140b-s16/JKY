Omg amazing authentic home style Mexican food. Portions were huge. I got a chimichanga that was the biggest I have ever had. They also sell churrros. Excellent service, nice, polite and low cost for the amount of food that u get. It looks like they use 32 Oz cups for the drinks too!  

Anytime I am in this area, I am coming here to eat!
