I found my new favorite brunch spot! The brunch menu items are served with a complimentary mimosa or bloody maria. You get a huge portion, a side of potatoes and fresh fruit served in a cinnamon sugar tortilla cup. The entrees we ordered were about $11 each, so all that and a drink is such a great deal! 

I ordered the huevos divorciados. Its a corn cake with 2 eggs on top with a green sauce on one side, red on the other. Both sauces were amazing, but I liked the green more. The corn cake was perfect, looks like a pancake but not sweet. My husband ordered the chicken fajita omelette, which was huge. The sauce thats on top is so good. Lots of chicken and veggies with plenty of cheese but not overloaded. 

Service was very friendly and our food came out so fast I was surprised. From other yelp reviews I've seen they offer $2 mimosas on Sundays. We had a second one after the complimentary, but we weren't charged. So thanks Cantino Laredo for great service, great food, and free drinks!
