Very authentic Mexican food. Refried beans were excellent, and the Carne Asada Chimichanga was fantastic. Decent d√©cor and mariachi music playing in the background. Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. Located in an unattractive strip mall, this restaurant is a hidden gem. My highest recommendation.
