This place is the BOMB!  Although we live a 1-1/2 hr drive away, whenever we head to Phoenix are for anything, we make sure to time it so that we can hit the Spotted Donkey in Scottsdale for either lunch or happy hour.  The frozen margaritas are to die for - they use something like a slushy machine to blend them and it keeps them slushy with no separation of ice & cocktail for the entire drink.  They are the best I've had anywhere! The tempura shrimp appetizers are the largest shrimp I've ever seen and the presentation is amazing.  The jalapeno shooters are a must have each & every time we go there and the calamari appetizer is like calamari steak strips with none of the stringy tentacle stuff attached - so delicious as well.  Everything we've seen being served as elicited comments from us such as "oooh that looks good" or "we should have ordered that too".  If you are lucky enough to go when Scott the bartender is working, you are in for a treat - he is a native Arizonian and a fountain of interesting, little known, knowledge regarding all things "Arizonian".  Personality plus as well and always has a genuine smile & a great sense of humor too.  Do yourself a favor and get there - if we can make it and have a 3 hour round trip each time, anyone within a 50 mile radius of Phoenix needs to experience this place.
