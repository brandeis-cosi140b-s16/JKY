I have been going to eat here for at least 15 years now. As stated in the other reviews, this was once known as Lily's Cafe. When it reopened as Fajardo's the restaurant had some remodeling and updating, which it greatly needed. The food stands the test of time. My daughter and I love the Green Chili and Eggs breakfast which they serve on the weekends. I have had just about everything and it has always been good. The servers have always been friendly and accommodating to whatever my kids come up with for them to make. This is a great for those who are sick of chain restaurants but still want consistent, quality food.
