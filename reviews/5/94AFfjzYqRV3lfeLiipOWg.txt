We LOVE this place! My husband and I were both regulars of the Rainbow location and we were so beyond excited when we found out about the Warm Springs location because it's right down the street from our house. I wish I could remember her name, but the girl at the front counter on Black Friday was the sweetest! She went above and beyond with service and helped us extra with our two little ones. We love being able to support a local business too. Props to Braddahs!
