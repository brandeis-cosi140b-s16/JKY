Don't let the location of this restaurant fool you; it's a hidden gems among the in-the-know locals.  All you can eat salsa bar and amazing bean dips!  Their menus aren't extensive, but it has your usual suspects, which exceeds expectations. 

I love their taquitos from the appetizer section.  It is enough for a full meal.  Margaritas are also awesome.  Must try if you're in the neighborhood!
