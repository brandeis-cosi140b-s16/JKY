It's fast casual Mexican grill that's between chipotle and café rio. A nice change up if you get tired of always visiting chipotle. I like the fact that there are sauté bell peppers and onions to add to our salad and the gauc was included. Good little place near our home. Got to stop by and try it. When you see postal carriers and metro stop in for lunch you know it has to be some what good. The quesadilla is killer tasty.
