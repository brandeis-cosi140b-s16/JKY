This is my 3rd review.  Once again my wife and I visited our favorite restaurant!  The occasion was our 15th wedding anniversary.  And, as with the previous 30 years of visiting Serranos, the experience was MEXICAN HEAVEN!!!  Our waitress, Tammy, made sure that every detail of our meal was perfect.  As always, the restroom was immaculate.  The bean dip, salsa and chips flowed endlessly.  Never have I tasted such masterpieces of culinary delight.  My main course, frajita, arrived smoking in the skillet.  My wife ordered a combo plate.  We ate until filled and brought half home.  They brought out jelada frita (fried icecream) for dessert.  We left feeling like our stomachs were smiling from ear to ear!!!!!  HUGE RECOMMENDATON!!!!! 10 STARS NOT ENOUGH!!!!!!
