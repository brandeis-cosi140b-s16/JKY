This was our first restaurant stop of our vacation and I have to say that it started with a bang!  I had the beachhouse burger and it was Amazing!!!!  My hubby had the brûlée burger and it was awesome as well. We also had a side of sweet potato tots, yummy!  Not sure if they were made fresh at the burger joint but to be honest, I really didn't care. We haven't tried the shakes yet but we're hoping to make another trip there before we go back home. 
It's not a place for people who like ambiance but c'mon, you're there for a burger!!!  We will be back!
