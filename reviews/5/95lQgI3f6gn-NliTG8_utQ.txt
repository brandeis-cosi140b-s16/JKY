Love Garcias.....


I love going to Garcias. It is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Arizona. They have great fajitas and a fantastic happy hour. The bean dip has slipped some, it used to be much tastier but it is still pretty good. Great margaritas and normally great service. The outside seating is also very nice. I would recommend Garcia's to anyone who wants good Mexican food!


Update....

We just recently celebrated my sisters 30th birthday here. We came out for happy hour so we were able to deal with the whole family being there :) We requested outside patio because it was such a large group and we were interested in the happy hour. We had grandparents that "couldn't handle the heat" so they allowed us to eat inside and still get happy hour prices. The server and the manager were very attentive to all 21 needs that we had in attendance. They did such a fantastic job dealing with so many people and made the experience great. No ones food was sent back it was all correct and everyone enjoyed themselves.
