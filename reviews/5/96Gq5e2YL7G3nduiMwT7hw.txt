Bean Tostada. Side of rice, small Diet. This was my mantra for years at lunch time - I  used to go for lunch almost every day, and still go frequently. My whole family loves it. The beans and rice are killer - so fresh and homeade - I am hungry thinking of them. The chips can be not as good if they aren't hot, but normally are really good and salsa often has a slight kick that is perfect. We have tried it all - tacos - the shredded beef is SO good...tostadas, taquito's, burritos, enchiladas...etc...never have i had a bad meal here. Its also fast, and inexpensive. What's not to like?
