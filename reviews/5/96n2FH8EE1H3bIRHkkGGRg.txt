Omg!  This was truly a find. I came upon this place by accident and feel blessed to have found it. As a traveling salesperson I have to grab and go. While waiting for my appointment I sat down to eat here. The Chile Relleno with green sauce was to die for. I would have licked the plate if it was proper. The price was so reasonable and it came with rice and refried beans. The complimentary tortilla chips came with 4 different sauces. I am now stuffed. To top it off, I feel like I was awarded a sopadilla for desert. Next time I am in Arizona, this is my go to place.
