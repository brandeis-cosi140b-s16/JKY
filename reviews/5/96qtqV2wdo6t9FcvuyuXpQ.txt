They have the best tacos! My boyfriend and I go 2 or 3 times a month for Taco Tuesday/Thursday and you can't beat 3 tacos for $3. They don't drench the meat in seasoning or sauce which makes for delicious tacos. Service is extremely quick for us so I'm surprised that other reviewers have had major problems. We're always seated within 30 seconds of walking in the door, get chips and salsa right away and get our tacos no more than five minutes after ordering. They have tasty Mexican rice too, and the rice and tacos always arrive hot and fresh. Love love love El Toro Loco!
