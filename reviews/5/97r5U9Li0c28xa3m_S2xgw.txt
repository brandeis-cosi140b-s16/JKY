So happy there is now a location by my house! Best Nachos in town with there large round tortilla chips covered in shredded pork, beans, cheese, and slices of fresh jalapeno. The Fajitas are amazing as well. If i had to describe there sausage/steak fajitas it's like fajitas combined with the best sausage and peppers from chicago combined and wrapped in tortillas. They have a slight sweetness to them which is refreshingly different then most fajitas in town. Couple that with great food, nice atmosphere and impeccable service and you have one of the best dining experience in Nor-Dale. (North Scottsdale)
