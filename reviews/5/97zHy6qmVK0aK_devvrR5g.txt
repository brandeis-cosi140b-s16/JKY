Moments after landing I was whisked away by my cousin and his words are ... I know I am going to take you to some very fancy places to eat while your here, but the first place we have to stop to is this taco place. 
He was very right we had the spicy pork tacos with the fried peppers and green onions on the side. This was the perfect start to my trip to Vegas. I also loved the horchata (the rice milk drink) and it was the best I ever had. 
If your going to Las Vegas I would make sure to give this place a try.
