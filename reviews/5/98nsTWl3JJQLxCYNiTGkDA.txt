Best fish and shrimp tacos I have EVER had.  It is served with just a very light breading and you get a lot of fish or shrimp for the price.  They give you the tortilla and fish, then you add the rest.  The coleslaw is awesome with all of the different sauces.  I got all my family hooked on these and we are usually in once a week.  When I have out of town guests, this will be one of our stops.  Thanks to Tortilla Fish for the best tacos ever.....
