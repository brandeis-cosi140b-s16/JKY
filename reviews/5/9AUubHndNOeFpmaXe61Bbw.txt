I went there for the first time this past Saturday night. It was aWESOME!

Description: Blue Burrito Grille is very much like a Chipotle, Baja Fresh, or Rubios, only probably better than all 3. There are no servers. There have the typical Mexican fast food condiment bar, but complete with chips. 

In comparison to similar establishments, Blue Burrito Grille offers
   -Better Chips. Tri-colored restaurant style chips that are NOT stale     like Rubios and Baja Fresh.
   -A wider variety dishes, combination platters, salsas, and meats. 
      E.g. Cod, shrimp, Mahi Mahi, Grilled Chicken, Machaca Chicken,  Beef, Carnitas, Steak?
    - A wider variety of wraps/torillas. For health-nuts, like me, they offer spinach or multigrain wraps instead of the typical boring flour or corn torillas.
    -A better variety of teas as well as beers. They use China mist teas and have a descent variety.

** The Salsa Verde alone is worth the trip!!! I make my own salsas at home all the time and I will tell you this is the best Salsa Verde I've ever had. I could drink that salsa by itself! (In fact, i did a little when i got home -- i took some to go).

I will definitely be Back.
