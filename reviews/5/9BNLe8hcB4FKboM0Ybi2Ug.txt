Service was great. The server was tentative and knowledgeable.  Loved the atmosphere and interior deco. 

We had the blackink squid as appetizer, its soooo good!! Warm, tender, and full of flavors.

We then had the plate that serves 2 ppl with Carni Asada, Polo, and Chorizo. Came with rice and beans, Mexican corn chowder, and 3 kinds of sauces. 

For dessert, we had the chocolate cake! Warm with strawberries! 

Everything was soooo goood! Great for date! Price is very reasonable for what you get!
