Don't want to visit too many chains on my travels.  Was interested in a burger and the first place Yelp took me to was closed, so this place popped up.  Honestly, when I pulled up, I thought about leaving, and actually started to drive away, but my insides were telling me to give it a try.

Was immediately greeted by the counter staff.  They clearly explained the menu and made suggestions.  I took them up on their burger suggestion, and was pleased I did.   Also had their BBQ chips, which were A+.  Did see done people get the tutor tots, which looked yummy too.

Interesting flavors on shakes, but I stuck with a standard strawberry.
