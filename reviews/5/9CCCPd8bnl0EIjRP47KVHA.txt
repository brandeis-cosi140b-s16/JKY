A-MMM-A-A-A-ZING!!! Seriously folks, this place makes some freaking awesome food and margaritas. I literally feel like bursting into song when I get to eat here (and after a few margs, I do).

The only knock that could possibly be given to this place is it's service. It is hit-and-miss. But seriously folks, what do you expect in a college town?

My suggestions are going during happy hour for a homemade margarita at a killer deal. Also, for eats, you can't go wrong with the Steak Ranchero or the Mole Chicken. Both make me salivate just to type their names.

Fortunately if you are starving, it helps that their salsa is righteously good. So, go there soon or run the risk of me beating you there and eating yours too.
