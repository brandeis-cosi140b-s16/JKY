So my wife and I were stuck up the road at Arrowhead Hospital for four days after the delivery of my baby girl. My wife was getting tired of hospital food and sent me out to find a Chipotle. I found this one off 67th and the 101. I was greeted by friendly workers who promptly made my food. As I made it to the cash register, a friendly lady, probably the (owner/manager?) greeted me in such a friendly way it really stood out. She noticed the hospital bracelet on my right arm and asked about it. I told her we'd just had a baby. The whole crew chimed in with smiles and sincere congratulations to my wife and me. The lady said, "It's on us, congratulations on your baby girl!" I couldn't believe what a gracious gesture they'd made. It was completely unexpected, which made it have even more impact in that moment. 

If you've been to Chipotle, then you know the food is fantastic on it's own. It was the customer service and friendly demeanor of the crew that really made the difference for me. I'll drive past the Chipotle closer to me from now on just to give this one my business. Great job guys!
