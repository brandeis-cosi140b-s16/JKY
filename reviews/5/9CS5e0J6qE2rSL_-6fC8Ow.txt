I'm going to give El Santo the big five star review. This place is quite a scene!

From the folks that bought us Spanish Fly in Old Town, this takes the concept upscale in an area of town the could only attract an older crowd. If you're just there for lunch or dinner, there's a nice dining room with music playing and a nice atmosphere. Beyond that, there's a bar with a stage and dance floor for bands, along with  a bunch of TVs and a pool table. From the bar, you can see outside to the pool and patio. It's a big pool with a lot of seating and several private cabanas. There's even a DJ stage outside and the music is bumpin'.

The staff is a bunch of really hot young chicks in bikinis. My colleague and I had a table in the bar. Our waitress mentioned that it was her first day, but she also worked ad Spanish Fly and knew how how to take care of us properly. The food is straight Mexican. Both of us love our meals. It's obvious that there's a real chef in the back; this isn't bar food. 

El Santo isn't for everyone. I wouldn't hesitate to have lunch there anytime, but I'm not into the bar scene, so you won't find me in the pool or hanging around at night.
