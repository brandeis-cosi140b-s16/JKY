I am giving this place a 5 star for food and a 3 star for location.  Located in the heart of downtown/old town Avondale.  This little place which is actually much bigger on the inside is a little bit of heaven.  Talk about Mexican comfort food. They have all the usual fair plus a few good soups.  

You start with the Chips and Salsa.  The Salsa was homemade and oh so delicious.  I had the BBQ Plate which was an explosion of flavor.  I can't even tell how good this was. It came with seasoned beef, rice,beans, guacamole, and tortillas. My mouth waters thinking about when I will be able to get this dish again.  My wife had the Machaca Burro which was also very delicious.  Soda's are served in huge cups.  

This place is good.  It looks a little bit run down on the outside but on the inside its nice and clean.  Even though this is defiantly a spot where local regulars come do not be intimidated to walk in as they are very welcoming and after one visit you will want to be a regular.

If your looking for GOOD homemade Mexican food try Cafe Zamora.  Come here for lunch and give it a chance. The price is just right too.
