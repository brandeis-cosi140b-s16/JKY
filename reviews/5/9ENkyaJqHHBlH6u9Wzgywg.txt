Never disappointed!   I have been coming here for years (since it was La Taqueria) whenever I have to go to any of the downtown government offices/ court.  The food quality is very consistent and fresh.  I love the Carne Asada, carnitas, and chicken in a burrito or tacos.  They have authentic chips fried in house and very fresh pico.   The absolutely best is the green sauce they have at every table.  I put it on everything!
