Ahhh... So many happy memories here, usually involving margaritas. This place has always been great, but it's even extra super cool now that the light rail passes right next to it. It is the old Tempe train depot after all, so it makes sense that trains would still be passing by. 

Macayo's is always hoppin', often times with live music on the expansive patio cooled by misters. (There is even a little waterfall.) They're usually pretty great about accommodating large groups. My extended family meets here for all major events like birthdays and holidays. 

I'm a creature of habit and stick to the chicken chimis. I most certainly have my ceramic margarita glass that I take with me for a dollar off my drinks too. Mmmmm...Tequila.
