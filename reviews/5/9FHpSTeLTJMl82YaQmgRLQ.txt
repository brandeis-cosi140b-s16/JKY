Great authentic mexican food. Recommended to this place by a friend. Decent prices. Huge portions. My friend that lives in mexico swears by this place when he is in the US. I feel like that alone speaks for itself. Will update my review if it seems like quality takes a dive like in some restaurants I used to love.
