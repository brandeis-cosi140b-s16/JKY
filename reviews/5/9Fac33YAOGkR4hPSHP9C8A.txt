Fabulous food and service!
Everything we got was great and I would highly recommend this place.
It is a very busy place, and you can expect to wait for a table.
But it is well worth the wait.
The service is unbelievable-we had our supply of chips, salsa, and soft drinks replenished multiple times.
The best part was we never had to ask for refills of anything, yet we never ran out of anything.
I have been to Mexican restaurants hundreds of times(honestly at least a thousand), and would say this is the best service I ever had anywhere.
The quality of the food we got matched the service.
Try it- we thought it was A++++++
