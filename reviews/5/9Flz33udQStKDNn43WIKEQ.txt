I've only been here twice now, but both times were AMAZING!

Great food, great service... will be back very soon.

FYI, you'll be tempted to fill-up on the out-of-this world salsa and dip which arrive to your table moments after you do. If at all possible, resist the urge. As good as these treats are, your entres will be even better.  Recommended are anything with the green chiles when in season, and if not, trust the Serrano family and their specials. We have been more than impressed thus far and will update this review as we go back again and again and again!
