Best Pastor Tacos this side of the Border period!  I have tried to find good pastor tacos here in vegas for years, some that would be as good as the street tacos I had in Monterrey, Mexico every place has failed miserably except gordos tacos which are decent but not as good as these.  These matched the tacos I had in mexico, they also sell the "Gringa" taco which is the way many of the street vendors sell them in Monterrey, MX which is,:flour tortilla, white mexican cheese, lots of pastor meat, avacado slices.  I highly recommend the "Gringa" taco, it's big so one is usually enough.  In mexico they also sold one called a "Campechana"  which was exactly like a "Gringa" but it had pastor meat and bistec/steak meat mixed.
