This is one of our very favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley!  We've been going there for years.  Although their menu includes BBQ entrees, we would suggest not going that route .... it's not their specialty and can't beat the Mexican entrees.  The salsa is fresh and has just the right level of bite.  The chips are fresh and warm.  The service is terrific.  The restaurant is clean.  Try Enchiladas Vallartas, seafood enchiladas ... or any of the traditional Mexican dishes.  You can't go wrong at the Gecko Grill!
