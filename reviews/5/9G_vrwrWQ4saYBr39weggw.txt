Go here! Our waiter, John was awesome and helpful with our menu choice.  We had the seafood ceviche for an appetizer..$10 very good, and each of us had the combo #2 and substituted the pork tamale for the paco taco....this was a great meal!  Upgrade for $1 to the side salad..definitely worth it!  We will go back here next time we are in Charlotte!
