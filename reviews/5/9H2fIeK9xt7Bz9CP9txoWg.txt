I got no problems with this place.  Food is great, prices are fair, service is quick and friendly enough.

Tried Carne Asada Nachos the other day instead of Carne Asada Fries my old stand by.  I actually like the nachos better, not as heavy but still loaded down with all the good stuff.  I also love the rolled tacos.
