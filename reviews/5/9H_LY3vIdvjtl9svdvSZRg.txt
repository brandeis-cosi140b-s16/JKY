Sitara is STILL the place to be! $13 AYCS most nights. The DJ's are fantastic, the food is incredible and most importantly, customer service is great! The employees let you enjoy your time without being too much of a bother but still manage to take care of you.

Alcohol is not currently being served but have high hopes that it will be soon. To clarify a couple of things, no outdoor seating. Everything is indoors. Security will continue to check your ID which means they are doing their job, lots of dancing and the vibe is fantastic! 

I never have a bad time when I go to Sitara!
