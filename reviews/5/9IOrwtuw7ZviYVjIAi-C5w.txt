I read the AZ Republic review of The Stand and decided to check it out because it's just down the street from me.  The food was great!  The building is small, but cute and clean with a few seats inside and a handful outside in a covered patio area.  I ordered The Stand burger with cheese and Niman Ranch bacon and shared fries and chips and guacamole with family.  The burger was one of the best I've had in a long time; great flavor, good sauce and fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles.  The fresh cut fries were also excellent, not too crisp but not soggy.  The chips and guac were also great, it will be a tough decision next time which side to order.  I highly recommend The Stand and will definitely be going back!
