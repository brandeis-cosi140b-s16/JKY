This place rocks! There new expansion is amazing! The owner did a great job. We love playing darts and pool. Our server took great care of us and our food was amazing. I love that they have live music or a dj 2 or 3 times per week. Really it's the only fun hang out in the area. My husband and I love their home made tamales and menudo. Never had ap bad experience here and I think all these people saying horrible things about the food/service really just have nothing better to do with their time... their "ghetto" festivals are a lot of fun for my whole family so I guess if their ghetto so are we!!!,
