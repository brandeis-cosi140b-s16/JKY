Authentic Mexican - the food was mild, but very unique compared to the usual at some of the big Mexican franchises and chains.  Excellent guacamole, and my fish tacos were superb.  Seemed like everything was FRESH, not out of a restaurant food service can or box.  Our waiter provided excellent service and made sure we were satisfied every step of the way.  When we paid the check, he wanted to make sure that we knew his name, that we would come back again, and that he would like to be our waiter again. We will be going back again in no more than a week. It was that good.

Several restaurants have failed in this location in the past few years, but I hope this one makes it and stays for a long, long time.
