Really great taco shop- I like this place and Los Favs equally. Food is not greasy at all, very reasonable, a huge selection and more combinations available than you would normally find at a taco shop. I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly, they have a salsa bar complete with free hot carrots and peppers. They have these little red hot sauce containers, a deep red, and green- they are all yummy! I have liked everything I have gotten here. Amazing breakfast burritos, carne asada, chimis, etc... My favorite thing about Betito's or Bepito's are their tortillas! YUM- They are so fresh- and delicious. Oh and not to sound lazy, but they have a drive-thru! :-) Try it!
