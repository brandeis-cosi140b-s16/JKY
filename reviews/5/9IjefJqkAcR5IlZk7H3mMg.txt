Im in the west valley and always have been so when im short on time and this is one of my go to places for lunch or simple dinner. 

Have not had a torta that was not good yet but my personal favorites are the hawaiian or the ribeye. They have agua fresca, mango is my go to but limon is pretty popular too. Last, the ice crean is fantastic also.
