My husband and I ate here for the first time for lunch on 02/28/2014. Customer service was great all around. Our waitress was on top of everything- she never let our drinks or chips get low and checked on us every few minutes. Super quick service. A manager came around once and asked how everything was. Every person I even walked past was friendly and courteous and had a smile on their face. And of course, the food was delicous. No complaints.
