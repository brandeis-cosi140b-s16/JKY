In my opinion, La Mexicana is the BEST mom and pop style mexican joint in town. I stumbled upon this place by accident years ago. I dont come as much as I should, but if im near by, I WILL stop in. Tacos are good and chimichanga is best in town. Every other item ive had is fantastic. Carne Asada plate is also good. 

Unfortunately, this place had a major renovation a year or two ago. They repainted the walls, and took down all these cool things off the wall. Rumor has it that ownership changed? Since they did that, i feel like food has gone down from what it was, but food is still the best in town. This place was the best mexican food ive ever had 2007-2011ish. Since, not as good but worth the visit.
