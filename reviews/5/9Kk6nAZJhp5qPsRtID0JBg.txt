So if I was just coming in for a taco or burrito, I would rate this maybe a 4. You won't find authentic Mexican cuisine, but Pasqual's is SOOO much more! They have the largest and best tequila menu of any place I've been to in the US and what's more is that they understand what they are serving. My husband and I joined the tequila tour that offers many benefits and a wonderful variety each time we come in. I have to give a big thank you to Seth, who is the greatest bartender of all times. Now, onto the food...My favorite items are the chicken nachos and anything with the black beans. They use quality cheese and their chicken is moist and well seasoned. We've never ordered anything we didn't like and have been dozens of times.
