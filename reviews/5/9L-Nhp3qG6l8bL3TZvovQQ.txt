This is the best authentic Mexican food in Charlotte!  I love the grilled chicken salad, fresh guacamole, carnitas tacos, and low carb margarita.  The bartender Fabiola is awesome, we always sit at the bar bc she is fun!  The owner is also very friendly, had a great conversation with him about food and his home in Mexico City. Love Love Love this place!
