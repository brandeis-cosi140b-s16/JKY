Such a fat kid they know my name. I come here saturday mornings, looking like death warmed over seeking the warm and reassuring sustenance of their delicious fare. Their Carnitas are a favorite of mine, the Machaca is succulent and moist, the confections are glorious and stand out amongst the various panaderias Phoenix has to chose from, even my tiny little 89 yr old spanish grandmother loves them, and she is one tough galleta to please. Azteca is one of my favorite places to bring my family for a quick breakfast, since they all love it and it's easy on the wallet. So many memories I have of this joint I just love it and hope someday when I have a little snot nosed brat to tote around I can bring him here and shut him up with some pan dulce. Viva Azteca!
