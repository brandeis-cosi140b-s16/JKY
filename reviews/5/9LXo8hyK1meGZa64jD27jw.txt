Wow wow wow!!!! I was highly impressed with the food and service that I received here today!

Let me tell you, I live right across the street from this Se√±or Taco and I was also more than hesitant to try their food due to my experience with the restaurant that was in the location before.

After passing by it everyday for the last month or so, and with my mom's reassurance that it has since been cleaned, remodeled and is now under new ownership, I gathered my courage and stopped in for a bite to eat. Like I said before, I was more than impressed!!!

I ordered the Chile Relleno Burrito and it was the most delicious Chile Relleno Burrito that I've ever had. I also got a side of both the red sauce and the green sauce and although they both had great flavors, the green was just amazing!

I enjoyed my experience here so much that I even gave them a phone call to commend them for their great work. I'm so happy to know that there is a delicious and safe place to eat right next to my place. I will be returning, and I recommend that you try it out too!
