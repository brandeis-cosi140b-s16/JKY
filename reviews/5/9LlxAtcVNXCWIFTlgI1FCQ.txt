It's like a Q'doba and a Chipotle had a baby, and then an American family adopted that baby. Seriously, what a great idea to have sweet potatoes and roasted potatoes as ingredient options!

You go through the line like you would at a Chipotle, choose your entree type (taco, burrito, salad, etc) then choose the ingredients and sauces. If you're in the mood for a healthy version of a Q'doba burrito, get a side of the queso sauce and taste that delicious familiarity without the fast-food calories. 

Anyway, we had a salad with chicken and a burrito with chicken, and both were ridiculously fresh and good. I'll try the tacos next time for smaller portions, because those burritos are ENORMOUS!
