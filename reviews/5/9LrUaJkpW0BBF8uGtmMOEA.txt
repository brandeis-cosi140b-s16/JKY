Diamond in the rough. We were referred here by friends a couple years ago and have never looked back. Very Authentic.  Great Atmosphere.  Place is usually packed. And haven't tried anything there I haven't absolutely loved.  The shrimp empanadas are a MUST!  Best fish taco I've had in Vegas. Carne Asada & Fried Shrimp platter are fantastic.
