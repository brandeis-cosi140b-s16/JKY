The food here is amazing first of all the salsa is among the best have ever had I ordered the three item combo the tamale was moist and the filling was delicious the chili reano was light with a great batter finally the shredded beef enchilada was so packed full of flavor .... My wife ordered the chicken mole enchilada the best mole sauce I had ever had 

Combine the amazing food with a really nice atmosphere and friendly wait staff a real five star jem
