I was so excited to find this little gem downtown. It is going into my lunch out rotation. I ordered a chorizo burrito as a test run and it was great! I brought it back to my desk and ate it in less than 5 minutes. I need to go back and savor it! There was a great variety of meats to choose from, my husband is partial to tongue. Try out Bea Taco Town, you won't be disappointed!
