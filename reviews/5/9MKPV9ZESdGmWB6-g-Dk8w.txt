KoMex was the first place to introduce me to the idea of Korean Mexican fusion. It became our go-to place when we wanted a delicious, inexpensive, homemade meal. I found it because of a Yelp review I read, and it did not disappoint. It looks a little shady on the outside, but looks can be deceiving. The food is wonderful, and the staff is friendly and kind. And it's so inexpensive!!! My husband and I would both eat a delicious dinner, and the bill would be 9 dollars for the two of us! You can't beat that anywhere in Vegas! The tacos are phenomenal, the chips are fresh, and the burritos and nachos are so good! Since we've moved back to the Midwest, I miss that place so much! If you're in the Summerlin area, do yourself a favor and visit KoMex!
