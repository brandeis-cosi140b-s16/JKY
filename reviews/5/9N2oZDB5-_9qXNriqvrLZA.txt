I haven't tried the Carne Asada here yet (but I know I will be back to do so) but all I can say is BEST BEAN & CHEESE BURRITO EVER!!!

After reading some reviews on yelp I decided to go and pick up lunch at America's.  The parking was a bit tricky to figure out at first, and I wouldn't recommend going after you get your car washed or if it is raining because it is just a dusty, dirt lot; but once I got inside and got my burrito, all was forgotten.

They advertise that they don't use any lard in their beans...and well, lard is usually what makes the beans so creamy and delicious; so I was intrigued.  Well upon my first bite, I was not missing the lard at all!  The tortilla was so fresh and delicious, and the beans, oh the beans, were creamy and had just the right amount of melted Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with them.  I was in heaven...and for only $3.25....this is definitely a budget friendly and waistline friendly meal!  

P.S. I only ate half of the burrito to start with, and then ate the other half later cold....it was almost even better cold!

I will be back...and next time...I will try to force myself to try the carne asada!
