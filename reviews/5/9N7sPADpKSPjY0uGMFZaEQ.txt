Authentic and delicious food! We were in LV for EDC and looking for something different than the usual fast food etc. Saw the great Yelp reviews and rolled over to Tacos LV.  Our expectations were exceeded! Felt like home as we entered and had a warm welcome from behind the counter. Friendly staff all around. Relaxed atmosphere with TV on, our food was brought to our table with a smile. We got the special that day, 3 tacos with rice and beans. Delightful and Tacos LV has their own homemade hot sauce/salsa ! And to top it off I was able to get Mexican Coke to go with my meal. The plaza they are located in is set back from the main road, but don't give up this place is a hidden gem ! We will def return when in LV again!!
