I've been in Henderson for approximately four months and have had some sketchy experiences at fast food joints. Fortunately, this Taco Bell has always been good to me and my better half.

There's a girl by the name of Britney that works the drive-through window and four out of five times when we've rolled through the drive-through, she has taken care of us. Last night at approximately 11:45 PM she greeted us and was very sweet and kind, always smiling and happy.

The food has always been great and the service is over-the-top cool. Thank you Britney for making our fast food dining experience so pleasurable!
