I don't order out a great deal but when I do it is usually late.  Burrito Drive delivers late.  I like that.  I also like that they do have a fair amount of vegetarian options.  The burritos are big.  So much so that I normally have half for the moment and the second half the morning after.  I have had the Hungry Hippy and alway get the beans and rice or chips and guacamole as a side.  Is this a meal fit for a king?  Of course not, but who would expect that of any restaurant that is affordable and delivers to the college campus crowd?  Are they better than most?  You betcha.  

They deliver on time, the food is always very good and I have never once thought to complain. 

My only negative is that they are slightly, and I mean slightly, on the expensive side but again, measuring food quality to late delivery and customer service, I think that it is appropriate.  (Tip your delivery guy well people, regardless of from where they are delivering!)

All in all, I like Burrito Drive and have willingly and will willingly use them often.
