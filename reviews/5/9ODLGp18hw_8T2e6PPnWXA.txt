I'll keep it short. I stopped by while I was on lunch and the food was great. They make their own chips and salsa and they were delicious. Ordered a carne asada burrito, the food was great and it was very cheap. I found out they deliver too. Ill be ordering from this place a lot I recomend to give it a shot!!!
