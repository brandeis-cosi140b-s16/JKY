I am a lover of Mexican food and have tried many places across the Valley; this joint is awesome. 

I had their fish tacos, and they were well-prepared and delicious. Their salsa bar was also very nice. What I appreciated most was that they are not stingy with portions. They included large chunks of beer-battered fish in my fish tacos (which the tortillas weren't even able to hold).

I wasn't a big fan of their rice, but everything else made up for it.
I will definitely be back, and highly recommend this place.
