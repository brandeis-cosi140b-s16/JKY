Delicious tacos, normally fast service except on Sundays. Wait was too long for starving church go-ers. Overall good spot if you can get past the gang of chihuahuas that lerk at the kwik-e-wash next door. Plus side, if you take your date there on the weekend you can score a bootlegged dvd to watch at home. In all seriousness, really good authentic food at a good deal. Cash only.
