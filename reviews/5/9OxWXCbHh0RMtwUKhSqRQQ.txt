I love this place!

I grew up in southern California and I think I know a little something about mexican food.  This place rocks!  The food is inexpensive and they give you huge portions.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is great.  The burritoes are big and tasty.  I wish I could live in San Diego and eat here every day.  I lived in Henderson for 8 months and I was a regular here.  This is a must stop in for me every time I visit Vegas.
