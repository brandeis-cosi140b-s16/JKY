So we were in the area and I remembered that there was a Mexican place near so we pulled into the parking lot. The place I was thinking of was gone and replaced by Sabor. The place was very clean and has a really nice bar area so we decided to give it a try.

It was early, 4:30 so the place was kind of quite..and kind of nice so we pulled up to the bar. The bartender offered us a happy hour drink menu and things were looking up. $3.00 for one of the best margaritas I've had in a long time. So far so good as we sipped our drinks and relaxed for a bit. The owner/chef Scott came out and informed us that their menu was not the usual Mexican that most people are looking for. According to him it's the type of food that you'd get in a higher end restaurant in Mexico City. Well we've been to Mexico City and he was right on the money. The chips and salsa that you normally get is replaced with a sampler platter of salsas and dipping sauces with some really cool innovations and little plantain bananas as a pallet cleanser. (Nice touch)  The sampler was awesome and really unexpected. You can really tell that they love sharing their food and like to give the customer and experience in the process.

After the chips and salsa platter we thought we'd take it slow and try out the fish tacos. A really, really well presented platter of very fresh tacos came out. I liked the fact that the fish was not fried fish. It was fresh and really well cooked and flavorful. Rice and Black beans with a funky and tasty little cream sauce anchored the plate with 4 perfectly constructed tacos fanned out with just a wisp of of a redish orange sauce was very enticing. The flavors all blended really well and were fantastic.

I have to say this was a great find. I recommend Sabor and I will make it a point to take their recommendations on my next visit. It sounds like their Mole is the specialty and I am eager to give it a shot.
