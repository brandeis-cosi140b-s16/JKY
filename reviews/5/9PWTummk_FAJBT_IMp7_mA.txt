One of the best burgers ive ever ate! Staff was very friendly. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner Bret and chatting with him for a bit. We were from out of town but he made us feel right at home. Got the special of the week the 'Bret burger' which was incredible. Bbq infused bacon, maple butter, corn bread crumbles, on a brioche bun. Are you kidding me!?! Party in my mouth. We also got the pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty, the sweet Potatoe tots, the pretzel fries, and Bret brought us out some french toast fries at the end. GET THE FRENCH TOAST FRIES.  How did i not think of that? ?? All in all it was a great meal and i wish i lived in town id be there weekly.
