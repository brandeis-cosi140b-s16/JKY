Seriously awesome Mexican fast food. Try the spicy pork vampiro (sp?)  

The wife totally dug the tongue. Neither of us were brave enough to order the brain. 

As well as your typical Coca-cola/Fanta soda well. They also had well drink dispenser serving orchata, tamarind, sorrel and others. 

Definitely one of the best places to eat in Vegas. Close to the strip. Near Stratosphere, Circus, and Riviera casinos
