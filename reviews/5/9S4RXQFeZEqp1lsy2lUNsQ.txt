Can you say EXCELLENT! 

I would rate this better then Ponchos (south Phx) and right on par with Carolinas. Yep you read right. 

Granted this was my first time here but come on it was great! 

The place is in a strip mall south of Peoria on the west side, with other types of Mexican shops all around it. It fits right in. 

I had a green chile burrito, rice and beans. It was $4.95, it came with chips and salsa too. 

The burrito was plenty big and filled with a great flavored and cooked Green chilie, topped with green sauce and cheese. The cheese was a white type not the cheddar type. YUMMY 

The beans were one of my favorite parts, they were soooo good. Again topped with the white cheese. 

The rice was very good and had a great flavor. 

The chips and salsa we re wonderful, anytime you get free chips is good. They also serve a guacamole type dip with the chips. I do not like regular guac but this was rather tasty. 

The service was excellent, friendly and attentive. 

The seating area was larger then expected and was cleaner then CHINO but could still use some decor updating. Not a fancy type place. 

I will be back but this time I am bringing my family!
