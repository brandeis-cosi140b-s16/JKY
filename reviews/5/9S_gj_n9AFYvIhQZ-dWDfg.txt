Delicious, fresh Mexican food clearly made from the heart.  Had the superb recommended green enchilada with rice and tasty black beans.  A very welcome alternative to the usual stale big chains lining the main roads.  Pleasant small intimate dining area with outdoor seating available.  Definitely worth leaving one of the resorts for a peaceful, delicious meal, Safeway around the corner.  I'm looking forward to my peach empanadas for dessert later!
