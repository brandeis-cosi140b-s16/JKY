Just ate lunch and fell in love with this place all over again. I haven't been to the one on Central in years and decide to try this one for lunch. It started with me thinking I found the best chips and salsa in town. Then the waiter suggested I try the green chile stew. OMG. It is the best ever. Be prepared for some spicy hot food. Everything was hot but not so hot it took away from the flavor.
