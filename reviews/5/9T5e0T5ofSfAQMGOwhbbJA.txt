Ok, first off, they have probably some of the best Steak Ranchero I've ever tasted!!  So yummy!  The salsa is way better than any other "berto's" out there, infact they have a salsa bar.  It's good price for what you get.   Best part of it all is!  THEY SPEAK ENGLISH!!  I mean you can actually understand them.
