I love this place! I've been here several times and have never been disappointed.  This time I took 3 friends with me and the owner came out to meet us.  She was very friendly and laughed with is as I ate a large cooked jalape√±o! Be prepared for the heat if you try that! I had the pork burritoand it was definitely a winner. All my friends enjoyed themselves too. I recommend this place!
