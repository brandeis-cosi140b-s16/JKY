Tako!  Even the name is cool.  If you haven't yet, make an effort to try this place.  The outdoor bar seats right at the kitchen counter are absolutely the way to go, and well worth the wait to nab.  

So, tacos.  I mean, they have other food...  But, tacos.  For gluten-sensitive peeps, they are more than willing to sub out a corn tortilla for flour if you request it/let them know you're gluten-free.  The only taco that's permanently gluten-y is the (breaded) fish taco.  Bummer, but so many other delicious choices, like the mushroom taco.  So yum.  Meaty, perfect, maitake shrooms with a garlic aioli, truffle huitlacoche salsa, and brussel sprout salad.  It makes my mouth so happy.  

Also, the guac is really, really good.  It's fresh, and quality, and thick, and they do this thing where you choose your funky add-ins that make it even more awesome.  Don't be afraid to try that weird combo!  You know you wanna!  

Aaand the gin fizz was pretty cool.  I loved the addition of avocado and rose water, and making it with Jarritos was a good choice as well.
