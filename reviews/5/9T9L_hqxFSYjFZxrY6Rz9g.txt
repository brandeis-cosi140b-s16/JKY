Took a little while for food but tasted great.  However, I asked if horchata refills were free and the girl said no so I said nevermind. Unknown to me, the owner or regional manager or someone happened to be standing behind me and heard. Asked for my cup and walked back and got it, said it was on him.  Nice touch, and prompted a review. Love that kind of service.
