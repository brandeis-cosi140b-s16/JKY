We were out at the base for a doctors appointment and wanted some good authentic food on that side of town, so we Yelped.  This place came up as a neighborhood place with some real authentic food.  The place looks small from the outside, but once inside there actually is a lot of seating.  You may not see that when you walk in the door but they have two back rooms.  

This is a family owned place which has been around for some time and they have some excellent chips and salsa which is bottomless and some of the best food I have had on that side of town.  

I thank all the previous Yelpers for this place as you were correct.  The wait for the food after ordering was pretty quick and the food was plentiful and very tasty.  This is a place I would return to anytime even if not on that side of town but wanting some good food in a family place.

I know I have a very good mexican place near my house, but the drive and gas would be worth going to this place again.  They have lunch and dinner specials which makes the price worth the gas.  A must try if you end up near the base.
