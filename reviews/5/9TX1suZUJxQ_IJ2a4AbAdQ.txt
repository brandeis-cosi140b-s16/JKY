We came here to eat after seeing this location on Diner, Drive ins and Dives. It was Saturday Feb 14th at about 3:00. We assumed at this time of day it would no be so busy, we were wrong. :) I over heard the guy taking orders tell the people ahead of us it is about a 30 min wait for food. We were not starving so we were okay with that. 
I ordered the Beach House burger, the Wife got a plain cheese burger, my one son ordered a bacon cheese burger, and the other son got the texas BBQ burger. We all shared a order of seasoned fries and sweet potato tater tots. We all loved everything!! I really enjoyed my burger and tried a bite of the BBQ burger and will probably order that one next time. 

We all left happy and full. The food was worth the wait. 

PS. I know some reviews talk about the staff in a negative light. We did not have a problem with any one. The employee taking the order was friendly and did not rush us even though there was a line of people behind us. I saw 2 runners who where taking food to people and they were busy but had smiles on their faces. There was also 1 employee walking around busing the tables as people left, he was also answering questions people had as they came in. 

We will be back!!
