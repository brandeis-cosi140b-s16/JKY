This family has been serving Mexican food  to west valley residents for decades.  La Loma is a sister restaurant with another location that closed down a few years ago. The food here is always delicious and the service is friendly. Once they get to know you, you feel like family.

As others have said, it's not the traditional restaurant experience, but we go there for the food and not to be waited on. Stop in for a great lunch or dinner and make sure you try the hot sauce...it's amazing!
