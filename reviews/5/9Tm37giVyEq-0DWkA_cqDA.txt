October Menu of Taco The Town is great, offering a variety to meet everyone's tastes. I love the dessert idea of Pumpkin Mini Chimis! 
Manuel's is a long standing face representing the face of quality Mexican food in the valley. Since their restaurant on 32nd & Indian School, they have provided us with the level of food and friendly service we've all grown to love. Thanks!
