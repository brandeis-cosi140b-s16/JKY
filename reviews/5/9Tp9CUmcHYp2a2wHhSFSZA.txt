Authentic fresh street tacos for sure. My deal buster for any tacos is if the place will take the time to have homemade tortillas and this place does. At first glance I thought $2.75 for 1 street taco was a bit pricey. I proceeded to order 1 carne asada and 1 pollo. When they came out I was happy to see they were packed. All ingredients were fresh and tasty! I suggest ordering an extra tortilla for each taco because there is enough filling in each taco to make 2 tacos. I am stuffed after just 2. The owner was very friendly and service was quick.
