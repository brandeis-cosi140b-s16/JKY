My wife and I went to this restaurant looking for some good Mexican food. What we found was not that...

We got there and the front of the restaurant looked cheap and commercial. It was not very big and we didn't see many people eating there. We started looking up and down the casino to see if something else looked better. But...

We decided to try the restaurant. Edgar, the chef, talked to us first and he said that he would be able to accommodate our wheat allergy. The food that he served us was great. I had just spent a week in San Antonio and none of those Mexican joints could hold a candle to this place. There was so much flavor, great portion size, and all three of us were stuffed for under $20. Thanks Edgar for such a great meal! Don't judge this book by its cover, get in there and let the food do the talking.
