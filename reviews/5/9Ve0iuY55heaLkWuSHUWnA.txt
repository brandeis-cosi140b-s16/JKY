The salsa is surprisingly good, very fresh and with good spice. It wasn't hot (to me) but it had great flavor and I'm pretty much a freak of nature when it comes to hot stuff. The chips came out hot and freshly made, as they should. The salsa was the best part of the meal in my opinion. I had the Veggie Chimichanga, which was a first for me...it was pretty darn good though. The service was slightly slow, but we were there on a Friday night so that was to be expected... and their friendliness definitely made up for any delay. That and munching on the chips and delicious salsa of course. The restaurant is small but bright and feels like it's family run. We also tried the fried ice cream and were pleasantly surprised there too. It was fresh and delicious. We've been many places that pre-make theirs and keeping it the freezer completely destroys the texture. Glad that wasn't the case here. We will definitely be back and it's nice to have a go to spot in our new area.
