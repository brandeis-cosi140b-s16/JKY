I entered the Clarendon hotel a cool old retro hotel to get to Gallo Blanco Caf√©. Waiter was really nice ordered an Anchor steam draft they also have hop knot witch is a plus drinks came time to order the tacos I picked the Cochinita, Carne asada beef and the Fish (Eco - friendly) Mrkt. Chilled a bit sipped my beer the tacos came out I took my first bit of the Carne Asada beef and had a flashback of all the taco shops I have been to in the past and said why god!!! This was a write home taco unreal the fish was kickass as well so refreshing I had to order another Carne wow I want more now just talking about it.. It's a must stop anytime I am a fan for life.
