My husband and I recently checked out Pink Taco while in Vegas. We had an awful trip to LV, but an awesome experience at Pink Taco. We chose to go for lunch and it was pretty quiet when we went in (on a Friday afternoon). They had a ton of staff on and everyone seemed really friendly and like they enjoyed their jobs. My husband ordered a beer and I ordered a frozen mango margarita. It was the best mango margarita I have ever had. They gave us tortilla chips and a plate of three dips (two salsas and a guacamole). The guacamole was smooth and creamy and the salsas had SO much flavor. They were delish!!

My husband ordered the chicken and cheese enchilada with green and red sauce and I ordered the chicken burrito. We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and it was a nice break from the chain Mexican restaurants we often frequent back home. We also ordered the churros for dessert and those didn't disappoint as well!

The atmosphere was great and we loved the decor of the restaurant. We definitely recommend checking out Pink Taco if you take a trip to Vegas! :)
