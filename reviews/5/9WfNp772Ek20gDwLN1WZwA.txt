The food is excellent!  Authentic Mexican food with great flavor.  My order always comes out hot and is made exactly as I order it.  The beans and rice are amazing and the tortillas are very fresh. The margaritas are a classic lime flavor. They sell coke products (even coke in a bottle). This is a family-owned and operated business so you will see kids helping out or hanging out.  Try the Nick special (ice cream) - you won't be disappointed!
