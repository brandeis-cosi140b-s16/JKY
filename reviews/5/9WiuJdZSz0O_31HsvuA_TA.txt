I came here tonight and was pretty happy that I did ! 

They just opened 12 days ago they stated! I came in approximately at after 7pm for dinner after my work day . The line was fairly long - I must have waited 15-20 minutes ! 

I ended up ordering the Long Beach - Sushi burrito ! It tasted amazing ! The fusion of flavor was there ! There is spicy tuna in it but it's not too hot ! In addition, the chipotle mayo adds flavor ! I definitely well come back ! 

I give them props on that machine that rolls the sushi into a perfect roll and the utilization of IPads at check out ! Also they had 5-6 people behind the counter working !

Down side - they need more tables - business is booming! Their juices on the menu weren't available yet and let's Market more friends ! The food is amazing you can market your product more ! I loved it and many more will and do too !
