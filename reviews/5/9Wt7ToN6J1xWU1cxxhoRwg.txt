Great tasting & freshly made food, with the best ingredient...LOVE, just like mom & grandma use to use!!! You can really taste the difference in their food. They use freshly prepared ingredients, nothing fake or prepackaged. And best of all the juices are all freshly squeezed when ordered & the Orchata  is  the best I've had, freshly made too. You can see the love & passion she (the owner) puts into preparing your food. And she's very sweet & nice as is her staff. Being latino it truly feels like I'm visiting a relative & she's so excited to prepare a meal for me!  And that to me is priceless, luv this place!!!
