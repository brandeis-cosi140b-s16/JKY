My boyfriend and I love this place. As a vegetarian, I love that I have lots of options, from asparagus enchiladas to burritos stuffed with spinach, potatoes, carrots or cabbage. Also, if you get a burrito and like spicy food, ask for grilled jalape√±os inside. It's worth it. My boyfriend always gets a combo plate with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada and a beef taco, all of which he loves. The staff has always treated us very well, and the food keeps us coming back for more.
