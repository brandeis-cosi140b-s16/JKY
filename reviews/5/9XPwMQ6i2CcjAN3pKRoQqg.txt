Delicious mariscos, and micheladas with fast and friendly service. For those not eating seafood, some of the house combos are $3 more after 5pm. So go before to save a few bucks. Everyone that I have shared it with has really liked it as well. Ocassional band walk ins which is expected, but here you can actually have a conversation with your party since there is no ridiculously loud music playing. Total plus for me. 
Oh, and clean and cute bathrooms (at least the womens was) if you need to use it. 
I've been here many times with my husband,  was there yesterday with my parents and I want to go back again soon because my mouth is watering now!
