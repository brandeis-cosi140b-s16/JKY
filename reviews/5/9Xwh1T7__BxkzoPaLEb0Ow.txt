Like someone else said, "Hands down the best carne asada tacos in town."  If we lived closer to Los Tacos, we would be in serious trouble.  But we still make the cross-town trek monthly to eat their carne asada tacos.  I order mine loaded, with everything - comes with beans, cheese, pico, and guac.  Their homemade hot sauce is killer and perhaps the best in town.  You must ask for it at the counter.  It's not too spicy, but wonderfully flavorful.  Honestly, we've eaten here about 25 times and have not strayed from our favorite, carne asada tacos.  One taco is pretty large with double corn tortilla.  Two tacos will leave you feeling full and needing a nap!  The side order of rice and beans is good as well.  You can not go wrong with this place.  A must eat for any taco lover.
