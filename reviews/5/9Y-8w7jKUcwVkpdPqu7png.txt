I went there after reading the Yelp reviews and because it was only a few minutes away from my families condo! I had the Carnitas and Fish taco one day and a Chorizo breakfast burrito the other day. All were really yummy and the ladies working there were very nice! If you're in the area it's worth a try and it's cheap. They also serve the breakfast burritos all day, a plus!
