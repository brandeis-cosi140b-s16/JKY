Went there for breakfast & ordered the breakfast enchiladas. They were VERY awesome! I thought it was also interesting that even though we went in for breakfast that we still got free chips & salsa from the salsa bar. Also, another 5 star worthy attribute is the fact that they serve breakfast all day long.

I enjoyed my breakfast with a refreshing large horchata. I could tell it was from a mix, but it was still very good.
