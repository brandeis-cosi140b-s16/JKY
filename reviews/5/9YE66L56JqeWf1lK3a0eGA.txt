Beautiful location tucked in the valley, taking a great drive through the mountains, and suddenly you discover this wonderful place!

Yes, it's a bit touristy like and at certain times of the day, it's crowded, but it's worth stopping and checking out.  The saddle stools, the western feel, reminds me of a few old cowtown bars back home in Ft. Worth stockyards!  

It's a bar, so the food is just what you'd expect, nothing special, it was good to stop and enjoy the ambiance.
