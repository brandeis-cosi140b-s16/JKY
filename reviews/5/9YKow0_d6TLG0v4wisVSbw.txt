I came here after reading a lot of good reviews on this website and I'm really glad I did it. For me it's really hard to find good authentic Mexican food because my parents were born and raised in Mexico and my parents and grandmother used to make the best Mexican food which makes it hard to compared to today's restaurants. Especially with the lack of supply for lengua (cow tongue). I was very surprised not only the fact they had that kind of meat, but because it was super delicious! It totally brought back memories of my childhood and the good old days with my grandma cooking me dinner!
