Still coming to this wonderful place with almost two years under my belt of visiting. Still, I enjoy lilies guac, but it seems she has done a wonderful job training everyone on how to make it, everything with fresh jalape√±os is the way I take it.
I've been there for brunch and dinner and love both menus, mimosas with breakfast and tamarin lemonade for dinner. I tend to venture with the cilantro salad, it's great when trying to be healthy. Everything is always fresh and you get exactly what you want. Service is great, we have a great experience every time, no matter if they are busy or not. Everything is beautiful inside creating the best atmosphere that we could have, calm and upbeat. I will continue to come back and always will, and if I find another city with one, I'll be in that spot so quick to eat my favorite part, those wonderful chips that come complimentary. 



:) thanks guys so much
