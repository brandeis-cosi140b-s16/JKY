Chips and salsa were excellent. Wife and I both had fish tacos , and they were great as well. Very reasonably priced, and the margaritas were tasty too. I had the standard blended with salt and wife had a strawberry one that she said was good too. We were on vacation in phx of the holiday and wanted some good Mexican....go you won't be disappointed. Service was excellent too!
