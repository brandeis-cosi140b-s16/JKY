This place was good ...i felt like I was at my friend Alans house!!! lets just say I felt like I was in Mexico with the music playing..the food was fresh very tasty. Chips in salsa was on point like a box cutter. People were friendly ..overall place was clean and I will be coming here more often ..no more Filismoothies for this litto stomach.
