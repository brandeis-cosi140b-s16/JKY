I was walking with a bunch of friends when we decided to stop in. The place was alive with music and the bartenders were great. I got to meet the owner and dance with a great group of people. To slow down and eat, they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy the night. Next time I'm in town, I am definitely stopping back.
