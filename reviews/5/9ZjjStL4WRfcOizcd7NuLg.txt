I have never had any food here that wasn't a least very good and usually extra good.  This is Arizonan/Sonoran Mexican food at its best.  This is at both the old location and this seen and accessible location.  This new location is more user friendly and I don't feel like I'm in a speakeasy.  I saw a review where it was said everything here was just a variation on beef & chicken. well that is plain wrong.  The pork chili verde is the best in the northwest valley.  The menudo is rich and hearty.  The cheese crisps are great.  This is the only restaurant that offers fresh jalapeno or serrano chilies, not that canned or pickled junk.
