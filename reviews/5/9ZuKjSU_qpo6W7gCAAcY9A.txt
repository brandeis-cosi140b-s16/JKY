Met my Niece there for lunch and had the spinach-mushroom enchiladas and they were great!  I highly recommend it as "as good as it gets" Mexican food.  Lately, the Mexican food restaurants have been so Americanized that I have been so disappointed in them all but finally found one that I thought was terrific.
