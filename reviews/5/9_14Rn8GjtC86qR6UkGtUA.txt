Had a great dinner last night, but more important, great service! Our group of 3 had a 6:30 reservation, with tickets for an 8 pm show, across the street, at Mesa Arts Center.  Just before leaving our home for the restaurant, our neighbor fell and was seriously hurt. We called an ambulance, and, of course, waited to see our neighbor was in good care. By the time we left our house,  it was already 6:30. We would be a half hour late for our reservation. When we arrived  there were "walkins" at the hostess station, who were turned away, because the restaurant was full. I feared we would also be turned away. Much to our surprise, our table on the patio, awaited.  Aaron, the manager, and our waiter offered suggestions of dishes to order which would give us quick delivery of our meals. The margaritas, quesadillas, guac and chips were very good. We had plenty of time to enjoy our meals and comfortably make the show!
