After many sleepless nights I've decided a name more appropriate for KoMex. ChiKoMeRican Fusion Express. 

What the heck is right. 

I don't think I've have ever ate anywhere that serves Korean-Mexican fusion, Mexican, Chinese, and American. It is like the food court at a mall fell into a pot and KoMex was the product. 

What I like:

- Uber cheap food. For $1.25 you can get a taco, but not just any taco, Korean marinaded beef, chicken, or pork sheltered by two corn tortillas OR protein style (lettuce) at no charge! Good bye Taco Bell Grade D "meat". 

- It tastes good. YEAAAAAAAA!

- The portions are very generous. You can't even hold a taco without the lettuce, purple cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro falling out.  

- Everything is cooked to order, just in case you were wondering why your taco is taking 10 minutes. 

- FREE chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. They make their chips from flour tortillas though, but, it is free. 

- FREE fruits for dessert. Sometimes I've gotten oranges and other times watermelon.

- Drink selection is pretty interesting. Jarritos, Voss water, typical sodas, lemonade, Starbucks frappuccinos, and I believe I saw a coconut juice drink. 

What it is not:

- This is not a Kogi's. KoMex serves food more family like and Kogi's is more street and greasier.

- No Korean only items. I'll live. 

- Fancy. It is not in the best of spots, or has nice decor, but it gets the job done. 

- Going to make your wallet or bank account cry.

- Going to give you a reason to regret. 

yeaaaabuddy!
