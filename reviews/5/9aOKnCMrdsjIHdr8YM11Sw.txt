today i went on a food tour around town ...  and i first went to a Shanghai restaurant and this place is the second spot i stop in .... gotta tell ya it was just so good ...i ordered a cow brain taco, a pig stomach tacos and one carne asada taco .... the cow brain i dont really recommend it ,wish they coulda doing somethings better with the brain other than just boil it .... but the pig stomach and the carne asada was so good with grilled scallion and fried jalapeno and their salsa ....
