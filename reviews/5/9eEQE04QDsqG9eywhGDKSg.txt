Best fast food nachos... I enjoy the pork or their ground beef. They have a lot of salsa choices, black beans and refried beans... their queso beats out other comparable places like Qdoba (chipotle has chips but doesnt serve nachos, go figure). The staff is friendly and there usually it not a wait. Good value for the money.
