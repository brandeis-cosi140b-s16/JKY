We went to this new Restaurant on Maryland pkwy and I couldn't be more positively surprised; the staff is very friendly and outgoing and  the food was just GREAT !  
 From the beginning you can feel the nice atmosphere in there.
I truly recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves great mexican food !
