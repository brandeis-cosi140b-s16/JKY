I came in here around 10:00 am on Saturday. The place was packed! However, we were seated right away. I was extremely impressed with the authentic and unique d√©cor of this place. It was beautiful. Very original Mexican style. Not likes some of the fake cheesy Mexican joints. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Live mariachi playing. They have a hand-made tortilla stand with ladies constantly making fresh tortillas. If you order guacamole, it gets hand made to order right at your table. Also, when you are seated, they bring fresh refried bean dip, salsa, chips and Mexican noodle soup (sopa de fideo). Very nice touch by the way! I'm from Los Angeles, and I've never been to a restaurant like this before. I will definitely be coming back here next time I visit my family in Las Vegas. :)
