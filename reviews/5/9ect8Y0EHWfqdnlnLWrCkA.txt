After braving the construction zone that is N Tryon St, I pulled into the small strip mall with Las Lupitas. The place reminds me of every ethnic deli I've ever been to. Fridges full of drinks and a meat case. Few descriptions, a bunch of people working to keep the cases full, one cashier. I ordered 1/2 lb carnitas and 1/2 lb chicken to go. The chicken turned out to be roasted thighs on the bone. Both meats delicious and moist. You cannot beat the prices! $6 a pound for carnitas or chicken. I also got 1lb warm corn tortillas for $1. I also purchased a ripe avocado, a bottle of crema and 2 homemade salsas. Off I went back into the traffic battle zone to head to meet my fianc√©e for lunch. Everything tasted so well together, flavorful and fresh. I know next time I want pulled pork, I will just come buy it here and to tacos at home. I cannot recommend this place enough. Our impromptu picnic made us feel like we were in Mexico on the beach! Go to Las Lupitas to get something authentic to eat for a change.
