Awesome food and service!  The mucho grande quesadilla is what I ordered and it was SO good!  Great drink prices too-$3.50 for a draft beer and $4.00 for a decent sized margarita.  The food was taking awhile but before we had a chance to say anything, our waiter apologized and gave us $10 off our bill.  I think we have found a new favorite.
