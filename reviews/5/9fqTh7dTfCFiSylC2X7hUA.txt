First,  if you are looking to remodel your bathroom,  you should check our their restroom for inspiration.  Secondly,  the food is amazing. My husband used to eat here all the time and we've driven by it a bunch of times and finally tried it out this morning for breakfast burritos.  Let me just say,  wow!  So good.  Plus a salsa bar with the carrots and peppers.  Reasonably priced and good portions.  We'll be back soon.
