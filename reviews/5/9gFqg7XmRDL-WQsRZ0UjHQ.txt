I usually stop here after a long hard bike ride at Hawes or at McDowell Mt.(Fountain Hills Location). My go to is the carnitas burrito. Although I could devour the whole thing, I cut it in half and take half home. My daughter gets excited when she knows I'm going biking, because that means she gets the other half of my delicious meal! If I ate the whole thing in one sitting, that kind of defeats the purpose of the exercise I just did.

Everything is yummy, haven't had anything I don't like. Everyone I've taken there becomes a fan.  I love the chili oil, it has a great smokey taste and goes great on the burrito. The tomatillo salsa fantastic, so are the carrots and jalepenos. They need to open one of these in Gilbert/N. Chandler area. (near me)

The place doesn't look like anything special, small dining area, outside patio, some Mexican decor. But it's always clean, the people are nice, the food excellent, it comes out fast and hot. If you want sit-down fancy go to Scottsdale. But if you want good food, reasonable prices, huge portions, come here!
