Los Burritos... Simply delicious. A hidden gem to say the least! I walked into the small restaurant with colorful window art of Mexican food. I was greeted and served by a wonderful staff. I ordered a burrito expecting the usual taste of a burrito, however when I began to eat I was hit with a wave of childhood memories and flavors. Los Burritos is TRUE Mexican food made with authenticity and care. The meat is carefully prepared to an unbelievable quality and the recipes used are the same ones that would be used for a family dinner. I highly recommend Los Burritos.
