We read reviews but did not read when  the review were posted .   They were old.

They just opened under new management.  When we pulled up front only one other couple was in there.  We thought "o Boy".
Went  inside and was impressed how clean it was, the murals on the walls are worth going to see.  They told us they were sprayed painted with a can of spray paint by the top state graffiti artist.  We enjoyed looking at them while waiting for our food.
They do not have a liquor licence yet as we could not order a beer which we all knows goes with Mexican food.
The food came out and it was delicious.  I have not had a good shredded beef taco like that in a long time.  They use regular corn tortilla instead of store bought one. It was not greasy.  The cheese enchilada  was full of cheese and the sauce was different than what I usually get at a Mexican restaurant but it was good.
Everyone in our party enjoyed everything they ordered and would come back again.

Maybe by then they will have a Liquor Licence :)
