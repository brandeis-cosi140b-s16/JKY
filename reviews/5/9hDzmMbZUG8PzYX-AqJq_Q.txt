Honestly had to be one of the best Mexican style restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas. Our waiter Jesse blew every previous expectation by providing above and beyond customer service, our table was never empty. The Chef has blended some to die for dishes including my new favorite Imperial Shrimp, delicately fried and wrapped in bacon I'll be back for them alone. From start to finish a wonderful experience will be back soon.
