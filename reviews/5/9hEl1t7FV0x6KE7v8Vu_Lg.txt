I heave used Eat24 two times to have them deliver and while they are always slow 60 - 80 minutes, both times the food have been delicious. I just finished eating the best fajitas I have ever eaten from anywhere and it came from this place. 

So far I have eaten an carne asada which was pretty good, carne asada fries which were just delicious and the chicken Fajitas which as I mentioned were the best I ever had. 

Enjoy!
