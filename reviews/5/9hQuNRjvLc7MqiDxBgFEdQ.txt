In all honesty, I would give away one of my future children if it meant I could have free Chipotle for life.

All jokes aside, this Chipotle is my Chipotle.

Rarely do I get charged for double meat and when I do, the guacamole charge is absent.

The employees here are my dudes and dudettes and Bailey is the best Chipotle cashier girl this side of the Mississippi.

My only question is:

If I get a Chipotle tattoo, will I receive free chipotle for life? 

If someone could answer me this question, it would be much appreciated.
