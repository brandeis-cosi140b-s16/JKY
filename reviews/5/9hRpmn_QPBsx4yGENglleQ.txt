The Barracho Burro is amazing!  Also, if you love Pollo Fundido then you absolutely must try theirs.  

They give unlimited chips and their own unique salsa.

It's not really greasy and "unhealthy feeling" the way some fast-food mexican food can be.  You get large portions with high quality ingredients that taste amazing.  

I moved out of state but if I come back I'm here for nearly 2 meals a day, no joke.
