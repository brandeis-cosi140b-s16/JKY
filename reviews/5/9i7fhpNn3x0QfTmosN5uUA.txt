This is hands down my favorite taco restaurant in Champaign Urbana.  It looks very unassuming and somewhat questionable if you don't normally eat truck food. There is an easy menu of flavorful basics: tacos, flour or corn, American and Mexican, tortas, burritos, and guacamole. Everything runs from $2 (tacos) to $8 for a massive burrito. But the star of this place is the elote.  Being from Chicago, elotes are a part of summertime. It's easy to make: cheese, corn on the cob, and chil√© but the flavors have to be just right to be authentic. And luckily for us poor central Illinoisians, Motorizado figured it out. For $2.50 you can enjoy this wonderful treat. They do go fast but if you come by at lunch, they usually have it. The service is quick. Just grab two sauces and a Jarritto from the shop next door and you're living the life. Heads up that there is no place to sit except one picnic table that might snap if you sit too long. It's definitely a part of the charm,  lol.
