Okay I will never go to any other taco shop again.  I feel like I'm at Grandma's house getting the best Mexican meal.  If you are on 95 and Rainbow you must stop!  We had cheese enchiladas, chile relleno, chicken quesadilla, ground beef tacos, and I couldn't decide which was best.  All super delicious!!
