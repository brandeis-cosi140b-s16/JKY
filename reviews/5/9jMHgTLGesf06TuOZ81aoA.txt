This place is being re invented... The place has a new look and every  dish I've tried is amazing, it specializes in seafood Mexican style.... The staff is friendly and the place is clean, and newly remodeled looks great with its new Frida Kaloh  color palet...I hear the menu is going to add some new Latin flavor dishes keep your eyes on this place I feel it's going to be the new spot for many old and new comers!!
