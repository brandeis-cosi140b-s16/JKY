I never have any issues at this Taco Bell.  I've been coming here since they opened and I cant remember a time they messed up an order.  Today we ate inside and they brought our oder out to us.  I usually do the drive thru and they are always nice and converse with me at the window.  Its cheap and fast.  I'll keep coming back.
