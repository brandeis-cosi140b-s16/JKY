This location is a brand new one, opened a few months ago, right acrossed the street from where I work...so, I decided to walk over on my lunchbreak yesterday and try one of their lunch specials and I'm glad I did! They have a Five for $5 lunch special and I gave their Junior Chimichanga a try. It's a smaller version of their Chimichanga plate and just as tasty too. It comes with beans and rice, guacamole, and sour cream...very, very good! 

They have a nice open restaurant with many seats and tables and also seats and tables outside for beautiful spring and fall days when the weather isn't hot. 

There is a chip and salsa bar for your eating pleasure as well, so I will have to remember to try that with my next meal from there at lunchtime. 

Their staff is very friendly and accomodating and provides fantastic service. The place gets packed at lunch too, so you know they're doing the right things here. 

This is a very popular place with the crew I work with, so that alone speaks volumes as far as I'm concerned!
