This place is great! From the food to the people your not gonna find better. My family has come here for years and years. I drive 30 minutes to eat here, and it's worth it every time. The hot sauce is the best I've had in Phoenix. It really feels like your family here, everyone is always pleasant and the service is awesome. It can get busy but that's a good sign, right? It's in Sun City, but you've got to try it. I've read the complaints on here and I'm baffled. I eat here A LOT and never have heard a complaint or seen the sour puss face. Highly recommended!!
