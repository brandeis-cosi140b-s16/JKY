First of all the wait is long, EVEN if you make reservations. However, I'd advice you to make reservations. 
My friends and I waited for our food very patiently, but once we laid our hands on their carne asada and enchilada plates, the wait was definitely worth it. 
I had the seafood enchilada and it was superb. My friend gave me a piece of the carne asada plate and it was to die for. If you've never been to Javier's you should definitely check it out. All the hype is true =] hands down amazing food.
