THE BEST!!!!! Moved here from Cali, and this is one of the first places my sweetie took me to. Great service, AMAZING food, (better then what Ventura has to offer) clean, and affordable.
Family is coming in next week and I can't wait to take them here, yet sweetie is afraid they will never leave after they taste the delisiousness of this place! 
GO! You won't be disapointed!
