A blurb in Phoenix magazine caught my eye (great chips and salsa and $3 happy hour margaritas) and the 4 star Yelp ratings said it was worth a try. Happy to report that this place exceeded all our expectations. Chips and salsa are excellent, the margaritas are great (though we missed the happy hour special) and the food is fresh and excellent. Yelp had a 20% coupon which they gladly accepted. Our food came and it was as advertised fresh and very tasty. The guacamole that came with my carne asada was in a fried tortilla bowl which I ate after wolfing down the freshly made contents. Overall the food and friendly service will certainly bring us back here again.
