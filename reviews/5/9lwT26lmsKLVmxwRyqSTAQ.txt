I've been eating there for ... like 6-7 years already. Almost since they've opened and never been disappointed. I don't come that often any more not because food got worse :)  - only because I cook at home most of the time these days but if I'm in no mood to cook Taqueria is always on my casual dine-out list.

As for menu: tacos are great - con lengua are my favorite ones, I also get fish tacos sometimes. Burritos are good too - I like one with shrimp (they put quite a bit of shrimp in them). Actually I think you'll be safe ordering anything off the menu and you'll guaranteed to walk away full.

Mmm... I'm already hungry :)
