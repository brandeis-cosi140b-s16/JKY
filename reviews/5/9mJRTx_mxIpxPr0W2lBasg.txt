What a gem!

Strange looking little spot on the edge of Phoenix downtown... doesn't look like much, but it's clean as a whistle and very well cared for. The food is great and the staff is friendly and helpful.

I had migas con chorizo and she had the bacon and eggs breakfast. The waffle was a little more like a pancake than a waffle but tastes fine and the eggs, chorizo, cheese and tortillas were really good.

It's at the corner of Van Buren and 9th Ave and I can honestly you should check this place out. For us it's likely to become our regular breakfast spot here in Phoenix.
