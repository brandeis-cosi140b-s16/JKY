Been there many times, and the quality is consistently great.  Had a shredded chicken chimichanga, enchilda style (red sauce) the last time we were there, and it was amazing.  That sauce.... so flavorful.  Just perfect.

They've also really done a nice job of redecorating and redesigning the interior space.  They've now added a bar (you can eat at the bar if you so choose) and often have a guitarist playing during dinner.  They've colored the walls, and it's a really nice atmosphere.

Great stuff still.  We try to go often, as we really, really, really want this place to stick around for a long time.  My wife and I, and our two girls, all love it.  I thought it was perfect the first time I went, and it somehow keeps getting better?  They're working hard to improve all the time, which is fantastic.

Check it out if you haven't yet.  Highly recommended.
