OK I am not Mexican and I do not know authentic food but I do know what I like and there were plenty of Spanish speaking people eating here so my consensus is great food, nice portions and good people. All the food I had was excellent, the beans were the best I have had anywhere...Yum. The ambiance seemed authentic and intimate and they were very gracious to me. Best restaurant meal I have had in Vegas and I eat out often.
