I don't even like Mexican food that much to begin with... But I don't mind repeating this place every week.  Why I think Zaba's tastes so much better than other (Americanized) tacos joint... Like Qdobas, Chipotle, or Baja Fresh... I don't really know. I can't explain. I guess I am just madly in love with their unique recipe ? I must also add that quality of the food is fairy consistent here, which gives me peace of mind. Just a little F.Y. I. I just had jalape√±o poppers for the first time, and I am ready to drive back there for some more :)
