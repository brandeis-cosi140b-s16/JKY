I have ordered a few things from here and have yet to be disappointed. The guac is mashed table side and it is so fresh that it was hard to hold my self back. I was polite and dunked the occasional chip in there allowing others at the table to get a taste. Had I been alone I would have used my spoon to shovel that green goodness into my mouth and not even thought twice about it!


I then had the Menudo and it was the perfect amount of spice! Tripe can sometimes become chewy or bland but this soup had it down to a science. I have never had tripe that good before and will be back just for this soup!

I can't wait to go back for breakfast!
