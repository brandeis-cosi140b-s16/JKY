America's Taco Shop is one of my favorite places to eat and definitely my favorite fast Mexican food place. I particularity love the tacos and burritos (Al Pastor is yummy). The guacamole is very good and the salsas are second to none.

The Staff is courteous and friendly and the service is wonderful. I need to stop in for the breakfast menu as I have no doubt that is as wonderful as the regular menu.
