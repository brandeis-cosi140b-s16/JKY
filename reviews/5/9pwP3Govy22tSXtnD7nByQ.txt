Great tacos. Will be going back. Nice decor and open layout. Food is a upscale healthy style gourmet that is more modern and not your traditional greasy mexican food like what I grew up with. Some prices little high but not bad. Can be a casual experience or something little more formal. Open to going back every now and then.
