Too many watered down Mexican restaurants . Not this place! Great chiliquiles, red chili that tastes like red chili, not gravy. The hot sauce is actually hot. What a concept! 
   It's a good sign when you're  the only anglos in the joint. Next time you need a "morning after" breakfast visit DON lenchos. Hey just visit the next time you want real mexican food.
