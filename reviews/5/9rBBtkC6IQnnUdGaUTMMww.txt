Breakfast at Dick's Hideaway is an experience you'll never forget. Well, OK when you're 90 and sitting in a rocking chair telling your life story to your great grandchildren it might not come up, but it is something you will tell your friends and coworkers about - but only if you do it right.

Dick's offers some standard breakfast dishes like eggs, pancakes and french toast. But you can get those dishes at just about any place that's open at 7am.  You really want to give their New Mexican dishes a try.  A personal favorite is the carne adovada and eggs but I don't think you can wrong with any of the dishes. Go on, be adventurous.

Bear in mind, this isn't a big restaurant and seating is limited - it's worth the wait.
