I have been to Paz Cantina before a few times and always received great service, and it is a wonderful neighborhood bar/restaurant with an unbelievable selection of local artwork both inside and out. It's the type of place that makes you want to bring your friends from out of town along to show them how awesome downtown Phoenix can be. However, last night's boxing match is what finally prompted me to write a review for Paz. Our group had waited fairly late on Saturday afternoon to pick a location to watch the fight...even though on the website it looked like Paz was sold out of reserved tables, they were able to work something out for us when my brother went up there in person to ask about availability. There was a brief mix up as far as which table was ours, but a manager (maybe the owner?) ran up to help us out and to make sure that we were well taken care of. Even though the place was packed with people and buzzing with activity, you would never have guessed they were busy based on the level of service we received from our server - she stopped in to ask is how we were doing every time she walked by, she kept the drinks and buckets of Tecate coming, our food orders came out quickly, she got our tab closed out within minutes after the fight finished, and she did it all with a smile. The whole waitstaff was fantastic too, checking in on us to make sure that we were in good shape. As for the food, we had chips and 2 salsas which were both tasty, and we ordered bean/cheese/avocado burritos and the special Pac-Man tocilog burritos made for fight night, all of which were fantastic. Thanks for putting on a great fight night, Paz - we'll see you again next time! :)
