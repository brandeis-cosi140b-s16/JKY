This little hole in the wall is well worth finding. The quality is amazing. My favorite is the Enchilladas Suizas. Great flavor in the verde sauce, perfect shredded chicken. I have also had the chile relleno and green chile burrito. My husband loves the mini street tacos al pastor ($4.99!). I have to take home half of my enchillada dinner. Never disappointed - except they don't serve margueritas!
