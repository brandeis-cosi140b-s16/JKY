Yet again, Yelp delivers. Hungry and on the hunt for something local, we came across Tacos El Gordo on Yelp. In an unassuming shopping center off the Las Vegas Strip we found this little gem.....thank you Yelp.

Walking in, the place can be somewhat overwhelming. There's like 200 things on the menu (ok, I'm exaggerating a little) and you can line up in like 10 different lines. Depending on what kind of meat you want - you go to that line. They cook the meat fresh - in your face. Right on the grill - a few feet away. Sure, this means you will smell like smoke for the rest of the day, but with casinos in Vegas being smoking and all, I rather smell like carne asada than cigarettes.

I got: 

Sope de asada - Whoa! This thing was pretty massive. It was a fried dough (?) with a ton of toppings like salsa, guac, onions, cilantro and of course carne asada - with a crispy chip on top.

Tacos asada - Two tacos with carne asada. Awesome! 

The wife got some quesadillas - they were a little small, but the cheese was so good! I think it was a white cheese for frying. Pretty tasty.

We washed it all down with some Horchata! They have two machines for fountain drinks - one for regular soft drinks and the other one for traditional Mexican drinks! Pretty cool - I would of liked to try some of the other drinks, but was pretty stuffed.


The staff was all surprisingly nice. With as busy as everyone seemed they didn't hesitate to answer our questions (the folks cooking all the meat). The cashier was a bit of a character (hey, it's Vegas!) but SUPER nice as well.
