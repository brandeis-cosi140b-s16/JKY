In a word - outstanding.  I spent almost my whole life in CA and have tried hundreds of Mexican/Southwest restaurants and is this is one of the 2-3 best, on par with Frontera Grill in Chicago.  Stellar, creative food; very attentive but not intrusive service (nice job Sean!); outstanding ambiance.  A little off the beaten track, which makes it pretty easy to get in and out of.  We ate the sea bass (excellent but not extraordinary), the shrimp tamales (by far the best tamales I've ever had), a stunning risotto side dish, and breathtaking apple crepe desert. We'll be back for sure.  Aplausos!
