We order Rubios about twice a week here at the office.  I often get it catered in for guests we have or company meetings.  The online catering option is extremely convenient as well!  The people working at this store (John the cashier, John the manager, and Liza...not sure how to spell her name) are always so friendly and helpful.  The food is always great too!
