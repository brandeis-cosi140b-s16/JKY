Open late, near my humble abode, on the way back from the airport...perfect!  I work closer to the original location but was thrilled to have Taco y Taco join the hood.  It was very fancy inside but had everything we could want after traveling from Islip to Baltimore to Raleigh to Vegas with snow, delays, wind, and no food.  Open late every night (til 11 Sundays), this was the perfect place for Eric R.'s taco craving and my desire to eat lengua!

There was a lady dressed in sequins helping me understand how to navigate the new layout, and she was very nice!  I asked her a few questions about menu items since I typically just get tacos.  I ended up getting one lengua taco and one vampiro - 2 tostadas with melted cheese stuffed with lengua, onion, cilantro, and salsa...sooooo goooood.  We also got a side of guac to share.  Eric R. got the barbacoa burrito, but he thinks he got carne asada instead.  The salsa bar was fully stocked and we munched our way into oblivion...okay I mean happiness.

Overall, for affordable late night eats, this is a great option!
