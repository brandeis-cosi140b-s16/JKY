Some of the best street tacos around - originally from the West Coast, these are some of the most legit tacos around. Grilled right outside rain or shine and there's always a line (sometimes longer than others) so you know it's well loved! The salsa bar is also official, just watch out for the orange habanero salsa, yikes!
