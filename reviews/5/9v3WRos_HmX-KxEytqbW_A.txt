I can honestly say I am so glad we will be moving to AZ. in a few month cause we fell in love with this place and can't wait to go back.  We asked locals were to go and everyone we asked, told us Frank & Lupe's.   I can over look at lot if the food is great, and the food is just that!  I expect "Mexican food" to be what you find at your buddies grandma's house, that's what makes it soooo good.  Hands down some of the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.
