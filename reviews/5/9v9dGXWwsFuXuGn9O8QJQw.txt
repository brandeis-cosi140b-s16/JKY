Recently dined here and absolutely LOVED it! The waitress was extremely nice and got our order perfect. We had a big group and had several appitizers and food. Pricing was great for as much as we got! Walked away Fat, Dumb and Happy. The owner was really nice and made sure to walk around to each table to make sure everyone was happy. We will make several trips back! Thanks Manny's!!
