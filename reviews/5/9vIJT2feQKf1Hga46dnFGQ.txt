Wow. I went to Mas Amigos for the first time yesterday and I could not have been more impressed. 
The service was quick. Our waiter was polite. Our food was excellent!
The chips and salsa are great. Actually, the salsa isn't overly amazing itself, but it is tasty. The chips are where it's at! They're warm, flaky, and probably the best that I've had in town. You can tell they're fresh and not poured out of a bag.
What I was impressed with was the quality of my lunch. I got the burrito. It's more authentic than anything I've ever received at Dos or El Torro (which I enjoy). It wasn't greasy at all. 
This will be my new go-to restaurant when I want Mexican!
