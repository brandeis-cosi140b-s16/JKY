Can you say handmade corn tortillas?! This place is so authentic-I felt like I was in Mexico and judging from the eat-in crowd as well as the constant carry-out, a lot of folks agreed. 

The portions are huge! I saw some soup bowls coming out of the kitchen that made me sad I didn't order sopa  I had the shrimp tacos and they were delish and my husband ordered a fish dish off the Honduras section of the menu the was perfectly cooked. 

FYI-we were at the South Blvd. location and it is a stand alone building with an adequate parking lot, but it is so crowded creative parking prevails. The service is a little slow but worth the wait.
