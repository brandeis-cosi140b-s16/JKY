The first time I came here, I thought the food would be Roberto's-esque, then I took a bite. Needless to say I am here at least once a week. It is four star food quality but I gave it five based on the type of shop it is. An authentic hole in the wall find. They cook all the food fresh and the pollo isn't the shredded watery type at most places, it is real chunks grilled up in the AM. The service is fantastic and friendly. Only down side is they don't open until 9AM now, so no more $3 breakfast burritos for me. Oh the prices are the same as a the other small taco shops, but the quality is more like a good sit down restaurant. Check them out!
