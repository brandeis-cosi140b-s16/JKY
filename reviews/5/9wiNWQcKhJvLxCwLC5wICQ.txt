This place is the bomb. Allot of restaurants these days focus on just presentation and service and loose sight of having amazing food. Not here! The food is too good!!! I am now a regular. I typically order the Brûlée burger because nothing compares but I have also had the shrimp tacos and steak tacos.  My girlfriend is vegetarian and she loves the veggie sandwich! Everything is so flavorful! the sweet potato tots and fries are delicious and always so fresh. If you are a lover of sweets like myself, do yourself a favor and try the french toast fries! you're welcome ;)
