I've never been disappointed here and it's always a fun place to hang out. The food(tacos) are awesome. My favorite is the street style chicken tacos. The breakfast burrito is also awesome and BIG.   $2.50 coronas until 7 are the right price too. When the weather is a tad cooler it's fantastic to sit at the bar and soak up the sun.  The bar tenders are always on top of the drinks and even give a little entertainment. Granted I have been there primarily before 5-6pm.  Oh and the giant games they have are hilarious to play with after a few shots ;)
