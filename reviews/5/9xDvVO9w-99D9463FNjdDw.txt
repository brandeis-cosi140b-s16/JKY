Just ate at this place for the first time and to say that it was awesome and I will be coming back would be an understatement! I loved it the tacos were original and with really fresh ingredients. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable I only wish I had gotten his name to ask for him next time. I will certainly be back sooner than later and am looking forward to trying new tacos and taking advantage of the great daily specials:)
