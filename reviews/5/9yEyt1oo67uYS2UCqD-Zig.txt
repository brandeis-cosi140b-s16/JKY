I have eaten here for years and have never had a bad meal.  In my opinion, they have the best red and green sauce around.  I usually stick with the tacos, nana's favorite, the chili, and the beef and cheese burrito.  yes, it is basic sonoran fare but it is better than most mexican joints i have been to in the valley.
