Very much enjoyed my birthday dinner last night at Secreto in Ahwatukee, my favorite NM restaurant in AZ. Six of us had outstanding meals... we ate too much and everyone was happy with the food. Our server was great and very attentive... the Carne Adovada is the BEST. 

It's my sixth time there and have always been totally pleased with the food. By the way... even if you don't like flan -- Secreto's is heavenly!

Can you tell I love the place! ;)
