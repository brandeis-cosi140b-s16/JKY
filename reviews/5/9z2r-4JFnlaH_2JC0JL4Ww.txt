The girls and I really like to go here after work (which happens to be 3pm or so), which means there is always happy hour and there aren't huge crowds. Ive been here on a Sunday, and it's crazy. This is why I love going after work...

Mondays are also a great drink special day, $4 margaritas, but make sure not to go too crazy, or you'll end up taking a cab home...which we have also done... but we always have fun!
