Great prices. My daughter and I ate there for $12 and walked out stuffed. It's definitely not authentic Mexican but it is still good. I got the green chili chimichanga and a beef taco. Both were fantastic for the money. The only knock on the place I have is that it was 90* in the dining room so I just took my food to go.
