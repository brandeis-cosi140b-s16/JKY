A few days ago was my first time at El Pollo Loco. I wanted to check it out since my friend had recommended the food. And it was delish!! 

I went through the drive through on a weekday evening around 10:50pm (10 mins before they close). I'm always nervous about going to places that are about to close since I expect the people to be in a hurry to get me out of there, but even through the drive though, the person was super helpful! He gave advice on what people generally like since I hadn't been there before. He let me get a bottle of water instead of a fountain drink without throwing a fit or overcharging me. And, since they were about to close, he gave me lots of extra corn cake, which I have to say is pretty much the most delicious thing ever. I am obviously now a huge fan. I got the mango something salad (awesome). My husband got the chicken avocado burrito (even more awesome). No more Taco Bell for me! They've even given Chipotle a run for their money, and I'm typically a huge Chipotle fan.
