If you don't get the horchata then you are making the biggest mistake of your life.... 

There are something's in life where you overlook the bad because the good outweighs it. Not gonna lie, the location and atmosphere is maybe a 3/5. But Dan says good tacos are always in the most ghetto areas so we had high hopes. The place was full when we arrived and filled with an assortment of people. It was promising. 

This place did not disappoint. I had the sorano arrachero taco plate (or whatever... Something like that) and Dan got the carne asada street tacos. Right when I bit into it I knew..... This was going to be a good meal. Dan is a taco snob and gave the street tacos 10 stars. Very rare. 

My tacos made me forget that our table was wobbly and that it was hard to find this place at night.

Just go and eat the tacos.... Just do it.
