I think this is definitely the place to go for late night mexican food in the area.  The service is super quick and prices are low.  Burritos are big but I usually prefer to go with nachos.  They definitely don't skimp on the meat  and cheese so the nachos is really a meal for 2.  

While the more traditional "carne asada" is good, I really suggest you try the lesser known "al pastor".  Its a very flavorful but mild spicy pork which goes good on any menu item.
