If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  Love the service, food, and drinks.  My husband and I love to come here during the week after work for the specials.  I absolutely love this place. It is not the taco bell craps. Simply delicious and worth every penny. We never spend more than $25 During the week and my husband is a big guy. Try it you will love it!!!
