When the cashier said we'd be addicted after our first visit, she wasn't kidding! We shared the taco combination plate and the steak nachos. I can only say - Delish!!! The steak for the nachos was smoky and char-grilled with flavor sitting aboard the crunchy chips, salty beans, excellent pico de gallo, and some incredible guacamole. The combo tacos were quite good as well. We tried two pork varieties and one steak and we were not disappointed. These street tacos on corn tortillas are just up my alley. I didn't try the rice - that's up to you. Service was quite good and prompt at high noon on a Wednesday. The tables were clean and so was the restroom, which is a major plus. Let's keep them in business!!
