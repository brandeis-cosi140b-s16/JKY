Consistently delicious and crazy cheap. Amazing tortillas, chorizo burritos, tacos, machaca and tostados. Don't be deterred by the shabby exterior. Be cautious in evenings though...I was once accosted by a smelly derelict demanding money on the way in who was laying across my car when I left... I was pleasantly surprised when I went back into the establishment and two kitchen employees promptly jumped the counter and scared him off. Still doesn't stop me from coming back! It's worth it...
