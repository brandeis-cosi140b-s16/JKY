This place is very busy at lunch!

The place is clean and there are plenty of places to sit inside.  When tables empty out, I actually notice the employees are there moments later to clean up.  They also offer to take your trays and baskets.

I usually get the Vegetarian burrito: rice, black beans, fajitas (bell peppers and onions), pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, lettuce and corn.  My burrito comes bursting at the seams with this combination.  

I've even had the person that wraps the burrito plead for help from her co-workers for another piece of foil.

Another plus is that they serve minute maid lemonade!

The employees at this area are very nice and professional and I enjoy their cheery disposition and enthusiasm.
