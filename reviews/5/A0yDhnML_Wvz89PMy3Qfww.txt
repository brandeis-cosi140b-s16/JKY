I found a new fave today. The reviews were pretty right on. The food ROCKS! Got the Steak Picado Chimi and man it was the best I have ever had. The wait staff I am split on. I am not sure if it was because I ordered take out but the waitress that took my order seemed less than thrilled to be there and made no attempt at customer service. The second waitress that approached me asked me if I would like a glass of water while I waited and was very pleasent. In retrospect I should have gave her the tip lol
