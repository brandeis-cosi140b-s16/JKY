Autumn was a outstanding server, I am a server myself so my espectations for good service was far beyond met. I disliked the location, however it was a family friendly place and my seven year enjoyed it. I had the veggie tacos and they were great, but the veggies were a little undercooked to my personal liking. The kids menu options were only $6 which was awesome pricing. Autumn informed us on the amazing vegetarian options for us and how they use non GMO ingredients. I also loved her presentation on the table side guacamole. It was the best guacamole I have tried and went home and made it myself extactly how she made it. Overall my experience was pleasent and we will be back to eat again. Request Autumn to be your server, you won't be disappointed!!!
