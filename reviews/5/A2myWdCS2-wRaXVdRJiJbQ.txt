Blanco is delicious! My family and I came here the first time after my sisters bridal gown shopping! We all ordered different margaritas and a bunch of tacos, quesadillas and appetizers to share. Everything was good and I am fairly picky! The blood orange margarita is TO DIE FOR! 

Go indulge in some tacos and margaritas here!
