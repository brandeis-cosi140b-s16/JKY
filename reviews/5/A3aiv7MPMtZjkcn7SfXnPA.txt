Inside the MGM at the food court. I didn't notice it walking in from certain side of the food court since it was angled off. But passing by a second time from the pool, I knew I had to have a bit here. Huge fan of tacos! And this place was super! I was very surprised given that it was food court food. But a surprising delight to have in my hotel. This was at least one meal a day for me out of the four days we stayed. I just kept coming back for more!

Everything was made to order. I always got the three taco plate which came with three tacos in house made tortillas, filled with your choice of meat (each taco can have a different meat as well for variety). You had your choice of filling as well, from cheese to lettuce, salsa, etc. I always got the steak as one, and other times chose from the other meats every time just to see what they tasted like. All were very good, especially the sweet pulled pork. They also have burritos as well. 

Highly recommended! As I'm writing this review, I am craving more of their tacos now! So please get tacos and eat some for me since I'm back home in Colorado!
