I love this place!! I have been going here for years and years and just haven't gotten around to post a review.  The fideo soup, the homemade chips and salsa, the steak, the burritos, tacos... Anything I have ever had is DELISH.  Very nice bar area as well as dine in area for kids.  Sometimes there is a live mariachi man playing as well.  Great place to go for big family dinners, or on a date :-) Love it ask for the chips and salsa at the table and they are free!
