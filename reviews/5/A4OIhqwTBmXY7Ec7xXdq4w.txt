We love trying small restaurants in our neighborhood.   We like that there are plenty to choose from however, this place, The Blind Pig, is a terrific find and we will make it one of our regular places.   We started off with delicious drinks, had an avocado bruschetta, my husband had the short rib tacos and I had a shrimp and corn tamale.  Every thing was served hot, fast, fresh and absolutely delicious!  We were too full to try the desert so I cannot comment about that.  In addition to the wonderful food and friendly service, the prices were so inexpensive I thought we had the lunch menu!  Great find!
