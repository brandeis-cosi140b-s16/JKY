I will be giving this place 5 stars for the food and the service as everything within the restaurant's control was perfect.  The food was perfect - portions were plentiful and very tasty .  They had that Coke machine where you customize your drink which I also thought was neat.  

The problem was that a basketball team with young kids was in there having a party of some sorts.  The restaurant's walls didn't help suppress the noise and it was very loud in there.  But this group got to be more and more out of control, that had I been the manager, I would've told them to cut it out.  McDonald's is down the road.  I can safely assume that the manager would've gotten in trouble by his higher-ups had he done such a thing.  

I love Moe's and will come back, but I wish places would have a policy on controlling groups of kids.  Plus McDonald's is right up the road.
