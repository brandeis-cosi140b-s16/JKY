Ho, Braddah's is ono! My roommate told me about this place, and the reviews are accurate - like a Chipotle with island flavor! My g/f and I both got meat  samples and decided on bowls, which were a great deal for the price. We were both stuffed for $7/each!

We lucked out and went in on their anniversary, so they were giving free coconut bark!! Score!! I'll definitely be back (even though I live on the other side of town), and I even bought a recent Yelp deal for this place. Mahalos, Braddah's 'ohana!
