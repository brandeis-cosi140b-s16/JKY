I loved this place from the moment i stepped in. The ambiance is enhanced by the vibe - very positive. The people who work here enjoy their jobs, and it shows. 

The food is quite honestly the best mexican ive had in vegas. Period. The menu was varied and pretty extensive, including traditional fare as well as seafood and more exotic dishes. I had the pollo con crema, which i havent even seen offered anywhere else, and it was sooooo good! Only $15! Hubby had the chilis relleno and chicken enchilladas. He agreed it was also the best mexican food hes had in vegas, and hes lived here for fifteen years! The prices were reasonable and i really liked the kids menu which included cheeseburgers & chicken strips, so imperative when dining with picky kids! I really enjoyed our table-made guacamole as well. Some of the best Ive ever had. It included fresh cilantro. Mmm!

The service was excellent, we never had empty drinks or dirty plates. A note on the hostesses too: they were polite and genuinely warm. This is something i often find lacking in vegas in even the finest restaurants. The Mariachi duo went from table to table and were also very personable. 

In general the whole vibe here was very positive. So kudos to you, viva Michoacan! We will be back AND we'll bring friends!
