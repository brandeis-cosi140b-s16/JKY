After stumbling upon their stand inside the Public Market and being told that they have a full restaurant on East Carson, I made it a point to check it out as soon as I was able.

This is one of the great Mexican spots in town, easily. My go-to when trying a new place is always enchiladas and theirs are excellent. I also enjoyed their lengua entree.

It's just a little bit more expensive than, say, an Emiliano's, but you're not likely to regret your visit here.
