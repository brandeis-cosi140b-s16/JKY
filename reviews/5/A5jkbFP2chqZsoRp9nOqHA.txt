This place is a hop, skip, and a jump from my house. It looks a place you might not want to go at night, but it's totally cool and safe. Recently somebody graffiti'd on it "Be Free" so there is definitely a hooligan or two roaming about, but it's a positive set of hooligans. Henderson's answer to Banksy, I tell ya.

Anyway, this place far surpasses any Roberto's, ever. Cheese enchiladas to go, plz. The enchilada sauce is super flavorful, if lacking in the spice department. I cover it in the salsas that they give you, but also the guac. The guac is more of a sauce than a dip, but it's really, really good. 

Also, the roll-up tacos. Delicious. And Dr Pepper? Don't tell anybody, but I indulge in the occasional alcoholic beverage, and Dr Pepper and Mexican food are my hangover cures. Santarosa does the trick every time. 

If you're on your way to Lake Mead or Lake Las Vegas, it's worth the stop!
