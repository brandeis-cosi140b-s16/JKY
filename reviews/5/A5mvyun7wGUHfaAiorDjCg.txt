I work walking distance to this shopping center and every day I eat out for lunch.  
What to choose, what to choose?  Taco Bell, Arbys, McDonalds, Subway, Chick-fil-a, or Rubios?  This is like a laundry list of what Mesa is based on.  

So every day I choose another mediocre place to dine... but once a week I treat myself to Rubio's Cali-Mex Restaurant.  It's just delightful!  It's hard to steer clear from the Beer-Battered Fish Burrito.  If I can make it there on Tuesdays after 2:30, I partake in Taco Tuesday where it's just $1.25.... Those 4 tacos are the best $5 spent in town.

Thanks Rubio's, see you next week!
