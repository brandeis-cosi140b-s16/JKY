I go here a lot and of course not every single time is a home run but 5 stars for how consistent they are. EXCEPT on Sunday but that get's a pass in my book. 

There was one time where I had to drive back because the guac and pico made my burro very cold and I expected the Shitty to come back my way but they were cool as hell!!! they apologized and explained what the issue was and hooked it up fresh.

Because this is a filibertos and only considering filibertos compared to other fast food mexican or other filibertos I've been too, 5 stars.
