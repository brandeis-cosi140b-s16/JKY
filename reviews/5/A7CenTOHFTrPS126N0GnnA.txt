Best mexican food in LV. Being from Los Angeles I love mexican food and this is an excellent choice. The shrimp ceviche is very good super crispy tostada and fresh ingredients. I'm here weekly and I live in summerlin. The owner is very courteous and attentive if dining in. The value is definitely there.
