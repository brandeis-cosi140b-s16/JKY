Love this place!  My husband and I had a gift card for a food fight restaurant and came here for the first time.  Place was packed but amazingly we got a table in like twenty min.  From the atmosphere to the music it's a great place.  The food and drinks were great.  Even our waiter Matt rocked!  Truly is my favorite new place and we will be back.
