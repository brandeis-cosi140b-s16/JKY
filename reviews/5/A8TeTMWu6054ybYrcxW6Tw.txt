Of all of the Fili-b's I've been to in town, this is the best one! My favorite plate is the Super Nachos, every other Filiberto's is very stingy when it comes to this plate, but this one is very generous with their portions. This is the only Fili-b's I would recommend. Very nice. Very clean. Great salsa bar WITH CHIPS!
