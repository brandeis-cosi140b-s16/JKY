One word WONDERFUL! Friday happy hour in the bar is amazing(1/2 off appetizers and 3 buck drinks!!! Can't beat it!!!!) Fridays can get pretty busy in the bar there BUT the friendly staff is always willing to help even when they are super busy! Plus, During football season they have their amazing happy hour prices from open to close!!! I can't wait to go back to this place!!! :)
