Don't let the location (next to shopping center) deter you. This place has a great atmosphere from the music to the bar. Very chill and the skeleton sitting at the end of the bar adds an edge. 

The chips and salsa were top notch - chips thin and crisp; lightly salted. Guacamole with pomegranates on top and it works well! Next the tacos. Mahi and smoked brisket was top notch the smoke on the brisket requires you to keep eating until it's gone! The seasoning on the mahi was perfect.  

Would definitely stop by again when in Phoenix close to biltmore hotel.
