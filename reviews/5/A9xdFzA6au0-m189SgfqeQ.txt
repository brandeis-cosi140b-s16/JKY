I eat here about once or twice a week for dinner. Never once had a bad burrito or burrito bowl from this location. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. 

The only let down is that the staff can sometimes be very inconsistent with their portions of the rice and meat. I will sometimes walk away with a stuffed burrito or one that is a little lacking in the ingredients.
