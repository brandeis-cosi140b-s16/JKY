Irma's is an AMAZING find in Phoenix! Delicious food, friendly owner and staff, and their PRICES ARE OUTRAGEOUSLY LOW!!!!
I was told to try the "Mean Green" aguA naturales, it was BEYOND DELICIOUS! Next time I'm passing through Phoenix I will be back for another meal. $28.00 (including tip) for 5 people to eat! That's amazing!!!! 
Just a note that it's small and there is no air conditioning.... But so worth it!
