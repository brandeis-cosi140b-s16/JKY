Korean Mexican fusion? The uniqueness of the combination and the reviews had me convinced I had to try it and glad I did. The portions were generous and flavoring was bold and unique.

My bf and I had:
1) Bulgogi Fusion Burrito
2) Bulgogi fries
3) 2 meat combo plate (spicy pork and bulgogi)

The fusion burrito was scrumptious and very flavorful as was the meats on the combo plate. The fries were a little sweet (b/c the flavoring of the bulgogi meat) so it wasn't exactly my cup of tea, but the other two dishes alone were enough to give this place 5 stars!! If I lived in Vegas, I'd totally come back and try everything on their menu!!
