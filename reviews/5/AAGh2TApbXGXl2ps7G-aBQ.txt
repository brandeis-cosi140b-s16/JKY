Non chain real Mexican food in Sun City? Wait, what? 
Is this fancy pants? No.
Is this blow your mind creativity/complex flavors? No.
Is this a place that puts decor/ambiance above the customer service and food? No

What this place does have is:
Good quality home made food.
An owner who not only cares about his customers but works with what they are in the mood for.
Has daily specials.
Has a fast turn around.
Has a salsa bar.

Is a family run, family feel good food in a crappy location. Prices are more than reasonable. Know that your busy time will be lunch hour and then the 4:30-6:00pm Sun City dinner dining timeframe. 

Say hi to Jose'. He's the real deal.
