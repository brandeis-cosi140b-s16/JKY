family friendly, divey little place.  a.m. radio and bullfighter paintings complete with red booths and formica tables.  very old school atmosphere.  this place is clean, cheery, and has friendly charming service and staff who remember your regular order, and sometimes your name.  the food is classic old school sonoran style with gorgeous and flavorful sauces and cheese.  the hot sauce is to die for...served in a thumb- triggered, red handled syrup bottle, just like hot sauce should be.  if you are looking for a sexy date night, this isnt it.  but if you want some good old fashioned mexican comfort food with a friendly smile at a good price, this place is it. love it.  i get takeout from here every week and i marvel at how Fast they are!
