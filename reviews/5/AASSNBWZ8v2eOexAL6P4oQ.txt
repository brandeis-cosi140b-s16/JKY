Bitzee Mama's isn't a restaurant its a Historical Restaurant.  LOL

Its been there for as long as I been in AZ  1987.. Its one of those places you go for good food relaxing ambiance and hang with good people.

 You cant go to Downtown Glendale with out popping in for a Beer Ice Tea or Some Food relax and explore down town some more.

GREAT PARKING behind Bitzees TOO!

Pop in and Tell em you want the Michael LeShane Discount!   LOL

Im not sure if its a discount or surcharge!
