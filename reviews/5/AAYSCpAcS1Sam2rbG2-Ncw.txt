This is a nice location to eat in at.  It's clean, it's shockingly delicious for fast mexican food. During the afternoon it gets busy because school gets out. Anything after 4pm it's quiet & clean! 

I always get the Beefy 5 layer no sour cream (1.79) with a small beverage (1.49). Not a bad price for cheap eats, I think it's filling.

This location does offer a senior discount when purchasing a senior drink.
