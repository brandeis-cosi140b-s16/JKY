The dudes from Three Amigos have once again stepped up their game and brought some killer food to the QC. This time, the focus is on traditional Mexican street eats and the fare is on the rise to becoming a more-than-regular spot for us. 

Came in on a Saturday before noon. The space is still being outfitted and decorated, so it has a bit of a feel leftover from the previous biz. I couldn't care less. The magic happens behind the counter and in the kitchen. 

The high notes:

Pupusas -- If you've never tried a pupusa, you're missing out. Thick, fried dough, veggies, cheese, and pressed flat. Incredible. It may look small, but don't be fooled. It's filling. 

Arepas. Filled with shredded chicken and some of the tastiest veggies I've had in a long time. The chicken had a flavor that was mild, yet pungent. The juices that came from the chicken, which I'm assuming was made in a pressure cooker, permeated the bread and almost made into two separate items. It didn't last long on my plate. 

Empanada. The crispy dough filled with even more cheese and veggies was equally amazing. Textbook execution. 

Tacos Autenticas. Perfect. Chicken, white onion, cliantro. That's all, that's all you need. Perfection. 

Guac. What else do you need to know? It's GUAC. I'd eat it every day of my life. The chips are seasoned, too, which is a nice touch. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Sabor. I'm excited to see how it builds out and becomes more of an Elizabeth staple. I'll be back soon. Next time: Burrito.
