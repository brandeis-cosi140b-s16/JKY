I loved the food here. A group of friends and I came here for dinner. I had chicken, that was perfectly seasoned it was wonderful to eat a piece of meat that didn't need additional seasoning or sauce. That is so rare these days. I didn't have a chance to eat any Mexican food but their case looked good. I am definitely going back.
