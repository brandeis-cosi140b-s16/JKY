The place seems small but once we sat down it was very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and it smells great

We had a spill of water and the staff was very helpful with cleaning it up. They offered us some free drinks which more then made up for it. 

The food was outstanding! Some of the best tacos we have ever had. I highly recommend the steak tacos, they were my favorite. 

Overall it was a good experience and we wi certainly be coming back!
