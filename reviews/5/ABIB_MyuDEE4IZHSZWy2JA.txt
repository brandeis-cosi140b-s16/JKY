Had the pleasure of enjoying a late lunch here with my husband while on a business trip. It was hands-down one of the best meals I've had anywhere, Mexican or otherwise. The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, and the food was just plain amazing. We started with the traditional chips and salsa, which at Border Grill, is actually a sampler of three varieties of salsa.  All were fresh and delicious, but my favorite was to green tomatillo salsa.  It was bright and tangy with a great spicy kick. I order the brisket taquitos and my husband had the Yucutan pork. My taquitos were perfect-crispy without being greasy, full of delicious, flavorful beef and topped with just the right quantity of shredded lettuce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  The presentation was colorful and beautiful arranged with black beans flanked by petite portions of fabulous arroz verde and red spanish rice.

My husband's choice of the Yucatan pork, which he chose based on the server's recommendation, was also beautiful and delicious (of course I tried a bite!). The pork was tender, moist with a fascinating, complicated flavor that included orange and cinnamon. Served with plantains, rice and fresh corn tortillas, it was a meal to be remembered.

If I ever find myself in Las Vegas again I will definitely plan to visit Border Grill again!
