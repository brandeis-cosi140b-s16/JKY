Will definitely be coming back! 
I had the roasted tomatillo chicken enchiladas w/red sauce & my husband had the pork w/green sauce - we both added an over-easy egg on top of all our fixings - NO complaints here! So fresh! We even tried their cocktails, mimosa & grapefruit margarita - fresh, crisp & amazing!
