First timer & I must say what a find! When we got there the waitress was nice & even took the time to "tour" the menu with us. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, one pork & one shrimp. They were amazing. I also had a tres leches for dessert. It was more like a shortbread style. But still good. All in all can't wait to come back!! Oh yea try the guacamole, great way to start your meal off right.
