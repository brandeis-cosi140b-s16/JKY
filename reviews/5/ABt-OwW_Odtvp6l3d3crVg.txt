Absolutely delicious, my new go place to when I'm in town. I tried four tacos and they were all really good. I didn't expect the zucchini taco to be my favorite, but it was so good and I'm happy I tried it. The blackened tilapia was seasoned well and my second favorite. The fried tilapia and shrimp were both good.
