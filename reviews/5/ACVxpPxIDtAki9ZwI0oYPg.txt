My boyfriend and I went here for my birthday on 10-22-11.  Allison, our server, was amazing and she was very friendly.  I had two Red Sangria's and Travis had three Margaritas.  The food was great and the best part was the Fried Ice Cream with a candle.  We will be back for sure!

Thank you for a great experience!
