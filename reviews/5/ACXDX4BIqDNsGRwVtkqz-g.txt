Reliably good Mexican food!  I'm a vegetarian and their options are tasty and plentiful.  I love that they started making vegetarian tamales, since I would beg for a meat-free tid-bit of my husband's every time we went!  Standard restaurant decor, and sometimes the heating/cooling in the dining area seems a bit shaky.  Good service and tasty food, a definitely upgrade from Pie-ful Delight (the old inhabitant of this space).
