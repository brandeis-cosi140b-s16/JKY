Amazing service!!!! Thank you to our waiter Brent and the food and beverage manager for keeping everything in order. Came on a Friday mid September which was much better than expected at most other places. Our server was beyond helpful especially considering the amount of tables he waited! I definitely recommend this place to anyone coming from out of town, locals, and everyone in between. Perfect sit down with a nice atmosphere to match. Can't forget how great the food was, enchiladas and tamales were cooked to perfection. Don't forget the salsa bar!!!!! (-:
