This is definitely one of my favorite taco spots out here in Vegas! The chicken, the carne asada, and machaca (shredded beef) are so extremely flavorful!!! Their tacos are pretty big and they pack on the meat! The burritos are huge and the price is awesome!!! The guacamole is to die for!!!! The service is excellent! And you get a free meal of up to $10 on your bday!!! Just show an ID!
