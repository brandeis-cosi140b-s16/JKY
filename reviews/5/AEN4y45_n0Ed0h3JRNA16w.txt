We just moved to Las Vegas and went to this restaurant based upon reviews from some of our neighbors. We LOVED IT. Our other favorite mexican restaurant is Super Mex, but this restaurant will become one of our favorites, for sure. Starting with the soup, chips, salsa and beans-what a great idea. We will be back many times in the future. Try this place and you will not be sorry.
