I recently came to this drive through super late because nothing else was open. Honestly my expectations were low, and I was pleasantly surprised! The wait wasn't long at all given that it looked like only one person was working. The nachos I ordered were great. The size was plentiful, the balance of amount of chips vs toppings was right on, not too much of one or another. The cheese was a huge surprise. It almost looked and tasted freshly ground, it had great body and really held up this plate of nachos. Next time I need a late night snack, I may just swing by this place again!
