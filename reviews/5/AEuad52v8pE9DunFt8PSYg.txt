FIRST!  Hot damn this place is GREAT!!  This place defines the term "hole in the wall Mexican".  It's across the street from a thrift store, and literally sits on the street in front of a trailer park.  Their breakfast is amazing and out of this world!  For $4-$6 you can get a DELICIOUS Mexican breakfast.  The service is friendly, food is the bomb, and price is cheap.  You will not be disappointed with this place, unless yore a total retard douche.
