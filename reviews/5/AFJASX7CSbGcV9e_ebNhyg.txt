Like a previous reviewer said, If you've lived in Vegas and had any kind of a social night life, you've probably called on Senor Roberto to bail you out of some late night hunger spots.  This is probably also the case if you've done anything in So. Cal past midnight.

This Taco shop is nothing like a Bay Area taqueria, I liken Roberto's/Alberto's/Jilbertos/Ralberto's to Mexican fast food.  Though it may not be the most authentic, it's usually greasy, unhealthy but devastatingly delicious.  Carne Asada burritos, chips and fries from So. Cal are the stuff of legend amongst my friends.

Prices here have gone up a bit compared to when I was last in So Cal, but the large portions, delicious Carne Asada and late night hours (24h) all remain.

The Carne Asada Burritos here, come with only carne asada, sour cream, guacamole, and pico, no rice or beans.  The carne asada fries, come in a Styrofoam container filled with fries, then guacamole, sour cream, pico, carne asada and cheese dumped on top.  Unreal, and unreal that I have yet to find a place in the Bay area that can do the same properly.

They have a green and red salsa (both good) along with some pickled carrots, radishes and jalapenos in their salsa bar.  And they also accept credit card.

If you are in Vegas looking for late night eats, seek out Roberto's, there are like 30 locations.
