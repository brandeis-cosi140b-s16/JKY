Thanks Philip! I randomly came across his review and decided to give it a try. The al pastor tacos were to die for, but we loved the carne asada as well. Philip's description is spot on. Honestly the best taco I've had in Vegas! Warning: The place is in a grocery store strip mall, no atmosphere to speak of, and the people working there are not fluent in English. Get over the surface details - these tacos are awesome!
