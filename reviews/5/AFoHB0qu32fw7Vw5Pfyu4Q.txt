This place is frigging AWESOME! The food is to DIE for. 

Be advised: this is a serious DIVE. The floor was filthy, the tables came from the thrift store, the music was deafening... I checked out the kitchen, though, and it was SPOTLESS!

Not a bit of the "dive" atmosphere mattered the moment I bit into my sope. The chicken was juicy, seasoned to perfection and delish. The tortillas of my enchilada were slightly sweet and buttery. And the refried beans and rice were LEGIT!!!

Hardly anyone speaks English (staff or patrons), and the menu only has cursory translations (but lots of pictures). It doesn't matter - everyone is ridiculously friendly and patient!

Know this: this is serious DOWN HOME, abuela's cocina,  shut up and tuck in, kind of food. Nothing fancy, just a super-authentic, meat-and-rice kind of joint. Definitely the best Mexican kitchen food I've had in YEARS, and definitely the most authentic I've had in Vegas.

You must eat here!!!
