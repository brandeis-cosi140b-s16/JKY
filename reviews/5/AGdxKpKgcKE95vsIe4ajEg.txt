Vegas and Henderson locals know of the secret and hidden charms of B.C. (Boulder City)  It's the tiny little town on the way to Lake Mead and Hoover Dam.

Right before you hit Boulder City proper there's a tiny strip mall that houses a phenomenal brunch joint called Two Gals From Cal.

Where to start.....their omelets are awesome....try the Olive Oil ( Mushrooms, Spinach, and Swiss Cheese.) or my favorite the Bullet Proof Taco, which is basically a huge taco salad stuffed in a fried flour tortilla shell.......FAN-FRIGGIN-TASTIC!!!

It's outta the way but worth it.  Make a day of it and visit B.C. there's lots to see, and I'll tell you all about it soon enough.
