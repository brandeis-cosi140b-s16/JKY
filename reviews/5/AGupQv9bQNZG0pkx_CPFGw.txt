We went in at 2:30am and asked the waitress for vegetarian options and she got the chef to talk to us, which was amazing. The chef asked about our preferences and restrictions and explained how they make all the dishes. It was the best Mexican food I've ever had, not greasy or heavy but very satisfying. The green enchiladas and veggie quesadilla are awesome!
