if you want a neighborhood place that is simple and delicious, Tacos El Burrito Loco is that place. LV natives know the difference between authentic and 'americanized' Mexican food. Every time I eat here I thank the good lord that our neighbors to the south have brought there awesome cuisine to our region. I like to get nachos with chile verde or pastor. The carne asada is muy bueno. The service is great if you yourself are friendly.  Brink your own beer if you like. If you don't have a sophisticated pallet or think Mexican food is only about tacos, there are other places. For those who live in Central Las Vegas, we know the best kept secret for Mexican food.Tacos El Burrito Loco
