I've eaten here twice and def will return.  We usually get a pitcher of martgarita on the rocks which hits the spot.  I would then recommend the fajitas, steak or shrimp, both are fantastic with tons of meat and peppers.  The service is good and the environment is cool.  Would recommend.  A little pricey though so make it a good occasion !
