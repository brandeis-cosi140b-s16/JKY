Went to El Rico's on a tip from a friend. They just opened last week in this location.  You go in,order,take a number and find a seat.  I got a chile verde burrito and my wife got the chile relleno.  They were both some of the best we have had for a while.  The flavors were rich and bold but not overpowering.  We both loved it and we will be returning soon.  Try it you will like it.....Vic & Pat
