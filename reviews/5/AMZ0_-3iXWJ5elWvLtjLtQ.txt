I liked this place a lot. I had fun eating outside on the patio. Red and green salsa taste great - but are not hot. I'm a wuss, so this worked out well - the flavors are great on both of them. They make both of them in house as well.

Really, get here. They need more business so they can grow into something even better than they are now!
