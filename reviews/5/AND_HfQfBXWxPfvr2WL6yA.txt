For all of the times I've been to Vegas and many times staying just down the street at the NY NY, I had never tried Diablo's until this past weekend. Looking back, I'm sad to say that I didn't try it sooner. I can't speak for the food across the board because I only tried the steak tacos, but they were phenomenal. Definitely the best steak tacos that I have ever eaten. The fact that I had them twice in a three day trip should say something given all of the choices Vegas has to offer. The prices did seem a little high, but for me personally, it was a vacation and the food was great so I'm not giving it a second thought.
