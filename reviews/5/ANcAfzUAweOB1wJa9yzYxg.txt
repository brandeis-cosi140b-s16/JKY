Still 5 stars! Just went there again and it is still delicious! We ordered bulgogi tacos on floor tortillas, the chicken Chow Fettuccine (1/2 order), and the bulgogi fries (1/2 order).  This was my first time getting the Chow Fettuccine, it was delicious!   We spent like $17.

The place was busy (it usually is).  We were lucky and got seated right away, but the wait for the food was pretty long.  We finished off the first basket of chips and salsa and guacamole. So they brought us a second basket, but I think they noticed with enjoy the guacamole, because they gave us to little cups of guacamole instead of just one. 

There was a couple next to us and the girl was there for the first time. It was very funny because she ordered fried rice, wings, some shrimp dish, and one other item I can't remember. Anyways each time they brought a dish she was shocked at the size.  She couldn't believe the portion sizes. Then when she was try the dish she was shocked again at how delicious they all were! I was very entertaining to watch her enjoy the experience for the first time.

Still great food, great staff, and good times! We posted pictures on our instagram and all our friends and family want to try it when they are in town.
