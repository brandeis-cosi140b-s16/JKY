I really needed to break out and try a new restaurant in Champaign.  We are here for football weekends and usually go to the same couple of spots.  I was down visiting my daughter and she chose a winner!

Escobar's has a very inventive menu with a fusion of many latin tastes with its own Ol√© added to the mixture.  We had the fried calamari for our app, something I would not expect in a Latin restaurant but it was delicious with one heck of a tasty sauce.  I had the Cuban sandwich for my main course and it was crunchy with all the distinct flavors you expect in a Cuban sandwich but with their own version of it.

My favorite two beverages in the world are freshly brewed iced tea and bottled Mexican coke and they had both.  Hard choices that are great either way are part of what makes this such a great place.

It's more expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant because it is so much more and quite frankly, aren't you worth it?
