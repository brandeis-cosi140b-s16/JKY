Fantastic food, beautiful refreshing atmosphere, great service, very reasonable prices! We visited Elvira's twice when we were in town we liked it so much. I've had Mexican food all over Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado ... and Elvira's is now one of my favorites. The most surprising thing is that it's in Apache Junction which has little good Mexican food to be found. We'll certainly be back!
