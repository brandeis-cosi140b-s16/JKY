First time at this Filiberto's. Have always had good food and decent service at the others. This one was no exception. 

Arrived around 7:30PM on a Sunday night and I noticed that the place was different than all the others. This place had seating for about 40-50, salsa bar, condiment bar and chips/sauce bar. Nice touch. 

My wife ordered the rolled taco plate with all the toppings on the side. I got the Adobado plate but with no beans (date night ya know). She enjoyed her tacos. Crispy tortillas, flavorful meat and fresh toppings. The rice was exceptional, compared to other Fili B's. 

My Adobado was unctuous. It was juicy and seemed to have some extra flavor that I couldn't describe. My wife took a bite and wasn't fond of it but she also couldn't describe the taste. 

I recommend this Filiberto's for its savory dishes, good atmosphere and efficient service.
