Great first impression. Sat at the bar with a friend. We came in just for margaritas (which were very well prepared) but then we decided to have a couple tacos. My friend had the fish taco and I went with the chicken taco.  Honestly, they were the best tacos I've ever eaten, by far.  Definitely coming back.
