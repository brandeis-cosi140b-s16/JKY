Since moving back from Vegas I miss this place.  Their burritos rival El Gallo in the south suburbs.  Best Mexican food anywhere in Vegas.  Burritos, tacos, tortas, enchiladas, you name it!  It's all good.  Always crowded but they move fast.  Get people in and out.  I love the carrots and jalape√±o pepper station!  The best!
