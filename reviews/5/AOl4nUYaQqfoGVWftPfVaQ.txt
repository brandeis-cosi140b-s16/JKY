Best taco's I've ever had visiting Vegas. If I could figure out a way to stuff my face with more taco's then my body could hold, I would. Every Time I fly to Vegas, this is my first stop. Carlos and Eli were amazing on this visit today. There was even a sweet little girl that let me try a few meats I've never tried before. Get here. Your tastebuds will thank you. I own a restaurant in Chicago and I tell my customers to come here when visiting. Thanks all
