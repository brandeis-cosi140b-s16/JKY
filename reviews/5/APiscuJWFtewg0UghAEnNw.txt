Carolina's is absolutely amazing! My rating is definitely based off the quality and authenticity of the food. Yeah the downtown location is not the most inviting atmosphere, but really that's part of its charm. There are people from all walks of life in there, sharing in a common love of authentic Mexican food. This may not be the best spot for a first date, but a great place to go over and over again. 

During peak hours it gets really busy (both lunch and dinner ). If you are in a hurry, call ahead to order.
