What a place! It was my first time at Aria and I simply loved it! We decided to eat at Javier's since the decor was so inviting. You have to see it to believe it. The food is super fresh and extremely tasty and the service is top notch. 

I wasn't feeling too hungry so I got the ceviche with octopus on recommendation from our server and it was probably the best I have ever eaten. The chips are fresh and the salsa is spicy!

The design detail of this place is outstanding. You have to go there to take a look even if you're not close by, it's well worth the cab ride. I hope to go back and have a full meal.
