Darn it, I had gotten fond of the assertive fuchsia color scheme on their walls, and they changed it! Oh well, yellow and salmon work well too. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pM1XQqVX-oudcm4nnvvQfA?select=6vDWy6fMQnMAClThF4ZmUQ

Had lunch here again and loved it, as usual. Fresh salsa, warm tortilla chips, beans, rice, burro, bit of salad. Fast service, tasty food, very inexpensive ... really gotta love this place!
