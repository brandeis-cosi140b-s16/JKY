I work right across the street from this place and it is one of the only places that I have not gotten sick of in the 3 years I have worked were I do.  Mind you they opened a little after I started work but the point is I could always eat at this place and enjoy the food. 

 I either order the blacken chicken burrito or the blacken chicken tacos.  They are always amazing, I would recommend these to people all the time.  Everyone I have gotten them for loves them.  The chorizo breakfast burritos are also really good.  

They use fresh ingredients and make amazing food.  The owner is there all the time and a great guy as well.  If you have never eaten here I highly recommend it.
