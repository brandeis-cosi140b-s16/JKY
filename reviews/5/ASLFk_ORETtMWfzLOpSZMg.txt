I love Mexican food, and this place is really good! The smell of the mesquite grill is delicious. I have been 3 times and try to stop by once a week to try something new, I have not been disappointed yet. The staff is very helpful in making suggestions on what to try. Gotta love it when they have a salsa bar too :)
