Have been here several times and the food and service is always superb!! They have a great deal on guacamole for happy hour! Yes I said guac!! I love their food but really love their taco plates. They are larger than typical tacos and always overflowing and delicious! Not only does this place have excellent food but the service and prices are just as good. This is by far the BEST Mexican food in all of Las Vegas!!
