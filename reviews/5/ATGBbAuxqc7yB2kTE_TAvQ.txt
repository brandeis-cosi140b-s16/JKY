Stoner heaven! There's nothing else you can call a place that delivers burritos, stays open to 3 am, and sits next to Bongo Video. But no matter what your frame of mind, this place is the bomb. I'm so glad they're on my way home from work, so I can swing by and pick up a burrito if I'm leaving late and don't feel like making dinner. Whatever you order, make sure it includes the sweet potato puree - like pureed gold.
