There are so many "Berto's" in Phoenix that it's not even funny.  Humberto's is next door to my rinky dink apartment.  So it's convenient.  I went in expecting to find a typical dive.  However, this place was clean and there was a lone man in there manning the grill.  I immediately ordered my "safe" meal - a Carne Asada Burrito. I was happy to see the man toss some raw meat onto the grille and make it fresh.  He took great care in putting chili in it and then slapped it into a huge tortilla.  He also put a MOUNTAIN of guacamole into it which was the only downfall.  I will next time as for cheese instead.  So, I ate it and it was good.  It was very big and filling as well.  I will be returning to this place time and time again!
