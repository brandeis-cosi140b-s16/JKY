Overall a good place to go and eat some quality food. Happy hour specials were pretty good with $2 beers, the service was friendly, prompt, and accurate. Three things that are apparently hard these days so props to the staff for that.

The chips and salsa bar was a good deal, with fresh made salsa to try. The tamales are also very good and better than what I was expecting. The burritos were cooked well, rolled nicely and didn't fall apart. 

The rice and beans was above average and had good flavor. On par with some of the better Mexican chains around town and far superior to filibertos. 

Would send friends here if they ask for a solid SE valley choice.
