Very very good food. Very fresh. Large menu of different dishes. Reasonably priced. You don't have to have seafood if you don't want to. They are extremely friendly. I went here with my gf, because I saw online that they received an A from the health dept. Lol I definitely recommend it. It's a great place to try something new. Only thing wrong was the music was a little bit to loud.
