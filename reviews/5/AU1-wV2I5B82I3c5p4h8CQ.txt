Nothing fancy... just a hole-in-the-wall place where one would expect some pretty good food.  There was just one guy working there, taking orders, cooking, and waiting tables.  There isn't much room to sit, just a few 'fast food' type booths.  I was ordering takeout so that didn't matter.

I ordered some tacos al carbon to go.  While I was waiting, a few others were served their food and it really looked yummy!  One of the customers got up, went behind the counter and got a soda refill... apparently accepted practice here and a hint of how low-key the place is.  

My tacos were excellent!  My "good food at hole-in-the-walls" notion was preserved, and I'll be going back.  

If you're looking for a chain restaurant, keep driving.  But the laid-back low-key atmosphere was just what I was looking for.
