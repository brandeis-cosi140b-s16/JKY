The food is great, pretty much like most other "Berto's" shops, but the lady who runs the drive through is super nice!  I want whatever she has for breakfast, because for some reason she is always happy, friendly, helpful, and its real... none of this fake smiles stuff you see elsewhere. Anyway, try the carne asada nachos, they are great! But if you dont like grease... steer clear of the ground beef, very very greasy, holy cow. Still gets 5 stars though for everything else, especially service : )
