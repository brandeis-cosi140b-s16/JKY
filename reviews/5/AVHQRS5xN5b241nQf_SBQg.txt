Love this Cafe Rio! First of all, our dinner tonight was fast, fresh, delicious and affordable.  I've visited other locations previously and never wanted to return, but my husband talked me into tonight's visit and I couldn't be happier with our experience.  As a bonus, after a 700+ mile drive from San Francisco today, in my exhausted stupor, I forgot my purse and didn't realize it until we got home.  Even though the restaurant had closed a few minutes earlier at 10pm, a very nice lady answered my anxious call and reassured me that they had it, which was a great relief.  Five stars for awesome service? Good food, and awesome employees!
