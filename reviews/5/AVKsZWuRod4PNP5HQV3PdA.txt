Was reading user Shon P's review, and was taking it seriously, but stopped right in my tracks when I read "Mexican food has about four basic ingredients" and then it was just laughable. Clearly, this person knows nothing about authentic Mexican food,  considering it's one of the top and most intricate cuisines in the world.  Be careful who's reviews you take seriously.  Someone with such a high level of ignorance has no clue what they are talking about when it comes to Mexican food.
