This place is fun and the food is very tasty! They have a Diablo fire wing challenge which I'm always down for a challenge but was not in the mood for chicken wings. The chips and salsa were great. Ordered the Diablo Cadillac margarita which was also very good. They also have a late night happy hour 9pm - 12am on the rooftop patio with a live band for $25. Great deal if you enjoy draft beer. 

It's a younger crowd and a bit loud so if you want a quiet romantic dinner skip this place. Otherwise, party dawn, get a margarita and try out some of the amazing food here! You will not leave disappointed and if you are a bit on the crazy side try the wing challenge, I know I will later in the day. Gotta get my picture on a 4th wall in Vegas for eating crazy hot stuff. Love it!
