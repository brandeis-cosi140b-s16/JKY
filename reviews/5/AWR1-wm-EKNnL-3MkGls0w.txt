This isn't a best-restaurant-ever 5 stars, but for what it is, a fun, irreverent twist on Mexican with a great beer selection, it does exactly what it sets out to do.

The Shadyside location has short rib tacos, which are worth the trip.

There's not much to say about MM that hasn't been said already, but dang, those tacos are good.
