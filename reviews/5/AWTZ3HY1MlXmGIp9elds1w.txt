I know you aren't expecting much from your Taco Bell however, I did call them with a concern (I'm vegetarian) the gentleman on the phone went over all the ingredients with me on the phone. Something I didn't ask for but he was willing to go the "xtra" step. Thank you! People are so quick to leave negative feedback! I challenge you to express the good as well! Thank you!
