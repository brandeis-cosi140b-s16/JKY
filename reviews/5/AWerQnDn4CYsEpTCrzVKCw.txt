We were going every Monday because it was 50% off for locals-- 50% off of everything! Yes, that means drinks as well BUTTT they stopped and made it 25% off instead it's ok, so now we go every OTHER Monday 
One of our favorite entrees are the fajitas. Mmm it's all so fresh and hot, comes with the most delicious rice ever (cilantro lime) and your choice of beans and tortillas. It's great and it's always so hard to not order that because we love it so much. I've also tried the hamburger-- SO good! And who would have thought at a Mexican restaurant! 

Margaritas-- just get one. Get the strawberry or mango (on the rocks!) with the chili lime salt on the rim and then tell me that's not the best marg you've ever had  ENJOY!
