We used to live in Prescott Valley and we had a favorite breakfast burrito place that we frequented almost weekly. We moved to Denver 4 years ago, and have been forever in search of a place that makes breakfast burritos as good as our beloved place, and have yet to find it. We are in Phoenix for the week visiting family, and considered actually driving 2 hours up to PV just for one of their burritos, but instead went on Yelp to find a good local place. Well, Regio's is it! Fat, full of chorizo, cheese and potatoes, with homemade sauces to pour on top. Delicious! Too bad we had to travel 800 miles to find it! We will be back!
