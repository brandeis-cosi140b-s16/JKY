Fantastic, a place opened in Gilbert that has more than bar food! Have tried many items on the menu but keep going back to the traditional New Mexico burro Christmas style. Ivan has been our go to waiter from the start.  The bottom line is these guys know New Mexican cuisine. If looking for a new dining experience, give La Ristra a try.
