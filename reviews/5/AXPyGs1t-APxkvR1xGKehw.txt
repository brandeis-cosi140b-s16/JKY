We picked this place solely on the good reviews --- and we were NOT disappointed! I highly recommend this place if your looking for a quick/sit down type restaurant. 

The environment is definitely a dive but most dives have THE BEST FOOD! Similar to Moes and Chipotle, this places offers a massive "wet" California style burrito. Food is fresh and prepared to order. Reasonable priced with ongoing daily specials. 

Not only is the food good, the customer service is absolutely amazing. The staff is outgoing/friendly and willing to go above and beyond to make the customer feel welcome.
