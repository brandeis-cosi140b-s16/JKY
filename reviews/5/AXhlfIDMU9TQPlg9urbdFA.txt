The starter they offer is fresh chips and salsa and it was AMAZING, I haven't had fresh salsa like that since I was in Texas! 

I would definitely suggest you visit this restaurant if you're at the NY hotel, we got the enchiladas and they were the best I'd EVER had (better than when I was in Mexico)! The menu has an excellent variety of Mexican food and the pricing is excellent for anyone on a budget. The portions are also very well sized (enough to share and be full). 

ABSOLUTELY A MUST WHILE YOU ARE IN LV! :D
