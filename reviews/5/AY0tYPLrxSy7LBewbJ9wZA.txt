When I visited this one which is close to home I lucked out and they weren't busy.  Still love the barbacoa burrito.  

They had a sign on the door explaining the recent story around removing pork (carnitas) from the menu.  And voila - the new menu item is tofu!  Looks pretty good so I'll have to try it next time.
