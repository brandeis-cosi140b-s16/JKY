This is my go to fast Mexican food place.  They are open late, always friendly and have good fresh food.  I've never gotten anything bad here.   No inside seating so I usually go through the drive-thru in summer months but when it is cooler the patio is nice.  Light rail construction is finishing up in front of them which has had to hurt their business but now it is easy to get in and out.  Their prices are very reasonable as well.
