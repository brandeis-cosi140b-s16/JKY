This was my neighborhood restaurant.  I've eaten here more than I care to remember.  Their Pollo Fundito is permanently a part of my hips, unfortunately. 

I love sitting in their back room near the little waterfall, but the big room is fun too - from watching folks, teenage couples to families managing too many little ones and of course being able to hear the karaoke in the bar.  

Their food is Sonoran so don't go looking for anything else.  They have some of the best fajitas in the valley, bar none, even if they do call them "Carnitas Picante de la Luna". See Omar's review of another location for proof.   It's my girlfriend's favorite Chicken Chimi in the valley too.  Very "Phoenix traditional".  I put that in quotes because you have to know what you want.  This isn't my place to go for Mexico City food.  It's not my place for coastal Mexican food.  But for traditional Phoenix Mexican food it's at the top of the list.
