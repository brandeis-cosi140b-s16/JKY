Wow, from the street it looks a little rough. But I noticed that the parking lot had been freshly hosed down and was spotless. As soon as we entered I knew we were in for a treat. A wonderful friendly atmosphere and all of the chairs and tables were hand painted in Mexican folk art. The place was immaculate. 
We had called for a reservation for 12 people and our table was ready for us and we were immediately offered chips, 2 types of salsa and waters. 
There were so many wonderful things to try on the menu that we all ordered something different. After we ordered we were given some of the best cevichi I have ever as an appetizer (no charge)! 
Even though the kitchen had to prepare 12 different plates, they all came out together. 
EVERYTHING was very carefully made and delicious. By far some of the finest Mexican food in the valley. We travel in Mexico often and have had many wonderful meals there. Imagine going to 16th street and Roosevelt for something even better. 
The service was VERY friendly and timely. It felt like we were eating at my Grandmother's house! 
Hands down, my new favorite Mexican Restaurant
