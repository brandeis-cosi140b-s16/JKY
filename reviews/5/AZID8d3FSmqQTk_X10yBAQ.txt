Our server Tyler S was very knowledgeable, friendly, and patient. He was also honest about the food. The manager came around and checked on us which was nice. Service was fast. 

THE FOOD: amazing. We started with 2 short rib tacos, Mac & cheese, and for our entree, we split the chili relleno. 
All of the food was flavorful and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about my meal. The Margaritas could easily be on someone's top 5 list. 


We ended our evening with the bread pudding skillet. This could have been a little sweeter, thankfully the scoop of ice cream helped that. Perhaps a bit of honey on top or agave would be a nice touch to that dish. I would order it again though despite it not being as sweet as I personally like.
