This is one of my favorite Del Taco locations.

The service is always excellent and my food is always piping hot. 

I love how quick they make the food to making it a great breakfast/lunch/dinner spot if you are in a break from work. 

We get coupons like every week in the mail which is nice because they are coupons that are actually worth it and make it easy on your wallet. Not that there prices are high anyway but it is just a bonus.

They have had their "Tuesday Taco Night" for years but recently added to it which makes me super happy. You can still get 3 regular tacos (hard or soft) for $1.09 but now you can even get 3 "Taco Deluxe"  (soft or hard) for $2.09. It has lettuce, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. So it is basically a baby "Macho Taco".
You can also on Thursday nights get 3 "Grilled Chicken Tacos" for $2.09.

I am a sucker for their "Del Scorcho" cause it is a must when I get a Cheddar Quesadilla. 

They have a e-club and if you sign up you automatically get free Grilled Chicken Quesadillas and other coupons from time to time.

You can't go wrong with Del's prices and taste!
