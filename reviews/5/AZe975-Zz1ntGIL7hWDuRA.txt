If you want a great fish taco this is the place to go. Since Ive moved here which wasnt too long ago, I always order cheese enchiladas with rice and whole beans (if I can find them) and a fish taco on the side. The fish taco was seasoned and fried to perfection. It reminded of what I got from back home growing up. The fact they have whole beans (here for some reason in arizona they call em ranchero versus charro or borracho beans which what I call em) are one of the reasons I  love this place. Being able to mix my rice and beans is as good as it gets with a pacifico. The cheese enchiladas I had were also tasty. The sauce was very tex mex and made it that much better. I have been there 3 times now and the place just keeps getting better.
