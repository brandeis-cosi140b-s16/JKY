I needed to have daddy and daughter time with my 3 year old and had an awesome dinner with her here. Justin, Paul, and Daisy did an awesome job holding down the fort down. Food was just what I expected and my daughter whom usually doesn't like Mexican food, ate half my plate:). I recommend this place if in avondale.
