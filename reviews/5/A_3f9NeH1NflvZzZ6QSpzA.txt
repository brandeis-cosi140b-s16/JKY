Okay, I'm stopping in to update my review because I was finally able to experience the glory that is Tediberto's last night. Per the previous fellow's request, I subscribed to Tediberto's on Facebook and was able to know with 100% certainty that they would be open. If you're not already subscribed, do it now! Not only do they let you know the hours for the day, but they also tell you about the specials.

When I got to the door, the very same employee who helped me out before greeted me and we were served by another fellow who was equally as charming and terrific at his job, completely allowing me to negate every person on here who ever wrote  a single bad thing about the service here. I don't know about before, but the service is top-notch, so if you had a bad experience in the past, go back and give them a second chance. They absolutely deserve it. Besides, I know you've been dreaming about those nachos ever since.

So, what good would a review be without a review of the food?  I'm from Chicago where we have two vegan/vegetarian Mexican restaurants that are both spectacular, but Tediberto's somehow manages to put them both to shame. We ordered the tacos on special and the No Whey Jose Nachos and every bit of it was phenomenal. I even later learned that there was cilantro in the tacos and I somehow didn't even notice. This is a huge deal because the mere presence of cilantro is generally enough for me to start side-eyeing all of my dining companions to question who could have possibly poisoned my food or at least sprayed it with Lysol, but I was completely oblivious to its presence due to the amazing flavors that were abundant within the best tacos I've had in years.

If they were open 24 hours a day, I would insist that you go right now, but, just to be safe, go like them on Facebook and double-check the hours and make sure you go as soon as they're open again.
