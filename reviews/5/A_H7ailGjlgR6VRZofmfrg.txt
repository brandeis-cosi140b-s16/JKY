I'm not sure why I have lived in Phoenix for 9 years and have never eaten here before!  My friend has been going here for years and said we need to go for lunch. When you walk in, you order at the counter and then they bring it out to your table. I have seen some complain about that but I'm not sure why. I had an enchilada with green sauce and a soft rolled taco, rice and beans. The beans taste like REAL beans and not canned. The rice was good and the green sauce...wow!!  I only wish I found this place years ago!
