Very impressive! Loved their service and style. The chips and salsa had an interesting flair to it. The chips were a mixture of tortilla and wonton type chips. The salsa had a peppery flavor which was really cool. I ordered the skillet chicken which was very yummy. My hubby got the street tacos which he really enjoyed as well. He ordered a margarita and I went with the berry bubbly martini which were both delicious and very strong which is a plus. The bill was right at about $50 bucks with tip which isn't too bad considering we drank alcohol. 

We also had a living social deal that expired almost a month prior and they still honored it. We will definitely be back and we'd also love to try their other restaurant, Rhythm and Wine!
