This is the new hot spot in Scottsdale and not only does it look good, but the food is excellent. Now combining Latin America cuisine with Asian food may sound a little odd at first, but trust me, this place is great!

We went here the other day for our office Christmas lunch and had a great time. There were six of us and between us we tried the following items: guacamole with pomegranate, street tacos, Chinese-style chili crab garlic noodles, Mexican pho, Mexican street corn, the steak pepito sandwich, and the lobster and crab "dynamite". 

Everyone enjoyed their food immensely and the service was great, with the waiter answering all our questions and doing an excellent job of adjusting the heaters and the wind shades so that everyone was comfortable. For dessert, we decided to split three items, the tres leche cake, chocolate peanut butter bar, and the chocolate sticky cake.

My only regret is that there were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and no one else wanted to order the ceviche, but I guess that just means I have an excuse to go back... and I definitely plan to do that. In fact, I may need to make several visits to get my fill of this place :-)
