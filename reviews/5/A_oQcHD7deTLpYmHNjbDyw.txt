It is kind of funny how people rate restaurants. First of all, who told you that you needed to have several baskets of chips or salsa before your meal? Even tho Chips and salsa are free, must understand, it is not your meal...so why do you demand refill after refill? I am sure that if you had to pay for them you would not demand as much....Same thing with soft drinks...one after another and another after another...please people.  How about comments like "I come from southern Ca. and I know what authentic food should taste like".  For your knowledge, a burrito will taste different within Mexico, it depends what little town you go to...So, there is not such of thing as authentic defining Mexico per say. If you have been to Mexico you would know better so say such of things. My comment it is not to defend this specific restaurant for any short comings but my comments are for all ethnic restaurants out there. Some People need to have a crash curse in etiquette while eating out. Remember, you can always stay home and cook your own meal.
