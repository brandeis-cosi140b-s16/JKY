Visited this restaurant for the first time. I believe they've been open a week. 

Atmosphere: Super cute & quaint! House converted into a restaurant. Beach themed throughout. Any & all clocks for decor are set to 5 o'clock. LOL They seat about 30 inside. They have a belly up bar for drinks. A few people were there enjoying themselves.  Outside they have a sand play area for kids, fire pits & picnic benches, seating at the outdoor bar. Pretty spacious outside. Today they had a band playing. 

Staff: friendly & attentive
Prices: avg. $10 for a meal with rice & beans 
Food: I had shrimp tacos. PHENOMINAL!!!! Hubby had the steak tacos & he loved them as well. Tacos are a little small but full, fresh & flavorful. Something unique about the rice, in a good way, is I usually have to add salsa to Mexican rice, but this rice I didn't need to add to. It's different, but good. 

Enjoyed very much, will be back!
