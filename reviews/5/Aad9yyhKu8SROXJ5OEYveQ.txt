We've been to this place a few times, and I don't know what has taken me so long to write a review! 
Love the chips & salsa/dip trio they bring out (Navy bean dip mixed with the spicy red salsa=delicious!!) Tried the Queso Dip, it was OK, but the Tortilla Soup was AMAZING!  My favorite entree is the pick 2 comb plates.  Their rice and beans are really great too.  It's a little noisy, but most Casino Restaurants are. 
I love that they have TVs with sports on them. pretty much visible from anywhere you sit.  We spent $60 between the 2 of us (not including tip), but I did order a massive Blood Orange Margarita that was a whopping $12, and we brought home another meal in leftovers.  I think it's worth the money, when you leave stuffed, & with a meal for the next day.
