Hell yeah. So when I walked in I saw a huge menu. It's not as organized so you have to really look for what you want. Carne fries are only 7.95, 2 extra dollars for extra pico and extra sour cream (how I like it)! And for 3 rolled tacos it's only $3.25! Every other Mexican place I've tried totaled to about $21 for all that but here it was 16.05 including the drink! 

So on top of loving the prices, the fries were pretty big and everything was really good and really filling. Better than most places. There rolled tacos were a little too saltless but nothing I can't fix myself. I defiantly recommend this place.
