Such great customer service!! Not to mention the food was fresh, fast and inexpensive for a seafood place.  I had the fisherman's sampler, torritos and chipoltle shrimp and man there was enough food for any army.  The place was packed and I still managed to eat and pay in under an hour.  Five stars in my book!
