Great burgers, reasonable prices, friendly service and no fuss.  Why hadn't we been here before?  Easy access in an iffy-looking strip mall conveniently located by the drive-thru liquor store.  But don't let the neighborhood deter you.  In a trendier spot with chic waitstaff you'd easily be paying twice as much for these designer burgers.  We need to go back soon to try the sandwiches and tacos, but it will be hard to not order the Beach Burger again.  Yum.
