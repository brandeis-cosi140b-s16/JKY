I love this place. The food is awesome! I usually get the Country breakfast burrito. It has gravy & is pretty amazing! 

The place is nothing to look at. I never actually stay and eat. I just order and go. To make it faster just call ahead to order. 

The burritos come in smaller or shack size. I always get smaller and can never finish the whole thing. They are quite a good size for being smaller. The prices are really good, too. I usually get the hot & mild sauce with my burrito because I can't get enough. The hot doesn't have heat (it takes A LOT for me) but it's pretty good. 

If you want something delicious for cheap & you're ok if the place isn't fancy then I recommend the shack.
