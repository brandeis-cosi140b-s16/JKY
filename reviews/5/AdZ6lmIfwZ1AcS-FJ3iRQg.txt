One of the newest, coolest, hipest joints in Carefree (located in the Spanish Village) and this joint might be my newest favorite happy hour place in town.

Think Mexican/Caribbean beach restaurant with a   laid back friendly staff combined with a well rounded menu and many great happy hour appies.

Tonight I tried "Chrissy's red enchiladas" and they were awesome!  $13 so this dish is well priced.

One of the cool twists on this joint is fully half the menu is all Italian fare.  So if your headed out and one of your complainers says "I don't care for Mexican food" you can go and take card of them too!

Lots of outside patio dining and they can handle large groups as well.

A relaxed decor that you'll enjoy ...... Give them a go, I think you'll be pleased.
