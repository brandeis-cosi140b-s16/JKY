Tacos are very good and ordering was easy. I sometimes struggle to order at a food truck because I don't speak Spanish and don't eat onions. Usually I ask them to hold the onion and get onions anyway. This was easy though. I ordered with no onions and that's what I received and the tacos were very good. 

But what I really liked was an Indian food truck. I've never seen that before. Indian food is a favorite of mine so I had to try it. It wasn't better than the best Indian restaurant in town but it was better than some for sure. It was fast and priced right and tasted authentic. It's nice to have variety. I do enjoy truck tacos but it's refreshing to have options especially the option of delicious hearty Indian dishes. The Indian food felt clean and healthy and I will be back.
