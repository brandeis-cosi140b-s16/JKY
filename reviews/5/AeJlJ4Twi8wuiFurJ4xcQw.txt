Cabo's (formerly Salsas) is my favorite Mexican in town!  I've tried other "Authentic Mexican" spots and they were a little too authentic for my taste (i.e. greasy and bland).  Cabo's is consistent, fresh, flavorful, prompt and service is sufficient.  Now if you're a snooty, uppity person and need a lot of attention from your server, don't bother.  They will bring your DELICIOUS fresh salsa the minute you sit down and take your drink order.  They will return with your drinks and take your food order.  Literally 5-10 yummy-chips-and-salsa-minutes later, your food will arrive hot and on a HUGE plate.  Your drinks will be refilled as needed.  No frills.  Pretty much what you can expect at this price-point.  Something you won't expect from this price-point are the table-side guacamole option and fresh made tortillas-made in a tortilla bar at the front of the restaurant. Very nice touch for those of you looking for a more Cantina feel. We almost always go for lunch but I know they have a pretty happening nightlife on the weekends.  

Tip: my favorite dish is the Pollo Con Queso.  Spanish rice topped with grilled-to-perfection (never over-grilled and charred) chicken, topped with grilled peppers, onions, and TOMATOES (yum) then all smothered with their perfect queso (never runny or watery).  Also with a side of standard guac and sour cream.  PERFECTION!  I get it every time and it is always good.
