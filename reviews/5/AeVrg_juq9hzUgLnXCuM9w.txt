This place was amazzzzing!! the ambiance was great, staff was SO friendly ,passionate and the food was the best mexican i've ever had! I highly recommend the Guacamole, they make it fresh right at your table! and the shrimp appetizer is to die for. The only reason we knew of this place was bc we have friends who went there the night before, they found it on here. Heads up, it's out of the way...there's a good chance your cabbie wont know where it is (we got lost) tell them to take you to Sapphire's Gentlemans club its a massive Blue glowing building... i know, i know, but trust me it's not inside..there is a seperate entrance to the left of Sapphires and is def kid friendly. They need a sign on the road so you can find it. Its so affordable and everything is local and organic. its amazing I cant say enough good things about this place, it's sad that it's so far off the strip BUT that's what keeps the prices low. :)
