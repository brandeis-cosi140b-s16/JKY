As a Chandler Arizona native, I have a VERY warm place in my heart for Espo's Mexican Food... I've been coming here since I was old enough to eat a burrito!!!
Dont come here expecting fancy schmancy ambiance...Come here for Delicious, Authentic Mexican Food served up fast in a very casual setting. 

You cant go wrong, everything on the menu is delicious & prepared daily. 

This "Mom & Pop" restaurant opened its doors in 1974 & has been Family owned & operated for over 40 years. 

Great if you want good food fast & aren't trying to wine & dine.
We usually call ahead & pick up our food to go, but there is also a small dining room inside & an outside patio with seating as well.

My favorites are the shredded beef tacos and the bean & cheese burritos...and they have the BEST Green Chili!!! Everything on the menu is delicious.
