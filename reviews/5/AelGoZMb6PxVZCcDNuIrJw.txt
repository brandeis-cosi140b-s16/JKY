this chipotle is SUPER TINY!! and so the line can be a bit crowded.  there's plenty of room on the patio, but that doesn't work out so well in the middle of summer when you might as well just go sit on the sun.  i was SHOCKED at how efficient and friendly they were here.   i mean, i've come to expect quick  friendly service at Chipotle, but everyone seemed to actually really ENJOY working there.  nice! and of course the food was  fresh and delicious!  this is a great location if you're going to take out, but if you want to eat on premises i recommend NOT going to eat lunch at noonish.  go early or late if possible.
