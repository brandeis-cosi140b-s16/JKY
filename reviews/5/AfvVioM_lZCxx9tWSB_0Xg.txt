Just moved to Scottsdale a couple of days ago, so needed somewhere close by that was stress-free and would be quick. Frederico's met all of our needs and it was Mexican - which I was really in the mood for.

It is probably the best fast food Mexican I've had. It was delish! We had an early dinner, since there was no one in there we decided to dine in instead of to-go. SO glad we did, because the Carne Asada French Fries would have been droopy and probably icky by the time we got home.

I had the Carne Asada Tacos and the hubs ordered the CAFF's mentioned above. The French Fry dish was a splurge, we don't normally eat like that, but it was wonderful. Prices were fair, food was fast - but not too fast, because it was made to order. The meal included chips, which surprised us. The chips were perfect, crispy and just enough salt. 

Excited for it's close proximity to both our new home and the hubby's office. I highly recommend Frederico's!
