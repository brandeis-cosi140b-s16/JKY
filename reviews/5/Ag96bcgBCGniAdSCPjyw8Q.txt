By far the best tasting home made Mexican food in the valley. The flour tortillas are huge, the menudo is fresh and fantastic, and the pork tacos are delectable. They fresh squeez a glass of orange juice upon order, and the make the best Cheladas beers! Very small and quaint. If you want food quick go to Taco Bell. If you want authentic great tasting food, Los Picos
