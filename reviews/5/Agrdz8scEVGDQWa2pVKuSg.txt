Been eating here for years.     This place is terrific for what it offers.  Pretty straightforward, no frills menu, food is cooked fresh, tastes fresh, is served quickly, prices are pretty cheap and I've yet to have a bad meal here.    Tortillas are awesome and their breakfast menu, which is available all day, is also very appetizing.   The service is always friendly, its a family-owned business and the other locations around the Valley uphold the same sorts of standards for quality and customer service.   Worth a shot if you're looking for a good lunch or dinner that will leave you satisfied but not feeling overstuffed!      They offer catering services and have some great drinks as well, killer margarita's!
