This is the best hole in the wall Mexican restaurant I've ever eaten at. very authentic and tasty! the food was delicious and the owner was amazing and helpful to us. my first time and he suggested the carne asada and it was the best carne I've ever eaten. I felt as if I was at home. if you're looking to eat homemade Mexican food, this is the spot!!!!! well organized and very clean!! thank you for your amazing customer service, I will be back!!
