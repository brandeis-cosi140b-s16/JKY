OKay I won't lie to you I went here originally because I got a two for one certificate from the Entertainment Book. And I have eaten here 5 times at full price ever since. Everything both my wife and I have tried is great especially the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. This is Gourmet Mexican food at regular prices. Great atmosphere.. Great Bar.... Good Sports Bar also. I love the outside seating especially Spring and Fall in Snottsdale.Try it you will Like it!
