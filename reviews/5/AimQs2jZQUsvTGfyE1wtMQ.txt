Cafe Tranquilo is owned by the Clarendon Hotel and it's a great add.  Now that the hotel and restaurant is owned by the same owner, you can order room service while staying at the hotel.  
The food here is excellent and mouth watering delicious!
On Sat, I had a party of 6 adults and 6 kids by the pool during lunch time and we were provided with great service by Yusa.
Everything we had was good.  The chips & salsa, chips & guacamole (chunky full of fresh guacamole & flavorful), grilled cheese sandwich- everyone enjoyed their food. 
And it was promptly served. Which can be a factor when receiving poolside service from an on site restaurant. 
Great add & I look forward to getting room service while staying at the Claredon!
