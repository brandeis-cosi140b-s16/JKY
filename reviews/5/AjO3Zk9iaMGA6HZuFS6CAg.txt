Excellent food and excellent service, and the portions guarantee that you will not walk away hungry. The chips were thin and fresh and the salsa was real salsa, not something out of a jar. Even though I was full at the end of my meal I found myself nibbling on those chips while they took care of my payment, I just couldn't stop!
