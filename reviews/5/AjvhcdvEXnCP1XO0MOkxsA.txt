I love this place!  Every time I go back home I have to stop by.  I usually am only a fan of cheap fast Mexican food but this place is definitely special.  The fajitas are especially great, try the shrimp.  

The drinks are awesome and they have some of the best collector cups ever.  I have the coconut carved to look like a monkey (a drink cup goes on the inside, even has a hole in the lid for a straw) and my husband/brother/dad all have the ChaCha Margarita cup (they like to call her ChiChi because she is anatomically correct).  I think you get a discount if you bring the cups back.

The sopapillas are to die for.  So soft and covered in honey and powdered sugar.  I always end up getting it all over myself but it is OK because then I get to lick it off later.

The interior is pretty cool, looks like a feisty Mexican cantina, including wooden birds and mariachi mannequins.  There is usually a balloon guy wandering around who will make you a seriously cool balloon animal/hat/whatever you want for a few bucks.
