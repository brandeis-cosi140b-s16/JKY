Yet another visit to try the lunch special, which for today was pollo frito con calabacin salteado. As expected, it was very good, very filling, and very inexpensive. Latest update to the place that I noticed: they now have their regular menu on a big menu board above and a bit behind the counter. But also look for the day's special which  is still listed on a small board on the counter itself.
