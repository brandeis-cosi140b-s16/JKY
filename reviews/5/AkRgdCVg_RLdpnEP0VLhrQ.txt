I've been here twice in just a week since finding this great restaurant. This is a family owned restaurant that serves good, high quality food. The shredded beef tacos are amazing and the asada rocks.
When you first sit down you will be treated to freshly cooked tortilla chips and some really tasty salsa. The salsa isn't too spicy but has a great flavor. If you are adventurous like I am, ask for their HOT salsa, which is a combination of habaneros, ghost chilis and jalapenos all roasted and blended up into a sauce that will set your hair on fire. Mix the hot and mild together to come up with your own custom combination. For me, the re-fried beans are the way to determine the authenticity of a Mexican restaurant and the beans at El Rico's are some of the best I've had. You can taste the hint of smokey bacon and the texture and the spices are just right... Fantastic!!
