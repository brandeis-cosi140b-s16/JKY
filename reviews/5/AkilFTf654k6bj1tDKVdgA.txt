Wife and I had lunch here today. First time eating at this location. Were greeted warmly by the working staff who were also very helpful in teaching us the ropes of constructing our bowls.
Wife had the chicken and I had chicken and pork on top of the seaweed rice. With the other toppings, the flavor combinations were fabulous. The only thing I would call a problem is their location. Been traveling this road for quite some time and never noticed Braddah's in this tiny mall. The wife clued me in as we drove by a few days ago. This place is well worth looking for and coming to. They need word of mouth advertising and I hope this review will help pull others in.
