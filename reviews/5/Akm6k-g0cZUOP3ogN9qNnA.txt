I was kinda scared to try a new taco place honestly this is probably the best taco place in phoenix, due to the location I didn't expect it to be as clean as it was. I'm very impressed. The carne asada tacos were wonderful, not full of lard. They have a salad bar with different type of salsa that is fresh!!! This is our new taco joint!!!
