Welcome to Moes !!! Is how they greet you. The staff is very alert making sure all guest are greeted. They are really nice and make me feel very comfortable. I have been in here a couple of times and it seems like the food gets better and better each time I come. Don't get it wrong they food is always good, I just get more addicted each time I come. They have the best queso and guacamole.
