I'm a big fan of Chipotle in general, but this location was extra amazing. Aside from it's awesome location in downtown Pitt (what I've decided to call the fabulous outdoor food court), the staff was super friendly and the ingredients in my burrito bowl tasted even more fresh than usual. Highly recommend!
