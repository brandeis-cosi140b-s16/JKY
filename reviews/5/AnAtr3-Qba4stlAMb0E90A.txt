My husband and I grabbed a bite to eat here while we were waiting for our paperwork to be finalized at one of the auto dealerships close by. We were seated right away and were also given chips, salsa, and bean dip to munch on while we looked over the menu. They also gave us some soup which was tasty. We were super dehydrated so we were finishing our drinks left and right but are glasses never went empty. 

I decided to order Gorditos de Camaron which is a rolled flour tortilla filled with shrimp, tomatoes, onions, and a bit of jalapenos. It's deep fried and smothered in cheese and served with guacamole on the side. It was so yummy and even though this was an appetizer it was huge! I couldn't finish it all so I took the rest home. 

The service here is fantastic and very understanding. While we were waiting on the food we got a call from the car dealership saying to hurry back . My husband had to tell the waiter that as soon as we get the food we need the check right away . They not only did that but knowing we were in a hurry we had like four people from the wait staff checking on us to make sure we were okay. It was really refreshing to have everything go so smoothly amongst all the stress.
