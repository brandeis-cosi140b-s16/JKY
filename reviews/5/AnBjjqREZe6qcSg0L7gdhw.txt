I work literally a hot skip and a jump away from this place and never knew it was there. Everyday I would drive a few blocks to eat at other fast food places and on monday i used my phone to find something new. this place popped up, i was hesitant at first because of the liquor store right next to it but decided to give it a shot. I have been back 4 out of 5 days this week during my lunch. im from california and have been here about a year and have yet to find a good mexican restaurant, this place is the only place i have ever gone back to that serves mexican food. easy on my wallet and excellent food! loveeeeee it
