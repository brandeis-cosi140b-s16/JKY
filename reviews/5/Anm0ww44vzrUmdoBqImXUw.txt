My boss brought me here for lunch and all I can say is WOOOWW!! This place really knows what they are doing! I had the Carnita tacos with their spicy salsa. The carnitas were a little crunchy but still moist and their salsa was HOT but very flavorful. Authentic Mexican food FOR SURE! HIGHLY RECOMMEND PHAT PHRANKS!
