OK, I don't get it...there are quite a few poor reviews for Javier's.  Having been to the Newport Beach location, I can say that the food quality is as good in Vegas as the Southern Cali location. The scenery is much better at Crystal Cove, with a stunning view of the ocean, but Vegas offers the eye candy of the casino.  Simply said, the service, food and atmosphere were all great.  Yes, it is expensive, but if you want cheap Mexican go to Taco Bell.  Think about their overhead (rent, large staff to deliver great service, cost to build out a spectacular restaurant, and high quality ingredients) and adjust your expectations and you will have a great experience.
