When it comes to Mexican food I food I do not eat it often. Therefore I am really picky. Only when it comes to Mexican food.. My husband and I never heard of Abuela's before, we were just hungry and saw this on our way home. We stopped in and it smelled so good inside. Like our moms kitchen. We order our daughter a Quesadilla de Lengua and I got a carnitas burrito and my husband got a burrito of barbacoa. 
Let me tell you that my daughters quesadilla was so bomb. I wished that she didn't finish it so I can finish for her. It was amazing. It came out hot and cheesy. The cheese was so good. 
My burrito was also yummy. The size was perfect and it didn't fall apart. 
We went back and I got a Gordita de Chicharron and language taco. I loved the Gordita. You can tell they make everything from scratch.  The Lengua was tender and juicy. My husband and I are always pleased and are surprised that we don't go there as often. 

I really like the fact I always see women working the kitchen in a lot of Mexican restaurants it's always men. I feel like it puts a "motherly touch" in our food ^.^
