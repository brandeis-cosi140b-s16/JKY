So one lonely night... OK wait... it wasn't lonely...

I was at a friends house...

And we were playing Mario Kart on the Wii (very fun BTW).

We got a craving for chili dogs (and no we weren't smoking!)

So, we headed out to Sonic, since that was the only place we knew that would have chili dogs at 10pm. We pulled up, looked at the menu and went... MEEEHHH...

So I wipped out my phone and opened Yelp and did a search for "chili dogs" and up popped up Mim's.

We pulled up and I'll be honest... the place was looking downright shady. If someone discharged a gun while we sat there, I don't think I would have been too surprised (this was late at night and the only thing that illuminated the weird colored building was one flickering street lamp). My friend looked over to me and was like "are you SURE this is the place??????" with a bewildered look on his face. I was like, yep, sure is! Just then, someone walked out looking normal and unmugged (I guess). I said, well, let me tell you this... 11 people reviewed this place and it still maintains a 4.5 star rating. It can't be that bad!

So we went in.

Boy was this place awesome! The menus is just outrageous. It has things on the menu that I've never seen before. It is a bit messy with things crossed out and white-out'd. But as another poster mentioned, it smelled good in there. Like, back home cooking where people made stuff from scratch, not ripped it out of a prepackaged box and  tossed it on a grill for 30 seconds.

BONUS! The place has old pinball machines and arcade games! HOLY HELL this is freaking badass! I'm actually glad the food took a while to make because it gave us a chance to be little schoolboys from 1986 and cram quarters and get our fix in! 

Seriously cool and I will be back for more chili dogs and bologna and BBQ bologna sandwiches!
