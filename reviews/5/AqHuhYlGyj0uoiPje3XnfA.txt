We came here off of a whim and so glad that we did . Fresh , homemade authentic Mexican food is what I would use to describe to place . This by far surpasses any robertos or don tor taco type taco shop . It would be a shame to even catorgize them with those taco shops .  
Your order with cashier thAt is aligned next to ppl making fresh food ( almost like chipotle) . The menu is basic and easy to follow. Then you sit at a table and your food is brought to you .  The service was so welcoming and polite and the food was even better . I wish I lived closer to this place because I would be there all the time . 
Plus they have street corn ( good authentic street corn ) !!!!
