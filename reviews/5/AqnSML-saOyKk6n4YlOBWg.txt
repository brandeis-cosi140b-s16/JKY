One of my biggest cravings during my pregnancy was a Raspado (shaved ice with unlimited choices of fruits) and our usual place closed for the winter. I was devastated! We tried another place and the quality was just not the same fruit was bad, some of the things in the raspado were stale. I had almost given up and thought I wouldn't have one until after having the baby. 

Thanks to Yelp, I found this wonderful wonderful gem of a place. The staff is friendly and the location is clean. The fruit is fresh and everything is done right. I can't remember the appropriate name for what I had, but I will describe it. 

A mango smoothie, the bottom of the cup had chamoy (tamarind sauce), it was topped off with fresh mangos and a tamarind candy stick and other tamarind candy. It's absolutely delicious. I hope to make a couple more trips here next with with my husband so he to can enjoy it!!
