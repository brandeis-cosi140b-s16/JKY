Disclaimer:  I'm not from New Mexico.  But I've visited there on many occasions.  This food is legit.

Stopped by on a Saturday night and ordered the carne adovada stacked enchilada (with calabacitas and refried beans) and a bowl of green chile stew to go.

I got a goddamn pie plate chock full of rojo sauce goodness!  With an egg on top!  I haven't eaten food this good in a very long time.  No way a human could eat all of this food...Lord knows I tried.

The green chile stew was almost as good.  It was a bit more spicy than the stacked enchilada, but the flavor wasn't as complex.  I loved it, though.

The food was so freaking good that I had to make another to go order on Wednesday...it was just as good as I remembered.

Wish they had a liquor license - I'd certainly dine in if they had beer.
