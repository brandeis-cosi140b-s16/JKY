Look - I know one assumes that a 5 star meal in Vegas will always break the bank. Gordo is here as living proof that the assumption does not always stand.

One of the BEST MEALS I had on my trip. Tacos Azteca were some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. The experience itself was great too. A little weird at first (you have to stand on different lines depending on what you want) but you'll get it. And you'll be happy you made the trip up the block.
