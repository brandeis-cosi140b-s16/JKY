Perfect lil spot for some yummy burritos! So far I have tried the bean and cheese burrito, sausage breakfast burrito, and carne asada California burrito. All were delicious! The restaurant is clean and pretty big compared to most burrito shops. The employees are nice and friendly. Salsa is good and spicy. Prices are affordable. Plus they are open pretty late which is hard to find in ahwatukee! I'm so happy to have this place close to home.
