OMG OMG OMG OMG

i moved to las vegas for a year from los angeles, and my friend TK took me to this place. he recommended the california burrito, and taking his advice, i bit into the single greatest food item in the whole world. it's as if every sports championship had just been won in my mouth. 

sometimes at night i'm a bit drunk and hungry as hell, and consider for a short time driving through the desert just to visit fausto's. it's amazing.
