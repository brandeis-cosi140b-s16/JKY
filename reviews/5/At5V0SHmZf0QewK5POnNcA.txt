These tacos are absolutely the closest thing to real Mexican street tacos. I had the steak and chicken. The chicken was moist and tender. The steak on the other hand was a little bit tougher but similar to that on really taco truck.  

The salsa bar includes fresh pico de gallo, guacamole sauce, a spider salsa, crisp lettuce and key baby lines. 

I LOVE MEXICAN sodas. The coca cola taste much better with real sugar. They also had fanta and sprite as well. 

This spot will hit the spot after a night of bar hopping Scottsdale. Cheap tacos and a friendly and funny staff.
