Comedor Guadalajara is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley. I highly recommend coming to this place. It has a great atmosphere; perfect for a work lunch, or even a date. When we arrived,we were greeted warmly by the two hosts. We were situated in one of their booths promptly. Our culinary experience began with a basket of chips and very delicious salsa. As an appetizer, we tried the Frijoles con Chorizo dip. One of the best I have had :) I also had Camarones y Pulpo a la Diabla 
(Shrimp & Octopus in hot chipotle sauce) . All I can say is I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes. It was absolutely phenomenal!! I also saw another table with Micheladas, so I will check those out as well.
