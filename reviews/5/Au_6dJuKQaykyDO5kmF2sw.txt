I'm giving 5 stars solemnly just because of my server Sarah. Don't get me wrong the food was excusing and the environment and overall look of the restaurant was nice but Sarah made it an outstanding experience, she was helpful, friendly and always had a welcoming genuine smile and went the extra mile to makes sure my visit was great full. I will definitely will be visiting Nacho Daddy over at downtown again.
