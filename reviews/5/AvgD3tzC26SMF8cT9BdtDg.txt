I really liked this place. I kept seeing a offer on Groupon and finally got it. It puts Chipotle to shame now! The girl was super nice. I told her it was my first time and she gave me samples of every meat they offer. I went with the steak bowl. It was so good. It is such a big serving that I brang half home to eat for later. They had a seaweed rice which is Amazing and different. I put red cabbage on mine as well. They also have a amazing mango salsa to add to it. There is a lot more selection here than Chipotle in my opinion. I agree the steak is on thr sweeter side so you do have to love the sweet if you want the steak. Just ask for a sample. Makes me not ever want to step foot in Chipotle again. Where has this been all my life? LOL I will be back for sure. The Groupon was a great deal so always check before coming in.
