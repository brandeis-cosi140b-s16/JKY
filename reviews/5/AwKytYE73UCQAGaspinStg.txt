My ex took me here a few years ago and when we walked in I thought to myself what the hell is he thinking and I refused to order anything, after he got his food he forced me to try it and I did. OMG it was so good we rushed back over and I ordered some tacos and have been hooked ever since. 

The tacos are a little pricy and grease but they are the best, I have drove about 12 miles on a short lunch break just to get these addictive tacos. If you have never been you need to go but make sure it is after lunch and before 5.

Great food
