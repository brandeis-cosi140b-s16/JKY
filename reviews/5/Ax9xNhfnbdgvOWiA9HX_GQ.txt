Hands down the best tacos in town!! The carne asada with flour tortillas are my favorite! Pastor are my second favorite.  If you feel adventurous I also recommend the tripa (crispy beef intestine). Seriously. 

The tortillas are what really make the tacos. According to the owner, they import them directly from Mexico twice a week!

Don't forget the salsa bar and make sure to add some lime and green guac sauce with your favorite salsa to your tacos- the runny guac mixed with the lime and salsa will create an explosion of flavor in your mouth. 

Paying at the end is a great convenience especially for a larger party or with new guests as you may not know how much you'll like these tacos until you take your first bite and you'll keep asking for more!
