I've had a lot of fish tacos, and the Crispy Fish taco topped the chart.

Recommended: Order 2 crispy fish tacos, one Standard taco, and get your free side order of cucumber orange salad.

Atmosphere: 9/10 (good music, out doors, lights)
Food: 9/10 (crispy fish and standard taco)
Price: 6/10 (little pricey for what you get)
Service: 9/10 (they have text alerts for seating!)

Good stuff, definitely worth going to.
