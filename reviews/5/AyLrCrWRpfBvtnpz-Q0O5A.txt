Juilo's is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. Does not have the best or largest dining area but we can usually find a place outside on the patio. Food is always delicious and portions are large and plentiful especially for the price. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for some good cheap Mexican.
