Run don't walk to this hidden gem on E. Charleston. We were in the mood for seafood and found this place on the recommendations of other yelpers. The owner's son ( so sorry I forgot his name) welcomed us warmly and led us to our seats. 

We let him know we are New Yorkers but now call Vegas home and love the independent mom and pop restaurants. He told us to close the menu and let him create a meal  based on what seafood we like. We started with the free salsa and chips that were better than any I have ever tasted with a powerful pepper Kick! 
I chose the ceviche topped on a corn tortilla while the hubby had loaded fresh oysters topped with ceviche. The taste was so fresh and amazing; my hubby was in heaven! The shrimp empanadas were stuffed with shrimp with a delicate thin dough. Perfect! 

For the main entree I chose the half pineapple loaded with seafood and cheese. Euphoria! I loved every bite. Will order this again. Hubby had the whole red snapper served with rice and beans saut√© with onions and peppers. The spice was up there but he pulled through like a trooper! 

We are already planning our next trip and can't wait to bring friends that appreciate authentic Mexican seafood. Can't wait to return!
