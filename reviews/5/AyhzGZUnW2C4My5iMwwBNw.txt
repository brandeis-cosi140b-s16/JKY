After reading the reviews we decided to give this place a shot because we were over the options the strip gave us. This place was delicious AND I would come again when in Vegas. Not walking distance from the strip but it's worth it considering the prices and the quality of the food!! Can't go wrong with anything you order but the freshly made table side guacamole is a must! Our server Tiffany made this first experience even better! I give El Dorado five stars for the quality of food and exceptional customer service provided by Tiffany.
