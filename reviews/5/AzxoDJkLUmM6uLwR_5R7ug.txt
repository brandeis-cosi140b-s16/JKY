Think you can't find fresh seafood this side of the Mexican border? Think again! This place has the best ceviche dishes in Arizona. Fresh oysters, octopus, crab meat... Anything you would want to order in Rocky Pointe, you can get right here. 

Complimentary chips and salsa never ends. Ice cold water, soda, beer, and margaritas to quench your thirst on the hottest of lunch breaks. No less than eight authentic hot sauces, ranging from mild to EXTREME, right there on the tab. 

Service is always smiling, even when the little dining area has a wait ten parties deep. As a little blonde gringa, I usually feel self conscious about my obvious lack of Spanish language knowledge. Here, I don't feel embarrassed my poor Spanish or by using the English words. The waiters are always polite and helpful. 

Not to mention, this place gives you plenty of bang for your buck. I dare you to try finishing their large Seven Seas cocktail!
