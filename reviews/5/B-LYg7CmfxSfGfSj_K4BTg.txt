I drive by CCS every time I go to church and haven't paid much mind. One night we decided to finally stop in.... OMG! Amazing! It's very laid back... I didn't really goto Chuys a lot but, let me tell you CCs is where it's at this is a true Phoenix Mom and Pop GEM! I love the salsa bar and how I can keep getting up for more chips or salsa and they are very kid friendly.. The strawberry lemonade was to DIE FOR... The food is GREATLY Priced. I can not wait to go back.. Seriously they are sooooooooo much cheaper than rubios and other competitors! I love CCs! The staff was so personable and nice!!!
