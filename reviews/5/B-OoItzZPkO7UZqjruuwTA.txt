Pedro's is in the neighborhood so we go here quite often. The food is great, but could benefit from adding some low-cal, heart-healthy and vegetarian dishes. It's quite noisy between the music, the kids and the patrons. I usually wear ear plugs. The wait staff is efficient and very friendly as is the management. It's almost always busy and there are quite often coupons available if you keep your eye out for them. Bring a sweater and knee socks in case you get a booth by the window. As far as an 'authentic' Mexican experience, I suggest you got to Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill in Chicago. Pedro's is about food and friends and fun. I have never seen anything dirty here and have never sent anything back. They have a busy fish fry on Fridays and it's all fried. Baked fish is available. The margaritas taste great. I used to live in Texas and there is nothing sub-standard about Pedro's food. You can make a meal out of the 'Table-side Guacamole'. They have a separate bar, TV room and patio. Basic nachos are available in the bar for most happy hours (?) and drink specials are available if you go on those days. They have half-priced appetizers in the bar but you'll have to call to find out when. We almost always eat in the restaurant. Great place to meet up with friends from work. Never had to wait too long for a table.
