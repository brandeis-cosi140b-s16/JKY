Hands down best frybread I ever had! It was cooked to perfection but they also have a ton of other options to choose from like menudo on weekends, posole, chimichangas, burritos, and it's also a candy store at the register. The customer service here is what most impressed me though. It seems to be a family run place and the kids were SO respectful and hardworking (you never find that anywhere anymore) and the guy who took my order was kind as well. The setting was Adorable with real flowers as center pieces on every table. Great place, it just became my  favorite place in Arizona. Can't wait to go back!
