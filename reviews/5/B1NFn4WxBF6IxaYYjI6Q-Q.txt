Las Lupitas follows the 3 "B"s that we always look for in Spanish: Bueno, Bonito, y Barato. Translation: "Good, Pretty (In this case appealing to the eye), and cheap!"

These are some of the best tacos you'll have in Charlotte, but all food is to go. Order 1 lb. of meat, either the Carnitas or Barbacoa, 1 lb. of Fresh Cheese, and 1 lb. of tortillas. The tortillas are practically free, $1/lb, and you can see the ladies making them from scratch in the back. When I went they had 3 sauces for sale at the register and I bought the 2 spiciest ones, the spiciest one was way to spicy for my taste and I love spice. 

This is a great spot to hit up before a picnic or before having people over for "make your own taco" night. Best deal in town!

I am not sure if they speak English or not, but since everything is out for you to see it would be very easy to order by pointing, please do not be intimidated, everyone who works there is SUPER nice. If you need a translator, I translate for tacos!
