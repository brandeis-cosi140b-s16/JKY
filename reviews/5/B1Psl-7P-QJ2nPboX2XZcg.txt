Having heard positive things about Braddah's since it opened I, of course, bought the Groupon to check it out.  It was about 7 p.m. and there was one other customer in front of me already checking out.  As soon as I entered I was greeted with a welcome and had I ever been there before.  When I said no, he said let me get you a couple of samples.  I tried the Huli Huli chicken and the Kalua pig.   Admittedly, I am not an expert on anything Hawaiian but as soon as I tasted the Kalua pig I was hooked.  

Their menu is very easy to read as far as the steps to create your burrito, bowl, salad or taco, meat choices,  extras, etc.  I ordered two of of bowls with the seaweed brown rice.  For the tacos I took the suggestion of the waitress and did a combo of the steak, chicken and Kalua pig.  They also provide sauces.  The pink one I found pretty spicy and a coconut one is on the sweet side.  I also ordered chips and guacamole and I couldn't resist trying the coconut bark.  If nothing else make sure and order that!  Sweet, crunchy, deliciousness!  They also provide sauces.  I thought the prices were very fair for portions.
