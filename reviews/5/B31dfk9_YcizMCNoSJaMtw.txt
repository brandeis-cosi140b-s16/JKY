From the outside this place looks like (and may be) a reclaimed fast food joint.  But on the inside, it seem like you're in Mexico! The menu is not entirely unique, but everything seems fresh and home made.  The tortas are exquisite, and the cheese and potato soup and albondigas are my favorite in town.  Add to this a friendly staff (mostly family) and wonderful freshly made sangria and other mixed drinks, and you can't go wrong.  Beer is served with iced mugs,and chips and salsa, both homemade, are plentiful.
