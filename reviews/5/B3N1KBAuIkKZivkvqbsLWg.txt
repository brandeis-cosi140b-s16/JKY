This is my jam! The food is delicious and fresh. The service is prompt and friendly. Every time we arrive in Vegas (usually Mandalay Bay) we stop in for nachos to share with meat of your choice. The FRESH jalape√±os are beyond delish with queso fundido. So yum! It's not a cheap place, but a great choice for some bar snacks and BULLDOG or a yummy lunch for a big day at the tables. My waitress even remembered me from my last visit! If they have the green pozole... Do not pass it up. BEYOND DELICIOUS. My compliments to the chef!
