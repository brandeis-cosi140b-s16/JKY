The salsas, everyone of them, are amazing! Check out the Salsa Verde and Habanero, both excellent and all are made in house. Love that they have a taco dinner with 4 different tacos, what better way to try them all (chicken, beef, pork and fish)! The staff are all great and super friendly.  My husband and I love this new gem we found. Great food and great service! Highly recommend! They may have been out of Tito's tonight, but they normally have it. Strongbow in a bottle, only thing better would he if it was in tap! Not many places have Strongbow!
