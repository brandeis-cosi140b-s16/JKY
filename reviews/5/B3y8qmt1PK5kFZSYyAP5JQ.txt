Such a fun place. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. So super glad that we did. This place was one of our most favorite in Phoenix.  Super friendly staff, awesome food, amazing atmosphere. Mimosas were great and the Bloody Mary came with a sidecar. What could be better? We had a great time and the portions were huge and delicious.  Highly recommended.
