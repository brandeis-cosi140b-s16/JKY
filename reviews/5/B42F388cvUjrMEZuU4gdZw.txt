I thought this place was delicious. I ordered a guarache. i wished I had ordered different  meat = instead of the carne asada. I'd def.order the guarache again! My bf ordered 3 gorditas. oh my goodness. each one better than the next. He had chicken in mole, and 2 others that i cant remember but we really wanted to order the nopales one but we were too full to even try it.
