My wife and I are from southern California, so we need our Mexican food fix on a regular basis. Fonda is very authentic, not to mention extremely tasty. I had the 3 gorditas with lengua, al pastor and barbacoa, i also ordered an asada taco on the side (this was my test, the taco tells all when it comes to authenticity). The asada was fantastic and their tortillas are made fresh and taste delicious. the way they cook and season their meats is fantastic and can rival any taco truck in Los Angeles. My wife had the enchiladas rancheras which also delivered with really great taste and seasoning. Highly recommend.
