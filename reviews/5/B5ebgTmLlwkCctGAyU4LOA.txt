I really enjoy making the drive out here from Mesa. When I have out of town visitors and after I couple of days they get tired of the seeing desert-khaki hell we call home I drive them out to show that we have some nice views. Tortilla Flats is a stop along the Apache Trail and basically just four buildings: a store that has some touristy items, turquoise jewelry, purses, and also sells the Tonto Pass for those going back to the lake. The bar is nice - I had pancakes there one morning and they were huge. The general store has a good selection of ice cream. I had the prickly pear and a bottle of sarsaparilla. The final building is the small museum. In the past I never had cell reception, but my most recent trip I was able to pick it up. It is a short drive from Mesa but a completely different landscape along the way. Everyone I have brought from out of town was surprised to see the lake, the beautiful cacti, and the nice rocky landscape.
