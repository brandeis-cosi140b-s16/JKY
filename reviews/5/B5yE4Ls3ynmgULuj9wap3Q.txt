Every time I visit Las Vegas I cannot come back home (California) without going Lindo Michoacán and have dinner. I have been coming to this place for 9 years. One of the thing I like about this place is when they sit you down they bring the tortilla chips; they make their own, with salsa and refried beans to complement that try their Fresh Guacamole Dip. They prepare the dip in front of you.  Another thing I like is they bring you sopa de fideo (Noodle soup); they make their own, before they bring your main entrée. No other Mexican restaurant that I been to do that.  They also make flour or corn tortillas by hand. They have variety Mexican plates. The dishes have very good portion of food. They also have great desserts.
When you come to this place read the history of Lindo Michoacán on their menu. Lindo Michoacán has interesting history. I highly recommended, check it out. You won't be disappointed.
