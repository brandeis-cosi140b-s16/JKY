First time actually coming to this restaurant and I have to say it was awesome! 
The food was wonderful and (most) of the people working there were very helpful and friendly! 

I came in with a few buddies for dinner one night, and I wasn't disappointed. Our server was Haley I believe, adorable little red head that was so bubbly and upbeat I'd come back just for that simple fact. She continually kept us in conversation we loved getting her mad about hockey!  She recommended her favorite drinks and told us all of their happy hour prices, and after telling her we liked IPA beers she immediately came back with two samples for us to try out. 
Being unfamiliar with the menu she quickly suggested the crunchy pork tacos and even said if we didn't like them the meal was on her! Needless to say we loved every bit of it! 

Went outside to smoke a couple times and one of the bartenders was just as nice as our server! I don't believe I know her name (also a red head) but it seemed like she really knew what she was doing! Along with a male bartender assisting her. They both talked the heads off the people sitting at the bar and seemed to have real personal connections with everyone there.

All in all I loved this place, I'll be back and bringing friends just on the service alone! It all seemed so friendly, and everyone knew everyone our server stopped at almost every table to talk or ask about their food. 
Only thing I will say is that their were a couple people that we're working that seemed to have attitude problems, one of the girls that brought us our food seemed to be quite rude, and she was glued to her phone, also don't know her name. But she looked like she was balding on one side? 

The reviews on this place are way too harsh for what it actually is! I loved the bar all together and I'm giving it a 100% 5 star rating!
