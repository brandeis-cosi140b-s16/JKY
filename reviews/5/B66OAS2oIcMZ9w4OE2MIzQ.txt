Not only is the food delicious and fresh, but the service was awesome! Servings were very plentiful. The queso was a little too spicy for me but was so good that I couldn't help but eat it! Our waitress was attentive, helpful, and very nice! We would definitely visit this place again. Business seemed slow for a Friday night - not sure why when the food was so great!
