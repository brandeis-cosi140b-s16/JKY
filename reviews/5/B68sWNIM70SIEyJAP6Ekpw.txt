The food is amazing, service is great and the drinks are phenomenal.  Most of the servers are inked which I love and the atmosphere is perfect.  My wife and I have been here every day during our short trip and wish we could bring this place with us when we go back to Chicago.   At least 3 meals a day here, I've had half the menu and nothing but great food.  My hats off to the cooks and everyone there and thank you for saving us from buffet misery.
