My favorite place for a hearty breakfast and memories of home (Though I've lived a lot of places, I claim New Mexico). There is NOTHING like good chile and it's near impossible to find after crossing the NM state line. The adovada and the shrimp enchiladas here meet the challenge!  ...So do the huevos rancheros. 

Heck! 

You really can't go wrong! (And,  YAY for $5 mimosas!)

And for dinner, my favorite is the pork tenderloin, moist and sweet, basted with a green and red chili jelly and the "famous" GCP (a chile stuffed with cheesy mashed potatoes and baked).

As much as I like the hip Dick's Hideaway location, I'm grateful for a greater shot at a table and the "new" Richardson's location just a smidge up the street.
