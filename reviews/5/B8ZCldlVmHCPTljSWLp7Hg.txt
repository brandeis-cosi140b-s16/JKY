This is the place late night stop on the Strip. The prices are low 2 dollars per taco and 4 dollars for the specialty items such as the mulas (amazing) and the vampiro. I highly recommend the spicy pork which the cut off of the skewer right in front of you as you order.

I asked the person preparing the food what makes these tacos authentic? his answer "no sour cream and The Sauce"  and he was right about the sauce it took the taco to a whole other level.

You must try it #foodcrew
