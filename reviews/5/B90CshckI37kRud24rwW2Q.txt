I've been frequenting this EASTCYDE eatery every since my eyes gandered at its' Yelp review.  Add another diamond in the rough. 

My usual is a double cheese boyger w/ fries and a 500 ml bottled Coke.  I changed it up with this past order. I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak.  Adding the Philly Cheese Steak to my favorites. The steak is grilled perfectly and has the right amount of makings for a solid-well-made cheese steak. I'm also a fan of their Buns which are delivered bakery fresh daily. Fat steak fries combos nicely with whatever you're stuffing your face with...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!! 

Great service: 
Today I ordered a fairly big order for pick-up. The homie did that order quick style! It took me less than 15 minutes to get there from work, and my order was ready to go. Great service yallz!

Solid food Fat Boy!!! I'm glad there is another great eatery coming out of the EASTCYDE. Will continue the support.
