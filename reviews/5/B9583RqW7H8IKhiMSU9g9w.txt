If you were a fan of Viva Michoacan on Sunset, you're probably still crying about its close.  Well, dry those tears!  This place has recipes that are similar, if not the same, as Viva!  The soup, tortillas, and dishes like Shrimp Dionisia and Chicken Zirahuen are to die for.  And the service!  Our waiter was so nice - you truly feel welcome there.  And if that wasn't enough, there was a man playing music, too!  Excellent Mexican food, excellent service, and prices way better than the Lindo in GVR.  We will drive out of our way to Bonita whenever we want the best.  PS- Football fans - there are TVs everywhere!
