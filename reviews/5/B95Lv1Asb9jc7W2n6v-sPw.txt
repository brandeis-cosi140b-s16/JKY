Snuck in there tonight and had some great food. It's nice finding a place that can make food spicy and tasty without compromising one or the other.  We at the whole menu, and I almost asked for a second round.  Everything was the right blend of gourmet and classic without being pretentious.  Loved it and can't wait to go back.
