Just had dinner at Mejico and was very pleased by what we had. I had the Ahi Tuna Tacos. They had the perfect balance of spice, freshness and acidity. We would definitely go back. As for the place being pricey, you have to know what you are going for. Binks is across the street and the area is very up and coming. So I'm not surprised by the little higher price tag. Was well worth it. If you have a choice between Mejico and Taco Guild, pick Mejico. We were definitely underwhelmed by Taco Guild. Cheers!
