I usually eat at the original R&T's at MC85/Litchfield, but the food here seems to be just as good.  

Hands down I think they have the best homemade red enchilada sauce in Arizona.  I won't eat enchiladas at most Mexican restaurants because it tastes like canned sauce - not so at R&T's!

My favorite dish, which I have never found anywhere else - is the Sonoran Enchiladas.  (I order with a side of pico de gallo and sliced avocado - yum!)

I agree they could offer a mild salsa (even a *medium* salsa!) because their salsa is SPICY.  Don't get me wrong - it's great salsa - but I think a good portion - maybe even half - of their customers would appreciate it.
