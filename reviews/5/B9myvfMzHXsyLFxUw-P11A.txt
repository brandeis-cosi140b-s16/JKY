There's nothing I can write that will do justice to what a great find Yo Rita is. Simply the very best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Adventuresome, contemporary, unexpected, nuanced, subtle, bold, reasonably priced, and always always always perfect.

My first 5-star rating for a Pittsburgh restaurant.
