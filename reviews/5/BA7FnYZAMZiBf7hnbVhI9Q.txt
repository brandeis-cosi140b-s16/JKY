This is the best red and green chile sauce I've had since I lived in New Mexico. The red is earthy and the green is sweet with a mild heat--pour either one over a delicious beef burrito and I'm home again. The burritos are huge--I ended up taking half home and it was enough for another meal. Pro tip: top leftovers with an over medium egg (you can thank me later). The restaurant is exceptionally clean and cozy and the owner is very attentive. It's a family favorite.
