My family's favorite!  Can't say enough about the service, everyone including the owners are so gracious, friendly and fast.  Every time we visit, we feel like family.  The food is AMAZING!  I'm very picky when it comes to mexican food and Caldero is Tops!  The portions are more than what you would expect and are beautifully presented.  My partner and I especially love the happy hour specials, the barbacoa street tacos are to die for.  

If you love true authentic mexican food at a great price you must visit Caldero - you will NOT be disapointed.
