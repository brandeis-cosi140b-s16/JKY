I eat at this location nearly every day and the other comments here about the friendliness of the staff are spot on. They are both having fun and providing excellent service. It really does make a difference! 
I found chipotle after discovering I have a gluten sensitivity. I find that I have no bad reaction to the food here even without asking for glove or utensil changes. Nothing on the menu except flour tortillas is off limits    If you are celiac you may consider asking for allergy precautions of course. Also, other locations may no be as good as this one about such issues. 
The chipotle chain like any other has weaker and stronger locations. This chipotle is absolutely tops in my book.
