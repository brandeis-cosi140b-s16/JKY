If you haven't been here then I don't know what you are doing with life. Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant? Well here it is. This place hits the spot. From the atmosphere, to the friendly waiters, and to the awesome food. My favorite food there for me would be the shrimp cocktail. No other restaurant that I've been to can beat the price and flavor. Jumbo shrimp! Around 6 dollars for a regular size. The civeche is also amazing. Around 2 bucks for 1. This is by far the best Mexican restaurant I've been to. I'm from California so every time I visit Arizona I always stop by. Im serious everyone check it out. You won't be disappointed!

Ignore the people leaving bad reviews. What I don't understand is that they don't understand why it has 4 stars. Obviously because people love it. Common sense! :)
