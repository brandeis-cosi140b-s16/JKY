My chips weren't stale at all.  And the salsa was great.
They smiled very happily through my fathers very, very broken spanish and responded with sweet things he didn't remotely understand.  
The service was quick and courteous - not in a lingering, fake-friendly way, which I appreciate.  They had a lot of fresh veggie and grilled items not typically found on your run of the mill mexican menu.  My food was well done and everyone I was with was happy as well - even my parents who can be picky.  Will absolutely go back.
