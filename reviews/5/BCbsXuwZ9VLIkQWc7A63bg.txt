Love supporting and finding new restaurants in my Sunnyslope neighborhood.  We  have ordered burritos and quesadillas with the pork and beef and they were delicious and they are made to order.....anyway you like! The owner is a hardworking Mom bringing the area great Mexican food....just like Momma's...step away from the fast foods and come support this great new little shop....I guarantee you love it and will come back for more...
