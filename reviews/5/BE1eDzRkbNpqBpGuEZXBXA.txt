Could live on chips and salsa...if they were all as good at The Spotted Donkey!
2 visits in 2 days. 
My friends swore by the signature nachos and didn't even share!
Great salads, for those of us who overdosed on Blood Orange Margaritas and chips/salsa.

Fantastic service from Melissa - outstanding - friendly, efficient and with a smile.
Worth the visit.

Cold Victoria draft (from Mexico) and delicious margaritas.
Designated driver.
Enjoy the outdoor patio if at all possible.
Had to fly back to cold snowy Washington DC the next day. Sad!
