Best Mexican Mariscos  in AZ!! Not only does the food taste good but they are clean too!!! I only eat at places that are issued a clean bill of health and this is one of them unlike the others out there. The food, WOW! If you want to feel like your sitting in front of the Sea of Cortez without actually going you come here... Coconut shrimp cocktail as good as it gets.... I have been going here for the past 7 years and will keep going back... Almost everything is great... I would skip the French Fries on the dishes since they are not so good and i don't expect them to be at a Mexican seafood place.
