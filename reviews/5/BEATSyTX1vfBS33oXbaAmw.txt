I came here based on my co-worker's recommendation for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. The restaurant was not too hard to find and there was plenty of parking when we arrived. Friend of mine ordered 2 beef tacos and 2 chicken tacos and I ordered a chicken taco and the chicken torta. Overall we preferred the chicken tacos over the beef tacos and the chicken torta that I ordered was extremely tasty. We would even go as far to say that these were some of the best tacos that we ever had and both of us have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants in the past.

If I ever make my way back over here I would like to try either the quarter or half chicken as that seems to be a solid choice based on the pictures here. I'm not sure if this is the best Mexican food in the area or not given that there are so many options available but either way this place is really good and definitely worth a try!
