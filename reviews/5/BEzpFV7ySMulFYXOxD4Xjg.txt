Chinese food, Mexican food, and Jose Andres. Three of my favorite things in the entire world. Combine them all together and it creates this harmonious bliss of magnificent food and dining.

I am so sad that we only came here for lunch so I only was able to sample a few items. Thankfully, Vegas is only 5 hours away from San Diego and I will be sure to  eat at China Poblano the next time I visit!

Firstly, I just love the ambiance of Jose Andres' restaurants. They are worldly, fun and adult at the same time. Between courses I was entertained by watching the pictures on the wall change from Chinese and South American peasants to Mao Zedung.

The margaritas we ordered were spectacular. While I was tempted to order the margarita with the salt air (to brag about the pretentious "salt air" LOL) I went with the blood orange chile pequin margarita. It was balanced, but SUPER strong. One was enough to start my Vegas party blood pumping!

My friends and I ordered a variety of tacos, which were all fantastic. I am a sucker for carnitas. While I have no shortage of those tacos in San Diego, none of them are topped with chicarrones like the ones at China Poblano! It added the perfect crunch to the perfectly cooked and tender pork. The carnitas weren't overly salty as they can be at other restaurants.

We split the Dan Dan noodles that came with black vinegar (oh black vinegar, how I love thee) and were so delicious. The guacamole was rich and flavorful. I love that it was served with tortillas and not just chips. 

My favorite dish was the Siu Mai with quail egg. I have grown up eating Siu Mai - it is among my top favorite dim sum dishes...holy crap China Poblano's Siu Mai was amazing! The quail egg on top was so perfect (see my picture). The yolk was runny and gave the already delectable Siu Mai flavors an extra kick. 

China Poblano, I will be back!
