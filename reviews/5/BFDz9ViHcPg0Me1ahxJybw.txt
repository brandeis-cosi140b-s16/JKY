Tried this place again and it is still amazing - that guacamole is just the best we've had.  Our server (I believe his name was Spencer) was great, very attentive, came back to the table often to check on us.  I had the chicken tacos and they were very delicious.  My margarita was excellent.  Hubby had the barbacoa tacos again and said they were awesome.  Still our favorite place in Scottsdale.  We had thought about going someplace else for a change, but as we were eating he said "why did we even think of going anywhere else?"  This is where we will bring friends when they visit.
