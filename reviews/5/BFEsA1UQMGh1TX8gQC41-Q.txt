A former co-worker recommended this place last time I was in the area and now I drive 30+ minutes from Steele Creek to get their burritos.  Hands down the best burritos I have ever eaten, especially for this town.  Owner is extremely friendly and always makes sure we are enjoying our food.  Very affordable, with a $4.99 special every day, and $0.99 taco Tuesday.  I recommend the Cali chicken curry burrito, AMAZING!  This place puts Moe's and Chipotle to shame, they don't even hold a candle to one of these burritos.  I honestly don't know if I'll ever be able to eat another burrito from one of those chains again because it just won't compare and it'll be more expensive.
