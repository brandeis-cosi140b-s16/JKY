When I give a review based on stars it is for the cost of the meal. So, where the average meal is something like ten to fifteen dollars (as it is here) it might get less stars if the cost was say twenty or fifty dollars a meal. That being said, for the price this is simply the best mexican restaurant in the east valley. I haven't had anything here (and I've eaten here dozens of times) that isn't top notch. chips and salsa, buritos,enchiladdas, chimmies, you name it, it is all really good. If the price was twice as high I'd still give it four stars, service is great too.
