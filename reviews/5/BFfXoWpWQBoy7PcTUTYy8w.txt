Everyone thinks im talking about the other abomination of a restaurant when I tell them about this place.  The only similarities are the menu and the name.  The food is very tasty and its super cheap on top of it.   I get the green chili burrito and its the best burrito I've had in this part of town.   For $4 you cant beat it.  They even have menudo on the weekends and the shrimp cocktail is great too.
