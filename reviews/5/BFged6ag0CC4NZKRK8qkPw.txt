As a native Californian, I have always hoped there would one day be a place I could get authentic Mexican tacos while visiting my family out in PA. Dose Taqueria has truly answered my prayers. Biting into one of these tacos instantly reminded me of the tacos I get at little family owned taco shops back in San Diego. Every ingredient, down to the Cotija cheese, is 100% authentic and 100% delicious. 

Doce Taqueria perfectly captured a flavor that you usually can only get in Mexicali.

Chef Alex has truly brought a price of the southwest to Pittsburgh.
