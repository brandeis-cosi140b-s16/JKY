Great location and great food! I ordered the gumbo bowl, which is delicious. Their chicken and pulled pork are probably the best meats. The portion sizes are very good too for the price. They have 3 different kinds of Queso, the Pico is always fresh, and there are a slew of varying sauces to put on your tacos, burritos, and on the bowls. The manager is really outgoing and so are the employees, and they give UNCC students discounts too. 

BIG PRO: They don't charge EXTRA for Queso, Guacamole, and veggies!!! FREE. I just about fell over when they told me this, started recently after 1/1/15

I found this Qdoba better then Moes and Chipotle- which doesn't even offer queso because of "preservatives", like what kind of Mexican-America restaurant doesn't offer queso? They don't play cliche spanish music either. Good place.
