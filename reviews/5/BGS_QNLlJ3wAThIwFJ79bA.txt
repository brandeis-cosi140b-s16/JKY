Just discovered their taco stand outside a few weeks ago.  WOOHOO!  Like the stuff on the inside, they charge just a bit too much (street tacos should be $2 max, not their $3/2 for $5), but they're excellent.  They even have lengua (tongue - tasty).  I haven't seen that since Buford Highway in Atlanta.  Probably not the best if you're from San Antonio or San Diego, but the best you'll find within 200 miles.
