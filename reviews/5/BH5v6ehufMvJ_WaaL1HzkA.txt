We go to Carlitos at least once a month for New Mexican food. The stuffed sopapillas are my favorite, and my boyfriend always gets a Carlitos Burrito (double meat) smothered in red chile. I always order a sopapilla on the side so I can eat it with honey at the end of the meal. The only thing I have had here that I think could use some improvement is their calabacitas. I would love to see them add fideo to the menu at some point too.
