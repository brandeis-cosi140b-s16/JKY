We ate here for dinner last night and I have to say seriously delicious.  This was our 4th time eating here and my whole family loves it.  What I like the best is that everything is so fresh.  I try to eat as healthfully as possible, and I am never disappointed by the fresh food at Americas Taco Shop.   I love all the different meats, and also LOVE the guacamole that you can order with chips.  We will definitely be back.
