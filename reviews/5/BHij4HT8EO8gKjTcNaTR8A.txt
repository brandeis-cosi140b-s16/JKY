I have been to this place 3 times. It's a must visit every time I'm in Vegas. They have improved the patio area to include trees that provide a nice shade for visitors. The service was great and the food even better. The coco loco is my ultimate favorite and this is the only place that I know that sales it. The coco loco deal includes the coconut water, the coco skin, and a shrimp cocktail.  We were in a hurry, yesterday, Labor Day holiday because we had to drop someone off at the airport. The waitress made our orders come out fast and she was so nice about it. Another gentlemen packed our left overs in ice to keep it cool.
