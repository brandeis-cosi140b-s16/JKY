One of the best finds in vegas, hands down.  Absolutely my new favorite place anywhere.  Fusion tacos? Just over a buck.  Giant portion of bulgogi nachos (best thing I've ever put in my mouth)  6 bucks!

I literally cant wait to be hungry again so I can go back.  Hands down amazing, great staff.  I always get food  to go, but the service has been great.  As someone who prides themself in seeking these places out, this is one of my top three finds ever.  Dont hesitate, try it out!
