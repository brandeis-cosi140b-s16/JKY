This is one of the top two places I've had the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.  The food is authentic and the delicious EVERY time I have dined here. The staff is extremely helpful and pleasant on a consistent basis.  Occasionally they have a Groupon but it's rare. 

PROS: Steak Cilantro 
             Chili Relleno
             Steak Fajitas
             Lengua Tacos
             Pollo al mojo de ajo  

I haven't had a bad experience yet and I've been here a few times. It's great for meeting friends for lunch or dinner. There is something on the menu for everyone.
