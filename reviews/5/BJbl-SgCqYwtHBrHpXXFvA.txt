Wow! Came here based on the Yelp reviews and this place did not disappoint! It is like the Hawaiian Chipotle. The girl at the front was friendly and offered to let us sample the meats before we ordered. The pork and chicken is tender and juicy. I ordered 4 tacos each with different meats. 1 pork, 1 steak, 1 chicken, 1 fish. They used the recommended salsas which were all great. My wife had a salad and it was loaded with meat and goodies. If you go...YOU HAVE TO TRY THE COCONUT BARK! It is the perfect combo of sweet and salty.
