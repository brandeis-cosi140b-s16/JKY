Great service and beautiful ambiance. The New York New York hotel has a beautiful theme to aid in your eating experience. 

The servers were friendly and even took our pictures for us (not for money) and the food was generous portions (tacos came with 3 tacos and rice and beans).

A bit pricey but overall great experience and the hostess is really down to earth and chill.
