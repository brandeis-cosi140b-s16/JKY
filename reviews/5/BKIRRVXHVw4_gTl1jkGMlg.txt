I can't say enough good things about Garnacha's. I'm used to great Mexican food & have been in Vegas for just about 3 years now. I've been to many places here & have finally found the best in town. Their street tacos are amazing & today I had a carnitas torta (BEST I'VE EVER HAD). They have a fresh salsa & chips bar with at least 5 different home made salsas, they too are extremely tasty. It's hard to pick which one you like better. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is in search of GREAT Mexican food.
