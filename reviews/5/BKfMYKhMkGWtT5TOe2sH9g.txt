Love this place so much! My wife and I eat here every time we go to Vegas! 
Majority of the staff is a delight (with the exception of one of the female hostess)

The waiters are great! The drinks are amazing and the food is too damn good!
The price is reasonable especially for the quality you get. 

I have tried almost every margarita they have there and you can't go wrong with any of them. The PB and J one is one of my favorites there. Try the BBQ pork quesadilla! You will not be disappointed! 5/5 for sure
