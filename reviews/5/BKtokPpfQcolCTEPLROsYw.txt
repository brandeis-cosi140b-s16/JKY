Having lived in Texas for 20 years, and AZ for 10, I have eaten in a lot of Mexican Food Restaurants. My wife and I went to Rita's tonight and I can honestly say that this is the best Mexican Food place I have eaten in in a very very long time.

The Food was excellent (Rocky Point style), the Service was really really good. The salsa is to die for. I ate more chips and salsa than I should have, but it was so so good. I learned that the woman who makes this salsa, has not shared the recipe with ANYONE. It is that good.

First things first, we were greeted with what I thought was your basic typical red salsa and chips. Wrong! The chips were typical but the red salsa was definitely not! Things were great so far. But things got a lot better.

Then we had the Toritos Appetizer: Yellow peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon with a really tasty sauce. Oh my, what amazing taste!

My wife had a beautiful dish named Parrillada del Rancho. The food tasted great, but it came in a Tericotta serving dish. I have never ever seen anything like it before. It added something to the meal that is beyond belief.

I usually come to a mexican restaurant with my pre-conceived notion of what I like. Well I like what I like, and have for a long time. But tonight I decided to get something a little different - I got the Camarones cobijados (Shrimp in a Blanket). Strimp stuffed with crab meat and wrapped in bacon. Yes, as Emeril says pork fat rules. I love bacon. This was really a good call on my part. It was great.

Our waitress was very helpful, she was prompt, she refilled my water glass several times without my asking. Just a great evening. And the best part? I only live about 20 minutes away, and I didn't even know this place existed. Well I do NOW.

All in all, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5.

We will definitely be back.
