You're not going to be disappointed at Distrito that's for sure. From the margaritas made with premium tequilas and fresh squeezed juices to the flavorful meats, tacos, and ceviches, this place is a must go to for Mexican Food. Being a native to AZ, I'm super picky about where I'll good Mexican food, and Distrito hits a home run in my opinion. I also love the decor. It's kitschy and classy. It's such a fun restaurant. I'm getting hungry writing this review.
