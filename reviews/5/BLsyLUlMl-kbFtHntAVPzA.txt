I love going to Diablos for Happy Hour! I'm a big fan of Mexican food so Diablos is one of my favorite go to Mexican Restaurants. As a local, I'm more of the type of person to stop in for a quick appetizer and a pitcher of beer or two with some of my other nightlife industry friends. The staff has always been extremely accommodating and the atmosphere is perfect for watching sports or just catching up with friends. I highly recommend it... It's one of my favorite bars inside a casino :)
