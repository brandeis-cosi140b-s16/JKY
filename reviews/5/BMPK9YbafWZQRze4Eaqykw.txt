I have been to many mexican food places and this is quite far the best. The owner strives to make his food as authentic as it can get and I praise him for that. The ambience is the room is comforting, there's always music playing for guests seated at tables, lots of space, friendly customer service, fair prices, and quick service. You can literally close your eyes and randomly choose an item off the menu and you will not be disappointed. I had the privilege to taste the shrimp tacos which were delicious, the quesadilla's which were bomb, and their carne asada burrito's which is the best I have ever sampled, also their horchata's are great. I know carne asada fries isn't real Mexican food but man I wish they had it on the menu, I could only imagine how tasty El Rico's can make it and did I mention their sauce is perfect? I will definitely return when ever I am in Arizona.
