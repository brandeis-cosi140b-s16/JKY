This place is great!

They have this salsa that is heaven in your mouth.  Strange orange color but oh so good!  Tacos were very good and they have a good topping selection.

I can't say enough about the great service.  The owner greeted us when we walked in and checked on us during our meal.  I really hope this place succeeds.  They have a good thing going.
