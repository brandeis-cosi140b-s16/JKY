AMAZING Mexican food. Awesome service. We always asked for the same server each time. I'm so bummed that she left!

The guacamole, fajitas, margaritas and burritos are ALL incredibly tasty and packed with flavor. It's on the pricier side of Mexican food, but I feel like we paid a fair price. They have a prickly pear margarita that you HAVE to try!
