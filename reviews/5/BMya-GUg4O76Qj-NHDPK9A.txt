Perfect place for date night!  We received a coupon in the mail, buy 1 entree get 1 free up to $11. It's a little far from our house but we decided to give it a shot.  We were very pleased.  It was a Wednesday night, which is Family Night. It was very busy but we were sat immediately because we wanted to sit outside on the patio.  The patio is PRETTY AWESOME! It looks out onto a precious, good sized pond which makes for a tranquil setting.  To make the experience even better there are ducks waddling around making you smile.  Service was a tiny bit slow but they were busy and I've been a server before so I know what's up!  Our server was awesome! He was sweet, informative,  positive and laid back.  We didn't mind at all about the lax and longer wait times because the atmosphere rocked and we were having a great time.  The food was great! We had the trio dips for an appitizer. The guacamole,  chorizo con queso and the cream cheese jalapeño.  The Cream Cheese Jalapeño is delicious as well as the guacamole.  I wasn't a huge fan of the Chorizo Con Queso but I had never had that kind of dip before. My man said it wasn't the best he'd ever had but still good. We had the chicken and steak fajitas and the fundido!  Both delicious! The Fundido was definitely worth it!  I also had a Cadillac Margarita.  It's tradition for me to get a Margarita on the rocks with salt and a shot on the side due to the margaritas not being strong enough. I want to taste the tequila and I'm a Lil bit of an alchy.  Anyway....I got a Margarita with 1800 Silver and a Grand Marnier floater with a shot of 1800 on the side.  The Margarita was so strong that I didn't even need the extra shot! Impressive!  We love the place! Definitely worth the drive and we will be back soon!
