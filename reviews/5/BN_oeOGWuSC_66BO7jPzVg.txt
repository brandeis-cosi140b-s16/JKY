Dined here for the first time with my grandpa and dad food was excellent i ordered the carne asada probably was one of the best i ever had my grandpa and dad had combination plates they liked those as well fairly inexpensive meals most entrees 10-13$ good portions service was a little slow but on a friday night hard not to expect that will definitely return
