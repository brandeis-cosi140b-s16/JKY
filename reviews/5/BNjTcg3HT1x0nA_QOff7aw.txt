Finally went to this place after driving by it dozens, if not hundreds of times and first thing I found is it looks so much nicer on the inside. Plenty of room inside and outside and the food is just absolutely amazing and top notch. I dream about it haha. Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life, and is pretty easy on the wallet considering how good it is (it's not dirt cheap but it's not expensive either, and I'm usually pretty stingy). Quality food and quality atmosphere. It's just fun, and nice and delicious and the servers are very professional and good at what they do. It's like it's solid and understated, but definitely a fun experience. Easiest 5 stars I ever gave in my life. You need to go to this place!
