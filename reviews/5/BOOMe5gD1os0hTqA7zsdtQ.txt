I would like to give this 4 1/2 stars, not quite a 5, but really some of the best food we have had in AZ.  The food was spicy and well flavored.  The ingredients very high quality and fresh.  The guac was chopped not mashed, great texture.  There was no mashed beans or puke looking typical Mexican preparations.  Everything was lovely.  The Margaritas were the best I have had here, they do not use that revolting sweet and sour mix, instead they use agave nectar.  Service a bit wonky but we still had a great time.
