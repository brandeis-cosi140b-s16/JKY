Mad Mex is my "go to" place to eat. It could be the awesome beer list which always includes at least a couple of IPAs. 

OK, beer is a bonus, but the food is fantastic. My current favorite is the "wing-o-rito" a burrito stuffed with boneless wings with your choice of sauce. 

I love the insane southwest sauce and go off the board by changing out the chicken for shrimp. 

Tonight I used my birthday free entr√©e and got steak and shrimp in my burrito. The second half will be lunch tomorrow!
