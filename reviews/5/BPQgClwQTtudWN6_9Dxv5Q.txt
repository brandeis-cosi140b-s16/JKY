When visiting my family in Litchfield park I have to stop by Old Pueblo for their chips and salsa. The rest of their menu in a blur but that salsa will haunt me  forever. Great stuff. The carne asada was pretty good but too full on the chips and salsa to enjoy. I don't think you will regret going here.
