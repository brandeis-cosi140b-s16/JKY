I haven't lived in Pittburgh for over 15 years, but i used to eat at Mad Mex way before it was ever a chain restaurant. 

Even tho I don't live anywhere near Mad Mex, every time I visit, I must eat here.

Not only does it have literally the best food, but for a fee, you get the biggest and strongest margarita ever. Yum!

I used to go here after with my friends 11 when all food was half off. not sure if that is still the same. But what a great place!
