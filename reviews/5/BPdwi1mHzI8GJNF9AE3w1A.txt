I want to start by saying that I normally do not have time to get online and write reviews for places but I had to for this place because it was AMAZING!! 
My mom had been here a couple of times already (mind you, they haven't been open very long but they are good enough for a repeat visit within a one week time span) so she wanted us to come and check it out for our birthday! The restaurant was easy to find and the appearance was very welcoming- a very clean and modern look!  The waitor greeted us immediately and knew the menu inside and out and explained everything to us in detail- he was very knowledgable of the food and the drink choices so naturally we chose to start with Strawberry Habenero Margaritas!! YUMM! They were sweet and spicy and delicious! 
After the chef came out and greeted us and made sure that we were enjoying our drinks we chatted with him for a bit and  decided that we were going to do a tasting of the menu and try a little bit of everything. He immediately went and created a ceviche with the daily fish to start with. It was very light and refreshing and tasty- it went perfectly with our drinks! The rest of the night was just plate after plate of incredible food! We had pork belly tacos, the MOOOO, Chorizo sliders, brussel sprouts, etc. We even ended the night with two dessert choices, the Chocotorta and some kind of tres leche with bruleed peaches! Both were insanely good! I left the restaurant that evening so full and very satisfied. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and I even plan on having them cater an event I have coming up! Thanks for the great dinner and experience Chef Aaron!
