I am now changing my three star rating to a 5 star! This Taco Bell is by far the best!!! Every time we go here the order is always perfect.. Extra cheese.. No this.. Add that... It is always right!! The staff is so friendly and don't make you feel like another customer just in the drive through Alexis is my favorite there. She is friendly with my daughter and also let's her pay through the window so it makes her feel like a big girl! This Taco Bell is worth the drive if it's not the closest one to you. I have 6 other taco bells we could go too, and this is the only location I will go too!  Thank you for a making the family happy!
