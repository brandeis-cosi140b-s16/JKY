I finally decided to stop by Gordas yesterday after driving past it for almost two years now.. I'm so glad that I stopped in and grabbed some tacos! The customer service was awesome. Very friendly and helpful staff. They recommended that I tried anything with adobada, and I'm glad I chose that. I ordered two adobada tacos with rice and beans. The tacos are a little smaller, but they load them up with meat and pico de gallo. Next time I will order three tacos or maybe try one of their burritos. They also have a clean salsa bar there which was stocked with good tasting salsa and toppings such as cilantro and onions. If you are thinking about going to Gordas, do yourself a favor and get off the computer and go now. You won't be disappointed.
