I've been eating here since I was a little kid and this place never disappoints. This is not a restaurant where the waiter brings your food to your table so if that's what your looking for I don't suggest you come here. But if you want to grab a bite to eat or get your food to go, this is the spot. There's a salsa bar and there all really good. I always get either a shredded beef chimi or a Mexican pizza.
