The ambience is warm, friendly, and very inviting. The team has high energy, are very hospitable, and they are infectiously enthusiastic! The food is very fresh and prepared with the best ingredients from the best sources. My favorite is the bowl with white cilantro lime rice, pinto beans, grilled peppers & onions, grilled chicken, and medium corn salsa with a side of guacamole!
