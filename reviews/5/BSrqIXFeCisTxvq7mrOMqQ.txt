The legendary Sonoran Dog is something you can't resist!! The menu is pretty simple and delicious. Tacos, tortas, caramelos, burros and quesadillas along with a traditional condiment bar.
It isn't Taco Bell or some fancy restaurant you might be used to, but it's as authentic as you get. The prices are excellent and the staff is really courteous. You'll see El GÃ¼ero walking around making sure everything is in excellent order.
This is a place that you'll definitely come back to!!!
