This place is amazing, possibly my favorite place for tacos in all of Charlotte.

The meats are delicious and decently priced (a pound of Barbacoa and carnitas are about 6 bucks a pound, and they're already cooked and hot). Queso fresco is delicious and the tortillas are hand made and amazing (like $1.50 a pound!)

Don't be intimidated by the language barrier, the manager/owner was very friendly and helped us out greatly. Also the salsas they sell up front are amazing.
