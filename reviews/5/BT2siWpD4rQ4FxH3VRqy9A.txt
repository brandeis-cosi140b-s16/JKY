I had a small anniversary party here recently and the chef paco hooked it up! He helped me arrange some decorations and we had an awesome time celebrating our anniversary at our favorite restaurant in vegas. I always recommend this place ti all my friends and family when they visit vegas. Its good to see that the restaurant is alot more packed for being relatively new.
