Maybe it is ridiculous, but to me Chipotle is another example of people completely missing the point.  You can not consistently get a better meal for under $7.  In my life I have probably eaten at Chipotle a little over 100 times at locations across four states.  Consistently, the ingredients are fresh, the service is friendly and the price is almost unfathomably fair.  If you think Chipotle is only burritos, you are missing the point.  If they are not busy, order soft tacos.  You get three, ask for three different meats.  Mix it up, all four are delicious, while I do tend to favor their free-range carnitas and the chicken.  Move on to salsas, get at least two, I prefer the fresh tomato (aka pico de gallo) and the medium corn (aka elote). You have hereby made your meal healthy and vegetable heavy.  Especially when you finish with freshly shredded romaine lettuce.  Also justify the cheese and super fresh mexican sour cream as fulfillment of calcium rations.  If you really need to cut carbs or some lame-o thing like this, get a salad or a burrito bowl with black beans.  If you want to turn your order into two meals, stick with the burrito and load it up, or get the burrito bowl, vegetarian, load up the salsa, black beans and guacamole and add on a side of chips for .95.  Now start planning your Halloween free burrito costume.
