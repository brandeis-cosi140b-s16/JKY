I wish there was one of these in Atlanta!!Amazing food & drinks!  I had the Rico Rita (margarita made with rum) and it was awesome!!!  Then we did table side guacamole and it was fabulous!!! I loved their "chips" and salsa!  I had the street tacos (shrimp and carnitas) and they were delish.  They brought out some yummy white chocolate dessert too. 
My suggestion - sit outside & listen to the fountains!!
