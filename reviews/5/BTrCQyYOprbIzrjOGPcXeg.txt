We like the food and.great service here. Breakfast burritos are my fave! They make them with just eggs, if you like. They taste fantastic--better than Filiberto's and Nico's.

They have various Caldos here (soup, in English)--my hubby likes that. you can't find caldo at many Mexican restaurants. 

Drinks: regular American fountain drinks, and also available are Mexican drinks (including fantas and Mexican Coke!! mmmmm)

Not a lot of seating, but there's usually not very many people eating in. The guy brings your food out and comes and clears dishes if it seems to be getting too crowded, too.  *and* bonus--my 1-yr old was getting angry about something--the guy magically appeared with a Capri Sun and it quieted my boy instantly! (I didn't even see that they had Capri Suns available ;))

 It's in the plaza near Goodwill on corner of Alma School and Ray.  Give them a try if you have a hankerin' for Mexican.
