High quality cheap eats. The guys were great, friendly and interested in how we learned about the place. They've got a great and unique menu - definitely try the Brûlée burger - a great mix of salty and sweet. The seasoned fries are good - the tater tots were a little sweet but maybe would do better with a sandwich that is not sweet as well.  Glad we stopped by - will be back again!
