This is my family's "go to" Mexican food place. I love the green chile pork and my wife finds the different shrimp plates delicious. Along with some good horchata, the food here can't be beat!

I've since bumped this up to 5 stars. We come here so often I'm working my way through the menu. The red chile burro is my new comfort food. Zopes are delicious and if you want something spicy, you can't go wrong with the AZ super taco.
