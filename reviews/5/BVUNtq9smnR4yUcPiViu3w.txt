The food is great! There is a large selection of Mexican food which will be at your table in very little time. The service is great as well. If you are looking for a delicious meal at a very little price, this is the place. You can order two well-portioned meals for less than fifteen dollars, very nice for those with big appetites. Came here from Florida and this is by far the best restaurant I have eaten at this far!
