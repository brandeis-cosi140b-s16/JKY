First off, I live near here and I am upset with myself that it has taken this long to try this place out.  

Steak potato and cheese burrito is my go to.  The steak is cooked to perfection and is a clean cut of meat not stringy at all.   The potatoes are cooked to a golden crisp that is perfect.   

Only thing I would change is to buy a time machine to try this place sooner.  Or to build an underground tunnel directly here to get my fix as often as possible.
