I'm so happy I could cry. Tijuana flats is my favorite quick eats restaurant and there's now one down the street from me! Delicious! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The sweet chili sauce is mixed w the peach sauce is the best. I really hope this place takes off since I've seen businesses come and go at this end of east blvd.
