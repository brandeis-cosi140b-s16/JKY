I absolutely love this place! I drive 30 miles from Mesa to eat at Rosita's Place every chance I get. Been coming here for at least 10 years or more. Best Mexican food in the valley. Their green corn tamales. Yum! Cheese enchiladas, red or green are the best....and not to forget the awsome refried beans.
