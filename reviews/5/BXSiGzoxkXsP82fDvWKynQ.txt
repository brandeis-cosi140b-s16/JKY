The university area of Charlotte officially has its own local Chipotle Mexican Grill! 

Currently over 1,200 locations in 43 states. Chipotle is one of the fastest growing "quick-bite" restaurants. Opening its doors in 1993, this business has since expanded itself to Canada as well as the UK. 

The food has also gone through its own transformations over the years. Chipotle is one of the few businesses of its kind that uses ingredients from naturally raised Pork, Chicken, and most recently, Beef. It was one of the first to adopt the zero trans fat cooking oil trend, currently used in many restaurants across the nation. 

The business is also known for sleek, new age designs/ d√©cor. As the new university Chipotle is one of the most recent additions in the chain, the building itself has all the latest pizzaz you would expect to find at any other, in addition to a few additional design items, such as tables, bar tables, and associated chairs.

In general, this location is very clean, the service is extremely quick and efficient, and lastly, the food is well prepared and is very appetizing. The staff here does a great job and hopefully they continue their outstanding service. 

The crowd here is average to crowded. As it is new to people in the area, it does tend to get busy around certain times in the day- i.e. lunchtime hours. The square footage is low, but still accommodates well. The noise level or overall ambience is surprising pretty low for the amount of hard material walls that can easily reverb. 

Overall, hands down, this is a great place to eat, at any time of the day. Again, well maintained and operated, and has a great atmosphere.
