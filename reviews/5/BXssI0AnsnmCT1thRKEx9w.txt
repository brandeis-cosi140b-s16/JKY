Yelp always leads me to interesting place. This is a total hole in the wall. It's filled with local families, so that's a good sign. Don't let the Boost Mobile and massage parlor scare you off. We ordered the taco special ($6) and it was great. I'm giving it 5 stars because its very delicious and the kind of place worth hunting for.
