I really love this place, the carne asada is fantastic and the nachos are great as well.  But I love it for another reason and here is my story.  It was quatro de mayo (I know cinco de mayo is not a "real holiday" and certainly quatro de mayo is not either) and in excitement of the upcoming celebration we decided to go out.  We started at a restaurant/bar that recently regained its liquor license and was a shady establishment already.  They were out of every common domestic beer and we had to get out of there.  It was getting late and decided to call Mi Familia.  Knowing it was not a holiday I asked what time they closed the bar and they said "When everbody is done drinking".  I was in love.  We headed straight over and have frequented it many times since.
