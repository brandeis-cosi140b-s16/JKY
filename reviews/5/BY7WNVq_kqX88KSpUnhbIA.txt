Food is authentic and very delicious. I had fish tacos and they tasted perfect, home cooked food. Husband & father in law had a variety of tacos, cabeza (head), tongue, & tripa tacos...they were all delicious, I tasted them all too and had plate envy. We want to try the sopas & shrimp cocktail next time. We also had the Jamica & Horchata waters and those were fantastic! I will recommend this place to everyone even if they don't ask LOL. Can't wait to go again! One more thing...nothing is over $6.95. Just go & see for urself....YUMMO
