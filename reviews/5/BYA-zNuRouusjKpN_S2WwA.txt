Five stars and not because I'm losing my mind or feeling charitable.  El Fish Taco brings fine dining flavor and quality at street fair prices.  The restaurant is a refreshing break from most Latino eateries that serve the same list of items.  Every dish at El Fish is an original creation.

All items are a'la'carte.  So, you can make yourself as stuffed with yummy goodness as you like. Every single item down to the tortillas are made fresh daily on the premises.  

My only complaint is that once people find out about this place, I won't be able to get a seat.
