Hi, first time reviewer, long-time reader.  Yea.  You might be asking yourself what made me get up off my butt and begin to actively participate in this shenanigan we call web 2.0.  Well I'll tell you what.  It's tacos.  More specifically dollar tacos.  EVEN more specifically, the best tacos I've had since a street corner in Veracruz, Mexico.

El Casa Grande is an extremely authentic quaint little restaurant on South Blvd.  I can't vouch for their whole menu, but what I can vouch for is there tacos.  Every Tues & Wed they have dollar taco night.  These are the best nights of the week.  

The tacos are simple soft-shell tacos with the flour tortilla quickly fried in some butter on the grill so their edges get slightly crisp.  They are then filled with the most delicious, succulent meat possible; all of your choosing of course.  Options include al Pastor (pork), Carnitas (fried pork), Beef (steak), Barbeque Beef (BBQ steak), Chicken (chicken), and Ground beef (you guessed it).  They then get topped with cilantro and diced onion.  They are served with a warm jalapeno pepper, a grilled onion (scallion bulb) -- which are worth ordering as a full side, and a lime.  Furthermore, every table gets FREE chips / HOMEMADE salsa.

In a nutshell, this place is as authentic as it gets and cheap as a handshake.  Tonight, I had 4 tacos and a Negra Modelo for $7.97 and left stuffed.

This place is worth the visit to a part of town you probably avoid.  Go.  Go now.

(also -- if you're worried about it being too authentic -- the kitchen received a 98.0 sanitation rating which is higher than the cafeteria for the hospital where I work.  :-P)
