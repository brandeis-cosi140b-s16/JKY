They do boast to have the biggest burrito in Nevada. It's 12.95 no matter if you get beef chicken or carne asada.

Didnt take very long to make, fed 3 people with left overs, and cost under 20 dollars. 

For such a large burrito i thought they were going to shaft us on the amount of carne asada. WRONG there was generous amounts of meat in this sucker. If i ever order it next time going to ask for no rice. 

Oh god...The house special enchiladas. oh god...how can so much WIN be under 10 dollars. I'm so full but the damn thing is SO GOOD!! Chicken is extremely moist not a dry piece and there's so much of it as well
