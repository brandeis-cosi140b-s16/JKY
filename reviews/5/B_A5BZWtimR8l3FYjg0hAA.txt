Excellent food, super fresh. It's a nice change from chipotle. They have tons of fresh ingredients to add to your bowel, salad, taco combination such as bean sprouts and fresh sliced jalepenos. They are also running a groupon special as well.Highly recommend giving this place a shot. The steak was my favorite, can definitely taste some korean influences in their spices.
