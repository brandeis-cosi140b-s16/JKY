Growing up near Chicago and in a Hispanic family, I am EXTREMELY picky about Mexican food, including street tacos. This place is spot on and couldn't be better! So authentic. You pay at the register of the grocery store (I didn't check the store out yet) and have your choice of meat. From memory, there was carnitas, chorizo, carne asada, pollo and bistec. The corn tortillas (only way to eat street tacos) are warm and made with lard. You can tell bc they don't break and are super amazingly delicious. I got cilantro and onion, again only way to eat street tacos and then went inside and added some of the little salsas they had in the salsa cart. It was cold, so I don't know if normally the cart is outside. Salsa was also fresh and spot on. Lots to choose from too. It was dirt cheap, another key part of street tacos and on point. Would recommend to anyone and writing this review made me want to go visit this spot soon! Viva!ยก
