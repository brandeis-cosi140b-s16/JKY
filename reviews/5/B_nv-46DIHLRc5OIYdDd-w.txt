Fun place, good food and I really liked the location. Made for a unique Vegas dining experience. 

Food is priced right for the portion size, you'll have plenty to take home after you finish. Enrique was great as well. My only critic was our quad and food came out within minutes of each other, so we didn't have time to really enjoy the guac.
