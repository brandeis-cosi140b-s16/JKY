This is definitively a find. We moved from Chicago over the summer and it has been hard to find really good restaurants. The food here was delicious!!! My kids are super picky and they maxed the kids meal taquitos and Mexican rice. My husband had the lobster langostino burrito and the surf and turf tacos and there were no leftovers. I had the mango chipotle Mahi Mahi tacos and they were delicious. I also had the shrim and salsa verde tacos and the shrimp salad and they were both really tasty! Will def. order from here again!
