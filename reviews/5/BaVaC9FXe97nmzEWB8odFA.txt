First visit ever, due to a Groupon deal. Was not disappointed. Great food, love the ambiance, great service by the waitresses. They checked back often, and if I wanted more chips and salsa. I had shrimp ceviche, seven seas soup, and heuvos con chorizo. It was all delicious! 

Prices were reasonable and serving sizes generous.  Wooden booths, wooden tables and chairs, Spanish music, quick service, sufficient parking. Coming off the I-10, you have to go north then find a turn around point. The atmosphere was nice. Some old objects on walls for ambiance. Plenty of seating. No wait on Saturday. It looks deceiving on the outside, I wasn't sure they were open, but I was there around 6pm. 

I'll be returning for sure. Thanks for a great first experience everyone there!
