Well this review is going to be done 2 ways lol. First with the 5 stair review. The service and fry bread very good, there hot sauce as well. It's very clean inside. Now we have to go the the 1 or 2 stairs. There Mexican food is very bad not a lot of flavor just not good at all. This was the 1st time having there Mexican food and will be the last. Will be back for there fry bread.
