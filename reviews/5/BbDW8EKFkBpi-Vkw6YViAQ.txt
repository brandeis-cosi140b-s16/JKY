Amado's is fantastic. I used to work next door to the McClintock location, so I ate there almost daily. I was delighted to find out about the Alma School location. I like my food fairly simple, and this is it. Taquitos are nothing but beef, with cheese and guacamole on top. Breakfast burritos are potato, egg, cheese, and bit of bacon. The hot sauce is great. So, if you want something just like Fili B's, only better, come to Amado's. Oh, did I mention that they're open 24 hrs?
