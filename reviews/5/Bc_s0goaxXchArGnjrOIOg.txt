What a great experience tonight! 5 of us in our party - my wife and I, her parents and our son.  Simone, our server was fantastic: She did a great job explaining  the options for my wife's food allergies (egg, dairy and wheat) and together they designed a tasty enchilada recipe. I enjoyed the Enchilada Mole.  Three others had Carnitas - braised pork shanks with chipotle-wine sauce - very tasty and a bit spicy. 
We've been here a number of times and have never been disappointed.
Greatly appreciate the flexibility for those with complex food allergies.
