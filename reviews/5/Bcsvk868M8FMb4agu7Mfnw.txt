food was good quite a drive from our home , had the oysters they where good !! the shrimp cocktail was kind of funky tho it tasted like it had horse radish or something not your regular cocktail. tostadas de ceviche where good both fish and shrimp... for my babe and his mom they seemed to enjoy the michiladas they had . the juke box had the right music to sit and reminisce of family over all it was all good
