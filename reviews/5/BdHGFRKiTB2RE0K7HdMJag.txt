We only ended up here because Maizie's down the street closes early on Sundays, but I was very glad we did!  The restaurant is in the Clarendon hotel, which has been made into a hip little boutique hotel with an awesome pool and roof deck. The hotel and restaurant are in a pretty good location uptown, near the light rail, but you probably wouldn't be driving down Clarendon for no reason, which is exactly why I had never seen this little gem.  Anyway, Gallo Blanco's decor and atmosphere is really hip, but low-key.  The food was very good - we tried all the different tacos, the guacamole, and the steak tortas.  The torta was excellent, but not quite as good as the best steak torta ever (Barrio Cafe) because GB used soft bread that got soggy quickly.  (minor).  The little tacos were all delicious, especially the cochinitas.  I am not really a big guacamole fan, but I actually like the GB stuff, especially because it had oranges in it.  The margaritas were quite good (I guess they were second place in the Best of Phoenix comp) and they had a few local beers on tap for very cheap ($3 for 4 peaks). Overall: very cool place, with really cheap prices.
