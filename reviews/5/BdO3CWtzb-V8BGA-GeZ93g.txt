Cute little BBQ shack in front of a citrus farm. Has only been open a few months. There's also a farm store but that is seasonal. Very charming place, all new but old timey looking. 

Stopped here after passing by several times. They were about to close on A Saturday night but were super friendly and happy to serve us. We split a 1/4 lb pulled pork sandwich between us, got coleslaw and a couple of lemonades. 

Within minutes the owner brought it out to us, along with a bag of tortilla chips, hot & mild salsa, and 3 kinds of BBQ sauce. 

The pork was succulent, juicy, perfectly seasoned and had a bacony finish. The sauces were all good, one was slightly sweet and smokey, one had the tangy taste of vinegar, and the last was spicy. Lovely soft roll that was not soggy held it all together. 

Coleslaw was light and fresh. What you want in a coleslaw, really. I like pulled pork with the coleslaw on top, but my partner didn't so I ordered an individual side which was a very generous portion. 

The tortilla chips were the thin and crispy type, very nice. Salsas were both fresh and tasty. Not sure if these always come with your meal or the owner was just passing them out because they were closing. He was chatty as well, obviously knew we hadn't been before. Friendly without being creepy, which is a bonus. 

Prices are good, $6 for the sandwich which was easily enough for us two ladies. 

Really the best BBQ I've had in the east valley, and on par with what I've experienced down south. 

Closed Sunday and Monday, like everything else in Mesa. Just buy extra on Saturday and you'll be all right.
