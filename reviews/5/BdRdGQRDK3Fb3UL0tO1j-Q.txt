Best Mexican/New Mexican restaurant around.  My family and I have been eating here almost every week for years.  Their salsa is the absolute best; just the right amount of heat, chunks of onion, and large sprigs of cilantro....truly divine!  Frank and Lupes subscribes to the "quality" over "quantity" philosophy that is to the detriment of many other local mexican eateries.  My favorites are Taco's De Charro, Chicken Mole, Shredded Beef Burrito's (the meat is succulent and perfectly seasoned), and their Veggie Burrito which is hands down the best in town.  Some of the gripes from fellow yelpers about Frank and Lupes are down right comical to me.  Complaints about tables being close together and people being able to hear your conversations are issues at most restaurants that are busy by virtue of serving a great product.  Frank and Lupes is not the Melting Pot and shame on you for blaming an eatery for not living up to your baseless preconcieved notions.  As a service industry veteran, I know that some are very adept at the art of dis-satisfaction.  Thank goodness for those of you who "will not be back", My wait for a table every week just got a bit shorter.
