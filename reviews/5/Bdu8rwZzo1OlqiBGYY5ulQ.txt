This is one of the best restaurants in the entire state of Arizona. If you're looking for a true foodie experience with a fordable and delicious cuisine this is a must see restaurant. The unique combination of Chinese and Mexican food was a wonderful invention.

I would eat here over many four-star restaurants at a quarter of the price.
