Yummy!!! This is going to be my go-to Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. My boyfriend got the flautas (barbacoa, chicken and potato) and they were perfectly crispy and full of flavor. I got the bandeja paisa special...amazing. I hope they keep serving this. It came w/ rice, beans, ground beef, chorizo, ?pork belly, fried egg, arepa, avocado and plaintains.
