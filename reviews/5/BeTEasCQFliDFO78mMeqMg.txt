First, our server was great.  Very courteous, helpful, funny, with just the right timing of his pop-ins.

Second, what a value.  The tasting menu was really two very large dinners for one person.  I don't know how they do what they do for $55, but wow.  So much food.  So much very good food.

- The guacamole was very flavorful.  The sea salt on top made it borderline exceptional.  Adding the crab took it to another level
- The salad was ok.  Nothing great.
- The jalapeno salsa had the perfect amount of heat
- The shrimp tacos in the corn tortillas were full of wow.  They added a small amount of chorizo which made the whole taco one of the better tacos I've ever had
- The sweet corn was fine

Yes, we're still going.

- The queso with duck was pretty good, but about a 1/4 inch too much cheese.  Nice flavor, but it wasn't my favorite.  Just too much cheese
- The branzino in the savory tomato preparation was very nicely cooked.  Meaty fish with a savory prep is always going to be one of my favorites
- The carne asada was super tender and still had that great carne asada flavor.  It was my wife's favorite dish

Finally, we get to dessert.  At this point, I'm just taking a bite to taste it and then having another server pack up the rest.  

- The panna cotta with strawberry sorbet covered in pineapple sauce was my favorite.  Just all kinds of tasty creamy goodness
- The chocolate bar covered in chocolate jello with a thin piece of chocolate with chocolate sauce was out of control.  Oh, it had coffee ice cream with it

As I said, this was the tasting menu.  For $55 per person.  These were not small little tapas dishes.  Aside from the guacamole, these were full size plates. I'm still full and happy a day later.
