Love this place! Friendly staff and clean restaurant! Salsa is good. Sometimes it's not as spicy as I like it but that's ok. My favorite thing on the menu is burrito tequila with grilled chicken! The red and cheese sauce is awesome together. Chicken is flavorful. Rice is soft and fluffy. I've also had their beef tacos and they were stuffed! My next thing to try is their Sunday brunch!
