I love Macayo's!!!  We come to Phoenix/Tempe every year for spring training baseball and we always have a meal here.  The place is huge so we have never had a problem getting a table.  We always sit outside because its a great atmosphere and the weather is usually great.  

They make excellent margaritas - I have tried some of the flavored ones and regular ones. Their chips, salsa, and guacamole is addicting.

We have had a variety of dishes that have never been disappointing. I especially love their tortilla soup - even when its March and 100 degrees out.

I am already counting down the days until our next visit.
