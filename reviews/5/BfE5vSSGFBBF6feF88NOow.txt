Best Chili Verde and best green sauce I have ever had. Also the best customer service. I came up short on my bill and they covered it without hesitation. When I came back a few days later to repay them, they said not to worry about it. The workers are always kind and very friendly. I have had other items on their menu and they are all equally good. I would recommend them to anyone looking for great fast Mexican food at a good price.
