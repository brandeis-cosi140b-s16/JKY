If you enjoy really spicy food it does not get better than Los Dos. This location is my very favorite. Staff are extremely friendly and attentive, food is consistent. The only bad thing at all is that they are closed Sunday/Monday so if you get a craving those days then you have to wait. My personal pick is anything with the Adovada. It's phenomenal.
