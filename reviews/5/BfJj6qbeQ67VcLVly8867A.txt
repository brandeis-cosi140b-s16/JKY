The food at Rubio's is great, but I have to agree with Crystal, it's the staff at this particular restaurant who keep me coming back. Such nice people - especially Ryan! I'm not exaggerating when I say I feel like a V.I.P. when I visit. They obviously care about their restaurant and their guests.

I've always ordered the Baja Grill Burrito with steak - yum! - but tried one of their new fish tacos today and I have to say it was delicious. I'll be ordering those again. The salsa bar is always fresh, filled and clean and the restaurant is bright and inviting. And take my advice: don't leave without a churro!
