Never went to the old location as it looked kinda shady. This location couldn't be any different. Very well decorated, the ambiance is top notch. The service was awesome, everyone working together. The food was awesome, I got their famous chimi and it didn't disappoint. The only thing that's weird is they opened up across the street from an established Mexican place, Sylvia's. That's kind of a dick move, but oh well let the people decide I guess. Anyway I highly recommend this place.
