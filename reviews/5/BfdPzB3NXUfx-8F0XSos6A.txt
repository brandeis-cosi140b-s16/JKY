I have been going here practically my whole life. It is my favorite mexican restaurant. It's not fancy, but it's not run down either - it's just right. The waiters are also always very nice.

I'm a total salsa snob and their chunky salsa is the best salsa ever. The hot sauce is also highly ranked in my book. I've had their cheese crisp, enchiladas, chimis - basic stuff like that. 
Their fried ice cream is really good too!

And the best part about it is that the salsa is wonderful at their different locations too. I'm just partial to this location since it's been the one I go to the most.
Very reasonable prices too.

Try them out!
