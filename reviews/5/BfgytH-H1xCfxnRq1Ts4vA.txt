No matter what the kniuckleheads say this is one of the finest restaurants in the greater PHX area.  There is NEVER poor service.  The service when it busy slows down is normal, but not excessive.  The drinks are awesome.  The food is always excellent.  They have spicey and non spicey food.  Prices run from $15 to $40 and yet it is not cheap, but not expensive because u get quality and a great experience.  Just try it@!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
