Had a three day class in South Phoenix and by the last day we were tired of the chain restaurants. We decided to try Gordas. I am so glad we did. Wish I would have found this place the first day I was there, I wouldn't have eaten anywhere else.  I'll be back (even if I have to make a special trip).  Great food!
