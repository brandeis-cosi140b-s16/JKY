One of the most delightful dining experiences. From the appetizer to the main course to the dessert to the Overall service. 

I had the Taos Combo (Honey smoked pork tamale, tenderloin relleno and shrimp enchilada). The tamale was the highlight with the WONDERFUL smoky taste and the moist masa the tamale was made of. The salsa and enchilada sauce had a full flavor with just the right HOT kick. The Triple Dipper was the best combination of guacamole, beans with pico de gallo & sour cream, and the highlight was the lobster dip with roasted Anaheim green chile. Dessert was a perfectly fried sopapilla stuffed with ice cream and apples, all topped with powdered sugar & honey.....a Mexican/American apple pie of sorts. 

Our waiter, Eric, was OUTSTANDING. Friendly and attentive service. Our tostada chip bowl and glasses of iced tea NEVER went below half empty. 

We will definitely RETURN.........soon!
