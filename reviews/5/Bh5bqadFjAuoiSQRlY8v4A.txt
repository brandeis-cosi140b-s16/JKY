We had a great experience at Distrito for our anniversary last night! The ambiance is nice and cozy and I loved having the back window wall open to the courtyard of The Saguaro Hotel. We decided the best way to go about our meal was to try several small plates so we could try lots of new things and get a good feel for the restaurant. 

When I looked at yelp reviews I knew we had to get two things - the guacamole and the tuna ceviche. They both delivered - the guacamole is fresh and lightly acidic, we added the fresh crab and it takes it to another level. Straight up, it was delicious. 

I now understand why someone would write an ode to the tuna ceviche - the dish, to put it lightly, is perfect. The yellowfin tuna, tender. The Serrano coconut sauce, spicy. The lime sorbet, unassuming and cooling. The sauce is just out of this world guys. You really must try it. Our waiter said they play around with the menu a lot and things come and go, but the ceviche de atun never moves. 

We also enjoyed the pulpo al carbon. We had tried octopus one other time at a tapas place in ohio and liked it but found it a little tough. Not so here. The way the octopus is marinaded and grilled, which brings out a light nutty flavor to the tender meat. It's dense and delicious, and the potato confit with the bearnaise sauce brings a decadent touch. 

We finished with the queso fundido - I'm glad our waiter brought this out last because it was pretty dang rich. I mean it's a crock of melted mixed cheese with barbecued duck and poblano chiles. You can do the math - it's delicious, but so heavy that you wouldn't want to start a meal with it. 

All in all, we really enjoyed our time at Distrito. We had two house margaritas that were on point as well. We'll definitely be back, and I'll probably bring my parents when they venture out west.
