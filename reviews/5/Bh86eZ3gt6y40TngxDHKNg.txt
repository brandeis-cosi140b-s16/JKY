The reviews for this place were not wrong. The food was great and the staff was very accommodating with a few special orders we had. I had the barbacoa wet burrito with habanero salsa and it was darn tasty. My wife got an order of nachos with the green chili pork which wad also great. I would like to say that they made my wife nachos even though it wasn't listed on the menu. I will be back.
