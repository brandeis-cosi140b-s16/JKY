Love this place.  Fresh, delicious food, super reasonable prices, very friendly staff.  It is everything one could want in a neighborhood taco joint.

My favorite items are the horcheta with coffee (ridiculously good - tastes kind of like a chai latte mixed with coffee) and the al pasto quesadilla.  Usually get food to go; often for lunch and ocassionally bring home a bigger order for dinner.  There can be a line out the door at lunch, but they move it quickly and if you call in your order it is ready when you get there.
