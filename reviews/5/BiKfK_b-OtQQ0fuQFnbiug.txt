Delicious! I recently moved from Las Vegas to NYC and the disappointment I've felt eating Mexican food in NYC is unexplainable... So I had a layover here in Phoenix and decided I need to fulfill my cravings for authentic Mexican food! This place was exactly what I need I had to carne tacos and 1 lengua although they were both tasty the lengua was so tender and salted perfectly.. I can't wait to get another Phoenix layover 

Side Note: the adorable girl selling snacks, collecting bottles, and clearing tables for her summer "job" is a real business woman Tip her! :)
