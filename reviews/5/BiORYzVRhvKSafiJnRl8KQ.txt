I very seldom write reviews, but I just had to put an end to the madness.  First let me tell you, I have been eating Tamales ALL MY LIFE.  I absolutely love them and will eat them all year round.  Today was my first time visiting Old El Paso Tamales and I had a GREAT experience.  I only ordered to go, but the tamales are excellent.  The flavors, the masa the meat all great.  I was greeted with a smile and asked to come back soon.  Overall, good tamales, the best that I have tasted in a very long time.
