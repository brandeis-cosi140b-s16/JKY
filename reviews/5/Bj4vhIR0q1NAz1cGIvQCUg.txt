Great portions of incredibly flavorful food. The burritos are jam packed with meat. The tacos are flavored just right and topped with colorful pico.

The relatively new location in the shopping center on the northeast corner of 48th St and Baseline may look like just another fast food Mexican storefront, but the food is well worth checking out.

Edited to add 5/23/2011: Nearly 3 years later and they're still in business and still excellent. Quick service and very good food from a simple but varied menu. While there was no one else in the place tonight, I'm really hoping that's not the norm. Quite a few businesses in this shopping center have shut down. This doesn't deserve to be one of those.
