I'm addicted to the simple bean and cheese burritos, homemade, no crap in them and everything a bean and cheesier should be. I need to wean myself from having too many, I don't want to get sick of them ...savor the love. I've had the carne Asada and Pastor Taco's both are ridiculously yummy as well.
