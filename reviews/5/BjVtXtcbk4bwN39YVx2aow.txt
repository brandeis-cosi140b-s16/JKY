The customer service people, at least at this Taco Bell, are named, 'Customer Maniac.' I did receive 'jazz hands' when I walked through the door so they were excited to see me. The food was prepared to my enjoyment. The chicken soft tacos were hot and the Mountain Dew Baja Blast was ice cold. Thank you Taco Bell & Paul the 'Customer Maniac' for providing a good experience.
