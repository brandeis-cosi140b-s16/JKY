If you're a high-maintenance diva, then this might not be the place for you.

If you're a juiced-up frat guy looking to slug miller light and jaeger-bombs, then this might not be the place for you. 

If you like great drinks, food, music and atmosphere then this IS the place for you.

I honestly liked the Cantina a little bit more before it got so popular but I am very happy for their success. It's just that now it seems a little over-crowded with people who don't "get it" or understand what this place is about. The food and drinks are very high quality and unique. The servers are laid back and friendly. They have one of the nicest patios in Pittsburgh. 

This isn't the Cheesecake Factory.
