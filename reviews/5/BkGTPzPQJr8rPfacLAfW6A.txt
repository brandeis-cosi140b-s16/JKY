If this could have a 0 star it would. This was the WORST experience ever. I used to come all the time and had the best experience. Tonight. No. Terrible. Horrible. First let me just say my husband and I ordered the trio appetizer and the kid that brought it out basically threw it in my lap. Then I got the steak tacos they were decent but kind of cold. My husband got he carnitas burrito and said it was good. At the time of our order we said we wanted the cookie dough flautas to come out 15 mins later. I didn't realize it would be 45 mins later. We got them after the back "forgot" about them. We got them and they weren't even hot. This was just the food. The dining room floor looked like it hadn't been swept since last year. The tables were nasty. After tonight I'd rather go to Taco Bell. 

Ok so we decided to give one more chance and I'm so glad we did. It was back to normal but better. I will be back now that they've made things better. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was fresher and the store was cleaner. As always Chandler was incredibly helpful!
