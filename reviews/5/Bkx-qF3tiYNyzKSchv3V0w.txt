Great tacos!  Had the pork and it was amazing.  The hot salsa was awesome.  You can't beat the price. The grilled jalapeno was one of the hottest I have ever experienced.    If I have one bad thing to say, it is that the server behind the register did not understand English.  I had to point at the menu for everything.  Otherwise, skip the oh so expensive strip Hotel/casino restaurants, this beats it hands down.
