It's a shame that a well designed Mexican restaurant automatically makes me think that the food isn't going to taste authentic.  Los Taquitos definitely proves that theory wrong.

Every time I'm craving really good pozole this is my go to place.  I found them on Yelp and I'm so glad I did.  The vibe is great - well lit, plenty of options for seating (even a patio).  The service is great too, I think the woman who runs the register and takes your order is the owner.  It's counter service, so don't expect a server.

The food is so good.  I've had the red pozole multiple times and loved it.  Also had their chorizo burrito and tacos.  All yummy.  Great little neighborhood spot and one of the best places to go for pozole in Phoenix.
