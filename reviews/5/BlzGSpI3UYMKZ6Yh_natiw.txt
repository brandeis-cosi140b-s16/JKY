This place is unbeatable if you are looking for the BEST street tacos in Phoenix plus amazing quesadillas, tostadas, huaraches and sopas and you aren't concerned with ambiance (the restaurant is comfortable but very basic). Everything is hot, fresh and delicious and they don't skip on the extras. We have eaten there a couple of times recently and, along with our meal, they brought fresh chips and salsa (decious but hot- not for the mild salsa lover), a plate of limes, fresh cilantro, cucumbers and radishes plus another plate with grilled chilis and cactus paddles. Highly recommended!
