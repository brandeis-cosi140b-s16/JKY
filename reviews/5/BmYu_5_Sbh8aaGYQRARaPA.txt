Ambiance - crowded on a Sunday morning, but it was a very short wait to get 3 breakfast burritos and a horchata. Tortillas were amazing, we got chorizo, eggs, and potato with sour cream and guacamole. The burrito was very big and filling. Horchata is creamy and delicious. Only drawback, there is no where to sit if it's busy, however, the food came out fast so that's not much of an issue. Green sauce is lacking spice but the red sauce was bold and spicy, just the way it should be. Definitely coming back here to try more off the extensive menu!
