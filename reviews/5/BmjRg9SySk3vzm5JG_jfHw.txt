What a great find on the strip! The fresh made guacamole is awesome. The beef short rib tacos were fantastic, served in a DIY style with plenty of small, warm, soft corn tortillas with an array of condiments. They also had a good beer selection with decent prices on the buckets, so bring a friend and sit on the patio for a relaxing meal.
