Ate here last night with my wife and daughter.  We all thought it was excellent.  I had chicken, steak and fish tacos.  Terrific.  The red sauce that accompanies it is HOT, which I love.  My wife had chicken,  steak and carnitas tacos, while my daughter had a chicken quesadilla.  We all raved about the food.

My son and daughter in law live in San Diego, and we've missed the food they have out there.  No longer!

Give these people your business, you won't regret it!

Edit:

Other reviewers say this place is dingy - I don't see that at all.  What it needs is more customers.  Concord Mills is loaded with chain restaurants - we need to support the local ones.
