So good I orderd more for the hotel.

Recently on a trip I was driving esploring looking at homes and found this place.  It was out of the way and at the right place at the right time. Or maybe I was at the right place at the right time.  

I was at that point were my hinger was starting my it presence well known.  I didn't want that fast food fix and out of nowhere.....

Not on the eligent list.  Dirt parking lot and it almost looked like they were remolding.  Maybe not.

I saw something I haven't seem anywhere.  Something from my past. Something of memorius gone with Grandma.  She past and gave my the best gift of all.  The love of food.  I am third generation Professional Chef and she was the First.

ALBONDIGAS!!!!!!

Ok.  So Good I ordered an extra and took it to my hotel for the next day.  I NEVER, EVER did that before.

You HAVE TO TRY THE ALBONDIGAS!

You HAVE TO TRY THE ALBONDIGAS!

I didn't ry anything else.  I didn't need to.

Remember the review seen of "Ratatuollie"?  That was me.  going back in my mind.  The one thing every Chef looks to acheive. 

Thank you for a heart warming reminder of where i come from.
