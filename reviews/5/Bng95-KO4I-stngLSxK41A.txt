I cannot say enough good things about this place! Food is fresh and delicious,  staff is very friendly, and it is CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN! I visit a couple times a month and I have never had a bad experience!  Grilled ship tacos are very tasty, and the agua chillies are fantastic. Plus, the ceviche is FULL of seafood, not just filler!
