How is this possible? This is at least a four+ restaurant. The service was excellent, as was the food. The fact that it's  Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger's restaurant, and I am a huge food show junky, doesn't hurt as well. They are the best duo!

We had a group of 8 on the back patio, which was the perfect setting in Las Vegas summer. It overlooks the "lazy river" at Mandalay Bay, but at night it just looks like trees. The server was attentive and took care of whatever we needed. The price was not bad, and everyone loved the food so much we came back 2 more times. 2 more times people!!

The best of the best is the Chili Poblano Burger. (I think thats what it is called). Also, the baja fish tacos that are fried are very good. Just enough batter to salsa/toppings ratio. The Peach Lemonade is a very refreshing non-alcoholic drink too.

Sit outside if you can -  It's the best spot!
