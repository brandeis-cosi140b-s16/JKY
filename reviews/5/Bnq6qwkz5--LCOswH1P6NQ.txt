ELOTE ELOTE ELOTE! 

I will have to say it was empty when we came in on a Monday dinner time & the setting is interesting. The staff was nice... although the al pastor guy station was a little grumpy... hahaha he was cursing in Spanish when I asked for flour tortilla on my MULA instead of corn, but they should have asked instead of assuming... plus I can understand Spanish so it was a bit =\ 
Other than that everything was good.

I would have to say this place is almost as AWESOME as tacos El gordo... but they do have their perks w/ the BOMB elote that they wonderfully COVER the ENTIRE corn w/ a loving amount of cheese. They also have the SALSA station which I LOVE!!! Their fresh Pico de gayo & jalapeno salsa is the Best. 

This place is definitely on the top of my list for taco places. This LOCATION I must say... also possibly tastes a bit better than the eastern location.
