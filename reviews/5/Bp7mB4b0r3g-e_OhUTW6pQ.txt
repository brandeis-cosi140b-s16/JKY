I got a chicken burrito yesterday and I couldn't stop thinking about it all day today. They gladly substituted some ingredients for others at my request. And now I'm driving home with another couple orders for my wife and me. It smells so good I just want to tear into the bag. I'm going to finish this review after I've eaten it.... Same thing. Delicious.
