Perfect waffle. The chicken was under seasoned,  nothing a little hot sauce can't cure. Got the breakfast chicken and waffles.  Was a huge portion.  Everything was fresh and hot. Gravy was thick and awesome. Nothing out does this waffle tho.  Wow. It was super dead when I came service was quick, and the food came fast as well.
