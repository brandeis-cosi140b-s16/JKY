Sitara is by far the single best hookah lounge in Vegas.  The environment is super chill during the week, and crazy fun on the weekends.  The owners, Les and Deebo, have owned and operated smoke shops for years, so you know they know their quality shisha.  The bowls are excellent, the service is always friendly, and the food is AMAZING!  I reccomend the blueberry bowls and the chicken wings are crispy and delicious.  When relatives are in town, I bring em here.
