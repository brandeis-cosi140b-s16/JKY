I have eaten here on a couple of occasions and it has been a great experience every time. This is a nice restaurant to sit and eat, or great for take out. When you sit and eat at the restaurant they give you 3 different types of salsa and all of them are amazing in their own way. I got a more casual vibe, so I was pleasantly surprised that they actually bring out your food to the table. I got the carne asada quesadilla, hands down the best carne asada I've had so far in Phoenix. We even got take out the other day and I couldn't say no to getting it again. I promised myself next time I would venture to other dishes like the tortas but I couldn't help it this time. My bf has tried the carne asada burrito and barbacoa tacos and they were also very delicious. We also tried the chese dip appetizer that had roasted anahiem pepper and other yummy stuff added. That was demolished instantly. The staff has always been amazing and very helpful in making decisions.  Will definitely be coming here for a long time, since I live fairly close.
