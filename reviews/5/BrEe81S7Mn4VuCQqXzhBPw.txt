The only reason that I can even begin to imagine as to why reviewers say it's nothing special is because a) they were expecting the typical Mexican food. This is Halisco style food - not the same! Think of it as more of a gourmet style Mexican restaurant. And b) they ordered the chicken tacos. Admittedly, they sort of suck. I've been coming here with my family for years! After they moved across town to the new location, we followed.

Ambiance: It's a CUTE restaurant with an old town Mexican theme. Subdued lighting with eccentric and rich coloring.

Service: You are evil spawn if you don't like M&M. They work hard and are the loveliest people ever! They are friendly and remember you if you go there often enough. He looks angry but I swear he's super nice. She's so warm and welcoming and knows my order every time I go in.Thanks.

Food (and none of it is greasy!):
+ Pork chop/cube with green sauce: INCREDIBLE. OMYGOODNESS. They're soft. They're savory. They're moist. They couldn't be better. They make me want to sing my praises from the rooftops of Phoenix.
+ Chicken tacos: Skip them. They are kind of disappointing.
+ Chicken tortilla soup: AMAZING. Seriously. I have yet to find one that's better. It's spicyyy and will clear your sinuses! Mmm.
+ Refried beans: Fantastic. The best I've had, and believe me, I am well versed in Mexican food. If anyone knows beans, it's me.
+ Chips and salsa: The chips are freshly deep fried, so they're wonderful and crunchy. The salsa is great. One is chunky and mildly hot, while the other is super smooth and super hot. Both taste amazing.

And the best of all: their always-spotless utensils, plates, and tables make me endlessly happy. So clean :')
