Edgar's Taco stand right outside on 21st between Liberty and Penn is fantastic.

The marinated lamb tacos are the best, although the chicken and beef tacos are good too.  The fish on the fish tacos were overpowered by the ingredients, and if you can't taste the protein then it's best to skip the dish altogether.

The guac is really good, and worth the extra $1.

This is definitely the real deal, and they are delicious.

There's almost always a short line -- they seem busy all the time.

The few tables and chairs right next to the stand are mostly in full sun.  These tacos are best enjoyed when they are hot and fresh, immediately off the grille.  Grab them, scarf them down, and move on!

The flavors are great.....

Right next to Thin Man Sandwich shop which is pretty reliable as well!
