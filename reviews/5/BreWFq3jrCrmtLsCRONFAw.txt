Awesome food! The food is fresh, your burrito or taco salad is cook up while you wait. Yes, that's right folks; they actually wait for your order and then put the meat or chicken  on the grill. I have been here over a dozen times so far and never gotten sick from the food. Not even so much as a fart. Awesome clean restaurant ; ) Yes, the area that it is in a little tough, but don't let that hold you back from checking out this diamond in the rough. Very nice staff that genuinely care about you as a customer. They have tables inside and outside on the patio. Great spot to go and grub whether it be on lunch or taking a dinner date to at night. For air travelers, it is 1 mile from the airport.
