This is the real deal - the straight up tastiest tacos in the valley. We went on a business lunch (5 of us) and ordered some of everything. My favorite were the pork - the right combo of crunch, sweet, tender meat, spice - amazing. I brought a couple of extras back to the office and gave to a few employees - one said it was the best thing he had ever tasted in his life (not the best TACO he had ever tasted, the best ANYTHING he had ever tasted) and it is hard to argue. Quaint patio and table side made guac as well - are you kidding me?? Go eat there.
