I never write reviews but seriously...the best Taco Bell I've ever been to. I live in California, and from Arizona so I've seen my share of them and from the perfectly orderly fashioned line of sauces to the freshest tasting taco I've ever had. I had to talk to the manager and and compliment the team. Till next time Henderson...
