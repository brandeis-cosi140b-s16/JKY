Roberto's is my all time fave! My two absolute favorite menu items are: Carne Asada Nachos and the Shrimp Cocktail (spicy). This location has definitely been one of the best ones I've been to. Not only is it in a great location, but there's an awesome patio to sit at. Go check them out if you haven't yet...you won't regret it!
