A very authentic Mexican Food spot on south side of Phoenix. The style of the restaurant is very colorful and festive. Every time I have been there it is busy especially on the weekends breakfast thru lunch times. Had the green burro with rice and beans and it tasted like my own nana made it. Would definitely go back and enjoy other dishes.
