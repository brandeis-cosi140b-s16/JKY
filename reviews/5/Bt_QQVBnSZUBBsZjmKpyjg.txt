I don't know what's up with the hater below, but I loved the enchiladas.  There were two cheese enchiladas with a large slice of steak on top.  The meat was delicious and the filling was creamy.  The carnitas was pretty awesome too (my 1st trip there).  They were good enough to bring me back, obviously.

And someone else please tell this guy what Rosarito beans taste like.  Go try the bean dip and tell me it doesn't have flavors of onion and chorizo in there.  This is Lindo, except cheaper and closer to home.  I'm not driving to Flamingo/215 or Eastern/Sahara to eat some Lindo.  This place is like 5 minutes of freeway from me...  Honestly, next time I go to this joint, I'll put up some pictures of the food.  For Tony's $15, he probably figured he'd get lobster tails and a ribeye...
