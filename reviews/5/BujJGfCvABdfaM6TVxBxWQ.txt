My fiance and I dined at Lenero's on Friday evening and really enjoyed the whole experience. Arriving shortly after 7pm, we were seated immediately. It was a bonus that their margaritas were half off, as I had several spicy margs that were delicious. 

Chef Marcos greeted us at our table and was able to provide recommendations, given this was our first time there. He recommended the lamb to my fianc√©, which was very good. I enjoyed an empanada with fresh veggies. 

We appreciated that everyone made an effort to make our dining experience personal - our server Alex, the chef, and the bartender Kevin were all very kind and accommodating. The ambiance was lovely, and we heard there will be live music in the summer evenings which will be something to look forward too!

At the end of the night, we left feeling full (but not heavy) and look forward to future visits at this local restaurant!
