Wow, some of the best tacos I've ever had. For 7 bucks you get 3 large tacos with your choice of meats and beans. Then you choose whatever else you want on them and man are they good. Definitely try the "extra hot" green sauce. It's like a hot garlic aioli and its is addictive. Love this place.I'll be back as often as possible...
