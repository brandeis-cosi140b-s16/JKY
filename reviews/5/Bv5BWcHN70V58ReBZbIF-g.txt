My guy and I fell in love with this place! We went during the Mariachi Brunch on a Sunday. We used a restaurant.com certificate, so we had to spend a minimum of $50, which wasn't that hard. We ordered the sampler platter for the appetizer. Everything was delicious! I loved the nachos and shrimp quesadilla. For entrees, we ordered the carne asada tacos and carne asada from the grill. All of the food was seasoned well and the portions were big. Will return on my next trip to Vegas.
