Okay okay so I'm obsessed with Blanco. It's not my fault. Everything is amazing and I come here at least once a month... At least.

The margaritas are fresh, I like the Blood orange and the Mango jalape√±o. Their blended sangria is great too, I don't love the red sangria but when it's mixed with the white, it's really good!

The queso is a must order. I recently I had 5 friends in town and obviously I brought them to Blanco for our first meal- everyone was talking about the queso all weekend. The guac is also pretty good. 

Entrees- I used to order the green chili pork enchiladas every time I came in. They are amazing, I highly recommend. Lately, I have be into Mexican chopped salad with steak. The combination of ingredients in this salad are perfect. My boyfriend is into the tacos and is obsessed with the corn they serve here. I don't eat corn but apparently it's delicious.

I really prefer this Blanco over the location at the Biltmore. Something about the Scottsdale location is just better.

Go to Blanco yall- I'm so serious, you can thank me later!
