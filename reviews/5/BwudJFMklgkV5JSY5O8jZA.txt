My wife and I have been going here for 2 years now.  The food is always EXCELLENT and the secret is out because they are always busy.  I love the carnitas tacos and the carne asada.  The salsas are fresh and have varying degrees of heat.  Service is always excellent.  I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here.
