If you're going to try anything here, I recommend the Hash Brown Burrito! Hands down best thing on the menu! Doesn't matter if its breakfast, lunch or dinner this is always my go to! I've been going to the FH location for 12 years now, just tried the sun city location and now just discovered this location is right down the street from me! I see a lot more hash brown burritos in my future! :)
