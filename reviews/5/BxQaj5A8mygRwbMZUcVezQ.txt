I had a fabulous time at Jalisco Cantina and was very impressed. It is conveniently located right off the 215 at Sunset, and there was ample close parking. The atmosphere is pleasant and homey. The video poker bar is completely separate from the restaurant area, and the d√©cor is very tasteful. The service staff is absolutely great. Everybody was extremely friendly and accommodating, not to mention super fast. And the food was fabulous. As authentic as I have found in Las Vegas. I have lived in Las Vegas for 21 years and try as many of the Mexican restaurants in town as I can. They make their guacamole in 3 styles from fresh, whole avocados. I sampled the clasico and the camaron tropical with shrimp and mango. Both were excellent! They also make all of their tortillas fresh in-house, as well as their chips -  which were as good as they get. They have over 90 items on the menu, so selection isn't a problem! I also had 2 different margaritas, the top shelf and the spicy. Both were excellent! I tackled their "muy caliente" salsa and about caught on fire! And I can usually handle hot! Not for the faint LOL - won't be doing that again! The mild was excellent, had ample spice and flavor, and was more my speed I guess! I will be back!
