Love it! Don't let the little shopping plaza its hidden in fool you. Once you enter the door you'll immediately be welcomed into a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere, friendly staff and wonderful food. Almost everyone at our table ordered the poco pollo. I substituted beef instead of chicken. Incredible. The group I was with have quite a few picky eaters, and no one had a complaint.
