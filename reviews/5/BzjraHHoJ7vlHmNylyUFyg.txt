This place is one of my top three Mexican restaurants in all of Charlotte. Everything taste authentic. The salsa taste incredible! I swear I think they make it by hand in the back. They offer all different types of meat. Just an excellent place to eat. Plus, a lunch menu for $5.75! I can usually have an entree, appetizer and drink (non alcohol) for under $12! The staff is incredibly friendly too! Try it!! You'll love it!
