This place is close and cheap. 

What more do you want? 

Alright,  I guess cleanliness and tasty food are musts as well. This restaurant has all of that. The food is great for what you're paying for and is cheap. It's not gourmet food by any means,  but it is good and great for a college student budget.  

Steer clear of the obvious American items mainly to please the people oblivious of Mexican cuisine and you're good to go. 

Definitely craving some Al pastor right now.
