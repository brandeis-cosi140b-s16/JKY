There are a lot of taco trucks in LA, but I have to admit, this place is so delicious! Probably my favorite Mexican restaurant.

I almost always make a trip here when I'm in Vegas. It's super close to the strip, so the drive is not bad (assuming Las Vegas Blvd doesn't have any traffic). However, parking can be hard to find if the plaza is super busy.

My favorite is the Adobada (spicy pork/pastor) tacos for $2. The Carne Asada fries are also really yummy. They're $10, but HUGE, enough to share for 4-5 people.

I always want to try other items, but I'm always craving the Adobada that I forget to!

FYI, the water from the soda fountain tastes weird.
