I love quick burrito places, and Chipotle tends to top the list.  But Qdoba comes a close second for one reason: Queso Sauce!  It's spicy and goes great in burritos or on nachos.  No other place carries it good as here.  I know, I know ... calorie killer!  But killer taste, man.  Sign up for their Qdoba card and you get a free Welcome Chips and Salsa, then every tenth burrito is free.  They email me $5 entree & drink combo coupons all the time, sometimes even Buy One Get One and I get to treat my coworker to free lunch.  The staff has always been nice, and I like that they're open late (10pm).
