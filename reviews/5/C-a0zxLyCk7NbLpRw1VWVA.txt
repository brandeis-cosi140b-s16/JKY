So.... I'm a Local Real Estate Agent, and I just closed a deal on the coolest 1950's house in this neighborhood. The buyer purchased the property to remodel it and re-sell it as an investment in a few months. I'm really excited about relisting the house when he's done and decided that part of the marketing strategy should include all of the cool restaurants, resale shops and hangouts that are in walking distance of the property! So as a good agent I set out on a mission with my partner in crime to sample the local flair.

Thanks to Yelp I decided to first try Mejico and boy am I glad we did! This 15 table restaurant has everything I love... a hipster atmosphere, cool little bar area,  and a small (manageable) menu with amazing food. The only regret I have is that I was driving and couldn't enjoy one of their signature margaritas.

I prefer not to say too much in reviews any more so you can judge for yourself, but if you Love this restaurant and neighborhood so much that you decide to move within walking distance too... give me a call and I'll show you what's available. 

Enjoy
