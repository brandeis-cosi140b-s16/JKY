So I haven't had the time to go into this new bar/ Mexican food joint! But My long term friend told me about the place, he currently is new chef and believe me when I tell you, this place well start booming in just a few weeks with him there, he's a young chubby guy Full of ideas and tasty Food knowledge, he's the reason why my place was a success, I had way to much things on my menu and my food expenses were threw the roof, I brought him in and he shorten my menu with foods that would sale, and foods that will help me sale more drinks at my bar, his food presentation are straight beautiful he gave my customers the idea that they were in a upscale restaurant not in a small family owned! ( his belief is you eat from your eyes aswel as your mouth, so the food has to look tasty) Try this place out guys you will not be disappointed! And if you have already gave up on this place give it one more shot, ask for chef Carlos aka Chef Charlie R! If your last visit wasn't all that great let him know and believe be he will do everything In his power to make this visit worth it! Tell him Johnny sent you.
