I love this Chipotle. The staff is fantastic, and even though it gets really crowded, especially at lunchtime, the line always moves quickly. The parking lot is really small, so you may have to park in the Qdoba lot (be sneaky about it), or drive around for a while until a spot becomes available.

I usually get a veggie burrito bowl, but I love the barbacoa (spicy shredded beef) as well as the carnitas (shredded pork). Their salsas are always delicious. I especially enjoy the fresh mild and the corn salsas. Their fresh guacamole is by far the best "take out" guac I've ever had. I just can't resist it.

There is plenty of seating at this location, even though though the parking can be a bit of a problem. But really, the staff is the best part. They are always attentive and friendly. It's always such a nice experience. I try not to go more than once a week!
