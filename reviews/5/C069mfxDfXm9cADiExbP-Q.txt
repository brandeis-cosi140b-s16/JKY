WOW!!! Thanks Garcia's!!!  I hosted 42 people for a surprise party for my wife's 40th birthday and thanks to Garcia's excellent service and hospitality it was a total success.  Michelle, the Restaurant Manager couldn't have been more accommodating.  Having to deal with the stress of a surprise party was enough.  But when I showed up the day of the party I was given personal service by server Wendy who helped me blow up balloons, hang banners and was there dedicated to my party the whole night.  No one could quit talking about how good the service and food was.  I can't begin to give Garcia's the appropriate recognition for making one of my wife's most important days as memorable as possible.  AWWWEEESSSOOOMMEEE!!!!!!!!
