I love it here. Been coming for months and I've never had a bad experience. Their carne asada is top notch and no matter what you get it won't disappoint. If you're looking a top notch sanitary experience coupled with unauthentic Mexican food, stay away nobody wants you here anyways. Cantina Loredo has a spot reserved for you. Just look at the place, you know what you're getting yourself into.. Don't let that deceive you from the gem that's inside!
