So I stopped in here for lunch on a whim and so glad I did. I will definitely be back. I'm somewhat of a Mexican food snob in the way that the only thing I don't like about Mexican food is when someone tries to Americanize it. That is definitely not the case here. Authentic, legit, simple, no fuss Mexican grub. I had barbacoa taco and a chicken quesadilla with the best sour cream and gauc I've had in a long time. But the shining star? The cream of poblano and corn soup! According to my delightful server, I didn't get his name but he was awesome attentive and informative, it's award winning and completely vegetarian....and absolutely de-lish. The broth was thin and light with fresh cilantro but not too much to become overpowering and the spice from the poblanos was perfect. Muchas Gracias La Palapa para almuerzo. (I only had 3 years of Spanish so if that doesn't translate right, blame Se√±ora Flasco)
