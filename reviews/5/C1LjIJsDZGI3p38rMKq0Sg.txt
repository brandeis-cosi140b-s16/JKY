Got 2 of their chicken chipotle tamales at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market. I should have listen to the guy and got more!! 
They were delicious! The masa was fluffy not too dry or creamy and it had flavor to it. The filling was just right spicy and made with white meat, no fat. 
Next week I'll get a dozen... Or two, who knows?
