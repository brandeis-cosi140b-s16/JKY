Chipotle just flat out rules. They are finally starting to pop up around Pittsburgh. Coming from Denver, CO ( they are as popular there as Starbucks in Seattle ) Chipotle blows away the imitators - Qdoba, Baja Fresh, CA Tortilla. Not even close. 

A great tip is the Chicken Tacos, but add rice and black beans.
