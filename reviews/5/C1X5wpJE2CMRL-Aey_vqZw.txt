I am usually pretty stingy with my five star ratings, but this place deserves it.
The food is consistently delicious and yes, spicy which is how I like it. Warning, even their beans have a little spicy kick to them. Don't go here and ask for something that is not hot, I don't think they would understand.
My favorite thing about this place is I dont even get a menu anymore. The servers know what I want. Great job, Johnny and staff.
