WOW! That was some good authentic Mexican food. The staff was friendly and the food delicious. The serving sizes are filling and I LOVE to eat! Although I was full I wanted more... You guys got me hooked. So glad a friend recommended eating there. 

This place is located inside the boulevard mall food court. DONT PASS THIS PLACE UP! I am salivating like crazy just writing this :-/
