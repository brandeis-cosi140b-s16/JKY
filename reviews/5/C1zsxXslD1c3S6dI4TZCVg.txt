Food is great! I had the chorizo burrito, which wasn't anything special but still good. I had a bite of my husbands chicken tacos and it was delicious! The taco was crispy and flavorful. We also had the chips and guacamole. The guacamole was amazing! The inside was clean and well lit. Tables and booths were all spotless. Definitely my new favorite authentic Taco shop!
