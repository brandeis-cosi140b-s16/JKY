Pros: $3 margaritas, awesome nachos, great service!

Cons: None.

So glad that this excellent space was taken over by an area-appropriate hang out spot.  Paz has some of the best nachos around, my weakness.  Good selection of street style tacos, and good drinks.  The house marg is a great deal, and although the bar is small, they have a couple TVs playing random music videos or the occasional game.  Great place to plop down for an easy weekend brunch if running around downtown.

Parking:  You park kind of behind and to the side of the building.  The parking lot entrance is an immediate right off of 3rd st just north of Roosevelt after the traffic light; 3rd street is a one-way street heading north.  Or, if you want to act like a local, turn north on 5th street off Roosevelt and take the first narrow little left, which will lead you to the same lot.

Thanks to the staff, and to DJ who made us fans on our first visit!
