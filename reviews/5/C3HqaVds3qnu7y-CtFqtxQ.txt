Still amazing! This gem is operated almost entirely by females and they are upbeat, happy, courteous and very, very nice. The feel is local and you can tell everyone loves working there (I think it was even the same people working there from our last trip to Henderson in December 2013 so they have low turnover).

Great job, excellent store - well kept and supplies always neatly arranged and full.
