This is the ghettoest burger joint I think in the whole world. From the outside, there is no way 99% of respecting human beings would dare walking in and ordering something. But I was confident in my fellow yelpers reviews and gave this place a shot. Ordered a 3/4 lb triple burger with bacon and large chili cheese fries. Very very good. I don't think 5 people could have finished the fries. It's way too much. Huge juicy patties and with all the fixins you want on it. Note to self, when ordering "large" from a hole in the wall, ask how big the large is. It's not always McDonald's large.
