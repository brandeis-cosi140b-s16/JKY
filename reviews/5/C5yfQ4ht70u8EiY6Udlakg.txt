LOVE LOVE this place. It is family owned & operated. It's so authentic and I've never had a bad experience. The food is Amazing. Try the cheese dip!! The salsa is home made and very tasty and addicting. The margaritas are killer!!!!! Everything is also very reasonably priced. The service is always very good.  I  Eat here usually once a week. It's always clean  and I love the decor ! It makes me feel like im in mexico as soon as I step in the door. I'd recommend this place to anyone !
