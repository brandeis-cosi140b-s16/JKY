All I have to say is YUM!!! Wonderful food, great drinks, and top notch service. It's a bit of a "hole in the wall" if you will.  Not a dive, just hard to find. Tucked away on a busy street surrounded by medical/business offices. Glad we found it. Wonderful food, nice atmosphere and great service. Can't wait to make an excuse to go back. It's a bit far from my local fair, but I have leftovers!!! Either way, I am winning!!!
