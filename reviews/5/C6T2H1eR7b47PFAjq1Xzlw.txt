I can't say enough about how delicious all the food is here.   It's a step away from traditional Mexican food in a delightful tapas themed fusion. I have yet to taste anything here that has not made me smile..  Service is top notch and with a smile.  A big fan of the sword fish tacos and shrimp ceviche..  Two thumbs up from this yelper!
