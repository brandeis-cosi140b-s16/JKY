I ate here last night for the first time, and absolutely loved it. I didn't know what to order or even what the concept of the restaurant was really about, but my server Kayla Ortiz was extremely helpful. She answered my many questions and I ended up letting her pick out everything I ate and drank, and loved everything she chose.
