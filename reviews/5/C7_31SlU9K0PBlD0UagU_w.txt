This place is amazing...you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  The chicken and steak are both good, but you have to get the pork barbacoa...its the best!  Sweet taste to it and its undescribable...you'll thank me later!!! :)
All the meat can be either in a salad, burrito, or taco entree.  Like I said, you can't go wrong with either of those and the hand made tortilla's just make it that much better!
Great place to eat, I'm a big fan...every city I travel to I try to find a cafe rio.  Finish your meal off with the coconut flan...to die for!
Enjoy because I know I am!
