This place is amazing.  The food is truly authentic and offers a wide variety of good, home-style Mexican food.  Los Taquitos was featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and is constantly busy.  My favorite dish they offer is the carne asada sopes; I also really enjoy the ceviche. However, they do cook up a mean breakfast burrito.
