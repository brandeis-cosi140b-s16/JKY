Tried this place for the first time today with the family. The place was small but very clean. We arrived when there weren't too many people there. We were greeted by the gentlemen who worked there who very friendly. They had a wide variety of items that range from "boygers" to pizza. Me and the family each had their boyger meal (I ihad the monster size which was recommended by Abel the cook.)Our food was made to order and it was worth the wait.  I have to say that the "boygers" here are the best I've had in a long time. Its a little ways away from my house but it was worth the drive. I will definitely come here again.
