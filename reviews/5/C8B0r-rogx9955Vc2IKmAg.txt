Still great service and great food. I usually get the original fish taco or fish taco especial. I wanted to try something different and the manager behind the counter started making suggestions and describing some of the entrees. I went with  Ancho Citrus Shrimp Burrito. It was great. The sauce goes well with the shrimp, lettuce and rice. I would get it again and recommend it as well.
