First time here. Yum yum but expensive!

I wanted to try all of their meats so I got the tacos with each meat and wow was it yummy or what?! 

Also got their coconut bark and pumpkin spice bark I think it was called. I really LOVED the coconut bark..not so much the pumpkin spice one...that one just sounded yummy but I'm not really a pumpkin lover. 

I can't wait till they open one closer to me in Henderson!
