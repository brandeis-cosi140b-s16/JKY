Here for lunch and was a little leery with the parallel entrance...but it was great authentic food and atmosphere. I m so used to using sour cream, salsas, guacamole, but this food was so flavorful I didn't need it. Had 3 different tacos (pork, braised beef, chiles) and they were all awesome. Also had the Brazilian Waxx to drink and it was good but expensive ($14). Loved the place and will b back when in town for business.
