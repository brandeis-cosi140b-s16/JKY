My husband and I were curious when we saw the signs go up... a few weeks later we had a menu on our door and low and behold a Mexican restaurant that delivered to us?!?!?!  We finally ordered tonight after a long work week and a crazy 2 year old that we didn't want to take out to dinner.  I called for delivery and was told there was no driver this evening.  I asked if this was the norm and the gentleman who answered the phone asked if we lived far and the size of the order.  He took our number and asked if it was ok to see if anyone could deliver and he would call us back within five minutes.  He called back a minute later and took our order.  He was kind, concise and a pleasure to speak with.  Our order was delivered in 20-25 minutes.  Although the portions were smaller than anticipated I would rather take quality over quantity.  Having DELICIOUS Mexican food delivered is UNHEARD of!  I can't wait to come dine in the restaurant for the full experience.  S. Tempe is lacking in decent Mexican food and I sincerely welcome their presence (especially after a sickeningly awful experience at a local chain located on Rural and Guadalupe where we were stereotyped for having a child.) Much appreciated service!!!
