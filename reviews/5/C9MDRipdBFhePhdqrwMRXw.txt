Modern open clean space but not too sterile.  Comfortable booths.  Server Tim was on top of his game-  attentive and friendly.  Nice to be offered chips with 3 different dips free of charge.  Food was great and very affordable.  Hubby had the brisket burrito and loved it, I had the veggie burrito which was HUGE and all ingredients fresh and delicious.  We both had the sangria's which were perfect.  Owner, Lenny stopped by the table to make sure we were enjoying everything and if there was anything he could do.  Really nice easy dining experience, will definitely come again and absolutely will recommend to everybody we know.
