My fiancé and I come into Ajo Al's monthly. He enjoys the chicken and steak fajitas while I like the chicken enchilada with jalapeño cream sauce over the top. The hot salsa is his favorite and he asks for the larger one. The spinach queso dip is an awesome appetizer that everyone usually enjoys. We will continue to make this place our go to and we plan on coming here for the years ahead!
