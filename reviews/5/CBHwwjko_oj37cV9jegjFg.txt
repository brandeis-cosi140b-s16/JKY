Pumking on draft, apple cider margaritas through September and the Gobblerito-what more could you want?!! This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and so happy they opened this location in Shadyside which is much bigger and more open than the one in Oakland.  The happy hour specials are great-1/2 all drafts (they always have a great selection of beers), $7 big ass margaritas, and 1/2 priced wings. I usually get the $3 little butt margaritas on happy hour special so that I can try a few flavors including the new Sangria margarita. It wasn't as good as I was hoping but worth the try. The apple cider one is delicious with a sugar mixture around the rim to top it off.  Of course the Gobblerito was fantastic and worth the try even if you are a little hesitant.
