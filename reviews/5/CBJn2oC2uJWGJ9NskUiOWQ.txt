this is one of the best family restaurants in the Valley.well managed, clean restrooms, spotless dining area, well lite, and superb customer service. our family dine here at least once a week. last week,  i ordered a huge order through the Drive Thru: 6 soft chicken tacos, 3 foot long chik burritos, 2 wet burritos, taco salad, 1 carne asada with rice and beans, and 2 foot long beef burritos. i only waited for less than 10 mins from start to finish. the staff is very kind, prompt, friendly, and never gives me a hard time for redeeming the Mailer Coupons. they also give you REAL salsa with each order in one of those Ice Cream single serving styro cups - hot or mild! their catering is a fantastic deal. they pack it extremely well for transporting and the meats were just as tender, soft , juicy, with little bits of burnt crust from being on a real grill. my office staff loves it , our neighbors are addicted to their foot longs, and i am no longer a slave to the hot oven/stove during hot summer days for my 4 kids! thank you so much Baja Taco!
