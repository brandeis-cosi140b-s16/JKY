Been searching for a Mexican restaurant since we moved here 8 months ago. We finally found it!
Tried it for lunch.  Great outdoor area. nice
atmosphere, very clean. 
Everyone was very friendly, fast service,
white cheese dip vs yellow...we loved that!
Complimentary chips, salsa & bean dip. 
I ordered the Vegetarian Burrito, it was delish! It was also huge! The tortillas were fresh and homemade.
Hubby ordered the special...both were $8.99ea, so much food, took half of each home. 
Didn't try the margarita's this time (a little early) but sure will next time..soon!!
