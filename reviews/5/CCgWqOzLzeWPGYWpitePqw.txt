Maybe I'm biased, but I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars! You see, I'm a California transplant to the East Coast, and let me tell you their Mexican restaurants are terrible!!! While I was in Phoenix, I specifically asked the hotel receptionist about a really good Mexican place and she directed me to Arriba's

I had the white chimichanga and asked them to substitute the pork with chicken, which they had no problem doing. It was fantastic!!! I also ordered a margarita, which was huge!!! and also very good. I wanted to order the flan, but I was so stuffed from good food that I couldn't even order dessert. 

I ate with a co-worker and unlike one of the other reviews, they did not have an issue with splitting our bill. 

I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix area... you won't be disappointed.
