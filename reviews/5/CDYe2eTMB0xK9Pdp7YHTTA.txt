We ordered a chicken burrito and a bean/guacamole/pico de gallo/cucumber burrito, plus a medium and  large horchata drinks. Generous sizes on food and beverages. Came with a pinto bean soup, chips and salsa, and plenty of cukes, red onions, and lime. We both enjoyed our meals. Our waitress was attentive and obliging. The smell of the grilling smoke is almost worth a visit. Near airport car rental so great place for a quick bite before hitting the road.
