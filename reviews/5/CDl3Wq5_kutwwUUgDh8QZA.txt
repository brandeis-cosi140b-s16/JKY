Being from San Diego ever time I get wasted in Vegas or  meet up with friends that have never had Carne Asada Fries or a California Burrito, I take them here to try it. For some reason I don't eat much in Vegas. I just drink or drink and gamble and I guess I just forget. But for some reason when I leave the club wasted late at night, I some how remember and have to go to Felipito's. No matter at what cost.  

Most of the time I take a cab there. One time I made the limo driver go there and pick up some burritos and fries for my friends and I.
Another Time I was to drunk and no cabs would pick me up. So I deiced to walk all the way from MGM. Some how I didn't get jumped or arrested and enjoyed my cali burrito.
