We overheard a car salesman talking about this restaurant and it just so happened we were hungry for lunch.  He gave us directions and off we went on a lucky adventure.  It seemed like a run of the mill fast food place but NO it was not.  Clean as a whistle and very good service at the counter.  I felt like I was in Mexico and so I had to ask a lot of questions.  The tortas are amazing, fresh tortas made on premises and flavor of the shredded pork was so good.  The Tacos de Ribeye were delicious & my tostada was piled high with fresh avacado with a hint of citrus maybe lime squeezed on top. We also tried the empanadas for dessert...YUM!  Don't think Mexican when you go there think "Mexico"...Authentic Mexico!  Don't miss the salsa bar and if you can afford the calories have a fresh strawberries and cream milkshake.
