Really Really Crap Decor. Lousy Parking Lot. I liked the first Weinershnitzel location on the corner better. Hard to find for friends who are first timers! Same applies for the South Central Location... except the decor is fun there.

But who cares! Just say Carne Adovado Ribs...or burrito...or whatever, and stick an egg on top. I have driven hundreds of miles to come back for those, and if I was in NYC, their now-closed outpost was salvation. And, when I first visited Santa Fe, and started touring their restaurants, I was able to say..."hot...You think this is hot? You need to try Los Dos Molinos!!!"

I remember watching my father sweat for hours when he first tried the hot sauces, and they haven't changed one bit. 

Margaritas are cloyingly sweet, but who cares...with the hot sauce and spices in the dishes, the sweetness actually works, and its about the only place where that doesn't upset me.

This might be consistently the worst balanced pitcher of margaritas i ever order, and when I am here, I enjoy every drop!!!!!!!!!!

The service can really suck on a weekend night on Central, but they're nice about it, and they've been putting up with me for 25 years now since they opened in Mesa.

And, after 25 years, I love seeing Vicky in the kitchen with a picture of the French Country house on the wall outside to show its been worthwhile for her too- well done. Because you've brought culinary joy to my life since you came down from Springerville.
