My partner and I have been coming here for two years now.  Their food is always delicious, we are big fans of their fausto breakfast burritos and tacos.  I've never had an issue with their food or customer service.

Their customer service is always great, I train guest service standards on the strip that correlate with that of Forbes and Triple A and faustos is on point.

Thank you for the great service and food!
