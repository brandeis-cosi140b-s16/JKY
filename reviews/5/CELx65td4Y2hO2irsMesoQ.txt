I have eaten in this restaurant for three lunches in a row and brought 3 other people with me in the second trip and 5 other in the third. In short, everybody loved the food and was extremely pleased about our choice to eat here. Nothing really disappointed however the hot bowl of mixed seafood and melted cheese was my personal favorite. When things get complicated , it might be useful to know a bit of Spanish but for the most part that's not needed. Probably left the highest percentage tip I've ever left in our third visit.
