Do you ever get so hungry /hungover/ had too much coffee that you need an emergency taco?

This is my go-to rescue place.  It's charming inside, and has a small patio.  The street tacos are right-sized and right-priced.  And damn tasty.   

 I recommend the pastor.  Don't be afraid to try something new people.  How many chicken tacos can one person eat?  Be adventurous - get a sope or a torta.  You won't be disappointed.
