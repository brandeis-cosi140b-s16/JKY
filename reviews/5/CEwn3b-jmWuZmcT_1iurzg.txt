The six of us came here after going to Sugar Factory and having a negative experience due to the hostess Hilary to where we could not even dine. The service we are receiving here is excellent from hostess, our server Alicia, bussers, and food. We will come back here next trip which is already scheduled. Atmosphere is great, upbeat. Good mix of music.
