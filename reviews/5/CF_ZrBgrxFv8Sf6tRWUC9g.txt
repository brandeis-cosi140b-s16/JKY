Tasty Mexican food served by a friendly staff. I had the soft chile relleno.  It was the perfect balance of chile, cheese & egg batter. Yummy!! My husband's plate had so many scallops & mushrooms he shared them with me.  They had a big selection of margaritas and desserts. Maybe next time for those. It's easy to overlook El Mescal tucked away in the strip mall on Durango near Peace Way, but DON'T.  We'll definitely be back.
