They have brought good food to Maricopa!!! Thank you for doing it right! As with all the other locations this is another in a long line of good food venues! 

As I walked in I happy to see that there was a lot of people who like good for you food. On the other hand I was shocked at how many people were in here to get some Chipotle and how long the line was. It moved pretty quickly and I had my food soon enough. 

Everything tastes great and they didn't break open my colossal burrito when closing it up. Got it home and was really happy chomping down my monster burrito. Thanks again Chipotle!!!
