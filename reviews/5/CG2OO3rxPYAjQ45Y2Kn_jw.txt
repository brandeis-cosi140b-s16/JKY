This was my first time here, and I went on their soft opening. Right away I notice the really cool art work on the walls and their cute lunch truck inside. The atmosphere was really fun and the owner Javier was super nice and sweet! They were giving out free beer and sangria on top of some free appetizers. Place was pack and everyone seem to be enjoying themselves very much and having such a great time. Towards the end of the night I got to try their food. Had their Mexican corn on the cob with mayo and cheese, yum. Then I tried their 3 taco plate combo, 1 chicken mole, 1 veggie and an alpastor taco. Loved them all very good flavor. Over all cannot wait to come back again and try more of the food they have to offer.
