I realize now that I've never had great Mexican food after eating here.  this restaurant is outstanding! Great food and excellent service. We ate here two nights in a rowland didn't scratch the menu's surface. bar available and take out. If you want excellent Mexcian food and not Americanized crap, eat here. It is my new fave!
