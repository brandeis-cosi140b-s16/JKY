What a great venue!  Saw Charli XCX there last week and it was my first time.  It is REALLY easy to get a drink and they make good drinks.  There's a cordoned off area in front of the stage that is accessible to anyone not currently in possession of alcohol.  There are bleacher-style seats in back if your tootsies get tired.  And FOOD (real food - not concession food) available.  Looking forward to coming back.
