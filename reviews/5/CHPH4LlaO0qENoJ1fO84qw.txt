A great little hole in the wall with excellent food! I had one of the combination plates - a taco and an enchilada. It was excellent! T came with refried beans and rice, both of which were on the same level as any I've had down in Mexico itself. I ordered the taco to be chicken, which was very tender and tasty. The enchilada was cheese, my favorite, and was just as good as any I've had south of the border. The chips were thin and crispy, just like I like them and the salsa had an excellent bite to it. Overall, the best Mexican food I've had since coming back from Baja last October. If you like good, real Mexican, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the "dive-y" look deter you from pushing the door open and going in. You won't be disappointed either! 

Oh yeah, they have real Mexican Coca-Cola in a bottle, too. If you've never had one, you'll be surprised at how different they taste from our Coke in the U.S. Try it!
