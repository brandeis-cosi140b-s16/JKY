You get what you expect here. And that's why I rate it so high. It's simple fast Americanized Mexican food. 100x better than Filibertos and the same price or cheaper. All locations I visit are clean and well kept and the staff are often friendly and personable. The prices are unbeatable--$4 for a breakfast burrito!?!?  It's not gourmet, but against other "fast food" type places its tasty, consistent, and quality. I am glad I have this place in my community, it's one of my favorite regular quick breakfasts or dinners--and it doesn't break the bank. 5 stars for doing perfectly what they do.
