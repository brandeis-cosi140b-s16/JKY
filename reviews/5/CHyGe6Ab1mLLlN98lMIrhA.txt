I am not really a mall shopper ... SO.... I do actually go to Chevy's just because it is Chevy's.  
Why?
Let me count the reasons...

1. Salsa and Chips : most people think that you can never go wrong with this combo ... but I have been to restaurants that HAVE. Chevy's is consistent and I love their salsa. It has great flavor and I want to eat it on everything including salad.

2. nachos - I love that they are made individually. Each chip has all ingredients right on it. Perfect little combinations that just go YUM in your mouth.

3. Pineapple-Coconut Margarita... mmmmm get me some of this RIGHT now. This is so tasty and good I get the fishbowl size margarita and I am not a drinker.  Chevy's is one of the only places i make an exception for drinking alchol.

4. Chicken tacos - I am a creature of habit. SO ... I order one of like three dishes at chevy's the chicken tacos are AWESOME . 

5. fajitas - with steak and shrimp combo.  so yummy i don't even have to futher explain it. 

ok it is a short list. .. but they are 5 amazing reasons to bring your munch on!
