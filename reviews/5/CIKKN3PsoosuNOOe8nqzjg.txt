This is a pretty good place to eat.  Plus they have this little mini bar area too, but I do mean mini.  

My favorite,  or at least one of them is the super nachos minus the nacho cheese sauce and replaced with real cheddar cheese.  AWESOMMMMME. The chicken or shredded beef are both tasty. 

It's always quiet,  no lines or long wait for your food.  They have a TV that is usually playing sports recaps or something so that's nice too.

The staff will do anything to make your food the way you asked for it and don't mind changing something small to accommodate.
