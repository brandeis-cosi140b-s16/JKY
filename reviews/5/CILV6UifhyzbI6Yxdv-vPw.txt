It was delicious. We had the lunch special
#1 and #10. I had the green burro, husband had the red burro. It was so good!! We tried the green corn tamale as well. We also had a bean tostado which was really good too. The only thing was there is no refill on drinks or the chips and salsa. They make you pay $2.25 for additional chips which is silly. Other than that we will ne back for sure!!!
