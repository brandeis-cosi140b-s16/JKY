I think this place should receive Taco Bell of the year award. Talk about an amazing staff! Inside or in the drive thru you're greeted with the most positive, delightful energy! These girls here are incredible! The food is always good, never sloppy. After eating a taco here once I could never return to the del taco around the corner. Instead of tacos that have been vomited up and sat on, these are made with love! (As much love that can be given to fast food) I really hope these ladies get recognized by their manager or company for amazing customer service and awesome attention to detail. It shows! Thank you ladies
