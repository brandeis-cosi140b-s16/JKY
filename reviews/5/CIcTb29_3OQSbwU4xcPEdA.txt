Have visited several times and every time I am so very AMAZED at how delicious this food is! I always get the quatro taco plate. and I absolutely LOVE the mild guacamole salsa! the chips are always fresh and warm. It can get pricey but I would say worth it. Went last night and I can't wait to go back! Will definitely have to go for breakfast one day soon! I LOVE EL TACO TOTE!!!!
