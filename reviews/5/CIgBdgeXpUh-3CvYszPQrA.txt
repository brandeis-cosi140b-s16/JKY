If you are looking for a whole in the wall Mexican place that serves fresh and authentic food located in the East Valley, Salsa Cabana is a great place.  I would recommend coming here for lunch as they have amazing lunch specials of $4.95, which comes with chips and salsa and a drink.  I got the chicken tacos with rice and beans.  It was a perfect sized portion for lunch.  The chicken was white meat and fresh.  They have a tomatillo green salsa and fire-red hot salsa.  

I usually do not put a big weight on drinks, but they have mango infused tea.  The tea was very refreshing and tasty.  It is all natural with no sugar.  The tea gives it the 5th star.

My friend got the chicken enchiladas, and they looked yummy.  I will have to order cheese or chicken enchiladas next time, yum!
