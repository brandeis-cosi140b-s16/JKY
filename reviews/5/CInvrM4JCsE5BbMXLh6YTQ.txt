It's a Mexican bar and restaurant. What can go wrong?  In this case, nothing. 

I love the chicken taco salad and the fish tacos. Marteen is always quick and generous when pouring drinks.  Try one of his Margaritas.  You won't be disappointed!  The chips are made fresh and there is a great salsa bar to compliment your meal. Beware the chips are addicting. But that's part of the gig at a Mexican restaurant. 

This is a good place to enjoy the beautiful Arizona evenings on the outdoor patio.
