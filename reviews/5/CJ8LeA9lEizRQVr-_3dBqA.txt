I haven't been in Rubio's in a while, and I was driving around starving and decided to settle on some chicken flautas.  I stumbled on a Rubio's that happens to be down the street from my house.  
After a quick glance at the menu, I realized they have completely changed their menu!  After a second glance, I realized this was not a bad thing at all.  They had some really incredible choices and being that I was so hungry, this made my decision incredibly difficult.  I finally decided on a two taco plate with one portobello and poblano taco and one avocado and corn fish taco.  And let me say, I couldn't decide which was better!  The fish was crispy and not at all greasy and the porotbellos had amazing flavor.  After my first bite, I immediately began to wish I had bought more food, even though I ended up full after the meal.  
There were so many other delicious looking options (including a summer orange shrimp salad that I can't wait to go back for) and the best part was that without even trying, I managed to end up picking a fish taco made with sustainably farmed fish.  Bonus because I love companies that are making an earth-friendly effort.  
The staff was very friendly and my food was ready so quickly (but didn't taste like it had been made earlier and sitting around).  Best of all, the salsa bar, which makes me worry, since I never know what other customers might have done to it, was very clean and fully stocked.  Nothing had migrated from one spot to the other (like when you find peppers floating in the salsa because a customer has dropped them in there) and everything looked fresh.  
All in all, definitely check out Rubio's new menu because it may be your new go-to spot for quick, fresh, Mexican food!
