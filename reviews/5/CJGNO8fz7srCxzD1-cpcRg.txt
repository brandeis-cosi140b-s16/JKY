Chipotle meals are always amazing.  However the staff here is what I love.  I probably spend more time here than I should and the staff has gotten to the point that they recognize me and are super friendly.  They've even kicked me some free guac once or twice, which is really not expected and absolutely appreciated (and tipworthy of course!)
