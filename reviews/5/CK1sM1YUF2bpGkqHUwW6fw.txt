You cannot do better than Johnny Burrito for good food, fast! 

Owner, Johnny Bitten, is a WONDERFUL man and his employees have been there for as long as I can recall and they always seem happy. He has a lot of choices and they are not skimpy with toppings. 

I only have one check in here--I need to get better about that--but I eat here several times a month and am quick to recommend it to anyone new in my office. 

The line might look long, but they are SUPER QUICK! 

You can take it upstairs to the seating either in the Atrium or outside by the fountains as there is no seating at the actual shop, which I consider a plus!
