I have been going to La Pianta for the last couple of years for lunch. I recently stopped by for dinner and it was awesome. You are always seated quickly with servers bringing chips/salsa and taking your drink order. The margaritas are great and the serving size of the steak fajitas was overstuffing me, lol..
