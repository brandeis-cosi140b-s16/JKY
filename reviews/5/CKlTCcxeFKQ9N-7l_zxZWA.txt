My husband and I LOVE this place. The staff is great. The food authentic. I am Mexican from LA. I know what I am talking about. If you don't like it then you probably think Taco Bell is Mexican food. The staff is wonderful. I love the salsa. News flash people... you CAN mix them to get the right consistency that's good to you. I always get the chili verde burrito spicy. So delicious!
