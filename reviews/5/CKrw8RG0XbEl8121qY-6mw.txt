My hubby and I love this place, especially for breakfast!  If you have a hankering for a breakfast burrito, look no further than Salazar Bros.  We ordered the potato egg and cheese and added bacon to them.  Each burrito is huge so order one and split it if you aren't ravenously hungry.  I love their tortillas.  As a self proclaimed bean expert, their beans pass muster.  The inside is extremely clean, which usually means that the kitchen is also kept just as clean.
