Great tasting Mexican Food + Great service = El Picante

I found El Picante before I actually moved to the Henderson area.  El Picante is a favorite in the short time I have been here.

The owner is really nice and has created a great menu of great tasting food. I always get the #17 ( two meat combination platter)

They don't charge extra for sides like guacamole which is nice.

All in all this reminds me of SF Bay Area Mexican food; the taste is great and easy on the wallet.
