Went here for dinner the other night with coworkers. We were all in the mood for nachos and margaritas after a long work week and El Burrito delivered that and more! We added beans and chicken to the nachos (definitely was a must) accompanied by several different margaritas. One thing that stood out above the food (which was delicious) was the service. I literally felt like it was my family serving on me, they treated us like we were their own. Our server Francesca, I believe, and the bartender Nancee recommended the perfect drinks and even got us to order more food than the nachos which we did not regret for a second. I've been watching what I eat lately and they accommodated that with "Skinny Girl" margaritas, strong and no sugar! My kinda drink. Don't listen to the previous reviews- this place is a must try
