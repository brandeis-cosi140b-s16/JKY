I've had my fair share of Tacos in the valley and I always said to myself that there has to be a place that just amazes me. Well I found that place Taqueria Mi Casita is by the best taco joint I have been to. The meats variety is great and the flavors are truly authentic. very simple layout as far as the d√©cor of the restaurant but who cares when its all about the food. My favorite tacos are the Carne Asada and Carnita's. I usually dine in 2 times a week here.
