Our go to place for affordable (dare I say cheap?) TexMex.  Consistently good.  Not diet friendly, except the carne asada sans tortillas or the chicken burrito unwrapped from the huge flour tortilla.  Both are a low carbers dream.  Favorites when I do decide to indulge is the Fish burrito and the Shrimp Burrito (which breaks the cheese/seafood rule of thumb, but it works).  The breakfast burritos are outstanding.  Quesadilla's are huge and cheesy.  Quick service, reliable to go service which always get your phone orders right and it's almost always ready in 10 minutes.  Oh, and the Super Nachos are great.  Not healthy at all, but great.
