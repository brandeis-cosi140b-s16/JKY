Wonderful Mexican!! More authentic than other places in the area I have tried.  I've eaten here twice, once for lunch, once for dinner, and neither time did I leave wanting to kill myself!!  (Which I think is very important when it comes to Mexican)  Like the name says, the Senor knows tequila, so def try a marg.  They have a bit of a rush at dinner, so go early or later.
