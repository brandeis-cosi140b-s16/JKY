I haven't written a review in a while, but I wanted to break my silence to sing praises for this new Two Hippies location.
I love having a place in my neighborhood where I can get quality, veg-friendly "fast" food.  The menu offers vegetarian tacos, burritos, loaded quesadillas, veggie burgers and tofu "sloppy joe" rice bowls in addition to a full selection of meat for you carnivores!
