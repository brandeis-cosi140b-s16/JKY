I think this is one of my new favorite spots. I don't remember ever eating at a Rubio's before. I'm sorry I haven't.
I wanted to meet my girlfriend on her side of town for dinner and after bouncing around a few different choices we settled on this one. Great choice. I got the original fish taco 2 taco plate. I got it with rice and black beans. She got a bean and cheese burrito. We split an order of chips and guacamole.
Everything was so good. The chips were nice and crisp. They guacamole was fresh and very tasty. We thought it was a little small but then realized it was only a dollar so for that it was great.
The fish tacos were awesome. Perfectly battered. The sauce they put on them is so good. That is what puts it over the top. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice. Even when I got chips instead of the rice I substituted they had no problem switching it out. The prices are very reasonable too.
My girlfriend said she likes just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to come back and try more things. In fact I didn't. The next day I went to another location by me for lunch.
It may be a fast food chain but it is so good and cheap that I will be back again and again.
