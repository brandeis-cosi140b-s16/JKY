Some of the best barbacoa "de cabeza" I have ever had.  Since moving in to Phoenix, coming from a city that is close to the border, I have always been searching for this kind of meat.  I was able to find some Mexican places here and there but their meat was always dry and nowhere near as flavorful as this place. 

I even told the owner "there are some places but" and the owner finished with "but no one does it good." We both laughed.  I ordered 3 tacos and a torta totally underestimating the amount of meat that I was getting and took it home.  The amount of meat which I stuffed into the bread, to make the torta, was a ton and I still had enough to make another 6-7 tacos!  Satisfaction guaranteed.  No wonder this place has a solid rating.
