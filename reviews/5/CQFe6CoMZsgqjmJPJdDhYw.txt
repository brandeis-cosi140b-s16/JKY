If you haven't eaten here then you are missing out. BIG TIME! I guess it opened earlier this year and I would have probably noticed if they had some sort of signage on the back on the building they are in. This place is on Tenaya in a small business center. If you pass by on Add rd  near the 95 then you pass by this small business center and see on the back of the building Lino's pizza and subs (gross) and some nail salon yet nothing for El Regio. After passing back and forth twice like an idiot my wife finally spotted the place and they do have signage out front. 

We had a $10 for $20 yelp deal and after trying the food a deal isn't necessary to get me to eat here. I had a asada burrito and a shredded beef taco. The asada meat was so damn flavorful and they didn't skimp on filling the burrito up. The tortilla tasted awesome. my shredded beef taco was good but I'm not a fan of crunchy tacos too much so I would ask for flour tortilla next time. At the salsa bar I got some of their green sauce and it just might be the best I have ever had in my life. My wife really enjoyed her food too and has been asking when we are going to come back. They offer breakfast deals and make everything from scratch. There was even a Mexican soap opera on the tv while we ate that was very comical. Eat here!
