Living in Flagstaff for seven years, I would eat at Mi Pueblo every time I visited my folks in Mesa. I have tried a wide variety of selections from their menu, but I kept returning to the amazing fish tacos. Now that I live in New Mexico, where the very concept of fish tacos is all but unknown, Mi Pueblo is one of the places I miss the most. 

Unlike most places, the fish tacos here are not fried and are not cod. Instead, you get big pieces of perfectly grilled mahi mahi (I believe), topped with fresh cabbage, cilantro, tomatoes, lime, some kind of tartar sauce, and cotija. The flavor is absolutely wonderful; everything tastes fresh and crisp and healthy. No greasy, soggy fish patties here. This is real fish. 

I have never been anything but thrilled with a meal at Mi Pueblo. From the Mojarra Frita to the Chicken Avocado salad to the Ceviche to the Taco Salad to the Chicken Tortilla soup, it's all been good. I tend to gravitate more towards the Baja and seafood meals, as I have found this places a bit harder to find and Mi Pueblo truly excels in these areas. Additionally, they have a decent selection of beer and a fantastic salsa bar, offering several house-made salsas and sauces, pickled jalapenos and carrots, lime and cilantro. Everything you need, in other words, to doctor up your food to your own liking. This comes in especially handy for me, as I love spicy food and most places can't deliver that straight out of the kitchen. The prices here are very low for what you get. I actually can't think of any place that offers the same quality and quantity of food for a similar price. It's well worth a try if you're into this kind of cuisine.
