This place is ridiculously good. When you want some Mexican food that is fast and not some weak Americanized version (a la Taco Bell or Del Taco) THIS is the place. Other places in the country could take this food, put it on a fancy plate, and call it upscale Mexican food. We're spoiled to have such good Mexican food available to us, 24 hours a day no less. I love their carne asada, chimichangas, tacos, burritos, and horchata. If you like Mexican food you won't regret going here.
