Excellant food.  The hot sauce is really hot.  The fresh chips are thin anc crispy, not overly salted.   Wonderful mole.  The best shrimp tacos that I have ever had.....only surpassed by the blackened fish tacos.   Of the 20 people that we shared the meal with, all were very happy.  Very fast service and affordable.  The dining rooms is sparse and still has the same tables/chairs that the Hardees/Popeyes and other previous owners have used.  Though not comfortable, the food makes up for the lack of decoration.
