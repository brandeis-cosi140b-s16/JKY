Flan.  You guys.  The flan.  OMG.  Perfect ending to our meal.
From the quick and friendly seating to our very attentive server, to the fantastic food, everything was top-notch.
Chef Paco personally came out to thank us for our patronage and invite us back.
Ignore the location and follow your taste buds.  You will be well-rewarded.
