I've been going to the other Chino Bandito for years.  And I love it, love it so.... (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cHdJXLlKNWixBXpDwEGb_A).  Sure, it's a hole in the wall kind of place, but it worked.  My friend told me about their new fancy Chandler location (it's a 2nd location, not a replacement) and I figure I have to give it a shot.  

OH MY GOODNESS!

This place is a completely different experience than the Phoenix location.  Original Phx location - bad old linoleum floors.  New Chandler location - stained concrete.  Original - Limited seating, with tables and chairs seemingly borrowed from a church social.  New - Tons and tons of seating, in tables that look like they belong in a restaurant.  Original - Small spot in an old "seen better days" strip mall.  New - Really huge space in, well, a fancy new version of a strip mall behind a Walgreens

Thank goodness some things never change.  The food is just as great at this new location.  Mexican, Carribian and Asian all mixed together on one menu.  Jade Pork in a Quesadilla with Chicken Fried  rice and spicy black refried beans.  

If you're at all confused about how it works I suggest you either go to their web site to their "menu demo"  or better yet just go there one day for lunch or dinner.  Everyone will find something they like.

As Andrew mentioned, filling out the menu ticket isn't quite as important at this location, but I still absolutely suggest it.  Take a few, you and your friends all fill them out at the same time, debating the merits of each potential combination and then ya get in line to order.  It's half the fun.  And of course the other half is the eating.  Yum!
