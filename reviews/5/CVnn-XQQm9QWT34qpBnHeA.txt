After not going here in over a year after the worlds worst experience with the worst server ruining my bday dinner I decided to give it another try and pleasantly surprised! The food, service and staff were amazing! Ask for Arnolodo if you go, he's extremely knowledgable, outgoing and takes pride in Sol!!! I will definitely be returning with family and friends :D  

Great happy hour as well!
