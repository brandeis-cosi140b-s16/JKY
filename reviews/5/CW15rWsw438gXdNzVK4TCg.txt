Manager Kylie Miller is awesome!! On 1hour notice on a Saturday afternoon she was able to help us set up for a birthday party (original planned location had a fire and didn't notify us).  Kylie helped get our area set up and ready for a party of 15! Food was great as well. Thanks for saving the day!!
