One of my favorite local Mexican food spots.  Delicious and affordable food!  We stumbled upon this by accident because we had some random coupon and decided to try it.  

Favorites are the enchiladas the chimis and of course the street tacos. They are a sister restaurant to another awesome place, Morenos Mexican grill. So ordering a Sonoran hot dog is a must. So delicious.  

Great service too. We once ordered take out and they gave us the wrong order. We called them and they replaced our order quickly with no charge!   

We have also used them to cater a baby shower and they were awesome. All the food was prepared and fresh and all the guests were happy. 

Always a recommendation to out of town friends!
