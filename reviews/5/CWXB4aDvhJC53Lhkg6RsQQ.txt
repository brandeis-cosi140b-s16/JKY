I went here for the first time to honor my father after he died.  This was one of his long standing favorite haunts for good Mexican food.

I was NOT disappointed and could see immediately why he loved this place.

Come as you are; be in dressed to the nines or in your favorite worn to a frazzle blue jeans.  Just be sure to bring a big appetite because the food is tasty and plentiful.  Prices are very reasonable.

I had the chile relleno - very good.  Chips were thin, crisp and hot and never ending without having to ask for refills.

The ambience is fun and fabulous.  The decor is something right out of a sumptuous Mexican hacienda.  If you have never been to Mexico but would like the feel of  being there then this is the place.

Intimate rooms for a cozy tete a tete, large rooms designed to accomodate the largest banquet or charming out door seating plus a very friendly bar area.  Whatever type of dining experience you crave Tia Rosa's can accomodate you.

The wait staff was very attentive and the food and Margaritas were amazingly delicious!
