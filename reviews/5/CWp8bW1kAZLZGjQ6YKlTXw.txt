Alot of you might be wondering why i would write a review on a fst food chain like Rubios. Well if you have had Rubios Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos you know why I am writing this review. If you haven't had the Gourmet Steak or Shrimp Tacos then hold on to your tate buds because these bad boys are as good as they get. The Gourmet Steak is BY FAR the best taco, of any kind, that I have ever had. I'm not even going to get into everything that is in it, but when they ask you if you want the bacon in it say YES. This will be a taco that you crave, but beware at 340 calories per tacos if you eat to many you might pack on the pounds.

Let me know if you think these Gourmet Tacos are as good as I say they are.
