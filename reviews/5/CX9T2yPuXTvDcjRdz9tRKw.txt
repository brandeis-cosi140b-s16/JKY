I'm always hesitant to go to "high end" Mexican Cuisine restaurants, simply because I don't feel right paying more than $5 for 3 tacos or $10 for a torta. But was I pleasantly surprise to find this restaurant. My wife and I mainly went to try their Tequila flights, which by the way are great and reasonably priced, but we were so pleased with the cuisine that we return the following evening for dinner. Besides the great tequila and exquisite cuisine (what more can you ask for from a Mexican restaurant) the service was exceptional. Becky our waitress was very kind and informative and the one time she did not have the answer she went ahead and got the director of food services to answer it for us, now that's service. I strongly recommend Isla, if not for the cuisine go for the Tequila and the great service!
