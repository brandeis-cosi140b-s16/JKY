La Salsita is infinitely better than the Filiberto's across the street. The drive-thru takes about twice as much time to get through, but this is because they make FRESH FOOD. Real handmade corn tortillas, flour tortilla, AND chips, fried to order! Plus, their carne asada is ACTUALLY SEASONED! The best thing? CHILAQUILES! I haven't had anything here that I didn't love! I'm going to try the seafood specials someday, but I just haven't worked up the courage to order un-fried seafood through a talking metal box.
