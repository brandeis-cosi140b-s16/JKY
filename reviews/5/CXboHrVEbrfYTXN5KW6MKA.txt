I haven't been inside the store itself...but the taco stand. Holy shpimoly. My friend and I were wandering around the Strip District and after just eating a huge meal at Vietnam's Pho, we were pretty full. But when we saw someone walking by with a super delicious looking taco, we wanted to try them, and we found this stand. OMG. OMG. I literally foodorgasmed. The tacos were really cheap-- $3 a taco, I think $5 for two? They were freshly made right in front of us, and they were soo flippingly good, me and my friend couldn't talk for a bit after eating them. DEF coming back here!
