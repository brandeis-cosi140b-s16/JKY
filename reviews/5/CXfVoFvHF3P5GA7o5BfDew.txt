This is easily the best Mexican food in Arizona...All of the food was good and the sauce's are homemade..My daughter asked what something was on the menu and he brought her out a sample of it.. Not only that he brought us all a sample of every type there was so we could all try it..The food is priced lower then any Mexican place in Az but the quality is that of an expensive resteraunt..To top it all of we had ice cream which was only 3.50 compared to the normal 4.99 at any other Mexican food place and it was THE BEST FRIED ICE CREAM ever!!!! The service also was second to none!!!  Our new fave!
