That's one good things about being a restaurant critic or a fact checker! My wife and I believed that mexican food is great in this restaurant . I don't usually don't order other food than Green Corn Tamale. Although, my last try of  Carne Asada was not that good and our recent visit we found out that  both our forks was cleaned well. Still, I will give this restaurant a five star review because of your unsurpassed green corn tamale.  We will be back next time and check those corrections  and will be firm in making the next review. So, always on the look out, Keeps those utensils clean and maintain a standard in your food preparation. We promise we will come and visit again.
