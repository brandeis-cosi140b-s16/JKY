I absolutely LOVE this place. Downtown Gilbert has really needed a place that can make a good cocktail. The Mazaltan Mule and Pineapple Mojito are especially delicious. The food has been excellent. Wonderful tacos filled with very fresh fish or tender meat. The Rotisserie chicken is a very nice take on a classic American dinner. The staff is one of the shining points of this restaurant. All the bartenders are more than happy to serve up exotic libations with a smile.  joyride is a very welcome addition to downtown.
