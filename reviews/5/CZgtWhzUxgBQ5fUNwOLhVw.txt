I love this place. Seriously.
The decor is so awesome. Beautiful dark iron work throughout. I can't even describe. 
Truly has a luxe Mexican feel to it. 
Man, Austin restaurants should take note. Seriously. I love the atmosphere here. Check out my pictures. 

Also, one of the best salsas i've ever had. 

Food is clean and simple in style. Excellent mexican rice. Not  a fan of the beans but the food is top notch imo. 

The bar has these cool knobs all around it so there's always a place to hang your purse. I took a terrible flash picture of it. 

Love. This. Place.
