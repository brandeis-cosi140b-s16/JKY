I use to work in this area and hadn't stopped in for quite some time.  But boy I am glad I did,  the California burrito was delicious.  The salsa is great, especially the green one.  And the tortilla used for the burrito was perfect, not the kind that falls apart as your eating it.  Overall a great lunch.
