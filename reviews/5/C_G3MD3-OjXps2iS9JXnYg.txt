I work in this part of town and end up here on a pretty regular basis. they try to play themselves off as "Mexican fast food" but they are far from. their food quality surpasses anything in their category (Roberto's, don't tortaco etc.) the service is friendly and the food is priced very reasonably. their tacos are fantastic and cheap. the burritos are about the size and weight of a newborn infant. the caldo de res is always there for me to nurse my hangover. they have a large selection of agua frescas and Mexican style sodas but no fountain drinks. also their salsa bar is way spicier and more flavorful than any other taco shop. I've been there many times and will be back many more.
