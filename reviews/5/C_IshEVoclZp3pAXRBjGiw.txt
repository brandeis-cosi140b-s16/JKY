This is my favorite quick bite to eat in the area.  I stop in so much for the carne asada burritos that the guys there know me and always say hi.  

I'd say the only downside is they recently raised prices so it's not quite so easy on the wallet to get a meal anymore, but I live my life one burrito at a time and it works.
