Great Mexican food. Variety of dishes including seafood, beef & chicken. They have a gluten free menu and you can also get gluten free chips & salsa to start (no charge). Their regular tortilla chips have wheat. 
What sets this place apart is their options for side dishes. They have pinto beans simmered with bacon (so good), a potato side dish with cheese (again so good), cilantro white rice, regular refried beans, etc. 
The kids meal is a good size too. 
Service is always outstanding.
