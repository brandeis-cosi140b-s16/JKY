Just picked a random restaurant in the area and went to Salsa's.  They have a $6.99 fajita special on Fridays and it was great.  Plus a complementary full basket of nachos and salsa to boot.  I ordered the Mango juice and it came in a huge beer glass (2 pints??), couldn't finish it all.  I would definitely go back.
