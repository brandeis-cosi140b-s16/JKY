First off, let me say that I can count the times I have reviewed a restaurant on one hand.
I'm much more a word of mouth type person, even if I'm blown away. 
That being said, El Gran Taco has one of the best Green Chile Burritos in the valley. Why do I say that? Because the friends I've taken to El Gran Taco and I have had most of the rest available for sale. 
In my "greedy little green chile loving heart", I almost don't want anyone else to find out about them, but then again, something this great has to be shared. Right? 
I noticed that all the other reviews here are focused on the other, important, but slightly less "life altering" things about El Gran Taco. 
So with an overwhelming sense of civic duty, I now fulfill a much needed public service. An awareness campaign for deliciousness of the "chile verde" variety. 
I urge all citizens with taste buds, use this information for your own self assured happiness, and ... could whoever ends up ordering my medal of honor, after everyone understands how correct I am, please be sure and spell my name correctly?
