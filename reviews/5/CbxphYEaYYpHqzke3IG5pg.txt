First time in here and it was an amazing experienced. The chicken is on point! Nice grilled and really tasty. The owner was also there to assist us, and also hook us up. Really good customer service. I had a to go and the owner assist us with free drinks while waiting. Like whhhhaaaattt!!!! I can also see all the chicken getting grilled and chop! I will recommend this place to everyone especially if you work out "need some gains" and trying to get some grilled chicken for less price not having to do it yourself on your busy day. The owner was the Man! If I can give this place more than 5 star, I would!!! Specially coming from a business owner myself!
