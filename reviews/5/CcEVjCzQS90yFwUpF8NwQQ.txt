I have eaten here dozens of times...and always enjoyed it! I've come for breakfast, lunch and dinner and this place is almost always busy, which is obviously a good sign!

I've had everything from lingua tacos platter to   breakfast burros and pretty much everything in between. Things are always fresh and cooked REALLY well in all of my experiences. 

In all the times I've come here it's been clean, had friendly staff and most importantly AMAZING FOOD. Easily my favorite place for Mexican food in Copa and one if my top 5 in Metro Phx.
