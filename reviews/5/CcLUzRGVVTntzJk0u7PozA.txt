I love this place for Mexican food and have been going here for the past 7 or 8 years.  The service is always great whether you're with a large group or alone at the bar and the food is always great and served hot. 

If you're looking at drinks you have to try the prickly pear margaritas... Seriously. Now understand that I love prickly pear anything which is surprisingly hard to find out here, but this place has got the best ones. I mean it... With sugar on the rocks, please. 

This particular visit I ended up ordering the 2 item combo with a chicken enchilada and a tostada, which is pretty much my usual here. I enjoyed the chips and salsa while I waited for the food to come out, however this time they gave me both the regular chunky 'mild-ish' salsa along with the hotter stuff, guess they're starting to know me. If you like hot salsas be sure to ask for this, because they usually only serve the regular unless asked.  

Anyways, the food came out promptly and was exactly how I like it.  The tostada was crisp and the enchilada was full of yummy chicken (they don't skimp on the chicken or add weird fillers here).  All in all, I would recommend this place to anyone over one of the larger chains any day. You won't be disappointed.
