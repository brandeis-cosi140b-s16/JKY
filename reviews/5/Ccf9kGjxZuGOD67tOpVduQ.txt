HANDS DOWN THE BEST PLACE WE ATE IN VEGAS!!

Reminded me of home.. maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much. Hawaii is known for the fusion of food and people and I found exactly that in Vegas! The food is soo ONO (delicious)!!! and for the price the proportions were generous.. I was going to pack the left overs for the plane ride home! 

We went with a party of 9 so we made reservations- we heard it gets busy for dinner. The place was filled when we got there so good thing we did. You need to try the bulgogi nachos, the tacos and fried rice!!! There are different types of meats that you can get so have your party order different ones so you can try them all!! Service was EXCELLENT, our waitress (the owner) was very attentive and the food came out fast!

Hope they open one in Hawaii!!
