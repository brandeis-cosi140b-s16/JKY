A girlfriend and I first tried this little spot yesterday and OMG, it was amazing! We loved, loved, loved the service! The place was clean, the food was fast and the staff were very pleasant! There is a sweet older woman who refills your drinks, she doesn't speak English that well, but the way she makes sure you're taken care of makes you want to come back to the restaurant over and over. Whenever the staff is waiting on you, they are cleaning the restaurant. There was never a moment that I saw any of the employees just lounging around. That makes me as a customer more confident in the quality of the food. Speaking of the food, it was sooooo delicious! They start you off with the chips and salsa, which, I'm a huge wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but that was to die for! ;) Then we were offered the fried ice cream. I've never tried it before but my friend insisted. Like everything else, it's needless to say that it was scrumptious! I could keep raving about this place, but I got to get back to work. Lol!
