Love this place! So good! Very friendly service. Chicken is always tasty and lots of white meat. They always get our order correct and easy to order over the phone for pick up. We almost always modify something and they are always accommodating and super delicious! I get a custom veggie burrito with beans and pico. YUMMY! We eat here so frequently. Less expensive compared to Robertos too!
