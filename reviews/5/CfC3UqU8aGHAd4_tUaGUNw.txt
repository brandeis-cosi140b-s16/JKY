Friend of mine told me about this place having some bomb fajitas so we decided to done there. They light the food on fire! It was bomb cus it had shrimp, steak, and chicken in it. Now this time we brought some friends for the first time, I totally recommend this place. And the ceviche is excellent and refreshening with every bite!
