My husband and I had one of our first dates here....and we just about LOVED everything about this place. The location, the service, the quality, the ambiance - everything!

The service was amazing. I am not a big margarita person but I had quite a few that night and I didn't get heartburn. Plus the street tacos I had were so delicious!

I had their beef tamales and they were AWESOME and the most authentic I've had in Vegas.

Unfortunately, we now live on the other side of town but we always are looking for an excuse to go back.
