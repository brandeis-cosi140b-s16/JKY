I'm seriously a "Cafe Rio Addict" in need of a 12 step program.  No joke.  

We've lived in Vegas for 4+ years and it took me 3 years to find Cafe Rio...wow, how did that happen?  Since the first bite of their shredded chicken, I've been hooked.  I get their chicken tacos or their chicken enchiladas....always.  As a family, we share chips and queso fairly often and that's always yummy too.

I LOVE the punch card program they have....we rack up free meals regularly!  Love that!

Customer service is almost always fabulous.  I can only think of a couple of times that we had less than awesome service and each time I was thrown off because its just so out of place there. 

Give them a try....you won't be sorry!
