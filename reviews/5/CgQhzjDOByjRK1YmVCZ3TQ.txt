I've had Drs. appointments just north of this location for 2 weeks now.  When I'm done I always stop by for my two sides of Chicken.  I can't get over how FAST their line moves especially during the lunch rush.  
I DO WANT TO COMMEND the cashier Laura.  She is so friendly and she's the perfect person to have standing at the counter as you're leaving this establishment.  Thank you Laura for being so thoughtful, kind & always giving others your SMILE.
