This place has AMAZING food! The only downside is they are a little pricy but really the prices make sense with the quality if the food/ingredients.
I will say that I thought their margaritas all were pretty expensive. It would have been nice if there were some cheaper ones as well as the pricier/fancier margs.

Great place!
