I always get the no 4 two beef tacos rice and beans.  On a suggestion from a friend I tried the carne asada burrito. WOW this thing is fantastic. For the first time I was asking for more of the other ingredients other then beef crazy I know. But this thing is awesome. 

Have tried beef tostada, bean tostada, chicken rolled tacos, beef rolled tacos, beef nachos, chicken tacos, cheese enchiladas everything is really good.  

Life hack the nachos are so big they get soggy.
