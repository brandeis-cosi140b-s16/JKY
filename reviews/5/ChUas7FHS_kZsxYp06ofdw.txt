I've been meaning to write a review about Dimas Tacos for the last month and I'm happy to do it. As I sit here at Dimas I'm reminded of the first time I entered the  clean glass doors of this establishment. I was greeted with a smile and a hello. I didn't feel rushed like most places that employ teenagers who don't have a clue about customer service. Instead, I had the privilege  of having one of the owners ( Jennifer ) take my order. Angel, the other owner, manned the grill with the authority of a seasoned chef that he is. 
The food was prepared quickly and was absolutely delicious. I didn't realize how much I missed my mothers cooking till I savored my meal. From the fresh ingredients to the atmosphere I'm totally sold in this place. Robertos better watch out because I see a Dimas Tacos takeover in the future. 
Enjoy and tell Jennifer Tommy says hello.
