People that follow my reviews might notice that I eat a lot of Mexican food. I'm also a Mexican food snob and this place is fantastic!!!!

I live down the street and when I saw this small place I knew I had to try it. It reminds me of Chicago - my home town. 

I love the tacos, especially the tongue tacos. I order #6 very often.

I tried their burrito once and I wasn't a big fan of it but I think that's just an Arizona thing. Burritos in this area are made in a different style than what I'm used to back home. My friends from Arizona love their burritos.

I highly recommend and the prices are great.
