Ok, so I am sort of a tamale aficionado. My step mother makes REAL authentic tamales from her own family recipe. It is very unusual that I find one I like outside of her house. But I tried a sample of these at Momma's organic market one saturday morning, and I a HOOKED!! SOOO many to choose from . I brought home an assortment of half a dozed, plus I ate one there. They are the best anywhere! Many unusual and traditional combos. Cream cheese in a tamale?! Who da thunk? 
Sweet green corn is my favorite! 
Try them, you will be so glad you did!
