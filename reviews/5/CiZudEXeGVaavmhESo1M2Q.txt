I love everything about this restaurant! The decor, the vibe, the colors, the concept, the chefs, & especially the food!! Everything is fresh, tasty, & uniquely presented. I have been here 3 times now & have loved it better than the last. The menu is so expansive that it can please the choosiest of eaters. The food comes out quickly & the drinks are so delicious!! This is my new favorite place in town!! It's now open for lunch which is even more exciting! Keep up the good work because you have a hit on your hands!!
