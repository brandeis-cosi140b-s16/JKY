Quite literally some of the best mexican I have had!!! Oy!! The table side guacamole, the street tacos, the fajitas, and the fried ice cream were absolutely to diiiiieeeee for! Don't let the fact that it is next to a gentlemen's club prevent you from going. It is a must try and repeat! Absolutely can't wait to go back. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
