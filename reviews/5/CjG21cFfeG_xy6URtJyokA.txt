I have eaten here more times than I can count over the years. It is my favorite Mexican food of all time. And I travel a lot. The margaritas (although a bit pricey) are fantastic. I have tried many dishes but I can flat out tell you that the best one is the Carne Asada w enchilada (its a cheese enchilada, so I have them add a little meat to it.. just ask... they will) and it is to die for. The carne asada is so flavorful. I order it medium rare. If you don't ask, they might overcook it. I highly recommend this place.
