I remember back in the day when this location first opened. We're talking a few years back. There was this awesome manager there that comped my meal every time I brought in a new customer, as I insisted they'd like it better than Chipotle. They always agreed.

They are still doing a great job here and I come whenever I get the chance. Food is amazing and fresh. I noticed a fixed menu here that I haven't seen before. Have to try their veggie burrito. I am so used to building my own.
