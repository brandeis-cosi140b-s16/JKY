The interior looks a little like a rubios but it was actually so much nicer. We got here at 11 on a weekday and it was packed within 30 minutes.  The server was perfect - friendly but not intrusive. 

The food came out piping hot. We had the calamari fries. They were bigger strips but tender and flavorful. I really liked the aoli. 

Also had the scallops and chips. Felt a little overcooked but still tender inside. Did not care for the fries, they were bland and boring. The tacos looked amazing!
