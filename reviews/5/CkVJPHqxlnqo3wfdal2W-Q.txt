Never had anything but the fajitas here...because they are the best in town!  If you want multiple meats, ask for one pound of meat with half of it beef and half of it chicken (for example).  Cheaper than ordering 1/2 lb of each.  Good service.  Great salsa and salsa con queso.  I repeat, BEST FAJITAS!
