Just moved in down the road and was exploring the nearby restaurants. Stopped by Mejico for a quick lunch and was really glad I did. This will be my new go to spot. Had the Avocado Torta. Flavors melded together perfectly with just the right amount of spice from the jalape√±o.  The fresh made thick cut fries were excellent as well with the sweet mustard dipping sauce. Excited to go back again.
