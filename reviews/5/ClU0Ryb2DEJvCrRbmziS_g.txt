Great service and always amazing food! Chef Damon is a genius. Try the ahi tuna tacos, they've got a unique flavor and the blend of the tuna, guacamole, pickled onions and sauce is perfect! Watermelon margarita is my favorite, not too sweet and strong enough to knock your socks off after a couple. Never miss a chance of table side guacamole, it's made to order right in front of you and exactly how you like it and from there choose any entree. I have more than enough good things to say about cantina Laredo but the most important one is to go try it!
