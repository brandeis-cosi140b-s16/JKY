Sooooo good! The friendliest service and homemade and delicious food. The owner is always out and about visiting with the customers. You can't go without having the Mexican corn on the cob. I don't know how he does it, but any time of year, they serve the most tender white corn with all the delicious street-vendor white sauce and cheese. I sometimes order two of these and soup - they make delish albondigas soup. Great chips and salsa, free of course. Wonderful fajitas and sopapillas too!
