We ate there with a party of 8 and had the BEST service!! Christine was Super friendly and went above and beyond to make our experience absolutely wonderful! We had the sampler platter which was fabulous and the spinach dip was excellent too!! The tortilla soup is Fab!! There needs to be more people like Christine in the restaurant business! We loved her!! I would definitely eat there again to have great Mexican and wonderful Christine!!:))) Thank you!!! A+++
