The food was great ! Maybe not the chicken tacos but everything else was delicious! From the moment we walked in it was a great experience. Our server was absolutely fantastic such a kind man with excellent tips about the food! Thanks for the great experience, Angel! (I think that is his name) a complimentary bread pudding with vanilla ice cream, pomergrante a & pumpkin seeds! Yum!
