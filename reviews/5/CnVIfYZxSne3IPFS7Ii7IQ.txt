I know it's kind of funny to write a review on a Taco Bell because fast food is generally the same, but this location in particular stood out to me enough for me to still want to write a review a few days after my experience. 

I was in a rush and starting to feel hangry so I pulled into the quickest place I knew I could get something really fast from. Right away I was pleasantly surprised by the girl in the drive thrus demeanor. Very bubbly and patient. Didn't rush me through my order and even asked how my day was going. Nice. 

The rest of the drive thru staff was friendly as well. It was the first time I ever felt like I was getting the best service possible, at a fast food restaurant. Seriously. And I liked that my food came out looking nice as well. Normally my tacos and mexican pizzas are put together sloppy, but this place made my pizza look like something I'd buy at a sit down restaurant , making it so much easier to eat in my car!  Thanks again!
