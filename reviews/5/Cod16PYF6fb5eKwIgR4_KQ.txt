Needed to find a spot to eat breakfast today and relied on trusty yelp! Found this little spot in a strip shopping area. It didn't look like much outside but boy was I surprised! I got the breakfast burrito with chorizo and my husband ordered the huevos rancheros. Big portions and very good eats! Def recommend!
