Great food and service to be found at Los Dos Molinos.  Love spicy food and this place delivers.  Even "mild" has a kick to it.  Chase that down with some awesome margaritas and what could be better?  I recomend their adovada sauce.  Love anything they cook in that.  The relleno de carne adovada being my favorite choice.  Hot spicy goodness at it's finest!
