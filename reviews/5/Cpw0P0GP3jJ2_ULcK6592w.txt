I'm rarely on this side of town during dinner-time-hours but one late Tuesday night I was and we were craving Mexican food. A quick look on Yelp offered up Sabor and we decided to try it out. I'm so glad we did, the guacamole was amazing! Our waiter was very knowledgable and really seemed like he enjoyed working there. I will definitely return for another delicious modern Mexican dinner at Sabor.
