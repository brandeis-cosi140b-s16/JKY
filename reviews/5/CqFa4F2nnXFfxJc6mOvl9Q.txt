The BF and I LOVE this place!  Their Margaritas are great...and potent.  We've never actually ordered the chips and salsa, but they always bring us some anyway.  Their salsas are good....but not great.  I love that you choose what filling you want in whatever menu item you pick.  Another great spot for us vegetarians.  We've only been there for lunch, but I'd like to give their happy hour a try!  Definitely recommend!
