My husband and I went to Macayo's for our one year anniversary because Mexican food is our favorite. I really was expecting it to be sub-par, seeing as it is a commercial restaurant, but they totally proved me wrong! The service was awesome! The hostess, servers (i say servers because every server that walked by our table would check on us it was really a team effort which is awesome our drinks stayed full), and obviously the cooks were crankin it out too because they made some real awesome food. Our appetizer came out just minutes after we ordered it and it was hot and fresh and amazing! The meals came out shortly after and I have nothing bad to say about it. The enchiladas were probably the best I've ever had, along with the nachos appetizer. If you get the chance to go here, DO IT! We will definitely be going back!
