Don't let the outside fool you, go on in.  4 salsas, each distinct from mild to hot & home made chips, great!  Fajitas Huaraches Moroleon was HUGE and delicious.  Wife had a Chicken Chimichanga that she also liked very much.   Guacamole appetizer was as good as everyone has mentioned.  Only downside, this is a very small place,  about 12 tables so don't tell anyone about it :)
