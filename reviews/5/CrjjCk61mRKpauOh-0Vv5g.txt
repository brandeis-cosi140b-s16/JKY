Definitely the best neighborhood mexican joint. Half price margs on friday - yes please.

The carnitas dinner is delicious. Also the blake tacos are a winner. I've tried other dishes, but those are the best two on the menu - hands down.

A great place to go with friends and have a relaxed and cheap meal out, while having great service. 

Def a winner.
