I love their Fish Burrito! They stuff that thing with fish and pico de gallo like it's going out of style. The more pico the better, I always say. Be sure to ALWAYS ask them for limes if you are getting the fish burrito. Their pollo asado is also amazing and sometimes it is OVERLY stuffed with guacamole. But again, that's always a good thing.
