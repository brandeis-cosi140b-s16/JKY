I really enjoyed this place. Finally able to find a place in charlotte that makes arepas rellenas and they were sooo good! The prices are very fair. The ambient is laid back. Also tried the spinach and cheese pupusas a bit too crunchy for me. The service is also good. It's self serve so you don't have to worry about tipping. We will definitely come back to this spot!
