I love this place! It is inexpensive. I went here with four friends and we all ate a lot of food for about 30 dollars. I came back later with my boyfriend and the two of us ate for around 15 dollars.  I love their breakfast platters and their pupusas. It is just good all around Central American food. Every time I go to Vegas I make sure to come and eat here :)
