Customer service was excellent. The woman who took my order was in a fantastic mood and seemed like she was having a great day, a very pleasant, simple thing that brightened my day up after having difficulties at work. Food was standard Taco Bell, delicious and streamlined to taste the same everywhere, but the customer service was impeccable and due to this I will definitely return.
