Great Food and unbelievably low prices !!
I checked into the hotel late at night, after 11PM but they were serving a limited menu at the bar.   I got the Guacamole, which was very fresh, some of the best I have ever eaten, ( I'm from San Antonio and know good Guacamole).   a large portion and a good price.  The chips and two types of hot sauce which came with it were great as well.  I especially loved the green hot sauce.  

This morning I got breakfast which was also superior.   Wonderful server.  I tried the yogurt with fresh fruit and granola. Loved it.  Everything is very fresh and beautifully presented.  The server. recommended the Chorizo con Huevos  which I was a bit hesitant to order since chorizo can be very greasy.  She said that it was from a local company and was very good.  She was right.  The chorizo was perfectly seasoned and not greasy and came with homemade tortillas, potatoes and beans. For $7!!!

Can't wait to try dinner.
