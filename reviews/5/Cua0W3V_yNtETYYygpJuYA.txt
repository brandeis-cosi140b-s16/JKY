My husband and I were frequent customers of the University location, and are so happy to have one closer to us!  I stopped in last Thursday and had the salad with the al pastor meat...and it is my new fave!  The pork was crispy and well seasoned.  I would never have thought to order this, but the owner suggested it since I wanted to try something different.  I am also a fan of the tacos, but prefer the burritos...I like the flour tortillas better...and just found out that I can get the tacos on flour too.  My husband loves the carne asada!  Great food, friendly service, would definitely recommend!
