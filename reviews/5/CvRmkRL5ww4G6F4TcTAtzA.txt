heard of this place from a friend of mine and he was all praises. We decided to try it and he did not steer us wrong. The food was wonder ful! There were five of us so we were able to try a variety of dishes. There was not a bad one in the bunch. From the chips and fresh salsa to the chicken enchiladas, carne asada, green chile verde etc.
Forgot to mention the margaritas, Great! We will definitely be back!!
