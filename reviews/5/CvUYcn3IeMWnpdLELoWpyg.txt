Affordable, filling and amazing service?! Yes please! I have only been coming in since the start of the year. I had been hearing about this place from other students from school and wanted to see what the "hype" is all about. If you want affordable food with the quality to match, this is the place to go. I bring my friends with "big appetites" and they leave satisfied without burning a hole through their pockets. I myself, am I big fan of the Mexican taquitos, lettuce wraps, fusion tacos (try their pork belly fusion tacos!) and the bulgogi fried rice. Everyone is incredibly nice and it keeps me coming back! (maybe more than I should). If you have not tried KoMex, try it once! You won't regret it :)
