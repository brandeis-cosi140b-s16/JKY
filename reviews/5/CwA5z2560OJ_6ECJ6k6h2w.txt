Super delicious burritos! I had a bean burrito with guacamole, and my husband had the pollo asada burrito with guacamole. The guacamole was FRESH, and we both devoured our food. It was definitely one of the best we have had since moving from California. Also, the owner who works the front is helpful and very nice. We will be going back to try the chile relleno and enchiladas. Check out the specials when you go in because they change, and are often a really great deal.
