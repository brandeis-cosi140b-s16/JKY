It's alway good at Julio's Too! 

I've tried many of their dishes and all have been fantastic! Their fresh salsa is one of my favorites!

We often order Julio's party platters at work, and they never disappoint! They are reasonably priced and you get tons of food! They're quesadillas are to die for!

I definitely recommend them, and the party trays are perfect if you're looking for lunch for the office!!
