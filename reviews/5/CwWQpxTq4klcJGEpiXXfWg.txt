I first came here with coworkers for lunch and we eventually continued to come here for our Mexican food fix. The waiters are very attentive and spoiled us with their delicious chips & salsa. The waiters do not hesitate to give us more chips after we finish our first basket. The food was fresh and fairly priced for the portion. The tables & silverware were clean and the ambience is very casual. I can imagine this place great for birthday celebration. I will definitely be coming back to explore more of the menu.
