Having this place in walking distance from your apartment is a dream come true.  Amazing, satisfying Mexican "fast" food (you may have to wait a bit but it's worth it).  THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE BERTO'S.  Super affordable delicious food with sizable proportions and a delightful salsa bar.  

My husband and I usually get the two burrito combo, one with carne asada and one with adobada.  OMG SO GOOD.  If you split a large drink, too, it comes out to about $8 for two people.  Miraculous when you are hung over.  And they are open at pretty much all hours so you can totally saunter over here at 9am and chill with an interesting assortment of early-risers.

This place does not have a drive-through so keep that in mind.  I have taken out-of-towners here on two separate occasions and it did not disappoint.

One more thing -- I always get a horchata and it is never bottom-of-the-barrel gritty like it can be at some places.
