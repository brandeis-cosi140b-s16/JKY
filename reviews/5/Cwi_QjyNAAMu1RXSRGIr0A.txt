I have loved this place for 30 years!  Some of the best Mexican food in the State!  This new location certainly doesn't disappoint. Long happy hours. Lunch specials until 5pm. Incredible food with extremely generous portions. You have to try the Green Chili Burro Enchilada Style. The little bit of everything combo is good too.  

The place is located in the new Sports complex just south of the freeway and north of Van Buren on Avondale Ave.  It was a bit difficult to find the first visit. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, the decor is pretty plain Jane, but the food and service are as good as you will find anywhere.
