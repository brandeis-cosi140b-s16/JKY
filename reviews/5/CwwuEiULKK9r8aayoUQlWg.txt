Great little mom and pop shop. Service was outstanding as they clearly enjoy all the business they receive. The potato salad was seriously awesome, clearly homemade. I got the nacho chili dog and it was delicious. 

My wife got the philly with homemade pasta salad, both really good. If we lived in the area I'd definitely support this place on a weekly basis. Highly recommended for a quick delicious lunch.
