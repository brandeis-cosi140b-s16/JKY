My husband and I had lunch at Serrano's with our friends who live in  the area at their suggestion. Wow! Everything was great from start to finish. The facility itself was clean and tastefully decorated (Hey! Presentation is everything, right???), the hostess was friendly, the wait staff attentive and diligent about keeping our drinks topped off and the chips and salsa coming without having to ask even once for a refill.  

OMG!!! The salsa was about the best I've ever tasted anywhere - so fresh and with just the right amount of hot that got its "giddyup" from actual CHILI peppers, NOT black pepper. Others said the bean dip was good too, but I detest beans so you'll have to take their word on it. Everyone enjoyed their meals and overate because it was so tasty despite filling up on the chips and salsa. My husband had the soft taco plate and gave it a rating of 9 which says a lot because he is TOUGH! I had the grilled chicken quesadilla which was HUGE and loaded with gooey, melty cheese. Oh so good... 

Okay, Serrano's, when are ya comin' to West Valley???
