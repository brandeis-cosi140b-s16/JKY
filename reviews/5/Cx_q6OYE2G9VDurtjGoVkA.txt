Thanks again Yelpers! 

After reading a few reviews of this place at work, I had to try it on my day off. 

I really like the idea of ordering from the cooks, which is how this place operates. On April 5th, at around 9:30PM, I ordered 3 Carne Asada and 3 Adoboda tacos. The order also came with grilled green onions and yellow chillies on the side. Their green chili sauce is SO good too. 

The tacos were fantastic. OK in size at first glance, but after eating a couple, they pack a good punch. Still no match for my appetite on this day. I never tried Adoboda before and it looked so good roasting in front of me, so that was easy to order. The Asada was also looking good just off the grill. Both tacos were really good, however, I did enjoy the Adoboda more than the Asada. Also, the side onions and chillies are mandatory (for me) after tasting them with my meal. 

Overall, I can't wait to back to this place again. I'm definitely going to get more Adoboda tacos and try what else they have to offer.
