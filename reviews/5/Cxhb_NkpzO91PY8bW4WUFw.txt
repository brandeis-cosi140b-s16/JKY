Right as I walked in, the staff was very welcoming. They provided me with samples of their meats which were excellent and on point.

I ordered the Huli Huli Chicken bowl. They gave good sized scoops of the meat and sides. First bite in, I knew I couldn't get enough!

The environment is very chill and relaxing. Then staff keeps the restaurant clean and well maintained. I'd give customer service a 10/10! Definitely coming back here soon.
