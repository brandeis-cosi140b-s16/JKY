I seriously don't understand the low reviews for this restaurant.  My wife and I had them cater our pre-wedding dinner and the whole group (30 people) loved every bite.  We went back again recently and ate until our stomachs hurt.  As for the prices, that gut filling experience cost us about $25 which included a huge portion of guacamole and two sodas.  My wife got the beef tacos, I got the machaca burrito.  Yeah, it costs more than Chipotle, but it's also a different experience.  As for the comment about the place going out of business...not a chance.  We were lucky to be a party of two because we got the last open table.  I looked around again before we left and there were still no open tables and probably 2-3 parties waiting at the door.  Oh, and a sign in the window said they're opening another location in Desert Ridge in January.  That one will be closer for us, so I'm sure we'll go more often in 2010.

The food is going to be slightly different from that which you'd expect to find at Macayos or Garcias or something like that.  The owners are from Mexico, first generation business owners in the US.  They brought the recipes (and according to their menu, even the flour) straight from central Mexico.  That other stuff we eat at chain Mexican food restaurants is what we've been TOLD is authentic.  So, yeah, you're going to get a different flavor and presentation at Ketzal.

No, I do not work for Ketzal or have any special incentive for writing this review.  I just genuinely like the place and wanted to stand up for it.
