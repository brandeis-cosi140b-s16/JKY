This place was simply great and delicious. It was more of a serendipitous find. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but this place definitely made me a believer! 

I got the Mexican molcajete. I didn't know what it was but seeing the picture I had to get it! Boy was I right! It was so good! It's like a fajita cooked in a stone bowl with simmering salsa, adding extra flavoring to the meat. A MUST GET. my wife got the 7 mares soup. Also very good. A great portion of sweet shrimp, scallops, squid, zucchini, etc. a hearty bowl of soup with a delicious broth. Definitely would eat this when I'm sick,  were I to be that lucky. 

--Keep eatin
