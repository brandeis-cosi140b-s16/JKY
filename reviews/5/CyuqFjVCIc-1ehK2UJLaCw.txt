We're new in town and my husband and I tried this place first.  Tonight's visit certainty won't be the last.  From start to finish, this place was awesome!  Our waiter Brad was more than on top of things, and the food was to die for! The only problem was that we didn't have enough room in our satisfied stomachs to eat it all.  We're looking forward to our leftovers and next visit!
