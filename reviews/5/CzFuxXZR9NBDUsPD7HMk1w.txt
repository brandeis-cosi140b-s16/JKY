First time coming here in quite some time, and the service was amazing! Our servers name was Alberto and he was very welcoming and gave me and my sister excellent service even though the restaurant was packed. Although they no longer offer the Chicken viper taco, I will definitely be coming here again soon. The food was great and the banana bread pudding was to die for. Definitely leaving this place with a full belly that's for sure.
