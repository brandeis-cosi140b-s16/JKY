Just tried this place for the first time tonight! Loved the free chips and salsa! The salsa is the kind that the spice sneaks up on you but the flavor is so good you don't want to stop eating it. I had the machaca tacos, the meat was super tender and had great flavor and spice. My husband had the Sonoran enchiladas again super good flavor on the meat, and the thick flour tortilla was awesome. The beans and rice were fantastic as well.

This is a small locally owned place that does food right, the price is wonderful as well. Give this place a shot the next time you want good Mexican food in queen creek!
