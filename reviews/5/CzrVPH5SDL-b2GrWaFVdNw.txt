Just had another great experience at a Rubios, this one made all the better by the awesome lady taking our order - Gladys!!  She was very kind and like the great food, she makes us want to come back here again.  Tonight we were in a hurry, so we picked up a couple Cabo Plates and a Coastal Trio to go.   She was very careful to double check that each item in our order actually made it into our to-go bags before we left the restaurant (an important detail which other places often forget).  Now back in the car and on our way, just a quick pit stop to be cheered by kind people like Gladys and the freshest baja food around!  Hats off to this location; keep up the great work, Mr. Rivera!
