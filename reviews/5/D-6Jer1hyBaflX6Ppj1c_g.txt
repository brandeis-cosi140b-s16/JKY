It's Mexican.

It's Korean.

It's both.  And I love it!

This is spot is small.  It's cramped.  There's no signs of the warm welcome of corporate American name tags or signage.  There's just really good, unique fusion food.  And most of it is cooked on the hot grills right out on display.

The fusion flautas, fusion Bulgi tacos, and kimchi fried rice all combine for a meal that I was not expecting.  It's sweet hot like Korean. But it kicks with a Mexican spice and flare.  I wasn't totally sold on fusion before this place.  And my Korean friends cringed when I asked them what they thought of the idea.  But after they tried it, it was all smiles.

Its tucked into a small strip mall so you may have to search to find it.  But you should search, because it's worth the find.
