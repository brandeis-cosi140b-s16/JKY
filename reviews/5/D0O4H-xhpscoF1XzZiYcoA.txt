I highly recommend Mattas to anybody searching for great Mexican food. I've been here nearly 15 times since they opened at the current location and it gets better each time. I've only had the Veggie Burrito because it is so good and I'm trying to watch my weight. The Veggie Burrito has mouth watering bell peppers and grilled onions as well as cheese, sour cream and refried beans. $10 for a burrito, sides of lettuce and more beans and cheese with rice is a great price. Chips and salsa are also provided which are very delicious.

Location is very easy to find as it is next to the Cold Stone. Front Staff does seem a bit bored sometimes but they always get the job done regardless and are very helpful. The chefs however are very upbeat and know what they are doing. I've never waited more than 15 minutes on a meal and that includes take out orders. I like how everyone here works as a team and cares about the food and the customer most of all. This place seems to always be busy and I can see why. One little problem may be the tiny menu which is hard to read if you are coming in to eat for the first time. Beyond that this place is great and deserves a lot of credit.
