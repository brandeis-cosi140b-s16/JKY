Second time here this week. Was such a great experience the last time that I'm back again in just a few days. Very reasonably priced food. I live in Mesa and will definitely make this a regular lunch spot during the week. 

The blood orange margarita is my favorite and the guacamole is great. 

The service has been great both times. Have been served by Erin, Shanna, Chelsea and Alex. All have been tremendously helpful in recommendations and prompt service. And all of them are very friendly with contagious smiles. 

I will be be back!
