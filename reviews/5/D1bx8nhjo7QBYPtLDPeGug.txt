Can't believe it took me so long to stop by here! I started to go through the drive thru but decided I wanted to go inside. The staff is beyond friendly. They asked if I'd been there before, I hadn't, so they started loading me up with free samples...and I'm now hooked! Amazing flavors, can't even explain it, you have to taste it for yourself. Kalua Pig is a pulled pork that is the best i have ever tasted, anywhere! Hope they stay in the neighborhood!
