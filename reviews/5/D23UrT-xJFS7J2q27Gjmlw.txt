I eat at Salsa's pretty often for lunch.  They usually have great lunch specials and the staff is always friendly.  I usually get the lunch steak fajitas and I just added a picture of them.  They also come with rice, refried beans, sour cream, guac, and a little lettuce.  The reason that I always get the fajitas for lunch is because their so good!

If you go on a day that the lunch fajitas are on special they will run you $6.99 which includes your drink.  What a great deal for some awesome Mexican food!

They have also just started a brunch buffet on Sunday's!  I think it lasts from 11-3 or so.  It's great, but come hungry!  The buffet has chicken chimichangas, chicken and beef fajitas, rice, salad, cheese quesadillas, pork, fresh strawberries, melon, muffins, cereal, whip, shrimp, chicken tenders, fries, mashed potatoes, and the list goes on and on.  All of the food is really good!  They also will make you a made to order omelette with chorizo, cheese, or whatever you want all for the low price of $11.99 which includes your beverage.  Again, great food and for a great price and this is why they get 5 stars!
