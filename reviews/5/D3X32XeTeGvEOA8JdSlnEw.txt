Huauchinango!

Huauchinango is a city around 130 miles from Mexico City in the Sierra Norte de Pueblo mountains.  More importantly in my life, Huauchinango is an inexpensive and delicious Mexican restaurant that I can go to with ease.

I am told the cuisine at Huauchinango is largely reflective of Mexico City cuisine.

On my first visit (only visit so far but I will be back) I had 3 quesidilla's.  And they weren't the things we make at my house.  They were joyful folded and sealed pockets of beef, chicken and shrimp with cheese, mushroom, onions, and other yummy stuff.

I was wowed at the outset by the chips and salsa. Both made in house, the chips were not greasy.  It came with three salsa's. One was a kind of a green chili tomatillo with a nice bright and fresh flavor and mild spice.  The next was a red chili salsa that had very little tomato.  It seemed a little watery at first but finished nicely with red chili heat.  The third was orange in hue and very smooth. I was told it was habanero salsa.  It seemed to be made primarily from smoothly blended roasted habanero.  Hot stuff.

Thanks to Donald S for the review that put it on my radar and then meeting me and Brian S there for lunch.  Outstanding!
