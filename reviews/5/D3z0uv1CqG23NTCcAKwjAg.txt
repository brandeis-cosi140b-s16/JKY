I'm a very picky eater and not a huge fan of Americanized Mexican food. This place is consistently the best. They have expanded over the Charlotte, Monroe & Matthews areas - and for once, this is a great thing. I love their simple tacos on a soft shell. Everything is so fresh and tasty, with fresh cilantro, crisp onions, perfectly seasoned chicken, pork or beef & great salsa. The staff is fine - not overly attentive and occasionally I've had to wait on the bill longer than I prefer but for the price and quality, I can't complain. That's more to give a truly honest opinion. Overall, it's the best Mexican food in Charlotte and most especially, Matthews. I eat here around once a week and haven't been disappointed. Don't expect fancy, just good food at a very nice price!
