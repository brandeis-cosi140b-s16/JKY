Throughoughly delighted! We asked for fries well done, and they arrived as asked and delish. The fish tacos, which were abslutely tasty, were piping hot in our togo bag with lime slices for squeezing on the tacos. They took the time to toast the tortillas for the burritos in our order. And our coke was a perfect mix of syrup and carbonation (this is kind of a big deal to me, I love soda, and if its bad it can ruin my meal).

Note: parking lot is a pain to get in and out of, not recommended for large trucks!!
