A lot of times when I'm in Vegas I'll gamble for long stretches without eating, so by the time I am ready to eat I'm usually;

A) famished

and 

B) broke

When that happens, nothing fits the bill better than Tacos Mexico.  The tacos are great and not only that, but they're dirt cheap, typically ~$1.00-1.25 apiece, depending on what kind you get.  I'll stop there for breakfast (yes, breakfast - they're open 24/7) and have 6 or 8 tacos.   For about $10 I'm stuffed.

One of the best things about Tacos Mexico is that you can get tacos made with a lot of exotic meats that you don't find at many places.  Instead of just the usual beef/chicken/fish tacos you can also get tripe, cabeza, intestine, tounge meat, etc.   They also make an awesome bowl of menudo (tripe soup) for ~$6.

As many have noted, this place is kind of dumpy but who cares?  If I want to take my wife for a fancy meal then I'll go to a nice steakhouse or one of the fancy buffets, but when I'm by myself and just looking for some quick, cheap, tasty food, Tacos Mexico is my first choice in Vegas.
