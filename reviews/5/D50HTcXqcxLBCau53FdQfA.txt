Yeah. This place is legit. When you're the only person in there who doesn't speak Spanish, you know you've come to the right place.

Tacos, tacos, tacos. That's pretty much what they do. And it really doesn't get much better than this. I just needed a quick snack, so I went with a lengua and a tripa. I'm not entirely sure if I ended up with tripe, but it was delicious all the same.

I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time. I noticed that a strip location has opened up recently, but I knew I had to check out the OG location first. Reading other reviews is definitely making me want to return for some more Taco Gordation.
