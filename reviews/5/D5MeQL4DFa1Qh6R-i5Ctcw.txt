So good I actually have their number programmed in my phone.

No more taco hell... I go to Caramba's!

This is fast food mexican that doesn't even taste like fast food... and it's not the "____berto's" chain.

Home grown here in Glendale, AZ, the taste in their burritos, pollo fundido, tacos and even rice and beans is flipping AWESOME.  Chips and salsa your thing? They have a whole salsa bar that is fresh made.

You walk in to a clean restaurant filled with mexican decor touched with a dash of beer signs.

You can eat in or take out... again, it is a fast food place so you do have to deal with the kids and crap, but the restaurant can't help that.

Love the slogan... where you don't "peso" much.

 Great for when you just get off work, dying of hunger, call them up, order your favorite tacos, walk in, pay, grab and go home.
