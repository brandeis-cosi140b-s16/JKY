This place is super cool. The decor is perfect, the bar is very comfortable, and the open air walls make the whole place a giant patio. I'm just having a cocktail today, but will be back immediately for lunch or dinner. Can't wait and will be sure to update when I do. The food looks and smells amazing, but I just ate a huge breakfast.
