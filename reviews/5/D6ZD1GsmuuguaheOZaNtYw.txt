UM yeah... My friend at work kept talking about this place she called "Scary Taco" and she just raved about the fish tacos and pork burritos. Well, today we went and "Scary Taco" is actually called Tacos Atoyac, (or now this new name) and I see why she went on and on about it. The food is SO GOOD! The prices are SO CHEAP. The ambiance is SO AWESOME for a "Scary Taco" and I'm in love. I had the pork taco, shrimp taco and fish taco and they were amazing. They give you sides of grilled onions, a jalepe√±o and two kinds of salsas. You have to try this place. Don't be alarmed by the sketchy location or homely interior. You see all sorts of people coming in - blue collar, white collar, no collar. It's great. I'll be going back ASAP!
