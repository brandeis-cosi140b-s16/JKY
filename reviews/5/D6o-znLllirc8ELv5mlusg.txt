Coming in before the rude reviews
I love it here its not the biggest place to get tacos or any mexican dish but hey it delivers yeah it had no plastic scanner but now they do and this should help tremendous with the atrocious idiots on yelp but in the mean time...

The food is great ive had about 4 dishes here for dinner and an afterwork snack the carne asada is cooked on grill with no soaked juices like all the other authentic taco shops would have everything is cooked in front of you and staff is friendly and prices are fair 

Yes the venue is connected to a gas station but what seems to be the problem? Oh yeah theres a stick in your ass 
Yeah theres sketchy people that come through sometimes but hey thats your problem
If your not paying there rent dont bitch where there business is

All in all good place
