Plain and simple..Nothing like good hole-in-the wall food. And I would have to say this place is the best. I love what I ate there. I had the carne asada tacos but could have eaten just about everything else.The meat was prepared so well and the tortilla was just right..not so thin that it breaks but not fried hard.  Great rice and beans too.

Ina  parking lot by itself in a not great part of town,but who cares, just go eat!
