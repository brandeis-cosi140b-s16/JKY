How do I love Chipotle? Let me count the ways... cilantro rice (mmmm), fresh corn salsa, burritos as big as your head, prices easy on your wallet, funky industrial-Aztec decorating scheme, and hip tunes on the stereo. Beats the stuffin' out of the usual fast food joints. Who would've guessed that Chipotle is owned by McDonalds?
