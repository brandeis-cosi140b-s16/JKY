I absolutely love carlitos burritos. I'm a huge green Chile fan having been raised in Colorado so I have been searching for a reasonable substitute in las Vegas for years. 

the green Chile stew is awesome with an added dash of salt on some occasions but usually very good. my very favorite is a stuffed sopapilla filled with the pork verde and then smothered in green Chile-so good! I can eat two, easy.

burritos are much better than a robertos burrito, especially the breakfast burritos. the fun nights to go in are when something special is cooking, anywhere from pizzas with green Chile to different sandwiches or special cuts of meat, sometimes on the grill out front. the kids are happy eating quesadillas or tacos. mom is happy with a margarita, which are very good by the way. 

one of my favorite places to go in las Vegas and Im sure our children grow up with fond memories of eating here the way I remember different foods from my childhood.
