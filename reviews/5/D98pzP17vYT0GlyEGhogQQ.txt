Brought my family here after a horrible experience at Lon's at Hermosa. Happy to say our server ( wish I remembered his name) turned a crappy night into an amazing one with his exceptional personality & attention to detail! The food was amazing, and so was the service!! 
Cant wait to come back again soon!
