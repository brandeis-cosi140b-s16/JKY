This newer establishment was a pleasant surprise. We found the place based on other yelp reviews and the reviews were right!

The bartender went out of his way to be funny and engaging with the patrons (here's your shout out - forget about the menu print font)

Food was good as was the service. Get the table side guacamole. Live music and Jose Quervo ladies were an added treat. 

Try this place!  You won't be disappointed.  I'll be back my next trip to vegas.
