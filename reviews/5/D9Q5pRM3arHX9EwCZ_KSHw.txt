Not your average bar food selection and it IS NOT OVERPRICED.  The prices are very reasonable.  Maybe Buckeye residents don't get out of Buckeye very much, but a salmon & shrimp dinner for less than $15 is a great deal.  I don't know what a lot of these reviewers are talking about.  You can get grilled salmon with steamed vegetables and rice.  Most bars don't offer any seafood selections at all.  They have fried shrimp, grilled chicken, great burgers, delicious ribs, and excellent margaritas.  It's hard to believe the delicious food comes out of the same kitchen where they prepare the usual Filiberto's fare.  There are very few good places to eat in Buckeye, and the good places in downtown Buckeye are breakfast/lunch only.  You won't be disappointed if you eat here.  It is a small place, and it is a bar, so if you take your kids to a bar, you have to expect adults to be there doing adult things, duh.......
