Being a vegetarian isn't always easy when you are at a tourist spot like Vegas and pretty much staying the whole time inside the MGM Signature compound. I found out that Tacos N' Ritas has a veggie option. Who knew? Not me. Anyway, my husband and I went to check it out. He had gotten a burrito there the day before and said it was good and about $12. So, off we went. I ordered and answered the questions of wanting this that and the other thing. I added chips and a drink, got my food and went to sit down to eat. When my husband came to join me after paying for my veggie burrito he said, "what veggies did you order that made that a $25 burrito?". I was shocked, wow a $25 burrito...yikes. Oh well, it was really good and I actually ate it over the course of 3 days (it was huge), so if you dollar cost average it out, it was a deal. Good food, just be aware of the cost of all the options.
