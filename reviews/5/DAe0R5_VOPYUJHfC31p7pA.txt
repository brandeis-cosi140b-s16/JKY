I've always had a great experience here from the food to the service to the decor - colorful parrots everywhere! Cheap margaritas that do the trick served in real glasses and huge portion sizes. My favorites are the chili relleno and the combo plates.  Also, the salsa is really good.  Grab a group of friends and enjoy!
