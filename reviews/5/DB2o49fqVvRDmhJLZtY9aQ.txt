Rockin taco has amazing nachos. The carne asada was delicious. The servers were real nice . Not to mention the giant 46 oz frozen drinks ( got a groupon for 2 and a beer)   White queso sauce was so good but unfortunately they ran out when i ordered an i didnt feel like waiting for more. Was too hungry    Nachos were huge   Would go there again and again
