It's true.  I'm a lover of Taco Bell.  I can't tell you how amazing their burritos are.  It was like crack in a wrap.  Be careful though, the meat is so fresh and moist that it'll drip out of the packaging, soaking into your clothes, and making you smell of sweet, sweet pork.  Man, I can't wait to get back to Las Vegas, so I can feast on these bad boys again.
