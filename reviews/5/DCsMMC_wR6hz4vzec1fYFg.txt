This is the most delicious non-Mexican Mexican food I've had in Madison. Is it fine dining wrapped in normcore clothes? Small business fast-casual with Midwestern pragmatism? *shrugs*

Our guy behind the counter rec'd the Sheh-meh-neh burrito, which was on point, who knew sweet potato mash goes good in burritos, but I was rightfully suspicious of his red sauce rec bc I know my body and my body likes green sauce so that's what I went with. Holy chicken it was delicious. 

Carnitas tacos were also nothing to mess with and they came in an easy to deliver box (we ordered to go). The meat bits were crispy and tender with a little hint of sweet, tasty good with green sauce and slaw. 

The interior is kind of damp and drab, but I suppose they provide tables and chairs out of courtesy. Most of their business seems to run on delivery or takeout.
