All 'berto's are, in fact, NOT created equal.  My ex-girlfriend and I used to be fans of Filiberto's, but the customer service was HORRIBLE.  The cashiers taking our food orders, got the order incorrect about 90% of the time.  My ex  was vegan (which made me vegan, by default, whenever I'm eating with her).  One of my ex's coworkers recommended Poliberto's to us, and we have loved it, ever since.  I am a very loyal fan and a frequent customer!

My ex loves to get the bean burrito, with guacamole, and cilantro.  The refried beans are made with vegetable oil (and NOT lard).  Plenty of free chips, and a great selection of different salsa's at the salsa bar.  It has the typical Coca-Cola selection of fountain drinks, and some other more traditional Mexican drinks too...

Poliberto's cashiers have NEVER gotten our food order wrong!  Unlike the 90% of the cashiers at Filiberto's who give the cooks the wrong order (typically with cheese), when we had specifically asked for NO cheese.

Be careful if you order the Guacamole and chips!  The Guacamole always come with cheese on it, unless you specifically ask for NO cheese, then Poliberto's cooks will just give you more Guacamole instead, with the chips.

Eating at Poliberto's has ALWAYS been an excellent experience!  5+ stars!
