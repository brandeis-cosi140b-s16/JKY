We stay in Vegas for the WSOP every year and this time we stumbled upon this taco place. The tacos were awesome!! I thought the staff were friendly and inviting. The best part is that they stay open late and offer a nice late night option. Also this place is affordable. Will be a regular customer every  year we are here!
