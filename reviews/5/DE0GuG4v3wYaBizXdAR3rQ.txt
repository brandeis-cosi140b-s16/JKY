Definitely one of my favorites. I'm constantly craving the cheese dip (is that a bad thing?). Every time I go usually get either chimichangas or a naked burrito. Every once in a while I stray to something else. Most of their dishes aren't too spicy, so if you need that extra kick you can ask for it. They also have daily drink specials that are an awesome deal. I usually go for a margarita though! 

Its nice to come to a Mexican restaurant that's not so overwhelming with decorations and over-stereotypically dressed servers (like Don Pedro's or Azteca, because it's annoying). 

The owners are awesome people! When it's slow in there I usually get a few conversations with them and they're really nice.
