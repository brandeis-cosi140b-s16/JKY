Excellent breakfast burritos! My husband and I got a sausage and a bacon burrito and they were incredible! The burritos are the perfect size leaving you pleasantly full yet not stuffed. The tortillas are excellently made (not gummy) and the meat is fresh. My favorite thing about these burritos is they are not greasy in the slightest! I found the green sauce to be the perfect addition!
