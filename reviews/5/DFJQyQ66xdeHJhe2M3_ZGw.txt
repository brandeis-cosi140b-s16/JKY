Las Vegas is overrun with celebrity chefs -- Bobby Flay, Joel Robuchon, and Jose Andres all come to mind -- but my favorite Las Vegas chef these days is Frank Miranda, of Phat Phrank's fame (phame?).

Frank is running one of the best hidden spots in town.  I'd been there once before, but I recently visited again to try Frank's famous ceviche.  And it was just as outstanding as I'd been told.  I don't know how he finds such fresh fish in the middle of the desert.  Clearly Frank is a miracle worker.

The other highlight was tasting Frank's chimi cheesecake.  A tortilla stuffed with cream cheese, deep-fried, and then coated with generous cinnamon sugar and caramel?  Um, yes please!

Frank's little restaurant is a total gem.  So here's my tip to Californians driving up the northbound 15 to kick off a Vegas  weekend: A couple miles before you reach the Strip, make a little detour onto the westbound 215, and drive one exit to Decatur Blvd.  Phat Phrank's will be right there, waiting to fill your belly with delicious Mexican-American fare that's made with love.  (It's cheap too, leaving that many more benjamins in your wallet available for squandering at the casino.)
