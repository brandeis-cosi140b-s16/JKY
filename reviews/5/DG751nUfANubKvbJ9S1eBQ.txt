Went for dinner while staying at the hotel. Good food and service! Everything was delicious and it was fast. Our server was attentive and friendly.
Then back for breakfast! The breakfast was amazing! Delicious and made to order. As guests of the hotel it was completely free! Our check was $27 and it was completely covered.
