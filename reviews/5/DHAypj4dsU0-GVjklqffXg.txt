I love these types of restaurants, like Rubio's or HighTec Burrito, and they can be real hit or miss. This is the best one I've ever been in. Had to wait for a client so I popped in to grab a bite to eat. Food came out and it looked a little scarier than I though. Rice seemed to be a strange color and whole thing was in a cheap foil bowl. With great concern I took a bight of the rice and was shocked how good it was. It tasted like it was cooked in seasoning, it was awesome. Moved on to the beans and finally my Quesadilla. It was awesome. Very fresh meat, great cheese, loved it.

The place was very clean and people friendly. I hope to find one on my side of town.
