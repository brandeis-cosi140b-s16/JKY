The best green chili burritos! I live in North Phoenix and I have driven all the way out to Moreno's just to get a couple burritos. You must try them. They are unlike anything I have had anywhere else, and I have been trying my best to replicate them with no luck. The Sonoran hot dogs are also very good! It's well worth the 45 minute drive from my house.
