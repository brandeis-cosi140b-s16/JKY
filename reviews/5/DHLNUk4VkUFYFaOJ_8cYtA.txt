What's not to love about this place? A house margarita that is still way better than most top shelf margaritas, AMAZING enchiladas and short ribs, and a laid back atmosphere. We were served by Heather this evening, who made great food recommendations and provided wonderful service. Seriously, if you like great Mexican food and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go!  We've been here before and never walk away unhappy. Can't wait for our next visit!
