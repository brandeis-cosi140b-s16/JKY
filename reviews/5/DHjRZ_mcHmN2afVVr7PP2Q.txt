I really cant say much about a non pretentious, low key hole in the wall that is mostly frequented by a Mexican clientele. This place makes tacos just as good as youll find on a street cart in Mexico. I had the four taco plate, 2 lengua, 1 cabeza and one of chorizo....all were pretty tasty but the cabeza taco stole the show for me. Their homemade salsas were bomb too! Im definitely going back here again!
