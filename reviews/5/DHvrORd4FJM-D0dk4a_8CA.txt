Wow!  Henderson - go here now.  We stopped by after reading the yelp reviews and they were spot-on.  The food and service were exemplary!  They margaritas were tangy, the dip & salsa assortment that was brought out with the chips was amazing, and our waiter was genuinely nice and attentive.

I had the Cactus Salad...yum!  Don had the Guaijllo Scallops with corn...wow...both dishes were very inventive and delicious.  Portions are bog as well.

Went back for lunch with a friend and we both had different types of enchiladas that were - both were yummy.  This a restaurant that deserves more business than it is getting.  We will become regulars & so should you!
