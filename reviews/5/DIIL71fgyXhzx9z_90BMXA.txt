Fantastic!  My husband and I decided to try this place out after hearing some good things, and boy am I glad we did!
The hostess greeted us cheerily, and sat us on the "patio" inside the mall (as opposed to the one they also have outside) as we requested. We put in drink orders and began the task of entertaining our toddler. 
Our waiter came by and took our orders. He was just as upbeat as the hostess, which was nice. 

I will say, it took an awfully long time to get our street taco appetizer, and our dinners (Z Burger and Hickory Burger) came but a minute later. I can overlook the odd timing though. 
Street Tacos...great! 
Z Burger... (According to my husband) one of the best burgers ever. (He also added some of the 'sauce' that came with our Street Tacos)
Hickory Burger...amazing!  Seriously, two bites in and I knew it was pretty much the best BBQ burger I'd had in years. 
My husband also got a regular margarita and said it was very good.
Our daughter had some mashed potatoes...I'm not sure what was in them, but they weren't plain...she liked them well enough for a toddler. 

I wish I'd had room for dessert but I'd stuffed myself with my burger and just had no room left!

We will absolutely be going back!
