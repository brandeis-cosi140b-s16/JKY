I came into this eatery with an empty stomach and a high standard for Mexican food. Between growing up in the southwest and being Mexican American, I've had my fair shareof Mexican food within the last 35 years and can honestly say that this place is the "real deal." I'd much rather spend a night eating tasty yet inexpensive food versus going to a place like macayos, where the food is overpriced and far from homestyle. For a quick & guilty pleasure, treat your taste buds to Christina's.
