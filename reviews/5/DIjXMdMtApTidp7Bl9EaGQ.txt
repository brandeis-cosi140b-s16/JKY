Their sonoran dogs are delicious and only $2.50 apiece! This is the only place I have had them so I don't have much to compare them to but I think they are AMAZING.

I really enjoy their tacos as well, and they are only $1.35 each. I love that they have the salsa bar set up with pickled onions, avocado sauce, sliced limes, and pico. Did I mention pickled onions?!? That is something I am only used to getting at nicer, sit-down restaurants. They really make the tacos.

Glad I don't live super close or I would be here all the time. CASH ONLY!
