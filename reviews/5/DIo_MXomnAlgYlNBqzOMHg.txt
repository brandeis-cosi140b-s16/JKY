I have found my 'Vetos' of Madison!!!!! (If you don't know what I'm talking about reference down to my review of Vetos (;)

So happy when my roommates brought me here, and when I learned that they deliver! And they serve beer :)

Definitely a place to hit up after the bar from some good Drunk People Food. My roommates ended up getting the steak quesidilla, tater tots, and the chips and cheese (Which is just tortilla chips and a cup of cheese) and their friend got the Fish Tacos, I on the other hand got possibly the best tasting thing ever at 2am The Hungry Hippie Burrito. So good, yet so messy! It had Rice, tater tots, guac, and Mexican salw I believe it was. I got a side of Sour Cream, and their Red Salsa with it. It paired perfectly while watching Family Guy on the TV (You never can go wrong with Family Guy while eating a burrito, drunk.) 

I only finish about a 4th of it due to it being so big, but bagged up the left overs, and was on our way.
