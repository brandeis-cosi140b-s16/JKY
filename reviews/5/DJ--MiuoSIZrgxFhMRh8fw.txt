Great new restaurant. The service was great and the food was delicious. Being from California, I hadn't found a place in Arizona that had good menudo. The menudo here was fantastic. It wasn't greasy and had the perfect amount of flavor. I also got a carne asada burrito to have later in the day and was just as happy with that. The burrito comes with rice and beans in it and had the perfect amount of carne asada in it too. I will definitely be back for more!
