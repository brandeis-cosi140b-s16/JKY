Located right across UNLV. Very convenient for a good, filling lunch ! Can be quite busy during lunch time but that means fresh ingredients getting pushed out FAST ! Their meats are usually cooked fairly well. Moist and at good temps. 

A quick tip would be, if you were to get a burrito bowl, before you shake it to mix, be sure the lid is secured better (sometimes they are in a rush and dont close it enough.... ) THAT would be a nightmare !
