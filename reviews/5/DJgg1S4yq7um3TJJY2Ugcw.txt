I only found this place because of reviews on Yelp.  I usually pride myself on knowing all the Mexican food places.  You know how everyone talks about that hole in the wall with great food that you can tell are old family recipes?  Yeah....this is that place.  Just tucked in the corner of the plaza its in, you gotta know it is there to find it, but it is worth it.

I had the carne asada plate.....tastey.  There are four sitdown style Mexican restaurants within about five miles that charge twice as much for food that is half as good.  All this and the staff was very friendly, which seems to make everything taste better.  BTW-The salsa is SPECIAL!
