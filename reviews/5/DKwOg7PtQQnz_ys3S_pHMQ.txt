I honestly didn't expect much of this place from where it was located but honestly I don't like burgers all that much and my boyfriend wanted to try it and I have to say the people that worked there were so friendly and it felt like a ol' mom and pop joint. The food was great I got the buffalo chicken burger and it actually was spicy unlike any other "buffalo" flavored hamburger I seem to get! So don't let the appearance fool you this place is a gem. Been craving it all week!
