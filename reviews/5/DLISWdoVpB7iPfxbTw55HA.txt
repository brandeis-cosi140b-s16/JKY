We've been frequent flyers at La Barquita for awhile now... can't believe I haven't written a review earlier! Don't let the bars on the windows steer you away from stopping by! We're never disappointed by the authentic and relatively inexpensive food here. The complimentary red salsa is fresh and the perfect level of spicy. The molcajate is our favorite entr√©e- a bubbling hot salsa sauce packed with a variety of perfectly cooked meat. The service is always friendly and attentive.
