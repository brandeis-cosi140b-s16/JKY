I decided to eat inside because the weather was sooo sooo hot in Vegas over the weekend.  I was traveling on a work trip and eating alone.   If you've ever done that you probably know that wait staff tend to look at you wierd as they'd rather serve a table of two and get a bigger tip rather than seat a single person in a booth for two.  That said, I felt that a bit at Cabo Wabo, but overall my waitress was very good and considerate of my needs.

Note - unlike most mexican restaurants you may be familiar with, you pay extra here for chips and salsa.  Even if you want salsa to dress your chopped salad you pay $1 for it. I guess that is the nature of eating on the strip though ... almost nothing's cheap. 

That said I ordered a chopped vegetarian southwest salad an it was EXCELLENT.  Seriously one of the best salads I can remember in a long time and I'm a vegetarian so I eat a lot of salads.  I'd gladly eat there again.

My only regret is I checked into yelp late and missed their check in offer for a free house margarita with an entree.  I ordered an upgraded margarita instead but saved the offer in case I go back.  I'd happily go back and enjoy that salad again.

Don't forget to check in before you order.
