This pizza is so good! I grew up in NY and am pretty snobby about pizza, but Sals passes my test. It has the crust consistency and slice size* of what I would consider "real" pizza with the flavors and unique ingredients of a more gourmet spot.

The carbonara pie is out of this world. I tried a bite of my friends' jalape√±o pizza and it was also great. I can't wait to try more pies and do take out! 

*if you can't fold it, it's not pizza. Sorry.
