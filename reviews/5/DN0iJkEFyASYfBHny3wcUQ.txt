We were recently in Scottsdale on business and stayed at LaQuinta nearby and had dinner at Garcia's. It is within walking distance of the hotel. It was just delicious in all respects. Both nights (different wait staff) we had great service and delicious meals. Everything was fresh and nicely presented too.  The place was lively with dates, couples, families, seniors. Nice mix. We had the enchiladas one night and tamales and tacos another.  Beer and house margs. Would go out of the way next time we are in Scottsdale just to eat here again.  Great job in all respects!
