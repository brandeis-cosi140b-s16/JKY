I'm not one to give stars lightly.  

I was first introduced to Chino Bandido (or 'Chinos', as it's affectionately called by its regulars) by some friends of ours.  It was explained to me that it was a cross between Chinese food and Mexican food.  

I'm sure you might be saying 'Huh?' right about now.

Trust me on this one.  They have the most amazing burritos, quesadillas, and beans.  They have anywhere from very mild (teriyaki chicken) to really spicy (cuban black beans).  They have amazing fried rice and carnitas.  

It all comes together in what can only be described as an addicting concoction.  My stomach is grumbling as I write this ... just at the thought of this place.  They actually have die-hard regulars that have written poems and music about their food.  (Poems and music!)

Don't come here for the ambiance.  It's a hole in the wall.  Don't let that scare you.  Walk right up to the counter, tell them that you've never been there before, and prepare yourself to be taken on a tour of the food.  

Seriously -- they'll give you samples so you know what you like!

No, I'm not joking.

They have quite a lunch crowd during the week.  (For some reason, engineers just flock to this place).  Come either around 11:00 or after 1:00 to beat the lunch crowd.
