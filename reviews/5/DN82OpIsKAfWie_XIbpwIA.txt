Finally!!! Had time to visit Gadzooks! It is wonderful!  A little intimidating at first if you don't check out their menu prior to going...ordering can be overwhelming...but worth every minute! I had pork tacos with the 50/50 tortillas!!! And a friend had the chicken tomatillo enchiladas!!! The BEST I have had in awhile! I will definitely be going back to try other combos....as an employee recommended the beef tacos! YUM!
