I had won $5 free grub on a card scratcher in the mail. Had never eaten here before so, I stopped in after work. Very clean, nice size, loved the salsa bar but, tables were not clean because only one person was working; not cool Station Casino! I am going to rating the Viva Salsa at Boulder in a few. The older lady working the counter was not feeling well, but she did a good job on the food! It was hot! Everything was hot!!! Thank you!!! Can't say that for Boulder... She was very kind and courteous! Even though she was the only person working, she handled the rush with grace! Kudos!
