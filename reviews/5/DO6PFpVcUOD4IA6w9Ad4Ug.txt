I personally prefer Filiberto's but they have been raising their prices so much this past year that I decided to try Federico's which is only two miles from my home !

Federico's at this location is the best.  They have select combo meals for $5 and that includes a free beverage !  Are you kidding me ?

Tacos with your choice of ground beef, shredded beef and chicken for .99 cents ! Everyday !

Bean and cheese burritos are only $1.49 !

My favorite combo meal is the taco, tostada, rice and beans with a free drink for only $5 plus tax.  This meal alone can feed two people.  However, since I am fat I choose to eat it all myself baby.  LOL.

Please Note:  Not all Federico's are the same.  Not all locations are fast, clean and affordable like this location.  They certainly are not priced the same.  There is one near my job and the same combo meal costs over six dollars and that does not include a free beverage.  No Bueno !

The taste and quality is just a notch below Filiberto's ( Filiberto's is the best ) but as long as this Federico's at this location keeps these awesome prices then this is my choice for fast food mexican food.
