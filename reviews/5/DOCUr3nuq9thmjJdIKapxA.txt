What can I say.  I live in Germany but grew up in Arizona and was raised on El Charro  The recipes haven't changed in 50 years and they are delicious.  Is the restaurant fancy?  NO.  Are the servers the kiss your butt kind that you get at Chili's?  NO, is it new and modern? NO.  Guess what?  Doesn't matter. The food is delicious, consistant (after 50 years of sampling it) and it is always as expected.  I have never had anything but a good time there.  Love the draft beer in the same glasses as forever, the amazing cheese crisps served on a metal plate, and "B" soft is always my choice.  I love the place and if it ever closes a piece of my heart goes with it.  What a fabulous Mesa tradition and establishment.  Keep it open forever.  I am a fan as is  my entire, large family.
