Finally! My boyfriend and I have been looking for authentic Mexican  (Honduran) food in the Charlotte area since we moved here 7 months ago. It is a hole-in-the-wall kind of place with a small but very friendly staff. The flavors are spot on. Their tomatillo salsa is perfect, the chorizo tacos were amazing. I was starting to think there weren't any authentic places in the area, so thank you, Tacos El Nevado!!
