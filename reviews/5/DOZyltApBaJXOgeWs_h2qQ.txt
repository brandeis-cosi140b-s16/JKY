Just got back to this place after 18 months of being away. Both times the food was amazing!! The street corn is the perfect blend of spicy and butter. The primarita is a delicate balance of quality tequila and fresh lime. Table side guacamole is a must and the options are great. 

I had the torta with cheese,egg and white beans to make it vegetarian and it was moderately  flavorful. My co-diners enjoyed the chicken on a stick and skirt steak tacos and were not disappointed. The cheese plate is enough for 2 to fill up on. 

Beyond the food the ambiance is very lively. The music made everyone at the table consider dancing if we had been less sober. The staff is very friendly and the experience was great.
