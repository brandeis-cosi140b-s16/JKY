After numerous attempts to find a late night dinner spot on a Wednesday night downtown, I stumbled into ND. Mark was super friendly and made our experience a double thumbs up!

I got the street tacos and damn.. They hit the spot! I got the chicken breast, filet mignon and gringo. The filet was my favorite :)

The margaritas (white peach and Thai basil) paired perfectly with our meals..

Would definitely come again!
