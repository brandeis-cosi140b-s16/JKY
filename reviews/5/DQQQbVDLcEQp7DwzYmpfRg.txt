I wondered downstairs from the Saguaro hotel early on a chilly January morning (2013) hungry for breakfast.  My absolute favorite thing for breakfast is Huevos Rancheros.  For the first time since college (my age is not relevant), I found an acceptable serving of this dish done perfectly (or as close as it comes).  The eggs were served medium with cheese, black beans, jalapenos, salsa and flour tortillas.  The combination was done perfectly.  The serving size was filling, but not over the top.

My son had ordered French fries and French toast.  I guess these selections really do not fit in a Southwestern themed restaurant with 60's retro pastel decor, but I must say both were done to perfection.  The fries went quickly and were in a cup; a great twist.  The French toast was airy and cooked just right.

The server was excellent! and attentive.

What more can I say!
