This is absolutely my favorite place in Charlotte to eat. 

Growing up here I learned about this gem when I was in high school and it's always the first place I visit when I go home to visit. 

Their chicken wet burrito is honestly my favorite meal in a restaurant....ever....

This is all after you eat at least a bowl of chips with their homemade pico de gallo which is also 10/10!!!!
