Straight up authentic Mexican food. Perhaps some of the most authentic I've tasted in town.

From the outside, it's this teeny tiny little building just on the fringes of the Arts District. It doesn't look like too much on the outside. When you walk in, however, it's a completely different story.

It's very small, very intimate, very artsy. They have a DJ spin music in the corner, and there may be a wait because of food quality and how tiny it is.

Two things that are must get: Their red sangria, and their guacamole. Their red sangria is delicious. Probably some of the best I've had. I'm also a notorious chip eater. Guac is pretty commonplace in any Mexican restaurant, but here? I could be buried with a small bowl of their guac, and it would be like I had already visited Heaven. Well, "Guac Heaven", I suppose if there are different subsets and levels a la Dante, but I suppose I can linger there a millenia or two....

We tried the sampler platter. Their cuts of meats are tender, melt in your mouth level, and seasoned to perfection.

I've been here twice, and I am well satisfied enough to recommend it to friends, and by proxy you, for that matter.  If you like authenic, flavorful Mexican food, and don't mind the small space and some wait time, this is like you've died and gone to Heaven.

But not "Guac Heaven", because I'm selfish, and claiming sole residency of that place. But you can still visit from time to time.
