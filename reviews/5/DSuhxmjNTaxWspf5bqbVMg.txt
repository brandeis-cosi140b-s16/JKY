My family and I have been eating here since the old hole hole in the wall place. I have to say that was one thing we liked about it was that it was a hole in the wall. 

Since the move I don't think the food is any less quality, the service is still good just has its nights (every place does though). This is still one of the best Mexican food places I feel. 

The steak tacos are great! Pretty much all the taco's are great! The chips and salsa are top notch as well. I also love the Tamale's I would defiantly try this place if your in the Champaign-Urbana area.
