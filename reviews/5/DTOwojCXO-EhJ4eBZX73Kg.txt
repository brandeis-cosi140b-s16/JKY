Best fast food Mexican near my home is all I have to say.  I was told about this place from a friend of mine that lives in the area and looks like Arlin B has checked it out as well.  I ordered 2 beef enchiladas plate and man was it fantastic.  The enchilada sauce was great, beans were awesome.  My wife had the floutas (rolled tacos to gringos) and they were awesome as well.  I have to go back and have a breakfast burrito which my friend swears is the best ever.  Also noticed the 2 beef tamale plate for $5.50 special that I want to give a shot as well.  This place is really clean and doesn't has a terrible odor like most Filberto locations.  The dining room is small with only about 10 tables, a TV, salsa bar, & soda fountain with no drive thru.  If you live in the area it is next to the Subway across from Top Shelf (which has terrible Mexican food).
