When it comes to food, I am known to eat about half of whatever I order and save the rest for someone else to eat later. Not at this place; the food is delicious. It is not saturated in grease and has a unique way of preparation and presentation. The atmosphere is casual and cafeteria-style. It is like a higher end Chipotle. I keep telling friends to check it out and no one seems disappointed either.
