SumoMaya is our new favorite place. We have been there twice now and have had the best service, and food we have had in a long time! The summer corn, edamame, Korean beef tacos and Pad Thai are to die for. Chef Herb Wilson personally came to our table to make sure our meal was perfect. When you go in make sure you ask for Austin, he was the best server. He is very attentive and makes amazing recommendations based on what you like. We can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. A+++
