I absolutely LOVE the food at Caf√© Rio!  I first found them when I was living in St. George UT, and was excited to find out that they were opening this store so close to my current location.
My Favorite:  Chicken Burrito, rice, pinto beans, medium sauce, sour cream inside, enchilada style! 
If you are nearby, give it a try...you'll LOVE it!
