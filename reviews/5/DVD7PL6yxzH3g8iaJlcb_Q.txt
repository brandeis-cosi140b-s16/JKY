My wife and I went for the 1st time today(10-6) and it was delicious.  My wife had the salmon dish and I had the Ramen posole chkn.  We sat at the bar and watched thm cook it.  The place is inside the Desoto Market in an historic brick building and parking is east of the building thru an alley with complimentary valet.  The entrance is on the north side of the building 2nd door to the right.  Hard to find the 1st time but easy after.  It's well worth it.  Once in, walk left towards the back or just ask.  We talked to the owner who is Filipino.  Very nice and humble guy.  We will be back.
