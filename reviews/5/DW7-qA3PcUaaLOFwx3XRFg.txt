Some have complained this name is inaccurate, that it's not really in the Barrio. Whatever. I had a great meal at Barrio Cafe. the Horchata is extremely legit. The guacamole with pomegranate seeds was original and a taste sensation. If you get anything, get the guacamole. The slow roasted pork with marinated onions and tortillas was amazing. I also tried the stuffed chiles off of someone else's plate, very simple dish but well executed. The restaurant was clean (if a bit small) and service was attentive.
