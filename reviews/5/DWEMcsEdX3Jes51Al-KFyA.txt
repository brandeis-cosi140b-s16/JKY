Couldn't wait to get back for winters in Arizona. Stopped by Rubio's Mexican Grill yesterday and as usual, what a tasty treat ! I wish this chain would open up in Canada.
The staff smile & say they love their jobs. That says a lot about how a place is run.. Everything is freshly prepared to order. 
Love their salsa bar. The seasoning on their grilled chicken is outstanding and and their Grande Bowl ( my fave) was as usual, not only delicious but also nutritious. Consistently great !! 
We are regulars in winter.
