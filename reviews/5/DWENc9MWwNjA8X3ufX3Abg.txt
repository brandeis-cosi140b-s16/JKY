Absolutely delicious huevos rancheros at 07:00 AM on a Saturday!! Authentic roasted poblano onion "chutney" dip for chips, home flavor salsa and delicious grill-warmed tortillas. The service by a young, cheerful lady was superior - far better than that from the staff at my five-star downtown hotel.  I wish we San Diegans had such truly home-made Mexican cuisine.
