Stomach's beware!  Amazing food and great service, but a hole in the wall location. YELP helped me find this spot and the Red Jade Chicken was awesome. The Hangrenade Chicken was the best I have ever had. Wonderful flavors!  Definitely recommend for lunch. It was a good mix of business and casual patrons, but totally worth the $9.50 for lunch!  

Menu is a bit confusing, but they give samples to help make a decision. Good mix of caribbean, Mexican, and Chinese food!

Amazing!
