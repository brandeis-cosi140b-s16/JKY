A hidden gem for sure. The atmosphere and decor are authentic of Mexican culture. Very clean, very festive. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. We ordered to go. I couldn't decide between the Entomatadas or the Enchiladas verdes so we got half and half, since the order comes with four enchiladas. While we waited I was served a sopa de Fideo that was delish! Their tortillas and sauces are handmade daily. Was very pleased. Will definitely come again.
