My friend and I stumbled onto this place over the weekend and we felt like we hit the jack pot.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly young girl who asked us if it was our first time.  She was so informative as was every other employee that we encountered.  You order through a line and then they deliver the food to your table when it is ready. The food is UH-mazing.  I had the black bean quesaDILLA and it came with chips and and lots of fun toppings.  They have a wide variety of sauces to try at a station ranging from sweet to slap yo mama hot.  Decor is bright and artistic.  You will not be disappointed.
