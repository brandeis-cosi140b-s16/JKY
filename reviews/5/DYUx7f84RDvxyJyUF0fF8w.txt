So we saw this restaurant being reviewed on Check Please AZ program and my hubby and I decided to check it out.. Totally enjoyed the ambience, casual, hip and friendly not up tight as some trendy new places can be..We started with the Chicharr√≥n de Queso, YUM! Fried cheese, need to say more?! We also had the side of guacamole and chips also very fresh and tasty. My hubby had the Naco Torta, which had aguacate avocado), carne asada, some veggies all topped off with a sunny side up eggs on a telera type bread (Mexican torta type bread)! He loved it! It was quite a large serving and he had to take half of it home. I had 2 Carne asada tacos and 2 cochinita (marinated pork) tacos! LOVED the Carne asada-drooling! The cochinita were very tasty too but I'm an Asada meat lover! Didn't get dessert because we where stuffed..I was a bit dissapointed with my Mojito, it tasted more like an unsweetened lemonade! But that can be easily forgiven with such yummy food! Definitely will be making this a favorite!
