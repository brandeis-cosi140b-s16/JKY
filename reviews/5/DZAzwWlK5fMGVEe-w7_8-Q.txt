This place is Authentic, if your looking for tex mex this isn't it.  You can feel and tell the place is authentic if the majority of the customers are from the country the restaurant claims to serve food from!  Everything is fresh and the food is prepared by a couple of "Real Senoras" in the back; that posses the real Sazon of Real Mexican Food!.  Highly recommend the sopes and Enchiladas in Salsa Roja sauce!!!  Also the Menudo is Excellent, tacos are awesome, try the Tripitas mmm!  You wont get this Authentic experience in any Filibertos, taco bell, or any of the other pretenders!! Enjoy!!
