I loved this place! Yeah it is on the pricey side but you're on the Vegas strip what do you expect??? 

I loved the salt foam cloud margarita! I did try the flaka one but it wasn't awesome. The server happily exchanged it for another salt foam. 

The carnitas taco and veggie fried rice were definitely my favorite things we tried. Service was good both times we dined and will probably make it a tradition to return each time we go. Can't wait to try the other Jose Andres restaurants in Vegas next time as well!
