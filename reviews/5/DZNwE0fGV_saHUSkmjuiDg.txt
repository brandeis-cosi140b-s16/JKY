Being from out of town, we turned to Yelp for a nice Mexican place. This was highly rated so we gave it a try. I had the enchiladas and my wife had the fajitas. Both were excellent and the service was great. The enchiladas were served unique from the traditional chili smothering. They instead came like fajitas with onions, red and green peppers. Nice change of pace. We were not disappointed. Very good.
