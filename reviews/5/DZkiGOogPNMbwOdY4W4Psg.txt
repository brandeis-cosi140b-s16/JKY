Where do I start?!? The service was amazing. Carmie was the one taking care of us. Super sweet and knows her menu very well.

The chips and salsa were really good. They give you three types of salsas... all are very good.

Then my fiance had the jalape√±o carnitas burger... wow wow wow!! Sooo good. Could not stop eating. It came was delicious  fries. 

I ordered the Baja ceviche which comes on a tostada and let me tell you! That fish and shrimp was very fresh. I'm picky when it comes to seafood but this was amazing!

For dessert we got this rich chocolate almost mousse. Amazing!
The other dessert that came with it was good too... but I'm still stuck on the chocolate one.

I will definitely  come back!
