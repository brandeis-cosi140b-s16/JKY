TC tacos has an incredibly friendly staff who is genuinely concerned about the quality of your experience and food. Normally, it'd be awkward when they ask you about the food, I often end up just nodding, but TC tacos has an incredible selection of fresh smoked meats. 

No awkward deception necessary, the food is great. The smoked meats make this place stand above other taco joints, and the staff just add to the foodie experience.
