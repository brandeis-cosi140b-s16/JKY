I typically hate going to mexican restaurants because I usually leave thinking that I could have made better mexican food at home but this place totally made me feel like I was at home eating my own homemade food. Their guacamole is delicious, the beans were so good, tacos were fried perfectly and not greasy. My husband had the chile rellenos and enchilada and loved them. My son had the fideo and quesadillas, he said his dinner was "the best" :D Our favorite was the sopa de fideo. This is the first restaurant I have been to that offered it in their menu and it tasted totally homemade and was incredibly delicious!! Also the service was awesome, probably the best we've had in a long time. Waiters were friendly, our drinks and chips/dip were never empty, and they made sure to check in with us pretty often. Highly recommend this place! Will definitely come back next time we are in Vegas!!!
