I went during their opening week and despite the obvious challenges they faced while learning a new restaurant and concept and staff I went back because the food is off the hook good and cheap as hell. 
Both times I got the half and half tortillas, I like the softness of the masa. I also got the chicken and short rib. The chicken is light and flavorful, the short rib is hearty and savory and smoky. 
I chose the "Christmas" sauce, half red, half green. the green is fruity, light and refreshing while the red is super smoky and hearty. I like the red better and need to remind myself for next time but the two together make a nice contrast. 
I got the cheddar cheese and then the guac and pico with the habanero on the side, its hot, and I mean hot. What I think is hot most people cannot eat. To me the habanero is edible but if you use too much you could ruin the meal. 
My friend got the chicken and the mushroom and loved both. He also tried the jalapeno ranch dressing and it was awesome ( I stole some). 
The first time we visited was their opening week and the wait was tough, the food ran out, the staff was over their heads. 
This time the wait was non existent, the food plentiful and fresh and the staff orderly and efficient. What a difference a few months made!!

Some people complain of "chipotle with enchiladas", and the resemblance is there in the production line and the mexican flavor but thats where it ends. With the huge amount of choices and customization as well as the food being 10x as flavorful this is the clear winner. 
The food is as flavorful as Richardsons or Barrio Cafe. no joke. 
I am glad to see they worked out the bugs. 
Eat here. Again and again.
