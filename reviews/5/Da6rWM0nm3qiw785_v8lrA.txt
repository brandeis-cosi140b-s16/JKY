I read the review from the person who prefers Mi Patio. That is hysterical. I go to Mi Patio to meet my white friends for lunch. When I want the real thing I go to Pitic. I can't believe nobody has commented on the soups. Their albondigas and their caldo de res are the best. Their green (chile) salsa has no rival. Excellent tortillas. The #14 is killer. This is authenitic, maybe too much for some people. I agree that the outside is scary, but the inside is fine. Like ALL restaurants, some things are better than others, but almost all their dishes are outstanding. Buena Comida!
