Legit mexican!   Seriously, I love Robertos, but this has something on Robertos, its the same , but better.  I cant put my finger on it, but I know its better, lets think here.....cheap as dirt, quick, flavorful, fresh made to order, glazed meats, mexican workers, bare bones, simple and it makes sense all together.  So simple it is , but remember simple can be supercalafragelistickexpeealodocious.....super for short.   No "undalay" over there for a burrito filler!   Satisfied always!  5star mexican!
