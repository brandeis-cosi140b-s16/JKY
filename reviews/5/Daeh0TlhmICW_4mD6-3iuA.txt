I feel guilty that I have never reviewed Cabo Fish Taco before because it is my favorite place! I love this place and I always take people here when they come to visit. My favorites are the BBQ mahi tacos, lemon grilled shrimp tacos and the mahi maui burrito but you really can't go wrong here. My fiance loves the rasta pasta. The guacamole is also delicious. The only thing that is sometimes a downside to this place is that it can get really loud in the restaurant which makes it hard to talk at dinner. Also, since it is so tasty, sometimes you have to wait awhile for a table. But it is SO worth it!
