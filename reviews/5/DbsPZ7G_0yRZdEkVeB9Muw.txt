Had a fantastic Sunday Brunch here last Sunday. Found the place by accident.....had been looking at open houses and got very hungry...after driving around we noticed lots of people walking down a little alley way and saw the Carefree Station Grill and Bar sign. We decided to follow them and came across a beautiful courtyard and restaurant.  My husband had the Texas Rubbed Rib Eye and Eggs with mashed potato on the side...which he said was very good. I had the Smoked Salmon Platter which was very tasty. The brunch comes with bottomless Champagne which is fun unless of course you are the designated driver : (   
The Menu is quite extensive and there are many choices for everyone.
It is a casual atmosphere, nicely decorated and very clean. The staff are friendly and efficient. On a cooler day you also have a nice courtyard to sit in and there is also an upstairs patio which I am unsure of the hours....the website recommends you call for the rooftop bar hours. We will be going back : )
