Wow!  Not only is the food incredible, the service is amazing.  The entrees are unbelievably creative and this place is every foodie's dream.  Went here for Sunday brunch and let the owner advise us on what to order. What a treat!!  The atmosphere is cozy, modern, fun and a great way to spend a Sunday morning/afternoon.  I was also really impressed with the selection of Mimosas; they had unique flavors such as prickly pear and sangria and a sangria sampler!  The food was fresh, the presentation was beautiful and there was a DJ spinning Latin Beats.  After breakfast, we ended our meal with a tres leches French toast dish.  Yum!  Highly recommend the guac and pork belly English muffin dish.  Come one! Come all!  You won't be disappointed.
