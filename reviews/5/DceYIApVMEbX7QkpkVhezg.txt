Awesome food! l had the tequila  shrimp  and my wife had fish tacos ,both tasted great  especially  with a few shots of tequila   and a beach bar rum drink.The service was on top notch.I mentioned  our anniversary and the server put  Chicken Foot  on the stereo and gave us a couple  complimentary  shots..This was our 1st destination  on our vacation  and we're not let down.Thanks Sammy we will  be  back .
