Great food. 

Just got home from our first but not last visit. Wife had Carnitas and I had Mole, both were wonderful.

Guacamole was just the way we like it, avocado, garlic and salt. Let's celebrate the avocado. 

Three wonderful table sauces.

You won't go wrong here, this is great Mexico City food.

Dinner for 2, before tip $38.00, we had iced tea to drink.
