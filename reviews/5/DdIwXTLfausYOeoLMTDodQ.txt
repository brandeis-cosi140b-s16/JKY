TACOS AL PASTOR WITH PINEAPPLE, ONION, CILANTRO AND THE ORANGE SALSA BOOM! Thank me later. Of course I stumbled onto this little taco cart after a night of partying downtown a few years ago and now I'll drive across town for a taco. It's on the corner in the parking lot of a tire shop and the parking can be crazy but who cares. The juiciest, most flavorful al pastor I've ever tried. I could drink their orange salsa it's so good. Make sure you scarf down your tacos in the parking lot because you'll go back to buy a couple of more, trust me!
