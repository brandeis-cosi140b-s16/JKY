I absolutely love this place. Their carne asada plate, carnitas, and shrimp diabla are all delicious! My mother usually gets the diabla or mojo shrimp. I personally love the quesadillas here. I know that may sound weird but I love me a good cheesy and crispy quesadilla when I see one. Especially when you want something quick or late night because they're open 24 hours. Best little Mexican joint on Lake Mead. I live in Cali and go to this restaurant every time I'm in Vegas.
