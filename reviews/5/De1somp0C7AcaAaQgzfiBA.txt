The great taco quest continues....

This place is excellent. Friendly staff, fat tacos, great prices and a clean restaurant. Price is outstanding. I think around $1.85 (????) or so per taco. Can't remember for sure. They win on all fronts and do not fall short. 

Sure, it would be nice if there was a better selection of sauces, but that's ok, we can't have it all. 

Ordered al pastor and chicken tacos and I'm so glad I did. Got some veggies grilled up at the same time and the food couldn't have tasted better. Only downside is that they didn't put pineapple on the pastor. I guess you have to ask? I didn't know until I got home, so next time for sure I'll request it. 

This place is small and can easily be missed. It's on the north side of Tropicana next to Arby's in a so-so shopping center. 

Definitely worth a visit!
