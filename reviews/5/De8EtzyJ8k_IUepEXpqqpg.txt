My favorite taco place!

I have to visit every time I come to vegas and it seems like I always get the same thing. The Adobada tacos (spicy pork). The creamy green sauce makes the taco even more delicious.

I've also had the half order of the carne asada fries. For two people, this is usually plenty because they fill up the half togo box full of fries and they give you a good amount of meat. And what makes it better? THE CREAMY GREEN SAUCE! The fries are crunchy and they come right out of the fryer.

I'm going to keep coming back until this place either disappears or stops making good food (hopefully that never happens) =]
