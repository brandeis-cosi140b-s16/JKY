We were staying at the Luxor casino and decided to eat some authentic Mexican food and Las Enchiladas de mama hit the spot perfectly. ..The service was awesome and the food was perfect and the Chile was excellent!!! The price was budget saving and gave us reason to return again before we leave las vegas. ..IF you're looking for good mexican food this is the place especially if you're on a budget...I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN!!!!  By the way, they have all you can eat enchiladas Sunday's and Wednesday's from  9am to 11pm...F.Y.I.
