This place is the best! I go here at least twice a week. The owner is really nice and always comes out to say hi. I also appreciate when the kind girl remembers you and what you ordered last. It's a place to get a great lunch, dinner or even have tacos for breakfast! Have you done that? I have done that here, its the best here. 

FYI: DONT use the restroom. It looks like the building is crying. I think it might be from a leaking pipe. It isn't a sign of the quality of food.
