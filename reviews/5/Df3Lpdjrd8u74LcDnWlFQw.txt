Great food, friendly waitstaff!

Appetizer sampler was good, but my burrito was the killer! It was amazing and big! I am so ashamed that I left some of it because I couldn't finish it.

My waitress was so nice and helpful when a couple at another table dropped a glass on the floor and broke it. She made sure that the customers were safe and move to another table and clean first before she cleaned the floor.
