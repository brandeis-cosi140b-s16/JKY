I haven't had Posole this good since I visited New Mexico and Colorado. It packs such a heavy flavor. The street tacos (I had the Al Pastor) were absolutely amazing with cliantro and lime infused rice. 

I also tried the Red Sangria (I know, not a Margarita?) and I can't wait to just get a pitcher of it next time. 

But what really impressed me was the Flan. Hands down the best flan I've had. It was light and yet so creamy. Not too sugary but just enough to satiate and satisfy. 

Tiffany was serving my boyfriend and I and she was so nice. Exemplary service. 

Chef Paco table touched us and the pride he took in his menu is commendable. Homemade recipes he's willing to share and I respect the time he took to talk with us. 

We will be back and we're bringing friends with us. :)
