Last Friday was the first time we've eaten inside this Rubio's.  We've always ordered take out.  And we were super pleased, especially me about this Rubio's.  The manager, Keith, was super nice and totally busy the whole time we were there.  We could tell there was a huge focus on keeping things clean and neat.

The floors were clean.  All the tables were cleaned.  As soon as someone left, someone there would clean the table.  They were organizing and keeping things stocked, like the salsa bar.

I had commented the Rubio's we most frequent, the one on Germann and Gilbert Road isn't always so clean.  

Keith also explained to us that none of the Rubio's in AZ are franchises.  I had commented to him we always get great service at all the Rubio's we've been to, and we've been to all of them in the Southeast Phx Valley multiple times.

There were some young workers in there, but that's fine.  They had great attitudes, willingness to learn and just were busy working.  

Awesome Rubio's!!!  We'll come more often.

The food is good as usual.
