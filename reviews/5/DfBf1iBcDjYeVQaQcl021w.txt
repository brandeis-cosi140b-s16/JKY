Wow, El Bravo never disappoints! My first visit to El Bravo was 15+ years ago and I have kept coming back because it seems to get better every time. I developed a high bar for judging Mexican food while growing up in Phoenix -- probably because of El Bravo!

My favorites are either the traditional combo plates (some variation of tacos + enchiladas + tamales) or the Machaca plate. Great family place!

Special shout-out to the tamales: El Bravo makes over 700 dozen tamales around the holidays; they don't make them until ordered, so it's fair to say that demand is *very* high for these delicious fares!

Viva El Bravo!
