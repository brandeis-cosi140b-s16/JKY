A Red Burger with a pork taco on the side...I think that covers all the food groups.  Jo is a lady who really likes food...you can tell when you talk to her about it.  Andyou can tell when you eat it, because it's great.  Also picked up a couple of cupcakes; one with bacon and maple, the other a chocolate and chile...;but can't taste those until I get home and my wife gets a taste as well.
She makes me wish I was still a night owl, because she caters primarlily to the late night crowd.  I'm always happy when she does a day gig somewhere close to my job.
I highly recommend.
