:) my review after 2 months of hiatus and iam back! And my first place to go didn't disapoint! It just became one of favorite place to eat. This place has the best breakfast  burrito I ever have tasted. Miss Irma is so gracious and kind:) you can taste it from her food. Here's the 5 reason why this place should be supported.

1. Locally owned. Heart warming welcome when you get to the door.
2. Clean. Let me emphasize that, very clean. Just check their staff wearing gloves when they serve you:)
3. Price. That price. Check the pictures:) 3.99 for a burrito!
4. Presentation, for a small place their presentation is very impressive.
5. The flavor. Just come and try. 

Iam so sure youll like this place that iam willing to  pay your food if you don't like it. For Less than 5 bucks and you'll have a new place to eat.

:) the place is small and in a very hard to find. But I tell you. The trip to this place is worth it. 

Again less than 10 bucks for a great food. So great I am pretty sure you'll like it.


Update: brought my family back to taste Miss Irma's cooking. My mom said her beef soup is one of the best beef soup she tasted here, in the valley. That's a compliment that's hard to get. My Family also loved how Miss Irma always comes and say "hi" to their customers. This place  just made my family a believer of local small local businesses. Hope this place gets more attention;) 

Yelpers come and try their foods.
