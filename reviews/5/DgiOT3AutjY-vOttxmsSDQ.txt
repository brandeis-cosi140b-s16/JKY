Had a great time here!! We went on a Thursday, which they have all day happy hour - $2.50 shiner bottles, $3 drafts, and $3 frozen margaritas among many other things!

Started with a simple chips and salsa for an appetizer. They have a chose your own salsa bar, which is kind of cool. But it gets really crowded and our table was right next to it so that was a little distracting. None of the salsas were amazing, but there salsa verde, I think, was decent. (The only green one)!

I chose a two taco platter for my entree. I got one hot mama (buffalo chicken style taco) and the Baka blackened tilapia with a side of rice and retried beans. The hot mama taco was delicious!! The buffalo sauce they drizzled on had a nice flavor with a little kick. Two thumbs up. The tilapia however left me disappointed. I just didn't care for the sauces and the blackened seasoning did nothing for it. 

I tried some sweet potato fries that came with my sisters order, and those were on point. Nice and crispy with a good dipping sauce. My boyfriend also really enjoyed his food; he tried three separate tacos (although the he said the chorizo one was rather greasy). 

All in all, it was a good time. While I didn't care for one of my tacos, there was so much else to chose from that sounded delicious that I give it five stars. Our service was great and everyone was so friendly. Great atmosphere and I enjoyed the decor, however tacky tex mex decor can get! Would love to come back.
