I was looking for a better breakfast burrito and I found it. I had the steak & egg burrito w/ pico and it was awesome. The chief was really kind because he gave me extra salsa and guacamole, which was super fresh.  I bought the refried beans and they tasted home made. The egg was real and the service was excellent. Don't hesitate, its a small business with huge potential.
