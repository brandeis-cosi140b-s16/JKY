I am a self admitted food snob and don't care for the "Chain" restaurants. I can tell the difference between fresh and canned, processed or frozen. Casa de Angelina is definitely FRESH made from scratch! The chef even made a ranch dressing for my daughter on one of our visits.

While it isn;t New Mexico, or Spanish, the recipes are still good and I forgot about that at the first mouth watering bite.
Those who didn't like it, are most likely just used to the canned/processed/frozen food from other chain restaurants. 

Casa de Angelina delivered incredible service as well as a freshly prepared meal that rivaled a few "Fine Dining" establishments I frequent. The food is amazing and doesn't leave a bloated feeling after eating as with the other mexican food restaurants in the valley. The presentation of the food is also very appealing.

I have taken my wife and family back a few times and have found a new favorite restaurant when we eat out. We will continue to go back.
