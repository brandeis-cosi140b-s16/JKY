This is the restaurant where my Newlyweded cousins had their wedding dinner, it was catered with some great food......chicken enchiladas, chicken or steak fajitas, spanish rice, salad & beans. 
The dinner was so yummy and the servers were GREAT! 
The drinks were even better! 
If I ever decide to go back to VEGAS I will be paying a visit to Cantina Mexican Restaurant again!
