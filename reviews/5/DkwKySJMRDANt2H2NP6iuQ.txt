The only bad thing about this place is not knowing what to order because everything is so amazing! I love the breakfast burritos. First timers need to either try "The Country" or "The Shack". Burrito Shack is my gold standard for burritos, and I take all of my out of town visitors there. They are never disappointed. Everything is super fresh and super delicious! Keep up the good work!
