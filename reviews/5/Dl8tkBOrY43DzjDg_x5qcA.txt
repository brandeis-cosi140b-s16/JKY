Highly regarded by a trusted local, we were sent here for the al pastor tacos and the mole, both equally fantastic.  But we weren't told we'd see "deals" go down in the alley out back and also witness girls smoking crack driving down the street.  We're not from around there so we chalked it up to the way the locals do it.  Made me wonder if the tacos would've tasted better after a smoke.
