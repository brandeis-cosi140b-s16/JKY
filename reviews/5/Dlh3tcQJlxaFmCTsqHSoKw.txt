I first found out about Pancho's Kitchen through the Fresh 52 Farmer's Market at Tivoli Village. I've tried three of their most popular dishes: tacos, burrito bowl, and tamales.

Tacos: I normally get carne asada tacos. I love that they melt cheese on the tortilla and then put the steak directly on top, so when you bite into the taco you get a perfect mixture of both flavors. I also love that they cook the steak on the crispy side, so it has a nice char taste to it.

Bowl: I typically get carne asada for their burrito bowls, but I highly recommend asking them to put the veggies they put from their vegetarian bowls in the steak bowl--there's a great mixture of cauliflower, zucchini, lettuce, and tomatoes.

Tamale: their vegetarian tamales are the way to go! Love the flavors and textures you get from the veggies they have in there. The sweet corn and carnitas tamales are delicious as well.

A must try!
