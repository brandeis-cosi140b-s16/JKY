As a native Texan, I love Mexican food and I never thought I would have such a hard time finding a good Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas.  However, everytime I go to a new one, I either get sick or the food is terribly bland.

Toto's is the closest I've had to authentic and delicious.  Whether you're a tourist or a local, this place is a must!
