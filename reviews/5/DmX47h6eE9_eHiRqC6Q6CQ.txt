We are regulars here and at another La Canasta location. Every time we go, the food is delicious and fresh. The salsa is TO DIE FOR. I always make sure I get my pint of salsa and pound of chips every visit. It won't go to waste in my house. My favorite items are the red enchiladas, quesadillas, and carne asada burrito. My boyfriend lives for their machaca burrito.
