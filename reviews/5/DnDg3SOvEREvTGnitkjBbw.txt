This is a great airport eatery and bar. I came here once before and had an awesome Bloody Mary. This morning my husband and I had breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich.  Both were substantial (particularly the burrito which was bursting with chile verde) and delicious! Servers were very nice too.
