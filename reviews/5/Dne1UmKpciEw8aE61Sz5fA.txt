I was pleasantly surprised by how good my meal was. I ordered the chicken chimichanga which came with the choice of red, green or cheese sauce. Our waiter suggested I order all three. Great choice!  It was delicious!  My husband loved it too! It was pretty large, so after filling up on chips and salsa, he gladly finished the other half of the chimichanga I couldn't eat.

The salsa they brought out with the chips was deceivingly delicious. It looked almost like ketchup. Smooth, not the chunky tomato salsa I'm used to. But the flavor was amazing. I loved it. I could've eaten it by itself with a spoon.

I'm going to have to remember this place the next time I am in Vegas!
