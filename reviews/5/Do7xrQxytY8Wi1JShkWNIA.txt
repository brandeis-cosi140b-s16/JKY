For some reason, I always get stuck in a rut at most restaurants.  I find one menu item that's my favorite, and I rarely to never stray.  However, something about Gallo Blanco makes me bold, and I've ordered something different on many occasions... and now, I don't even think I have a favorite dish anymore.  I think I have about 7.  You really can't go wrong at this place.  It's fantastic.
