My wife and I ordered a grande breakfast burrito cut in two halves for an early Sunday morning repast. It came with chips, a small amount of salad and was enormous! I would estimate that it approached the size of two regular burros. We added carrots, onions, chills and salsas from the copious salsa bar for a complete meal. In fact, we could consume only half of the delicious, gargantuan feast and took the remaining half home for a second meal. This means the per person, per meal price calculates to $1.75! Astounding bargain for food of this quality and flavor.
