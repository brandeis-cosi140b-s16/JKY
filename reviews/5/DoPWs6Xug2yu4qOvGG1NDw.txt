At first I was hesitant being mexican myself.  The decor was very colorful and the service, despite the reviews I read, was great.  I ordered the chicken flautas and it was not cooked how it is traditionally cooked, but it was still amazing.  Normally they are fried with flower tortillas, but this had corn tortillas and I'm not entirely sure how they cooked it.  None the less it was an awesome dish. I also ordered the chile relleno a la carte and they messed up and brought me the whole meal.  Good thing was they only charged me for the a la carte.   Overall great experience, don't believe the bad reviews.

Also,  the hot sauce they bring out in the bottle with your chips is awesome!
