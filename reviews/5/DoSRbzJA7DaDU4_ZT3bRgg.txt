I've passed by this place so many times. But I'm so happy to know that it's close by!

I went in today, I was so starved, glad that the place was dead. (I knew I'd get my food right away.)
I ordered the Carne Asada burrito, three rolled tacos with Guac and cheese, and a large cup of Horchata.

The rolled tacos were alright. But they slapped on a mountain of guac on top of it, that I overlooked their boringness and enjoyed every bite. (I love guac. D: SO MUCH. Avocados FTW!!!)

I didn't realize how big the carne asada burrito was until I ate almost 2/3rds of it. I almost died, over stuffing myself because it was good, really good. I've had Carne plenty other places before, but this ghetto looking hole in the wall restaurant probably takes the #1 spot for yummiest Carne Asada.

The horchata was... Well, horchata! Very refreshing and helped balance out the flavor of the Carne asada burrito.

The service was good, and quick!

Definitely going back, probably tomorrow or something. Gonna try out the rest of their menu. I'll come back with an update when I've tried half their menu.
