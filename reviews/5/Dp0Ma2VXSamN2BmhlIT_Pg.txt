Sunday fun day downtown Scottsdale as I just ate and found this place, it instantly reminded me of Cabo. I stopped to tell them how awesome the carne asada smelled and expressed my remorse for just eating. He hands me 2 cards for 2 free tacos anyway.......and I came back a few hours later to cash in........FABULOUS!!
A must stop if your in old town!!
