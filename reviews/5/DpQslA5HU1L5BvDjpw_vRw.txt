First of all: I review this place as a fast food place. Of course you can't expect the same for less then $ 10 as you can for $ 200+ in a nice restaurant.

When that's said: This is the place I have eaten most of my lunches for the last couple of years. I always get the grilled 3 piece chicken. As side orders I pick cole slaw and pinto beans (they took out the grilled corn that I had from time to time).

The chicken here is in fact better then what you get in most fine restaurants. The side orders are okay, but nothing special. The price for food with drinks is less then $ 10, so you get a really tasty lunch for a cheap price here!

If you have a choice for when to go here I would recommend going outside the busiest lunch hour (Noon-1 PM), but before 6. After 6 I have had a couple of experiences with a bit dry of a chicken.

You might ask how I can give a place 5* with not everything perfect in my review. Compared to almost all other fast food places it's in another league. And I love chicken :)
