Let me start by saying I am Mexican. (This should tell u  something, aaand should sum it up.) Now I have been here 3 times, had their Shrimp cocktail (twice) and it was delicious!!! Also had the sonoran hot dog and it was also delish!!! Im on my way back now to try some tacos..stay tuned... 

I did also try their Carne asada tacos, they were good also! This place is legit!!! Remember, If you see mexican/latin ppl in a Mexican restaurant YOU know it's Good for SURE! lol
