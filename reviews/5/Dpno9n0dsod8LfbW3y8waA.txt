We visited this place the night of the color run and had a BLAST. It was like eating in my Nana ' s kitchen. Food was well prepared and had flavor you don't expect from a chain restaurant. I asked about it and our waitress mentioned that most of her family worked there. She took pride in how long she had worked at the restaurant and treated us like family. We were tired, hungry and she knew exactly what would hit the spot. Can't wait to go back again soon.
