Food was AWESOME!!! Went here to grab lunch, and was pleasantly impressed. 100% authentic! The staff is courteous and professional. I had chorizo and Campechano (Steak & sausage) tacos. The salsa was good too! Just the right amount of spicy. My only negative is that the menu is kind of pricey, and chips and salsa does not automatically come with your order. The sides in particular are quite pricey, for example: a side of cheese is $1.00....if you want to include sour cream ect....expect a hefty bill. Other than that...the place is a authentic gem, and I highly recommend.
