I've been hearing about this place for a long while from various friends, specifically one friend. Finally decided to try it when near the area. 

Super busy location. First time ive been to a restaurant like this. There are different lines for different things you want. Top favorite meat among a lot of people is the spicy pork (adobada). Then of course, you have the usual carne asada, as well as the more "exotic" eats like stomach, tongue, etc

Their taco's are priced pretty much around the same price ~$2/ea with exception to the tongue being $2.25

Aside from the tacos, another popular thing that was suggested were carne asada fries. Being one who has tried carne asada fries in the past from another place (Roberto's), i was eager to try these ! 

Adobada - spicy pork, freshly sliced off the rotating spit. Seasoned nicely. Not spicy (sadly) but still delicious

Carne Asada - Freshly cooked on the hot plate and sliced. More towards the medium  to medium well but still fairly tender. Would like a less meat temp cook but they probably use a better quality or cut of meat to produce a nice tender texture. 

Pork Stomach - simmering in an unknown broth, cut upon order. Very tender and flavorful. 

Beef Tongue (lengua) - same as the stomach, cut upon order. Super flavorful and tender. Tongue has a different texture than normal meat but its porous in a way to soak up some of the broth it was sitting in

Nice location, which they'd open one up on the west side of town. I believe there's one on the Strip as well.
