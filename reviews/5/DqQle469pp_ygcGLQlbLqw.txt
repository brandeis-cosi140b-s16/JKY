What a place! The food is out of this world. The braised beef melts in your mouth. The grouper was buttery, flaky and barely stayed on the fork (that's a good thing!). The beer battered mahi-mahi tacos were a party in my mouth. The pomegranate margarita was fruity and yummy. The jalape√±o cucumber margarita was crisp and sassy. The traditional mojito and primarita were refreshing and excellent. And our server Kyle was knowledgeable and gregarious. We would eat here every other day if we lived here.
