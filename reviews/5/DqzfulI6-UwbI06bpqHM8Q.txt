The 4 of us visited on Friday night and, having never been there, were unsure what to expect but knowing of Richardson's we were hoping for the best. Well, that's what we got... The best food we've had in Ahwatukee for a very long time and some pretty damn good sangria to boot. The combo was ordered by an excellent cook who was impressed with the variety and quality, my wife had the fillet which was unbelievable(I tasted it to make sure lol), myself and my friend had the carne adovada which was smoky and hot with a flavor I haven't tasted before. The sangria was tasty and powerful forcing me to switch to beer after the first one since I had to drive. The staff was very attentive and friendly and the interior was decorated in a Santa Fe New Mexico style. Very cool. We had ZERO complaints and will be back on a regular basis so we can try the other dishes. Don't miss this one
