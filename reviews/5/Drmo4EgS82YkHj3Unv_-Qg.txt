yes, if you're looking for something super expensive and fancy, or somewhere to take a date, you'll be out of luck here.

but if you want a hole-in-the-wall mexican place, i feel like this one can't be beat. huge portions, cheap prices, and there's just something about it i can't place. i just love it so.

its breakfast burritos are always there for me if I need them (chorizo, but also poke a hole in the bottom of the burrito before you start eating it because you're going to want a way for the oil to drip out as you eat it). The carne asada fries have helped me through many a boring saturday. by that i mean if i was bored on a saturday afternoon, i would eat them and then take a nice long nap through the afternoon. if you can stay awake after a portion that size, you're probably on meth. 

anyway, i'm always going to love this place. i hope the family running it finds a way to get rich off of this.
