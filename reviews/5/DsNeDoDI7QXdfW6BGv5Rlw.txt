Delicious!!! The place is gorgeous with great decor. Ordered Ropa Vieja and Quesadillas and both were just perfect....Love the sweet fried plantains!  You get plenty of food with each plate.  Will def go back!! Oh and kids eat free on Wednesday.  I agree, restaurants in this spot usually dont stay open for long but I sure hope La Catrina stays here for good!
