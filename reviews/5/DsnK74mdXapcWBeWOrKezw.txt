This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in the valley. If you haven't gone, grab your car keys and go! (You can look at the menu in all good time, but trust me just order the roasted garlic plate as soon as you sit down. It's amazing!)  I've moved out of the neighborhood, so now this is a rare treat reserved for when I'm in the area. Oh happy day! A meeting in the general proximity so I called in a lunch order. George is an expected part of my visits, so seeing him felt like everything was right in the world. :) I grab my to go order, cruise the 20 minutes back to my office just to find my much anticipated Chimayo Chicken with a green chili pepper are no where to be found. I am sure maybe the Sante Fe chicken is amazing fresh from the kitchen, But by the time I had it, it was cold fries and broken hollandaise. That's hard to come back from. Everything there is amazing so if you like sort of a plain Jane menu pick, I bet this is totally an acceptable option.

Feeling bad for calling at 12:15 (and apologizing for the terrible timing) but worse about my lack of lunch satisfaction I let them know there was a mix up and that I'm in no position to come back. The gal on the phone said the order got rung in correctly but the kitchen made it wrong. She was super apologetic and said they'd waive the charge on my card. So while I'm still bummed because that Chimayo chicken is so amazing, and I'm totally jonesing for it, they tried to do what they could. I thought maybe an offer of a free desert to entice me to come back was the most I could expect (assuming they even have desert?).
I'll be back, baby! Thanks for handling it so graciously. I would also recommend any of their salad specials, Tomatillo Toast, Eggs Benedict, turkey relleno and carne adovada. Some think their food is hot, I think it's just right. :) Their wine by the glass is fantastically priced for the selection they offer.  Mmm did you remember about the garlic plate??
