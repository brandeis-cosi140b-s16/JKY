all you chumps who rave about the "authentic" mexican "fare" at carolina's need to calm down and head over to this joint on 16th street. their parilladas (grill platters) come with your choice of grilled meat(s) on a hot bed of coals, with guac, radishes, cucumbers, onions, salsa, tomatoes and two kinds of beans on the side. the $9 half order (with up to two kinds of meat) is plenty for two. 

parking is impossible, and the first time we went there these two homeless dudes came in and stole the tip some other couple had left for the waitress. we felt bad so we left her a 50% tip, but she didn't seem to care.
