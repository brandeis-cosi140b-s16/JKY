Birthday Dinner Party Great for groups there drinks are number one especially the margarita blended with salt with jalapenos. Empanadas (cheese) amazing!!! I am in awe of their service and amazing staff. 
Chef Paco, personally came to greet us, our waiters name was Jesse. I'm calling them out, because I wish they had a place like this in LA.
I love the vibe, the service, everyone, the food, the drinks!!!! I'm truly impressed. 
Please OPEN ONE IN LA. I will personally volunteer to work there! 
This place is AMAZING!!! I'll be back!!!
