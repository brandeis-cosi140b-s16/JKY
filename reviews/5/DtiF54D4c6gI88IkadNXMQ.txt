I will admit the last time I was here a few years ago I was VERY disappointed!

This places was on DDD and i ordered the torta with high hopes.   Turns out, they are just not for me.  

However, my SIL asked us to meet them here two nights ago and I am so glad they convinced us to go!  

The cameron burro is insanely delicious!  Chipotle crema, prefectly prepared tortillas, so much yum.  

I ordered a fancy drink (I think this is a dry restaurant?) and it too me to the beach without the booze! Get the King pi√±a colada, you gotta try it.

My husband ordered the king tacos (with steak) and he loved them.  SIL ordered the same as me, and her husband got another cameron dish that he really enjoyed.  

We also got 4 ceviche orders to start and they were really tasty.   They are individual sized and a great way to begin your meal.  

If you enjoy Tortas I'm still surr this is the place for you!  They just aren't my cup of tea apparently.  I've now learned that LRdlT can serve up delicious food no matter what you're looking for in a hole in the wall Mexican joint.

One last note:  this place is kid friendly too. Server was attentive and made it fun for him.
