I've listed the Meat and Bean burro enchilada style as my last meal on earth.  What you order here is the key to your happiness.  I recommend the clare burro, the enchiladas and the taco's.   The margs are pretty much a bad tequila and off the shelf mixer, but will do if you want them.  I don't ever have the service problems that others have mentioned.  I go here every time i'm in town.  I wish I could get there more often.
