Oye, que tal, mis amigos? This is the premier place if you want to find out what beef chimichangas should taste like. The place has all the charm of an abandoned warehouse, but the eats are second-to-none. Take some tortillas home, you'll be glad you did!

Been eating at this place faithfully for the past five years, and the quality has always been consistent. I get it to go, but sat in a few times to eat, as well. South Phoenix and close to Van Buren, what's not to like?
