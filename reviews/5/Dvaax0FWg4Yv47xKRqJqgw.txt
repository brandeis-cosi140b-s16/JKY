Been here MANY, MANY times, in fact, I might go here in a few minutes.  This is slowly becoming my new favorite burrito spot.  For me, its the steak that makes the difference taste-wise.  Their steak is very juicy and succulent, and has almost a smokey/grilled flavor it to it.   

Their service is usually pretty good.  Although I feel the employees sometimes go too far out of their way to speak and/or joke with you - which I don't mind, but sometimes its excessive.  Otherwise the service is good and they are more than willing to accommodate whatever your specific burrito needs are.

There is usually ample parking and easy access from whichever entrance you choose (that's what she said ;-)).  The inside, though sometimes crowded, is usually clean enough to stay and eat, if you like.  

Friends tell me the bowls and salads are good as well, but I am yet to try either.  I always run the burrito - steak, peppers and onions, plenty of cheese, sour cream and guac, with hot salsa -  NOW that's good eating folks!
