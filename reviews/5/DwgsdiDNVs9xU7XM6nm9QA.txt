I honestly love the Korean Mexican fusion food.  The person who put Korean BBQ in a taco is a genius.  That being said, I ordered the bulgogi tacos and the chicken wings.  Both were delicious!  I wish I could've tried more food, but I wasn't super hungry.

The table next to me ordered the tostadas and kim chi fried rice.  Gotta get that next time because they looked bomb diggity!
