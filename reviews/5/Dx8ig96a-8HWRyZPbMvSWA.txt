On our way to the Hilton to meet some wonderful friends and play at the pool.  We were a bit hungry.   Wife and son had been here about a year ago and said it was good.  WOW.   A CARNE ASADA BURRITO WITH FLAVOR!  Whomever is in the kitchen, KEEP THEM.  The food was so good I couldn't wait to go back, had to stop on the way out of town.  We want to try the whole menu.  Two days in a row the wait staff were pleasant and happy to be there, like they had a vested interest in the success of the restaurant.  Clean, fun, fantastic food at a reasonable price.  Open one in Oro Valley!
