El Magnifico - Phenomenal Burgers 
What makes this place unique is the spices they use and the way they flavor their meats. I ordered the Taqueria Burger late on a Saturday,  and the only drawback was that it took a while for it to come. (A while meaning I opened up my laptop and almost completed an online traffic school class before my food arived. (In their defense, they had only been open a few days, and they were still getting the schedule and menu down, and probably didn't anticipate a Vegas late night traffic surge). The manager personally came over and let us know the situation,  and took care of us.

Our waitress was Cy, and she was very nice, she brought us some complementary snacks to compensate for the wait as well, now it was like thanksgiving. I was starving and the extra food was very appreciated,  but it was their attitude about it, that turned me into a repeat customer.

The food was so tasty I came back the following day to try the Mahi tacos. Nina, my new waitress subbed out a few ingredients for avocado and their Chipotle mayonnaise. Obviously it took longer,  but I wanted them custom made.

Ambience:
It is Vegas so of course there was a big screen TV with the playoffs in the background.  

This is not "fast food," but if you like authentic Mexican food, you may enjoy this restaurant. Highly recommended.
