I honestly had to write this review, this place totally deserves it. First of all the food was amazing,  customer service is the best. I came earlier today with my girlfriend and had forgot my ring in the ladies room, the girl (Janet) went and searched for it 3 times till she found it and kept it for me .. ring wasn't valuable but was an important souvenir.  Anyways, I got here and they welcomed me again and gave me these corona rings and sunglasses and they were very extremely friendly... this is the new spot for me.. thank you very much
