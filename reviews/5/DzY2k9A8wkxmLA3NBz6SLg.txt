I agree with a prevous poster who says this Rubios is the best in the area. The employees are super friendly and nice. Between my kids and myself, we usually make tons of modifications:( hold this, add that etc.)...I always order the chipotle ranch chicken salad (minus chicken and cheese w/ dressing on the side)..they always take my order without batting an eyelash and ALWAYS get it right..my salad is always crisp and fresh and we probably take out from Rubios 3 times a month...
