I first moved to Gilbert in 1992, I was 9. When I first started driving I always got gas at the Diamond Shamrock(now a Valero) that Rio Rico's shares a parking lot with and found it very strange that a restaurant was next to a vet office. Total turn off for me! A couple friends brought up Rio Rico's and I kept saying oh ewwww, I am not going there. They swore by it and said it was by far the best Mexican food they have had! Well all these years later I have been 5 times since July. The first 4 times were nearly every weekend in the month of July. 

I get the same thing every time, the #13, the chips and salsa are AMAZING!! I still think it's weird being next to a vet office but I've gotten past that and just enjoy the delicious food. I could eat their chips and salsa all day long.

I'm already planning my next lunch at Rico's!
