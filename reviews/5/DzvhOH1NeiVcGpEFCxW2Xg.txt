This is a Latino butcher shop - deli. They sell fabulous carnitas and barbacoa by the pound (about $8 per), they also make delicious fresh corn tortillas for $1/pound. Queso fresco that is seriously fresh (not the crap you get at the grocery store). They sell several fresh salsas the orange looking one is really good, I think it's made with chipotle peppers. It's spicy so a little goes a long way. Hit it on the weekend and they sell fresh pico. If they ask you if you want carnitas mixed say NO unless you like all kinds of pig parts.
