I eat at Otro once a week. Their carne asada tacos are to-die-for. And who could pass up happy hour prices- They just added a chicken taco too, and the marinade is delicious. The chips are crunchy and the guacamole appetizer is worth the price. My dad is pescatarian and he loves the shrimp and veggie tacos, too. If you are looking for a quick, modern Mex bite, go to OTRO!
