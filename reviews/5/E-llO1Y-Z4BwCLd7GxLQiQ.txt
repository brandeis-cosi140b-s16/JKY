This was a fantastic experience from the minute we walked in. Best meal I have had in the Valley and served in a beautiful patio setting. I had the beet salad- beautifully presented with yellow and purple beets. For the main course we both had the Halibut which was substituted for the Chilean sea bass but prepared the same way. It was bar none the best piece of fish I have had in AZ and  beautifully prepared. Desserts are available in petite portions so you can sample several. Get the Chocolate Nachitos for SURE! We loved it so much we went back for dinner the next night and I had lunch there the day after that. Every visit was great. service excellent too..especially Lynn. My new favorite!
