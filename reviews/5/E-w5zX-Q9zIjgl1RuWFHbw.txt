This place has the best tamales that I have had in Phoenix! The bean dip sauce that comes with the chips is phenomenal--if you are into beans! Salsa is great. I have had the chilaquiles , enchiladas, and tacos. I am fans of it all! The drinks are a little overpriced. I would have liked to have seen a queso dip but heck, I will eat the beans! Its family friendly and has a small outside area for dining too. We have not had a bad meal and we are there once a week.
