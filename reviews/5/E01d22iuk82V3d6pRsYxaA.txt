My friend told me I had to try this place and I am so glad I finally did. It's a small space and doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is delicious. I tried the carne asada and pastor tacos. Both were delicious but the pastor was my favorite! The tacos came with lime, cucumber and radishes on the side. The salsas were flavorful and tortillas tasted fresh. I've also tried their carne asada that is marinated there. My friends threw it on the grill and it was so good. They also bought some of the small flour tortillas from there that were perfect for tacos. I will definitely be back.
