This location compared to the location they opened in the northwest valley on buffalo are worlds apart. Bean dip with flavor fresh tasting chips and far better food quality, technical work and presentation. Better atmosphere but still great service as at the location on Buffalo.  If that location wants to keep going  they need to take a lesson from the original.
