Chef Paco is the man! El Dorado Cantina has a great atmosphere and great servers like Jesse with the mustache. I have only been here twice, but each experience has been worth while. 
The food is excellent. Besides the fresh produce there is so much flavor in every dish. Every plate is authentic. I highly recommend this place and plan to return frequently.
