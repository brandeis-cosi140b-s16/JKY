Can't go wrong with el pollo loco when you want fast food and chicken. It's a great place to go. The charbroiled chicken is delicious. I always get the 2 piece combo, breast and wing, with rice and beans. It sets it off right every time. The house salsa is tasty too. One of my favorite fast food chains.
