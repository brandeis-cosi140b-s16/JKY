I'm pretty picky about Mexican food and honestly I'm not a big fan of it, particularly the americanized versions that spend more time on their decor than their food. But this place is pretty awesome. Alot of their food is in the traditional style and authentic. I absolutely love their margaritas and their tacos and Carne Asada.  Their cocktail de camarone is my absolute fave! ! I've seen places with better decor but quite frankly,  if you want actual authentic Mexican food and ambience-this is where to go.
