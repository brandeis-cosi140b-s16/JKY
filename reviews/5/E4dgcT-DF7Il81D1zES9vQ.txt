Really not sure why this restaurant does not have 5 stars because it is the absolute best, hands down! This is my second time eating here in one week. I crave this place. If you like it hot, the Deviled Shrimp is to die for. The Ranchero Steak plate is also delicious, so delicious that my mom just put in another order to go so she can have it for dinner :) The establishment is clean and the staff is super friendly.   I highly recommend Jalisco's!!!
