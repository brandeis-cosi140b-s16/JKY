Okay... so I'm way behind in the times... but I just went to Chipotle for the very first time ever!  Yesterday, I got a serious burrito craving and checked out Chipotle on E. Camelback Rd.  

I got the steak burrito my way.. .which included black beans, salsa, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce.  The steak pieces were the best I have ever had (in terms of size and temp.  Usually, steak burritos have shriveled up over-cooked marinated meats... but Chipotle had beautiful large pieces of steak that were medium and delicious.  The beans were not too runny... the salsa was very fresh!  No overpowering on seasoning.  Everything well balanced.

The people were friendly, the food was delicious.  Yeah... to me, it is a little expensive for a burrito, but when I have the money, I'd go there again.  Next time I'll try the burrito bowl.  My friend got it and it looked heavenly!
