I'm in love with the chips and salsa. They chips are always so fresh, salsa is delicious and addicting. The bean dip is great too. I came here for lunch today and was very happy with the service and the food. I ordered a margarita and didn't like it much. I will try a different one next time. Everyone was so friendly and were attentive without making me feel rushed to leave. I will definitely be back.
