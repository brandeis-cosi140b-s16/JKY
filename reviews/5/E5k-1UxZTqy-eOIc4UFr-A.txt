Love this place! The patio is awesome! Usually just come in for some delicious corona light on tap and some of the awesome queso, oh and according to my better half the ranger IPA is also on point.... Side bar... Any way tonight we decided to eat and told the bartender Tiffany to just pick something for us she brought out the fajita fundido on separate plates for us to share it was delicious and Tiffany's great! Sit at the bar for the best service, ask for Tiffany
