I came here tonight with a group of air force people and as we all know sometimes large groups in restaurants can end really badly. Not so tonight! 

Chips and salsa were good. Drinks were good and kept full. I'm pregnant so can't vouch for the alcoholic drinks but most people there seemed to be enjoying them very much. Admittedly I was jealous.

I ordered chicken tacos which is pretty basic so I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were! Never before have I been sad to eat all my grilled chicken....it was really that good!

Family friendly place, they gave my 2 year old crayons and coloring sheets which is always appreciated. Didn't order off the kids menu since she wasn't hungry but I do know they offer one. 

I can't wait to go back and try more things here! Super friendly staff and also an awesome military discount of 20%. Just be sure to figure your tip before the discount so they don't stop offering it. :)
