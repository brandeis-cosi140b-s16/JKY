Fresh and Hot food. 

Not to mention how wonderful the cashier was. She brought the food to us the serving size was generous plus a women forgot her purse and the wonderful atentive cashier hustled it out to the owners truck just before they took off. 

I usually go to the one on 19th Ave but after this night am probably coming here.
