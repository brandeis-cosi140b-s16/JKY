This place is fantastic!

It's in a strip mall behind a Coco's on the southeast corner of Thomas and 46th street, I believe. The sign is fairly visible, and I believe there it's only a couple of stores down from the Hungry Howie's pizza place.

The guacamole is great, and they have a salsa I have not ever had before - they're like marinated peppers that are just so light and refreshing. The only minor critique I would have at all about this place is that I'm sure this place could make its own tortilla chips - it seems like the ones they serve with their chips and guacamole/salsa appetizer are some store bought tortilla strips chips.

Anyways, I highly recommend their fish tacos. Definitely the best I have had in Arizona - and probably anywhere else as well. I prefer flour tortillas, but you can get them on corn too. The fish is not fried - which is great - and there's plenty of fish, veggies, cilantro etc. You really have to try it!

For a while they were serving tortilla soup - I would get it every time! I imagine now that summer is coming around and it is getting hot again, that is the reason it is no longer on the menu - but it's so good I don't even care! Bring that soup back - it's so good!

The carne asada is very good too - but I actually like the soup and fish tacos so much more that I rarely get the carne asada. That should tell you something!

I have not strayed beyond those items listed above. Whenever I think about doing so - I just cannot get myself to follow through. Must have those fish tacos and guacamole!!!

It really bums me out that whenever I go to this place, it does not have any customers (or if they do, it's only like one other person/group). It makes me afraid of the possibility that they won't stay open for business - while I would hate to have to wait too long in line to get the food, I would hate it even more if they were to have to close down! 

Check this place out! It's very good and you won't regret it!
