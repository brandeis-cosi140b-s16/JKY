This place was fantastic.  We were skeptical when we noticed that the parking lot was empty (as was the restaurant).  However, we both ordered the fajitas (mine were veggie, and my husband's were shrimp), and they were wonderful!  The chips (thin and crisp) and the salsa (poured from a cute little decanter) were an excellent start to a simply delicious meal.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive.  
I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its service and its food.
