Can never go wrong with a Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. Staff was extremely friendly and the service was excellent. The Mexican pizzas are incredible as are the Doritos Los tacos. Try the Gordita crunch as well as the cheesy fiesta potatoes. Nachos Belgrade is legit as well. Love this location right on on the corner of jones / tropicana. Quick service and even better customer service. 2 thumbs up. Enjoy
