I visited here from out of town with a friend and absolutely loved my experience here. Instantly, you are welcomed by two very friendly restaurant staff members whose attentiveness and care for customer are truly unmatched. The dining area is rather small, but I believe many people carry out so seating is not an issue. The Mexican cuisine is unbelievably good. I had 6 tacos, 3 with chicken and 3 with carnitas (pork). Topped off with some red sauce, cilantro, and onion, these tacos proved to be some of the best I have ever had! I wish I lived in Chandler, AZ so I could visit here more often. I highly recommend for anyone craving low cost authentic Mexican cuisine.
