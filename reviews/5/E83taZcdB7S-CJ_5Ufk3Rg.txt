Probably my absolute favorite place to eat in town!
I've been going here since I was 8-9 years old, I'll be 27 this year. I remember their old location with the fountain, was the best part as a kid! It's nice to go and still see some original staff working there! Their mild sauce is an addiction, I could literally drink it, haha. Their ranch is heavenly, when my mom was still alive, she would always joke and ask for the recipe. My favorite has to be the burritos and enchiladas, and now I've brought my husband and daughter to eat there and love on Chapalas! I hope this place never closes! I would be so sad! Go here, eat here, love it!
