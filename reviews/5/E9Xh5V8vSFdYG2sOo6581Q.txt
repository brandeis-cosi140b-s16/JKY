My husband and I randomly stopped in and we are SOO happy we did. They have only been open 1 year and they have done everything right, the service is amazing, the decor is very cool and rustic, everything was clean and the food was to die for. Nothing is greasy and they give you a lot for your buck. Every taco comes with guacamole and they don't charge extra for it like most places. They make fresh juices everyday...I believe they have strawberry, watermelon, mango, pineapple & spinach. I mixed spinach with pineapple & I will order it every time :D you have to try the Street Corn as well...it melts in your mouth and has the perfect amount of queso & Cheyenne
