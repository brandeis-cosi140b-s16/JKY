I went here today based on a friend's sighting of the "We hate GMO's" billboard. I hate GMO's too so I couldn't wait to try it. Kai was our server. He was personable, attentive and knowledgeable. He made the best guacamole I have ever had. 
Chef Paco came to check on us after our entrees had been tried. I loved the carne asada street tacos, but the highlight was the flan made from the chef's grandmother's recipe. We ordered another after we got our first taste.
This is my new favorite restaurant. I can't wait to go back!
