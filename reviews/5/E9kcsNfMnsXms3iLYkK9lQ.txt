I absolutely love this place.  It beats filibertos hands down.  The prices are great and the food is excellent.  I usually get either the rolled tacos with guac & cheese, or the chili relleno burrito filled with carnitas.  The latter being a particular favorite.  I've also had the deluxe nachos with carne asada, which are also quite delicious.  They have a great salsa bar and a large bin of fresh tortilla chips.  Sometimes the chips are in low supply, but I usually go later at night.  The staff normally consists of a single girl working the counter, but she is very sweet.  I can't recommend this place enough.
