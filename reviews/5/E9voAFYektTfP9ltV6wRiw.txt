One word to describe my experience at San Antonio's, Great. 
Front of house staff called to confirm reservation and made us feel at home upon arrival. 
The menu has an eclectic range of Southwestern dishes.  Two of which I highly recommend and will return for time and again. The Galveston crab claws are phenomenal and this is coming from a Baltimore boy. And, the Jalapeno shrimp. Colossal shrimp stuffed w jalapenos, Jalapeno cheese, and wrapped w bacon. A must try. 
We had top-shelf margaritas served in appropriate glassware that were excellent. 
We walked out with a smile on our faces and some cash left in our pockets. Try it out.
