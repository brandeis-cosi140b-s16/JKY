I'm visiting from San Francisco and wow is there a lot of Mexican food around here!

OMG delicious drunken burrito goodness!  I got the Arizona, recommended by a latina friend.. it has potatoes, I believe carnitas, salsa and sour cream.  Plus awesome hot sauce, which I drizzled all over it.  Really the best late night after-drinking food!
