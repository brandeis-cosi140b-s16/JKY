Manny's Mexican food is some of the best food north of the border, .. 

 With the friendly service and attention to detail makes this a valley gem! 
The decor and authentic music inside are vibrant and inviting. 
Ample parking outside makes it easy to get in and out even when it's very busy.

The food is excellent! My favorite is the Carne Asada Burrito ... but today I'm having the Fajitas ... what a treat! ... but it seems that everything at Manny's is delicious and made with the care and love that Mom would put into her food! My wife had a Chimi and asked for some baha sauce . . which is a very non-standard request for a chimi . . .NO PROBLEM! it was there in seconds, drinks always full! . .  They even found that so hard to do secret of asking how is the meal, while no one had a mouthful of food! My son had the Baha Chicken Enchiladas . .  he just raived about how great it was . .  creamy sauce, moist savory chicken, . .  he can never get enough cheese . .  he remarked  " Wow this is really cheesy . .  I love it!!" 

The waitresses remember what my favorites are, and suggest other specials that quickly become favorites!

In short Manny's is just great and I can't wait to come here again and again!
