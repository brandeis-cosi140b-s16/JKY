I have been frequenting Juan's for about 15 years and have never been disappointed. Their works burrito is the best in town, especially with their homemade green sauce which is creamy and cheesy and gooey and spicy and otherwise indescribable. You can dip your chips in it, put it inside the burrito, outside, or just drink it straight out of a cup (I haven't done this, but given the opportunity...). I've customized my works burrito in a variety of ways. I've had it with shrimp, fish, carnitas, carne asada, pollo asado, chile relleno, machaca, shredded chicken, a combination of several meats at once, with one tortilla instead of two (less carby), and with no tortilla at all (great as a chip dip). I actually drive nearly 20 miles just to eat here. Their salsa is excellent, and their chips always fresh. This is one of those gems that you would never suspect from passing it by on the road. This isn't just another burrito shop, this is the best Mexican food in the valley!
