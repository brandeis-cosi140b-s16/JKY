Simply put, this is possibly my favorite place to eat of all time. Certainly it is in the top 3. Completely unique, spectacularly flavorful food in a family atmosphere with a great staff. My son and I were once regulars here and made some great friends amongst the other regs. Chino Bandido is a great treasure and, since we've moved away from Phoenix back to our home in the Bay Area, it is very sorely missed but we will be back from time to time and it will doubtless be the culinary highlight of the trip.
