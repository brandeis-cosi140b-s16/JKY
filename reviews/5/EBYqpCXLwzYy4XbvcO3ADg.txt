Ok this is my favorite place to eat tacos in Vegas and I'm Mexican American so this is real talk! Atmosphere is casual and fast food like and like most great taco shops it's in an older neighborhood (more hoods than neighbors though). Way worth the drive but the one on Sahara is owned by the same family. The owner was nice enough to comp my cousin and I a shrimp cocktail aka Mariscos, so we could experience the love. No complaints, I could have got caught up in a driveby and it still would have been worth the tacos and mariscos.
