Remarkably excellent food and very good service. The inside is way too loud and noisy but I enjoy sitting outside and getting to watch the kitchen.

My kale salad was great, tangy, fresh and delicious. The carnitas tacos were perfectly prepared. I finished with the tapioca/mango/passion fruit sorbet that was wonderful.

Our hostess, Caroline, was smiling, good humored and kept this busy restaurant running smoothly.

Gourmet food. Fun decor. Creative menu. A winner!
