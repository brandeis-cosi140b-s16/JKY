Had lunch there today. We have eaten here in the past, but today was exceptional. Everything was delicious and amazing. I had the enchiladas verde... So fresh and the best verde sauce. The sope with chorizo was the highlight though. The corn cake tortilla was crisp on the outside but moist and delicious on the inside with the spicy chorizo on top. Soooo tasty. The food seems as if it has improved from prior visits. I was very impressed. 

I also feel I have to add this... I am not the owner of this restaurant or any restaurants.. Yes, recently some dumb ass yelper messaged me and accused me of owning one of the restaurants I reviewed. Their message was harassing and intimidating.. So I am not in the restaurant business so please don't message me! Thank you! Oh and I contacted Yelp and they did nothing about it!
