I have lots of good things to say about this place.
Great location, very clean, delicious food. All quite healthy as well.
My daughter discovered this on her way home from work many years  ago now.
It has stayed true to itself all this time.

Fresh food, they say all their meat is hormone and chemical free.
It is really filling. If you have it for lunch , you may not even need dinner.
Clean bathrooms and lots of parking, though at a busy time of day you may have to walk a little as there are a lot of people there.
Plus other businesses there as well in the shopping center.
