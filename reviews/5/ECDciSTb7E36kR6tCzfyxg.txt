My Grandma took my mom here as a kid. I am the third generation of my family to eat here and my daughters are the fourth. My parents have known the owner, Butch, for years.. my dad used to drink beers with him. The food is AMAZING here. When I was pregnant I made my mom go pick up their salsa for me and take it to me in the hospital... it's THAT edible. I KNOW Mexican food and this is the best of the best. Amazing enchiladas! We leave Prescott just to go eat at La Perla.. my mother is like a homing pigeon to the place. See you soon, La Perla!
