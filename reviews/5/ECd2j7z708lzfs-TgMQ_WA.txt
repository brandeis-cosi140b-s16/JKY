I know people are a little skeptical because this restaurant is by a strip club, but don't worry it's just next to it! Not like you are going to a strip club to eat! First off the d√©cor of this place was so well done, it's beautiful! 

When we came in we were immediately welcomed by the friendly staff and sat at a lovely table. It was our first time and our server had some excellent suggestions, her name I think was Erica? She was very fun,  friendly, and sweet - her service was impeccable, if you go definitely request her. 

The menu is just sensational. I mean its pretty cool that you can get organic, farm to table food 24/7 right next to a strip club!!!!! 
I honestly couldn't even pick a favorite item but I'll list a few that I just loved that my group and I ordered. 
First off the tableside guac is so fresh it made me feel like I was in Mexico on the beach so definitely get that. And being a tequila lover I was ecstatic to see their tequila selection was amazing, my girlfriend got a jalapeno margarita that was just unreal!!!
We also loved the carnitas rajas burrito, the empanadas and of course the street tacos, GET THE TACOS!!! 

I also noticed that one of the managers, his name was Sean was touching every table and spent quite a bit talking to ours. He was just such a gem and really topped off our whole experience, when he learned we were locals he sent out some of the addictive flan they have. Just a really nice guy, and he does an exceptional job managing his staff because the staff at El Dorado Cantina gets 5 million stars from me and I've worked in restaurants for years so I know what good service is. 

All in all, I can't wait to come back! I'm already craving the food and I can't wait to see the friendly, fun staff again!!
