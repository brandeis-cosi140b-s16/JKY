Hussong's Cantina has just opened their new location in Boca Park and they prove again they're masters at the best Mexican food and drink!   After years of steering clear of margaritas due to the sweet and syrupy taste, I reclaimed being a fan....but only of the "Original Margarita" at Hussong's!  I actually can't wait to have another one!   As far as the food, since I am a bit of a health nut, I am very particular about restaurant food and was thrilled to see great options in veggie entrees, gluten free items and the best part is that it is all freshly made!  
I will be going there again very soon!!
