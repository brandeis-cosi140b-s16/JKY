We've passed Alfonso's many times and after seeing the many positive reviews decided to give it a try and are we glad we did!!!

My boyfriend ordered the Alfonso Burrito, but he customized it by adding shrimp and enchilada sauce- I couldn't believe how humongous this burrito was- had to fit into 2 containers!!! What matters, though, is that he loved it- made fresh, carne asada was excellent. And he's got the other half of the burrito for lunch tomorrow. 

I ordered the carne asada quesadilla- again, huge, couldn't eat it all and it was yummy. 

We will definitely be back!!!
