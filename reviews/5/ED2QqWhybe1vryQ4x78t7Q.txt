Wow. This placed just opened and I will definitely be back. 
The waiters were so friendly and eager to please. 
The decor was beautifully done and fresh feeling with a traditional Mexican vibe. 

Now... Let's talk food. Absolutely classic and authentic Mexican food. It was fresh and high quality. And...delicious. The tamales were the best I've ever tasted. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. My husband had the chile relleno and loved it. They have a great bar too!! The margarita was the perfect addition to my dinner. 

Keep it up, La Pi√±ata!! Can't wait for my next visit!
