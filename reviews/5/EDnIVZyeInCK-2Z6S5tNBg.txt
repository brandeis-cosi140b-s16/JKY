Really how does this place only have 3 stars ? If you are looking for a really CLEAN restaurant this is the place . The food is great the beans are as good as my home cooked ones. Priced so reasonable ! Give it a try u won't be disappointed ... Our only problem is now that we found this place we don't want to go anywhere else & find our selfs eating there 3 times a week !! Finally a good Mexican restaurant in Arizona !!
