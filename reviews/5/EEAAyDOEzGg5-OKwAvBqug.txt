This place has amazing food.  It's not for everyone, though.  Some of my friends want the typical "mexican food" experience and this is just a simple place that does a few things very well.

Tacos.  Amazing.  Bean burros.  Amazing.  Guac.  Amazing.  

A great place to pick up dinner from a long day at work.
