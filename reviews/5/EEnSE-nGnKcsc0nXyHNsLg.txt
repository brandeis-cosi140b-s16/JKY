Hands down best Mexican food in town. The colorful atmosphere and clean environment makes for a wonderful dining experience with amazing Mexican food. The street tacos are a personal favorite, try it with shredded beef. They make the best micheladas that you can't find anywhere, just like in Cabo and actually on the menu. My older brother introduced us and it's been a love affair since. On our way now to try the other location on Thunderbird.
