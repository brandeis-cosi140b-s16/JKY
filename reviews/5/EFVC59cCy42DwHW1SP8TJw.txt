We ate at the main restaurant last night (first time since the fire).  The venue is beautiful.  We love to eat on the patio this time of year.  The  giant tree shades the seating area from the late sun plus the parking lot/road is nowhere to be seen or heard.  As the sun goes down, the decorative lighting comes on and this is a fun place to relax.  
The chips and salsa are delicious.  Our server brought us a red and green salsa with an endless supply of hot white corn tortilla chips.  These were freshly cooked and not just from a bag.  I always eat too many before my meal!  The difference tonight is that my wife loved the salsa and chips.  We both gave the salsas a huge thumbs up.
We ordered the Enchiladas Monterey and a beef taco.  Both were fantastic.  My kids ordered Chicken Fingers from the kids menu and to my surprise, they were fresh chicken, not the frozen breaded chicken at all the other places.  That made me happy, and my kids loved them.  
Our server was very attentive and accomodating.  We could tell that with the new ownership, they are figuring things out.  While we were waiting for our food, she brought us an appetizer because she felt we were waiting too long (we didn't ask).  I was just relaxing on the patio watching the night sky change.  I was happy to be patient and enjoy the time with my wife and children.
This is a great new restaurant.  Embrace the change and enjoy the experience.  We'll be back.
