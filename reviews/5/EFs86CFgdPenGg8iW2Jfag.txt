Moe's is way better than Chipotle or Qdoba.  Moe's offers free chips & salsa with their burritos.  You have to pay extra for this at other places.  They have 5 salsa's available including a tomatillo salsa which I have never seen at any other place.  Their burritos are the same size as any other giant burrito place and the price is comparable.  They also have daily specials.  My favorite. Moe Monday - - Any burrito, chips and a regular drink for $5.55.  Can you get that a Chipotle or Qdoba?  No, I don't think so.  Save money, eat at Moe's.
