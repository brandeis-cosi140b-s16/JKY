One of my favorite go to spots for Mexican - yes it's a chain - no it's not completely authentic - but it is YUMMY!   We went to OTB today for a Mother's Day meal with my "2nd" mom....and we sat on the patio because the weather was beautiful!

We had peach margaritas and strawberry/mango sangria and both were very good!  The OTB chips and salsa are always bottomless and delish and this time was no different!  

We chose Chorizo and Baha Fajitas and an Enchilada entree at our table of three and each went home with about as much as we ate.  We enjoyed the Turtle Empanadas for dessert and they were a perfect ooey gooey combination that was a great ending to a wonderful meal.

Our waiter was great, our glasses never empty (or even close) the food was once again consistently good and a bill of $55 for drinks, entrees and dessert was a great deal!  Great choice for a meal with friends!
