Ohhh wow. Delicious.

My husband and I love Gallo Blanco, so we had to try Otro Cafe. The location is interesting; the restaurant is open and spacey, which I think I prefer to Gallo, and the seating is more comfortable. I really like that the kitchen is open and you can watch the chefs cook your food. I also think the staff is a little friendlier than at Gallo.

You're served the same two sauces as at Gallo, but you get chips. I also had a one person serving of guacamole, which was so good. Definitely some of the best guacamole I've had. I love that you can order a smaller portion, as my husband doesn't care for guacamole and if it's just the two of us eating Mexican, we don't get guacamole as an appetizer because it ends up being too big a portion. This ended up being perfect.

I had a veggie taco (kale, cauliflower, and squash) and a shrimp taco. My husband had the naco torta. The veggie taco was fantastic - I loved the mix of vegetables and the sauce they used. The shrimp was also excellent, with a really great slaw on top. The naco torta was huge and delicious - perfectly cooked over medium eggs and tender beef. It was rich and delicious.

We didn't intend on getting dessert but we decided to try the coconut pudding. I thought the consistency was a little thin, but it was creamy, smooth, and not too sweet. It was topped with some shaved chocolate which simply added to the richness. A great ending to a great meal.

Loved it! Can't wait to go back and try the other menu items.
