We told the manager what happen last night and what's funny is we said we were never comin there again but I guess he didn't wanna lose any customers so he offerd to take care of everything to night so we came back there the food was great and the service was great and the manager was nice he took car of everything I guess if your in for some good Mexican food I'd come and eat hear everything was great
