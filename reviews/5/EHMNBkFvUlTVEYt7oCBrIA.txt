Located within a Fabulous Freddy's, you'd be surprised at how busy this place gets. I come here at least once a week and its because out of all the Roberto's I have gone to in Vegas, this is by far the best one when it comes to service and quality of food. They are ALWAYS busy, but with this being literally the only location in Centennial Hills, its kind of expected. But the carnitas tacos! The carne asada nachos! The breakfast burrito! This place has restored my faith in Roberto's! Its located within a GAS STATION, so I don't understand what some of these other reviewers are expecting. If you want a 5 star, exquisite dining experience, please try somewhere else. If you want quick, greasy but delicious 'Mexican' food, eat here.
