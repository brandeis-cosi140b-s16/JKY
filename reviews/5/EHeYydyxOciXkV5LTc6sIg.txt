The bf and I decided to try Las Cazuelas upon the suggestion of another merchant in the same shopping center and were we glad we did!!  The restaurant is small, but I was impressed by how clean and attractive it is.  We arrived just after 10am on a Monday morning and only one other patron was there.  We ordered the huevos rancheros and sat down.  The gentleman taking our order at the register did not exactly exude lots of warmth but he was polite and we quickly had a bowl of chips and some of the tastiest salsa I've had in a long time.  The chips were salty without being too salty.  Most places I have to add salt to the chips but these were fresh, crunchy and with that wonderful salsa really hit the spot.  Our food came quickly and I was again impressed that when we ordered the eggs medium, that's how they were cooked.  No runny white, but the yolk still soft, just perfect for me!!!  The plates they use are very different and set off the food for a nice presentation.  The refried beans were very good and the corn tortillas that came with our meal were so hot I could hardly hold one in my hand!!  Lots of other places half warm the tortillas and they end up being hard and rubbery but these were not.  I finished off my whole plate and the bf did also.  At $5.50 for this meal, it is the bargain of the week!!!!    We want to try the enchiladas de mole poblano so badly, I know we will be back again there very, very soon!!  I am intrigued by some of the other offerings, some I have never heard of.  This is definitely a must try if you are looking for good, very reasonably priced food!!
