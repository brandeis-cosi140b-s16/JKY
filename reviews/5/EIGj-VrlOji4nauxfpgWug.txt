Me and my friends go often because the restaurant is a 'no hassle' spot.  The food is consistently good and the wait staff is always super friendly.  No matter if we go as a couple or a party of 20+, we have never had to wait.  Being a native Carolinian, I'm not the best judge of authentic Mexican cuisine, but this food is full of flavor without being overpoweringly spicy.  I'm glad that the lacking decor turns people away so I always have a seat!
