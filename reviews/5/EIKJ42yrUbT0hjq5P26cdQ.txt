I cannot go to Vegas without a trip (or two or three) to Canonita! I live in San Diego where we have awesome Mexican food, but this place is the whole package- great food, amazing drinks, awesome service and cool atmosphere. We usually just sit at the bar, and Alex (one of the bartenders) is so good at what he does! He's super friendly and even remembers us after months of not going. You must try the pineapple margarita, sangria and the chicken flautas. It's also cool that it's right by the canals, and great for people watching :) I can't wait to go back!
