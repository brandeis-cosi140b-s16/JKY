Man I love this place! What a great idea, Korean style food meets Mexican taco made by a white guy and you can get an Italian soda! It has everything you need. I order the Nate dog every time I go. The owner likes to call me Vinny from Jersey Shore, even tho I dress way better then that guy. 
Everything on the menu is really good so good so order a taco and some sweet dough, you will be glad you did.
Customer service is great, the location is nice.  They always seem to have an event going on Sunday and the liquor store right next to him always has a cook off on Saturdays. This is a great weekend lunch spot.
