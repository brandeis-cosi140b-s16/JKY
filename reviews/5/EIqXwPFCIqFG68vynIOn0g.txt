If you want Sonoran style comfort food, you can find it at Someburros.  I've been going to Someburros since the original location opened in Tempe, and in fact worked there while I was in college.  Over the years, I've been to all the east valley locations and still go once or twice a month with my family.  It's been pretty much consistent, except for prices (which is expected - everything costs more everywhere every year!).  I have found people either love it or hate it.  Those who love it, usually love it forever.
