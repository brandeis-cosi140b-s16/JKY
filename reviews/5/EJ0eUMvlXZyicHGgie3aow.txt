Del Taco is the best Mexican chain fast food ever. Go on Tuesday for taco tuesdays. It's 3 regular (beef) tacos (hard or soft) for $1. Otherwise the tacos are $.49 each. Thursday are 3 chicken soft tacos for $2. Yes, it's totally worth it. Get the Del Inferno sauce if they have it. I get 90000 packets and use it when I cook (when that happens 4 times a year). The chili cheese fries are bomb too. But don't order any of the burgers here; it's a trap!
