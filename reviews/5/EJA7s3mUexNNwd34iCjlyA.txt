This eatery is located on the outer area of the Las Vegas main strip.


This eatery is located within a shopping center which is fairly large so parking should not be a problem.


Our group came into the eatery about fifteen minutes before they were closing, but still staff stated they'd stay open later for our group of about twelve people. 


Their ordering process is cafeteria style where you stand in line based on the type of meat you want for your tacos. 


Once you know the meat you want, the staffer in that area of your meat or meats will cut up your meat and make your tacos. 


After your tacos are made, you go into another area to meet with the cashier to pay.


The eatery offers tacos of carne Asada, Adobada, el pastor, chicken, cabeza and much more. Tacos come with onions, tomato, cilantro and guacamole.


The presentation of the tacos looked great, the smell was good too according to another groupie. 


The eatery also offers a wide selection of salsa's to serve onto your tacos with limes and onions or tomatoes on the side salsa bar if desired. 


The meat was tender in each bite, flavorful al pastor, chicken and carne Asada. I highly recommend their tacos and a visit for tasty, tender meat and good customer service.
Their salsa selection is also flavorful especially the Orange one.


Tacos are priced at $2.25 each. Note that they also make mullitas, burritos and carne Asada fries or nachos for your pleasure.
