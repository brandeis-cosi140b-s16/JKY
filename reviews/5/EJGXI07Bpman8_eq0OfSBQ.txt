While visiting Arizona we were told we must try Macayo's. The margaritas (fruit flavored and blended) were a bit on the sweet side- to the extent that I was worried I might get a tooth ache. The prices here are very reasonable. I had the fajita quesadilla, delicious- I cant stop thinking about it. The service was friendly and somewhat efficient. This isn't a place you go for decor and ambiance- but they do have outside seating, always a plus in my book.
