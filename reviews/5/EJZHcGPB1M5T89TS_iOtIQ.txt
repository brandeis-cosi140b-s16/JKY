Love, love, LOVE this place!!! The food is delicious and it's really close to my house. The great thing is eating here before or after your movie. It's one of the better choices in Aliante, if you don't mind eating in the food court. You can also get pretty healthy fare here. Might I suggest the grilled Mahi Mahi burrito?? Cause it's mighty tasty! Especially with the tomatillo salsa and a little lime. I tried the mahi mahi fish tacos as well, but I much prefer the burrito. I think it has more flavor and the portion is HUGE! One burrito will definitely fill you up. If not, it comes with chips too.
