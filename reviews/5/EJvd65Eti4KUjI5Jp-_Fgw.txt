Outstanding.

A magnificent tequila selection with a staff that knows them. Straight tequilas get a tomato water/pomegranate back. Clean and palate cleansing; never had nor considered this. Ask for Kato.

Food is earthy, Pan-Japanese, Latin-American street fusion. A street-facing bar beckons Blade Runner flashbacks in this city of steel and concrete facades. Interior is steel, earth-tones and LED light. Staff is smart, attractive, and engaging. My first great meal in this city. I'll return weekly.
