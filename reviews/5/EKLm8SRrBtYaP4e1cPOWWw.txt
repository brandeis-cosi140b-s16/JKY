I have never had a bad experience here. I have been coming since before they had remodeled. The food is great. Never been sick but the service. Wow! Juanita is so amazing. Always happy, so sweet. I love her and she makes sitting in the drive thru completely worth it. This woman needs a raise. STAT! No I don't know her, but I am so impressed every time I go in that I had to write her a great yelp review! You are the best Juanita!
