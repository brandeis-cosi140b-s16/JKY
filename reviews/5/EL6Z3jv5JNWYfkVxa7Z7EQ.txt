A group of 4 of us were in Vegas for a birthday, and came across this place. Amazing tacos! There is such a variety of taco fillings and meat. The guacamole and chips are also a must-have. They have a really good chips to guacamole ratio, and even offered us more chips after. Great food, customer service, and ambiance. Can't wait to come back to Vegas so we can eat here again.
