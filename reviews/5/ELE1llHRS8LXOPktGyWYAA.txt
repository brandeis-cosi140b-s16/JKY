I guess that before this place opened it was another taco place that wasn't that good. NOT THE SAME PLACE.

I stumbled upon this place  at the end of a run through Madison, and went inside to check it out.  It was a great find, and easily the best burrito I have ever had (braised beef burrito- wet). 

Everything is made in house and is farm to table. They process their own meat and grow their own vegetables. I came back with my wife, and she loved the veggie chimichanga. Fresh kale, pickled radish, it's really an amazing meal. Make sure to get house made chips and guacamole, queso or salsa. 

I highly recommend this place, bring your appetite and don't miss out!
