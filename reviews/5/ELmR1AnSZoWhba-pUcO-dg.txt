LOVE this place. Outstanding service and management. First off, the margaritas. Oh, the margaritas. Nothing better than a frozen Chambord margarita on a warm day. Or a cold day. Any day! Their food is so consistent, and the salsa & guac are divine. I love the seared peppered ahi appetizer, with its blackberry wasabi sauce. The wild mushroom enchiladas are so delicious; there's something about their tortillas that makes them awesome. The corn they make them from must be extra sweet. I have also enjoyed a steak here and it was delectable. So juicy, tender, and the gorgonzola sauce was just perfect. 
Now for service: even though this is one of several Z'Tejas's, the service I've experienced is that of a smaller neighborhood place. I almost always sit at the bar, so this is a shout out to them specifically. Marty--awesome. He's been there for almost two decades I think and he is as friendly and upbeat as though it were his first day. Yet you can tell he's a veteran since his style is a perfect combination of attentive and unobtrusive. He'll gladly chat with you but won't interrupt if he can tell you're not in that mood. Rebecca and Julie--two beautiful sisters who both work behind the bar, both very personable and attentive. And Carla--pretty blonde with a wonderful smile, is delightful as well. Michael, the GM is always present, speaking with guests and he pays attention... I know this bc he remembers me and even who I came in with last time. Excellent neighborhood spot!
