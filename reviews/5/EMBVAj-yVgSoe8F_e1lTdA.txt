The food was super authentic Mexican quisine. The salsa was the perfect way to start the meal. The drink menu was appropriate  to compliment the food that was served. 

The food was delicious and served in a very timely fashion.

Lastly, we could take salsa and homemade tortilla chips to go.

Great experience!!!!!
