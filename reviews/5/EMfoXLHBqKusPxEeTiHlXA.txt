What is all the complaining about? There AREN'T affordable places in vegas strip that offer high culinary level food. Don't people know that almost all mexican restaurants aren't authentic in taste? Why the high expectations? This place is meant for the cheapest beer pitcher, tacos, tequilla shots, nachos and quesidilla on the strip! Love this place. Thanks tequilla bar and grill for being pretty yummy and AFFORDABLE!
