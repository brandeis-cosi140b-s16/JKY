Went to Rosita's yesterday for lunch while waiting on car repairs. In and out in an hour no problems. The best Machaca ive ever had! Our chips were steaming hot when they were delivered to out table. Guacamole, salsa were all bomb.com. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great flavor, fast service
