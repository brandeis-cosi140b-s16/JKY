I can't believe Moe's only had three stars? What's up with that? I've been to this location twice and never had an issue.

Moe's, by far, is my favorite chain Mexican restaurant. The value is great and you get so much food for the money. I get the "Homewrecker," which is a delicious and huge burrito, filled with everything you want and your choice of meat and beans. With that includes chips and your choice of salsa at the salsa bar (I like being able to get the salsas myself!). The big burrito, chips, salsa and a drink all for under $9! I also love the fact that you can fit all the crap you want in the burrito and somehow it all stays together and doesn't fall apart. As much as I love Chipotle, the free chips gives this place an edge when it comes to deciding where to go for quick Mexican. The staff is also very friendly as well.
