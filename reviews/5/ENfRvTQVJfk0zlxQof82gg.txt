okay, okay, i admit it!  you got me!  i've been in az for a decade and have NEVER had a torta.  *hangs head in shame*

UNTIL THIS PLACE!

srsly, the asada torta is my new crack.  i am hooked on that shit like a fat kid on cupcakes.  big, gooey, chocolately, covered in sprinkles cupcakes.

you don't need the limes.  you don't need the uber-spicy green shit.  you just need The Torta.  it's soft, moist, got a lil kick and is PACKED with flavor.  honestly, you have to eat it to understand.

i got it two days in a row...that's how good it is.

yeah, now, after writing this, i think it's what i want for dinner.  fuck you, homemade chicken salad.  mama wants torta for dinner.
