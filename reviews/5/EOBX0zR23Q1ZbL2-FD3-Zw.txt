Decided to try this place out last night after continuing to hear about it. One word describes it for me "Excellent". The food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the burger, fries, short rib taco, and the chicken taco and one of those delicious shakes. Can't complain about any of those items. The tacos really put it over the top for me. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and everybody is super nice. The decor is a mix between modern and old school burger joint. Absolutely great place! This will definitely be a spot we visit frequently.
