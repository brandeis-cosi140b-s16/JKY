The VAMPIROS are to die for! I went there last weekend with my friends and they introduced me to arguably one of the best mexican places I've ever had the pleasure of eating at. The only question is, what's better Taco's el gordo or Roberto's? They are both awesome and if you like mexican food you should go to both!
