Beyond the glitter and flash of the Las Vegas strip is a humble little taco joint tucked in an unassuming shopping center somewhere between Wynn, Encore and Ross.

In terms of ambiance this place is definitely lacking -- there are no pinatas, mariachi bands, or oversized margarita glasses in sight.  But as soon as you step up to the order counter you will be treated to a feast for the eyes.  A giant slab of sizzling pork on a rotating skewer with a giant pineapple on top, it's juices slowly basting the meat to delicious perfection.

Excuse me, I just drooled on my keyboard.  

Back to my description -- after I placed an order for spicy pork tacos my order taker carefully sliced a few slabs of pork onto warm handmade corn tortillas topped off with fresh pico de gallo, crema fresca and a thin slice of grilled pineapple.

It was truly the best taco I ever tasted and for only $2 I had lots of extra money to drop at the slot machines!
