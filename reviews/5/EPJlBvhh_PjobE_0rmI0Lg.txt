So . I live close by Braddah's and had be waiting for it to open. The day it opened I went I had a wonderful experience, friendly service good portions,good food! I couldn't be happier with my first experience. I went again, it was good. Hoping to make this a regular spot for me  the next time I had a bad experience. I had friendly service but was over charged and the portion size decreased and I felt like i got ripped off. No meat no veggies, I wasnt going to go back. My roommate wanted to go , I said  I'd go in. They asked me if i I wanted anything after she started to order. I said no , She said ok may i ask why ? I told her the experience i had and Tia was her name , she insisted on buying me lunch to right the wrong that had happened. Then to top off her excellent service the manager Chris came over apologized and added in the most amazing dessert  "coconut bark" . MMMMMMM. I dont write reviews often but, they blew me away with how quick they were willing to right the wrong. With a smile to top that off.

Thank you I will be back!!!!
