Our family stopped by the new location this last Sunday evening and had the best time chatting with the staff and the owner, Dave even stopped by to give us a personal hello. The dinner was delicious-I am a bit of a snacker so I had the taco topped with sliced avocado and my husband had a HUGE portion of fajitas and the cookie ice cream dessert was devoured by our 6 year old in about 2 seconds flat...over all fantastic food and service. Thank you for your hospitality!! We are looking forward to our next visit.
