We absolutely love these tamales! You cant go wrong with any of them. For over a year we searched for whose tamales we tried at a farmers market. Then a friend told me that is had to be the tamale stores because that is who she gets hers threw and were the same cream cheese tamales we were talking about. Thank Heavens for her!!! We have a stock pile in our freezers! They are always so fresh, the taste is unlike any others, and i never was a tamale person until now!!! Every chance we get we find out what market they are at and restock our freezer. We eat them atleast once a week :) AMAZING!!!! You must try them!
