This is my little gem in the city... I can call them at midnight and still order chillaquilles! 
I have tried the different dinner specials they have and I constantly tell myself, "Oh they need to put this on the menu..."
Oh and I can taste hints of chocolate in the mole sauce. 
I'm getting hungry just writing this review and I think I know where I'm going to grab some dinner!
But seriously.. check this place out. Great menu and flavors!
