i've been making my way through the cheaper mexican restaurants around town for years and was just introduced to this place- I hope I'll never have to go anywhere else.  The tiny, rustic atmosphere makes you feel like you just left madison and wandered into mexico accidentally and the enormous delicious portions are so cheap- exactly the kind of unique experience that makes this place stand out.
