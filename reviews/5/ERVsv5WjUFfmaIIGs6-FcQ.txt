I just LOVE this place!  Extra everything, and no extra price.  My roomie gets Chips, and Guacamole for $3.00...$4.95 at Chipotle.  Double guacamole on the burrito bowl, no charge!  $4.30 MORE at Chipotle.  Better service, better prices, same food.  I eat here twice a week, and without fail, get a great experience every time.  Love the cool coke machine with all the different soda's, and flavored waters too!
