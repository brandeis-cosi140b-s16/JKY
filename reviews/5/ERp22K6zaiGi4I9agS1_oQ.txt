This is my 2nd visit and 1st review.
The girls and I enjoy an authentic Mexican meal! The girls split the Wednesday dinner special - enchiladas with beans and rice. I ate a side of guacamole with my refried beans! Absolutely delicious! Everything was fresh and make to order! The service was quick and the staff is very friendly! This is a definite repeat, kid friendly dinner spot! I love Mexican food and I love this place!
