I can't begin to tell you what a great time we had at Lindo Michoacan. The best wait staff you would ever want to serve you and Victor the manager was the greatest, he became our new best friend. The food was as great as the employees I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
