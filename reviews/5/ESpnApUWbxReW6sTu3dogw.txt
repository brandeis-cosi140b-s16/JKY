Since we've relocated to the area that homes a few taco trucks, and taco stops...we've planned a night to test them. We drive by and always see a good amount of patrons...so we did it last night, and this will be our taco truck to enjoy fresh homemade tortillas and tacos. My husband got a lengua taco and we got a couple Carne Asada ones. Everything was fresh and wonderful. Next time we may try a torta. Get it to go and its nicely packaged with salsas (or chili) & other toppings. Only sad part is that they should have a folding picnic table so we can enjoy there on the spot, otherwise you're making a.mess in the car. Maybe next time we take our truck and eat on the tailgate. Either way....we will be back.
