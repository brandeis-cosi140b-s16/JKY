I ate at the Gerardo's near Wal Mart by Rainbow and Twain. And wow! I am from Stockton California and we have Taco Trucks everywhere and many Mexican Restaurants and I found it hard to find authentic mexican food here in Vegas! I was hungry for a burrito and thought that it was Roberto's(because I heard they were good), and I seen that it wasn't but didn't want to drive so I figured might as well give it a try. Walked in, place was empty but it was 10 at night. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito with sour cream and cheese, no onions, with salsa verde. What I got was on of the best Carne Asada burritos I have ever eaten! Not only was the burrito good but they grilled me a jalapeno and caramelized onions on the side! Wow wow wow! This was my highlight of Vegas so far!
