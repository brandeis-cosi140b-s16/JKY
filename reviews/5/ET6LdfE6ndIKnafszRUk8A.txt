Amazing food! I came 2 nights in a row while in Gilbert. I would give it more than 5 stars if i could! All food is made fresh on premises, you can tell!  Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, but most amazing food! The sweet mexican corn was my favorite.  You can also tell tortillas are homemade =)
