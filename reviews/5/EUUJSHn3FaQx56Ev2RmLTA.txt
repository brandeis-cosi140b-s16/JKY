Homemade Mexican food at its best! Found this little place on Yelp and decided to try it on our way back to LA and we were very happy with our meal. They serve you homemade chips, retried beans, and both green and red salsa while you wait for your meal to be freshly prepared. Had the chorizo and eggs breakfast which was very tasty and lots of it. We also had the chilaquiles in salsa verde with steak and fried eggs, delicious! Salsas are home made and very tasty. Green salsa has a slight tang from the tomatillos and the red a delicious smoky flavor from the roasted chilies. Can't wait to go back!
