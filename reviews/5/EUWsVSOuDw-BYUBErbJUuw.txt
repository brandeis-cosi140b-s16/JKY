Great atmosphere and friendly staff! I always love grabbing some delicious Mexican food here. It was my go-to in college and that hasn't changed. I recommend the poblano hash browns and chorizo burrito off the breakfast menu...and anything for lunch and dinner! Oh, and the margs are the best in Tempe.
