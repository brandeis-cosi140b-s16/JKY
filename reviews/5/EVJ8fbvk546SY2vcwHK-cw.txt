Good Mexican fast food. They have well seasoned tender meats that make the meal. Good large portioned burritos, freshly made corn chips and salsa, awesome fresh fruit drinks and a delicious chia seed and cucumber water. I was surprised to see street corn, not too impressed, but I still ate it since it's rare to see street corn in a restaurant or in Vegas for that matter. Its no Los Angeles street corn, but it was nostalgic for sure. Friendly staff, clean dining area, clean restroom, fair prices. I will be back for some al pastor tacos and agua fresca de sandia.
