I'm not sure who was working there today making the Gourmet Grilled Ship Tacos that my wife and I had but there were AWESOME!  I love these tacos and haven't ordered anything on the menu since having these.  The bacon on them is awesome and the mix of other stuff on them makes them something I will come back for over and over again.  Great, thanks for the best lunch!!!
