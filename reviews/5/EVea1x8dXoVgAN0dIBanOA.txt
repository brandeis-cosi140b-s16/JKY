For the value and the taste, this place can't be beat! My burrito was HUGE and delicious. It cost $6 with everything in it, and lasted me for lunch AND dinner. Also, their green and red salsas are homemade and especially tasty. I want to go back right now! Please note they have new picnic table seating, and the Hawaiian Ice place is right next door for dessert.
