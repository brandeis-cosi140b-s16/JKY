Alright. I don't eat taco bell, and wouldn't still even if I weren't allergic to dairy. That being said, my boyfriend and I just left this place and had to see if anyone else mentioned the gung-ho middle aged guy working there named Matt. He was the most intense guy ever to work in fast food. Basically a commercial come to life. I wasn't sure what to think or whether he was trolling, but it was the most interesting experience at a taco bell I've had. Totally a nice guy.
