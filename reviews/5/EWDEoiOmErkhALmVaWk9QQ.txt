YUM.

When I think about the Mission, a smile spreads across my face.  The place is great from top-to-bottom.

Stunning menu with high-end meals, to upscale street food.  The Corn on a stick is spicy, sweet and absolutely amazing.

Great for groups, wonderful patio, amazing brunch.  I have never had a bad experience here.  Waitstaff is extremely friendly and attentive.

Portion size is also very good and the drinks are a great topper with their extensive tequila list.

Overall great date spot, team event of just a lazy Saturday lunch.
