Just ordered the three item Mexican fiesta platter which we chose a Chicken Tamale, Taco, and a Cheese Chili Relleno. With a side of Guacamole. We had it delivered and it was hot and really good. My Wife and I each ordered one of these and would definitely order again. The delivery time was about 40 minutes which is exactly in the 40 to 50 minute delivery time. Now we have a go to Mexican food delivery place.
