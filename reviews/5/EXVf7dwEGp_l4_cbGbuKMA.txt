Mejico is not your typical Mexican spot, it's amazing! Week after week and not one meal lets me down. Very high quality ingredients and always so tasty. I'm so spoiled by Mejico that I will not go to another Mexican restaurant. The staff is fantastic, friendly and pay attention to detail. I would rate it 10 stars if I could.
