I'm so sad to see the stars this place has.... It was my first time here the food was DELICIOUS!!!!! we went around 10am so it was pretty lonely and quiet... No music or anything kind of weird, too early maybe, haha like 30 minutes later they began playing music and made things less awkward. The food did take a little while to get to the table but once it  arrived it made up for anything else that could have gone wrong.....we were a party of 7 and we each got different plates and picked at each others food everything was too Good! The agua de horchata was on POINT! THIS WILL DEFINITELY BECOME MY FIRST STOP next time
