This place has legit street tacos. It's very similar to the stand in front of Reyna's. It is a small stand in front of a Mexican grocery. They have 6 different meats to choose from. We had the pulled pork, the chorizo, and the Carne Asada. All were excellent. They have a toppings bar with the usual street taco fare- fresh onions, cilantro, and 6 different salsas and pico. One of the salsa's had pomplano and was very tasty. If in Oakland on weekends, do yourself a favor and hit this stand.  Only open on weekends. FYI- They don't have any seating. Most of the clientele are locals like me who walk home to eat. But there are always a few apartments on Atwood for rent with steps out front that you can sit real quick and eat on the steps. No one bothers you. It's a laid- back, college vibe in this area. Cash only. Prices: $2.50/ taco but when you see the size of them you will understand. 
Parking tip: if Atwood has no parking, try one street over (Meyran) or York St.
