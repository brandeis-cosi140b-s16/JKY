We have been to Dicks twice.  Both times we have been amazed.  The slightly wood smoked smell and taste was intoxicating.  We couldn't decide between the breakfast burrito or the Chili Relleno.  Both are excellent.  We get red and green sauce, or "Christmas" because both sauces are wonderful.  We will be back.
