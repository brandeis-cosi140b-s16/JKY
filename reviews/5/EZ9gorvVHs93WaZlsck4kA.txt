Great little Mexican restaurant with an authentic taste in the food.   Kids soup is a traditional Mexican soup that every kid likes and the adult meals where really good too. We had enchiladas with a pork chop on the side and a huarache.  The pork chop was perfectly cooked and had a great taste. Everything else was also good. Spicy enough to to enjoy comfortably.
