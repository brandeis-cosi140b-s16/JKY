We went yesterday for the second time. Great again! I am not sure why this place isn't more crowded, the owner is always friendly, the female server (I have to ask her name!) is great and the food is exceptional.
I hear the shrimp is good, but I always get the carne asada burrito. It's big, full of flavor, and hard to beat. My friend got the Carne asada enchiladas. I had a taste and YUMMY! I might get them next time. I'd like to see  carnitas on their menu, but it's ok that they aren't as that would just be another temptation.
I would say you should go and try it. you WILL return.
