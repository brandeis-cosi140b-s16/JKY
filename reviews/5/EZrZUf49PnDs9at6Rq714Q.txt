On a mission to try new restaurants closer to home, we found Dos Caminos which had recently opened in our neighborhood.  We chose to eat inside but next time will definitely relax on that gorgeous looking patio.  The guacamole is made fresh to order. We had the traditional kind and the mango habanero.  My only regret is not ordering the one with crab as well.  We shared queso fundido, the chicken taquitos and the grilled shrimp quesadilla. And the mexican street corn side has a great presentation and a really fabulous smoky taste. I loved all our choices. Everything tasted really fresh and vibrant. Our server was knowledgeable, cheerful and efficient and we really got to enjoy our experience. 
I'm really pleased that a restaurant of this quality has opened up on my side of the City, rather than having to trek to the Strip.  Looking forward to returning to try more of their menu and to sample another of their tempting Margaritas.
