I could not believe i had not written up a review when I checked for their phone number tonight! As I have said in previous reviews, I am a Canadian Irish man, far from a Mexican food critic. In fact I had not eaten "decent" Mexican until moving to NC 7 years ago. I do now love it, and Three Amigos in particular (see my review's) and this is my next fav Mexican in the Charlotte area by far!
I have been to & reviewed the La Unica in Huntersville and assume they are related as they have the same logo, and I like this one much better. 
Everything I have ordered, from the mole, to the enchiladas, & the best way to test Mexican, the basic taco. All are fantastic. We have dined in and ordered take out, I am normally not a fan of take out Mexican, but they make it work, and work well.
Unfortunately they do not yet have a liquor license and therefore feel I am missing something when dining in without a cerveza. 
Hands down best Mexican without driving down to Central Ave, or Tijuana. 
Gracias La Unica!
