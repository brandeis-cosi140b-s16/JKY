I can't say it enough, this place is so dang yummy.  Portions are very good for the price.  Dishes are incredibly flavorful.  I try to get something different every time. The Diablo is crazy spicy. I had the shrimp burrito tonight and it was so goooood! I will be so mad if my next trip out here to see my mum...they close. And I will blame that hideous, god awful sign of Del Webb.  It is an eyesore & blocks it's visibility when heading west on Bell road.
