Awesome fast food - WAY better than Rigo's and esp Roberto's, which I hate by the way. Try my OWN SPECIAL concoction - Half JAMAICA drink with half PINEAPPLE agua (flavored drink, kinda like lemonade) and a squeeze of lime. its an authentic Mexican place so dont expect American customs here. Remember its fast food. Location is not  bad, just looks old. Its an old building and the people are cool, no one bothers you.
