Los Sombreros is a nice casual environment with high quality food. The food is absolutely delightful and unique. It is most definitely not your average Americanized Mexican food. The happy hour specials are exceptional enough to create a possible regular outing to Los Sombreros after work, but what really is absolutely amazing is the Lamb Adobo. It's a delight and brings forth ecstasy upon every bite. The staff is wonderful and friendly as well.
