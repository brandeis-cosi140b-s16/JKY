Everyone love a fiesta right???? Well this is the place to get your Cinco D'Mayo on!!!

Start with the nachos layered and piled high with all the fixings!!! Beuno!! This could be a meal in its own but bring all your friends and share because we are just getting me started. Try the queso. Bueno!! Try the guacamole. Bueno!! Drink the top shelf margaritas!! Bueno!!!

For the main course...pick anything. I've tried it all and was never disappointed. Ask them about their favorite shrimp dish...the way they describe it is exactly why I get it almost every other time I go here. 

Sit on the patio...and flip off the people at the Vive. They are the losers that prevent this place from having mariachi every night of the week. But that is what this place needs. More music. More salsa. More merengue. Bring your dog especially if you have a chihuahua. But if you live at the Vive...sty home...your dogs, your cars, your drunk walks home aren't wanted at this establishment.
