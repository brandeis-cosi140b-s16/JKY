This is by far one of the best places we have gone to eat in Las Vegas.  The burritos were great and BIG!!!!!  We tried the kallua pig and chicken and they were very tasty.  This just might cause us to rate Hawaiian as our favorite food edging out other favorites such as Mexican and Thai.  Overall - this was really good and can't be beat. You must try the bark.  It is incredible - and - out of this world!
