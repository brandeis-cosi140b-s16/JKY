Serving up BIG flavor in a little strip mall.  It was our first visit, the girl behind the counter was great...she gave us samples of 6 popular offerings to acquaint us with the menu and then talked us through the order process.  A nice touch for first timers. I ordered the carnitas (savory), jerk chicken and jerk rice (a bit of spicy) and black beans (refried and slightly sweet).  Great combination! I took half of it home for lunch the next day, great bargain at $10.  The staff gets service...even putting a special fold in our bag securing our leftovers (precious cargo!).

We went here on our last night in town, wish we had gone here first! I could have had dinner there more than once.  Next trip to Phoenix, Chino Bandido will be our go to dinner spot!
