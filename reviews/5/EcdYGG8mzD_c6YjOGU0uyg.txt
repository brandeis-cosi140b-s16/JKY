Growing up in a household eating delicious authentic Mexican food, I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants. I would like to say that El Panzon is as close as I've found to the taquerias in Tijuana and my mom's cooking. My mom rocks, just saying... 

My favorite thing to order here are their tacos. I love to order buche, lengua and tripa. Yeah, these might not be for everyone, but they are my personal favorites. If you aren't an adventurous eater, you can't go wrong with their carnitas or carne asada tacos. My boyfriend also loves their chicken tortas as well as their sopes. 

Not only are their tortas, tacos, sopes and huaraches amazing, they also have great people working there. Rosy is a sweetheart! I have yet to ask her if she is the owner. She very well may be since she's always there. She knows me by name and even recognizes me over the phone when I call in my order. I'm so happy to have this awesome hole in the wall near me.
