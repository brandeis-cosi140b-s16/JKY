I am a serious Mexican and taco fan, so I've been to plenty of different places.  This was at lease in my top 3 of all time.  Everything I ate was recommended by the owner/ manager Ross Buter, so I suggest asking for him if you go there.  The guacamole, salsa and Ribeye tacos were all amazing!  Plus, I'm a bit of a margarita snob and those blew me away, too.  Please go here any time you're in Las Vegas.  You will not be disappointed!  Thanks to the whole staff there for a great experience!
