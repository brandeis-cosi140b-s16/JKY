I don't know how many 5 star ratings I've given..not many I'm sure, this deserves it.. these tacos are the best I've had in vegas..

at first I was skeptical, i ordered two tacos and they put the sauce on the side.. probably because I'm white and the waiter said it was spicy.. he looked really surprised when i asked for more hot sauce.. and to be honest they should never assume because the sauces is what make this place so much better than their competition.. the chipotle sauce they use is too good to even describe.. ask for extra you'll be glad you did.. 

I swear some people rate places five stars because they were starving and they think its the best when really they would say anything was the best... not in my case i went to El pollo loco first.. and as i was leaving was still hungry.. one bite and i immediately regretted el pollo loco.. and i love el pollo!!!
