I have always loved Qdoba because of their variety, quality and taste and although those haven't changed, their menu and service seem to vary.

I definitely recommend the craft 2 if you want to get two smaller entrees, it's a great deal.  Two tacos with chips ("on the side") and choice of queso and add in *anything* for under $10.  Awesome. Including the price of sour cream in entrees is a bit frustrating as I don't care for them, but this probably is a benefit for most.

My meal was very tasty; I love the salsa roja (spicy) and the flavor of he meat. You always see meat being grilled.

Great place. More locations needed.
