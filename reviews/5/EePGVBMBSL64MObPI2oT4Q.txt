This is my families favorite fast food Mexican place! I pick it up about once every 2 weeks. Drive thru is very quick. Family owned. I love the bean & cheese burritos. My husband loves the carne asada burritos & shredded beef tacos.  The cheese crisp is yummy, huge but good for a child for 2 meals. 
For the price/speed/convenience you can't beat it!
