Tacos El Gordo is the spot . Best tacos in Vegas! It's like they brought  TJ to the strip ! If anyone thinks other wise they must not know what a Great taco taste like. It might be alittle confusing to order and the wait might be long but I'm telling you it's well worth it . Oh and make sure to tip the cook if you want some extra meat! It works every time .
