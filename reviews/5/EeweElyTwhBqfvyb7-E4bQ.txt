This is my favorite Mexican food place in Phoenix, I wish I lived closer! There aren't many places to choose from for a vegetarian, but Mi Patio has many options and I really appreciate that!! They have an AWESOME vegetable enchilada. Their salsas are really good and to top it off, their prices are great! This is definitely a friendly, local business that I take all of my out of state visitors who of course always want Mexican food as soon as they get here :)
