Ok, first off I have frequented many, many  Mexican restaurants. I have ordered from the usual mexican/american menu. I was anticipating the usual when my wife and I stepped into Don Pedro's. I was in for A BIG surprise! This restaurant deserves a stand-alone location. To simplify, this place knows how to take care of customers and deliver superior, quality food. If you ever get the chance to sit in the bar area then I would advise you to ask for Hector - actually, I recommend you ask for Hector. By far the best Bartender I have ever befriended. I LOVE this place and hands down there is no other!
