Love Chipotle and super stoked this one has opened near the house! As it is new, the store is very clean. Staff is super friendly and the food tastes the same as any other Chipotle, Delicious!  I have to go to another location  to be certain, but either prices went up or this location  is a tad bit pricier. I only say this because I am used to hearing "that'll  be 1.80 extra for guac" but here it was 1.95.   Not a deal breaker for this chick. Lay it on me! Om nom nom.
