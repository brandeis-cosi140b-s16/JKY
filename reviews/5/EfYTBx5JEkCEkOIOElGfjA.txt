I love Chipotle. Always have, always will.
Everything is fresh and made to order. They are fast and polite as you make your way down the line. My usual is a veggie burrito bowl. Chips and guacamole if I'm feeling frisky! All locations are clean and food is consistently fresh and delicious . What more can you ask for? 
Did you say beer? They have that too. 

Peace, Love and Chipotle!
