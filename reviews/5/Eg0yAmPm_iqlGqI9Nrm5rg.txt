We had been here a few years ago and really enjoyed.  We went back last weekend as we had a staycation at the Boulders.  Hilton now owns this restaurant.  This food was really amazing.  We started with the 3 salsas as we did last time, and they were still great.  I had the enchiladas and my husband the pork tenderloin.  Would highly recommend both.  Portions are large, and next time I would try dessert rather than an app just for something different.  The service was great as well.  This restaurant is over 45 minutes from our home but we will be going again for sure!
