Stopped here for a quick bite after flying into Phoenix and found this restaurant on Yelp.     The food was fantastic, I had a filet with a green chili-sour cream sauce which was wonderful, delicate and flavorful, I'd never seen or had anything like it in Denver.    My wife had a soup with very large pieces of shrimp, scallops and fish.     Great flavors and value.
