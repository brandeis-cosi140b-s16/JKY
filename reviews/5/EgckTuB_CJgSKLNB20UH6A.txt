Budgeting is tough.  My wife and I put our play money entitled "Blow" down to $100/month, and looking for a good place to eat is a very stressful decision - one that instinctively led to the place where a man held a poorly spelled sign (though I can't for the life of me remember what it was that made me laugh out loud and turn).

"A good taqueria."  Pssht.  I may only be a gringo white boy (though I swear I'm one-eighth Mexican), I know and love Mexican food.  I've frequented the Roberto's, the Cafe Rio's, the Lindo Michocaon's - they've all been pretty good.  (Cafe Rio is bordering on American Mexican, but I digress.)

But I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for one reason - the meat.  I love the meat.  Their selections are both varied and excellent.  Marinated for hours and clearly seasoned to perfection, I was sold the second they let me test-drive their meats.  Wow.

Actually, I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for two reasons - the service.  The people there are friendly and it's clear that they want to do well here.  Smiles and cooperation makes this a solid mexican food joint to at least give a try.

I have a qualm - I have a feeling that they started in San Francisco - mainly because they have the weird decor of the Golden Gate, etc. adorning their walls, but I have to critique the way it's presented.  It's...  awkward.  And I don't know what it has to do with Mexican Food when there's no "History of Super Burrito" plaque or something to let me know I'm still, in fact, in Nevada.

Had their nachos and boy were they salty!  But I happen to like really salty nachos, so it worked out.  I've had the burritos.  I've had the taco salad, too, but the burrito is a solid way to start.  If you're not a vegetarian - which should be sacrilege in this restaurant if you ask me - you will love this place.
