Oh my flip! Had the California surfin burrito tonight, it was crazy good! One of the best burritos I have ever had. As always, this place is excellent. In fact, we were in the area for a b-day party and intentionally burned about two extra hours so we could hit this place up for dinner.  One could never go wrong eating here!
