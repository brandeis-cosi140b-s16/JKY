I am pretty sure I have never rated anything on Yelp. However, with that being said I was so satisfied with this place that I am writing this review as I drive home. I couldn't wait to give it five stars. It was my first time at a taco cart and I was a little nervous. However as I walked up I was warmly greeted by a man who turns out to be the owner. I ordered a chicken taco. While I was waiting for it to be prepared he presented me with a taco on the house of their specialty, the pastor. After eating both which were both equally delicious I am left speechless about how wonderful this place is.  Hands down the best tacos I have ever had and a gracious owner to boot. What more could you possibly ask for?!?!
