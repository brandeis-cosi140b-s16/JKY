This restaurant is AMAZING! We eat here regularly and recently had a big event and they handled the catering. Megan, the take out manager, really went above and beyond. She not only made sure our order was perfect (after some initial confusion), but she came in on her day off to do so. I love that your staff is so dedicated to their job and their customers that they will come in on a Sunday to help with a special catering order. This really says a lot about this location and their leadership. I cannot thank Megan, and Chipotle, enough, as the party was a success and everyone loved the food!
