Went around 6pm and the place was nearly full. Took a little long to have my order taken but I wasn't complaining because they had a sign that explained it wasn't fast food and everything was made to order so be patient. After tasting the food it was well worth a little extra waiting time.

The chips with salsa and guacamole were the best I've had in Vegas. I really wanted to get full on those alone. Up next we had the Bulgogi nachos and they didn't disappoint either. Stacked high and covered in cheese and beef I was digging in elbow deep. Most places skimp you with barely enough toppings for a big pile of chips but Komex had the perfect 50/50 toppings to chip ratio. I had the bulgogi burrito and my roomie had the bulgogi chimichanga. Both were pretty darn good. The bulgogi was super tender and extremely flavorful and all the fresh ingredients stuffed inside really sent my taste buds for a wild ride. I wish the rice inside the burrito would of had a little more texture to it but once again that's easily overlooked in the grand scheme of things. After our meal our waitress(owner?) bought out some orange slices which I thought was really cool and a nice way to finish off a meal. The server was really busy but always had a smile on her face and made small talk with everyone to create a cozy feel within the restaurant which will have me coming back weekly.

TLDR: Amazing food, great service considering one lady was doing the entire front of house. Price was 21$ for two apps and two entrees which is pretty great at this quality level. Be patient because their food is worth the wait.
