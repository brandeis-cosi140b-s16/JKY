honestly, bomb tacos for roughly $2!! i was starving and bought 3 tacos and even though they look small, man they are truly filling.

even if the lines are packed it goes by relatively quickly, and it really hits the spot.  im sure there are other people here writing ridiculously long reviews so i'll let them do that...so JUST GO IF YOU LOVE TACOS!

i also got their flan just because and it was pretty dang good, i think it was around $2 as well for a nice slice.
