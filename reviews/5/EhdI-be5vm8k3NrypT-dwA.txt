First time at Burrito Drive, and was skeptical, being raised in Texas and growing up on authentic Mexican food. I ordered the 3 taco plate with carne asada, on flour tortillas. Blown away! It was good. I was a very happy customer! They use fresh ingredients and combine ingredients the way real TexMex is done. Fresh guacamole, (not the fake, bright green stuff you get at other places), Perfect cheese, too. The tortillas were good, but I prefer mine a lot thicker and fluffy. Never the less, it was money well spent. These days, if I'm going to part with my hard earned money, I darn better be satisfied. Burrito Drive made me more than wiling to do this, and I plan on making the 80 mile round trip again, for sure. Well worth it. 

I brought home chicken enchiladas for my son. Even after reheating it, he said to report that it was great! 

It's a small place, easy to miss, unless you're looking for it. That made it all the more good since everyone in our party of 4 knows what wonderful food lies in those small, hole-in-the-wall places in the communities of South Texas. 

I would recommend this place to everyone, but especially those in Madison area who get what I mean when I say "real" TexMex. 

Shout out to the awesome staff, too. Nice vibe to go with good food.
