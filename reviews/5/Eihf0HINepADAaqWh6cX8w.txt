Enjoyed Cinco de Mayo with the best Ahi Ceviche we've ever had! I may crave the Kale chopped salad daily and the cauliflower on a sweet potato puree was AMAZING!! We'd never had pork belly tacos before and they were delicious! Also loved the pumpkin seeds in the guacamole! Loved the fresh, healthy choices and the great atmosphere. If you're looking for ordinary mexican food this isn't the place. But if you want extraordinarily fresh and inventive food, give Taco Haus a try!!
