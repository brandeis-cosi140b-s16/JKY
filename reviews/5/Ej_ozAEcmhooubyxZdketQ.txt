I thought this place was going to be the typical cheap burrito joint but boy was I wrong. This place really does the food well. I love the prime rib tortas or the carne asada burrito. But more than the great food this place has mexican ice cream, a selection of pastries and even makes cakes. Also the place is very clean and lively. A big thumbs up in my book!
