I have been passing this gem for a long time and finally I stopped today . I ordered the carne asada fries , which I had to wait 5 minutes for but let me tell you , it was Worth the Wait !!! I love hot sauce and homemade sauces hers/theirs is delicious. 
I will be stopping back by as much as I can . Sorry other taco vendors,  Abuela's has my vote , now. 
By the way, I love the owner , she is z sweetie.
