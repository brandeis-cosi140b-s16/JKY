Wow! What a great find. Really out of the way. Even a local didn't know about it. The best fish taco I've ever had. Taco salad was huge and had great flavors. The chicken quesadilla was really good. Food cooked with love. Go here! The staff was really friendly! Thanks for a great meal and experience.
