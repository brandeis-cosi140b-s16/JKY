One of my favorite Mexican places to eat in Phoenix.  this is definitely a lunch place (and very busy)... the exterior has been upgraded recently so it looks kinda nicer...  the atmosphere is different.  you order your food from a window and wait for your number to be called... all seating is on your own and at times it is though to get a seat...  despite all of this the food is excellent and cheap.

If you go you should buy the tortillas to take home... they are HUGE and pretty tasty... the walls are plastered with awards for best tortillas in Phoenix...  I also recommend trying the tacos and burros...
