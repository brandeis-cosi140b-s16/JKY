First off, I have to comment on the customer service.  It was an older gentleman.  He was amazing!!! Super nice, prompt, and professional.

This place is a bargain for amazing unique food.  We had the tater tots with everything.  I highly recommend.  The first taste is a party in your mouth with the taters, the pork belly, bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.  It is so flavorful.  It comes in a cask iron pan.  It was soooo good.  I'm still craving it today.  Very good and creative.  Must try. 

We also tried all the variety of tacos.  You must get it with the kimchi.  It makes all the difference.  They were very generous with the filling and at $2 a taco, you can't complain.  It was so good.  No extra charge for the kimchi which is awesome. 

You get complimentary chips and salsa.

I highly recommend.  Must try.  It will not disappoint.
