Fiesta Grill is the former "Tradiciones" next to the Ranch Market at 16th St. and Roosevelt.   We stopped in for lunch today and it was a great experience.   The service was terrific, the decor was authentic and the food was outstanding.   We started with chips, Salsa and been dip, all of which were very tasty.  I had the combo fajitas which included skirt steak and chicken, one of my companions had the same with the addition of shrimp and another had burrito. Everything was accompanied by homemade guacamole, salsa, rice, been and tortillas.  We all agreed that the food was as good or better than any other place we have been to.   

What's fun about dining at the Fiesta Grill is that you feel like you are eating at a restaurant in Mexico.  Everything is authentic from the tile floor to the chandeliers.

After lunch we we walked next door to the Ranch Market and walked around.  Going there is like culturally visiting another world.   It is fun, vibrant, colorful with all kinds of unique products.  If you go walk by the meat counter.  There were things there that I hav never seen before!

All in all a fun lunch.
