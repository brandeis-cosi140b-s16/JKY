Since I was first introduced to Gallo by my best friend, it became our regular mid-week, catch-up & get away place. The food is good but my favorite are the drinks, specially the Bloody Micheladas. It's definitely I nice 'chill' place and if you get the benefit of being out there on a nice afternoon ask for your drink to be put in a plastic cup and take up to the roof top to enjoy a beautiful Phoenix sunset.

I CAN NO LONGER KEEP THIS PLACE A SECRET! It's too awesome so I've been "sharing" with family & friends. The only issue I have here is I can never decide what to get!
