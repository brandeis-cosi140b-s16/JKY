We have eaten here at least 5 times since it has reopened with new owners. Couldn't be more pleased with friendliness of staff and yummy food. My 7 year old ate her entire pork taco without picking out lettuce and tomatoes. She hates lettuce. She said the pork meat just made it all taste so good! This mom is happy! We are coming back every Tuesday for tacos! Oh and the green salsa, so good I could drink it straight.
