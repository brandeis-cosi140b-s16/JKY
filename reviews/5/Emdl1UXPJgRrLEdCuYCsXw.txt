Went to Chipotle for the first time last week. Was greeted enthusiastically by all the employees especially Peter. I told  him it is my first time and he walked me through the whole menu.

He then checked on me later on after I was eating to see how I liked it. And then before he left for the day he brought me over a coupon to invite me back a second time. Sadly this kind of great customer service doesn't happen very often. 

I went back in today and he remembered me and welcomed me warmly again. 

Highly recommend visiting this location.
