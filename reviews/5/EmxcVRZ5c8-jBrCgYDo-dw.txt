Excellent food, probably the only authentic Mexican food in the entire state of Arizona, very friendly staff....Amazing food just like my grandmother and mothers cooking. I feel at home everytime i come to this place. The downside is they close at 3 but other than that i would give it 6 stars if i could. Food is cooked fresh unlike other restaurants who cook the meat early and let it sit for hours until you order. The owners are very friendly people too...Tamales Guadalajara should open up a second location !
