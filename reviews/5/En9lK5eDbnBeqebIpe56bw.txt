One of Scottsdale's hidden gems. Any place that can be open for over 50+ years has got to be doing something right. Not your typical mexican fare....this is "New Mexican" style. Much more flavorful and zesty! Had the number 8....probably the best mexican food I have eaten. Do yourself a favor and eat here. Not if you're counting carbs tho.
