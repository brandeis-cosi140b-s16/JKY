OH. MY. GOSH. 

EVERYTHING was on point. Everything! The service was amazing - we wanted to sit outside so the gentleman at the front of the restaurant brought us our salsa and chips. We then decided it was too hot and came back inside - without skipping a beat, or being upset, the same gentleman gave us the same great service. 

The dining area was gorgeous - quaint and authentic. A few pictures on the wall of what was on the menu really goes a long way. 

The food - INCREDIBLE! I have to recommend the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Oh my gosh the BEST Green Tomatillo sauce I have EVER had. And half of my family, is Mexican! I saw so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try - which is unusual for me. I usually find one thing I like and stick with it every time I go to a restaurant. But here, I'm excited to try more! I know it's amazing when I am craving the same dish the next day. 

Oh and by the way --- the salsa with the chips they bring you first thing is absolutely delicious. Perfect amount of spicy and savory. So good. I would buy this stuff just to have it at home whenever I wanted! 

I only have one critique...and this may be a non - issue because I didn't ask too many questions. The majority of the menu seems to be focused around chicken. I cant imagine having a shredded beef enchilada with that same sauce, or even a pork enchilada...They may have more options though - you will have to ask, and so will I when I go in again...This weekend! :D
