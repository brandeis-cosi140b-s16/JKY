I was brought here for lunch by a co-worker, and it's now my go-to dinner on the way out to Coyotes games.

The tacos are out of this world, but even better is the salsa bar.  Peanut salsa? Cilantro salsa? Pico? Yes, and more; over 10 salsas made fresh daily on site. The place is small and decorated brilliantly in a Dia de Los Muertes theme year-round. 

Sometimes the waitstaff can seem a little disinterested, but during lunch you order from the bar and sit down whenever something frees up. 

Don't go here for the service, go here for the amazing food and enjoy a little taste of Mexico in Phoenix.
