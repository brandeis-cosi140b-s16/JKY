I love Loco Lime! We've been many times and it's one of our "take out of town guests to" restaurants. The food is always fresh and the drinks always tasty. The salsa is nice and thick and the veg options are great. The meat eating man is always happy with his dish too. You absolutely cannot beat $1 taco Tuesdays. The service is attentive but not annoying and a manager has popped by our table every time we've dined to make sure all is well with our dining experience. 

My only minor complaint is that parking can be a drag as they share the space with Kickstand.
