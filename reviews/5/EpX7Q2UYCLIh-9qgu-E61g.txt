Went for lunch with some friends today. We were seated quickly, and things only got better from there. Our waitress, Marla, was the best server I've ever had! They kept the chips and salsa and drinks freshly stocked at all times, and were really timely with our food order. I ordered the Beast burrito with the carne adovada and it was amazing!!! When we were ready to leave Marla got us all fresh drinks to go. The food was awesome, the service was great - I'd recommend it to anyone!
