Went to the new location this morning and was pleased with the new spot...I chose the steak n egg quesadilla hoping for a smaller portion than the normal huge burritos they serve...I was happy with the heat of the green chiles and just right portion of proteins too...

Slightly awkward layout right now but I'm sure once they get all settled in the logistics of ordering on the LIVE FIRE Q side will make sense...

Good thing I don't live closer because I'd for sure be eating here more often!
