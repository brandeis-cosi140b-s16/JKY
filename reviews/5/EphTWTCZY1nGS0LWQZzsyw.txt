O.M.G. This place is sooooo good. And I should know cause I'm a half-bred Mexican! okay, so I only know the dirty words in espanol, but I do know great Mexican food and this place has it. The chips were blazin hot and light and crisp. The taco shells the same way. The beef was tender and salty and the refried beans were perfectly delicious. I would weigh 800 pounds if I lived close to this place. Oh! That reminds me, they don't use lard. Only vegetable oil. Mexican food heaven.
