I'm surprised by the other reviewers here. Are fresh tortillas really a "gimmick"? The fresh tortillas are what this Panchero's apart from Chipotle and Qdoba, who pull stale tortillas out of a plastic bag. That's huge, for my money at least.

People some to be upset that the service "unbearably slow," which is kind of nonsensical insofar as this is an order-at-the-counter restaurant where the food is made right before your eyes. If one cannot wait in a line and then have a burrito prepared fresh, then one should stick to McDonalds where the food is always fast.

Surprisingly, I see relatively few complaints about the actual taste of the food. Well, few specific complaints, that is. For me, the freshness is the key. Qdoba always serves me luke-warm chicken that has been sitting out for hours, and Chipotle's meats are so over-salted as to be criminal. The salsas have variety and one can get a nice tomato-based salsa that tastes fresh and light. 

My criticism is that their steak can be a bit tough, but then again, so is Chipotle's. The chicken is usually tender with a nice grilled flavor. 

Overall, I think the fresh tortilla's really make the difference. They don't keep massive quantities in the warming trays before they want to serve it fresh and hot. I'll happily wait if I get fresh food.
