If you are hungover and in Las Vegas you need to come here! It's about 20 minutes from the strip but I guarantee you it's worth the drive. 

The place is very colorful. The music is good and the service is more than great!

Let's talk about the food though. 

I had the aguachiles. This is my favorite Mexican seafood dish. The ones here are just so good. The perfect amount of lime and chile. They also give you a side of chile which I made sure to use. My mouth is watering just thinking about the taste. 

I also tried the shrimp ceviche and it was just as good! The serving size looks small but it's actually enough for about 3 tostadas. They give you a lot of shrimp. 

We also ordered 4 shrimp empanadas thinking they would be small but boy were we wrong. They were huge! It was only 2 of us and we would've been good with just 1 each. The waitress recommended we mix  mayo with the green chile sauce it comes with. Good thing we listened to her because it was amazing. 

We also had 2 refreshing micheladas. 

This place is a must when you're in Vegas! You won't regret it and you'll leave satisfied.
