The mission is my absolute new favorite restaurant!  The food and service is awesome!!  It is also has an incredibly beautiful atmosphere.  You walk in to find a glowing wall of salt rock, which puts a soft glow into the entire restaurant, very romantic.

We made a reservation, which I would strongly suggest.  We got to sit down very quickly.  I think it is great that they take reservations for a party of any size!  Not really all that common these days.

We started with the quacamole and it was excellent!  I also had the primarita, which was made with fresh squeezed limes and agave necter.  Delicious and low cal :)

We, also had the cripsy pork, and halibut as suggested by our server.   Everything was amazing!

Overall, our experience was great!  Friendly and attentive staff, beautiful atmosphere and delicious food!  Can't wait to go back!
