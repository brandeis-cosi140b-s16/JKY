This place is delicious. It's in my top 3 mariscos restaurants. The food is amazing and super tasty. The staff is really friendly. sometimes the food takes a bit but that's only because it's always packed! I am really happy that they expanded the restaurant as it is now a lot bigger and everyone is not right next to each other.
