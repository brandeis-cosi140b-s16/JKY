Awesome food.  I repeat, awesome food.  There is a section at the front of the menu that goes over where they get their products from.  I felt good about what I was eating!

Cool ambience.  Good people watching.  Our waiter, Rorke, was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient.  There was one mistake with the food we ordered, it wasn't a huge deal, but we wanted to let him know.  He apologized and immediately had it taken off our bill.  We told him that was unnecessary, but they did it anyway.

We will be back.
