Bravo, Chipotle! You gained a fan in me when you took the initiative to step forward and label the GMOs on your nenu, as well as striving to veer away from further use of GMOs in your restaurants. Thankfully, you have begun paving the way for others to come clean. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
