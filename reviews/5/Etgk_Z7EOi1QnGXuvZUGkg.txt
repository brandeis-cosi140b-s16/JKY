I am a picky eater and customer service is huge to me. I can honestly say I have never been disappointed here. I highly recommend their shrimp burrito and if all you have is $5.40 I highly recommend their Two Fish Taco with medium drink. It is delicious, hearty and healthy, loaded with fish, cabbage and their house made pico. I also enjoy their generous complimentary salsa bar. I always go for the Horchata, it's delicious and my food is always served with good vibes!
