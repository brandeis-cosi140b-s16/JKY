We went to Spanish Fly for a co-worker's farewell happy hour since she got a new job. When we first arrived, hardly anyone was there- granted it was a random Tuesday night. Right away we all went to the bar and realized what an amazing happy hour Spanish Fly had! $2 drafts of any beer they have on tap and $2 chip dip trio (originally $6 bucks). The Bartender TJ tended to our every need- we were a group of 9 girls so he really deserves a medal. We had a fabulous time and definitely plan to go back!
