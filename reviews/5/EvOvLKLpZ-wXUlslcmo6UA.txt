Stopped in here after a week long trip in Vegas, and on out way to Hoover Dam before going home and man what a sweet little find.  I got the fish tacos and I'm impressed!!!   I can't tell you how good these were.   The salsa bar is homemade and the medium one is the best!!!  The guy at the counter was magnificent,  friendly and kind (a nice change for once)    Thanks Taco Stand!!!
