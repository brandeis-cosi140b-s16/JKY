This was an amazing date night! We started with simple chips and salsa. Then when the food came, I was amazed! I had the Baja Combo and a margarita. The Baja is something I have never seen before! It seemed like an egg at first glance, but inside this fried and stuffed avocado was a true delight! It is stuffed with chicken and cheese... yes, INSIDE the avocado! I have no clue how they did this, but it was delicious! It had the creaminess of the avocado, but the rich flavor of the chicken and cheese inside. Along with this came black beans and Mexican rice. The margarita was delicious also and a great way to compliment the flavors as well as cleanse your pallet due to the rich flavors. I can't wait to go back! The staff was friendly, but due to them being busy, less attentive than I would have liked.
