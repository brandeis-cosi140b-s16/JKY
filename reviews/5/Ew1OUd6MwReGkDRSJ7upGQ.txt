I go to Cafe Rio on a regular basis (atleast once a week). Their Pork Salad and Tortilla Soup are great!  Their daily specials are also something to consider because those meals come with a drink. Personally I prefer Thursdays for their tamales. 

Cafe Rio also has a stamp card (if you don't have one, ask the cashier for one) which for every entree you order you earn a stamp and after ten stamps you earn a free meal (plus drink).

Cafe Rio is definitely worth looking into; and if you're a burrito fan, enchilada style is a must!
