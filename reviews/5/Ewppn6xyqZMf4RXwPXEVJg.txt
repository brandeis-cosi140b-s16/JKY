Some of these previous low ratings surprise me, as my wife and I have been eating here for years. I have never had them limit refills on drinks ever. One waiter is not nearly as efficient as the others but he is the only one. 
This is not a Tex-Mex joint so if you want their best do not order chimi's, enchiladas or fajitas. They have many other excellent choices. May I suggest combinations plates number 15 and 34 they are always superb. For the week day lunch special I always order the beef alambra tacos. The bacon puts them over the top. The Queso appetizers are artery clogging but excellent.
