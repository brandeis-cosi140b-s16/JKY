When I stayed in North Phoenix for two weeks of training class this was the only authentic Mexican food I could find in the area. I was surprised that in Phoenix there would not be more Mexican food choices (I meant good ones) but I went back here several times for lunch. The food is a great value. The atmosphere is one of fast food as you order at the counter and pick it up when your number is called. But really good, anything I tried. And the tons of Mexicans that eat there all the time will back me up I'm sure.
