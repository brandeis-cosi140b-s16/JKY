I cant put into words how good their breakfast burrito is. It is the best breakfast burrito i have ever had. I love how everything in it is pretty much cooked right in front of me too. I'm very health conscious and wont go to most fast food Mexican restaurants but this one i will never stop coming to. I love it. Everyone who works there is awesome and very nice. They get my food out perfectly every time and provide great customer service every time.
