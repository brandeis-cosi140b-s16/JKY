Oh my good friend, it was love at first bite. I first tried Chipotle in Ohio in 2002. Oh man, was I hooked. I have no idea how this is possible, but back then I could actually get down two burritos. Wow. For those of you who have eaten here but have never experienced the Chipotle Carnitas, please help yourself by doing so. This is the best carnitas I have ever tasted and it is always amazing. Moist with a hint of salt and seasonings. I have turned many people on to their carnitas. Their cilantro lime rice is sooooo tasty! I always ask for extra. I no longer eat meat and this is actually one of the few meals I will truly miss even though I didn't eat here all the time. Their pinto beans are cooked with bacon so I have to get black beans and their vegetarian burrito now...it's good...but that meat is always on the other side of that glass looking awfully good. My order: Vegetarian burrito, extra rice, black beans, peppers and onions, pico, the corn salsa, the medium salsa, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and guac (or instead of guac the carnitas). Their chips are super yummy too...try them with guac! OMG Flavor Explosion!
