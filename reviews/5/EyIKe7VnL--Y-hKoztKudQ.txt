I love Mexican.. Burritos in general. Chips and salsa. Soooo good. I only go here once in a while since there are only a couple in town. I like to get the Carne asada burrito and put their medium salsa in it. Sometimes the kids meal is perfect if you need something small. A couple tacos can do the trick too. 

When I came in I saw they were short handed and told here to take her time. She took my order and then in threw a couple bucks in the tip jar cause I know how hectic it can get. She seemed really surprised and then smiled and gave me some extra chips. They pushed out the orders they had and then seemed caught up. Made my day with the chips.
