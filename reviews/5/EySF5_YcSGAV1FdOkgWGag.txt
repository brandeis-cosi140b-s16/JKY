My boyfriend and I and our min-pin chihuahua headed up to the fountain and Yelped for lunch. The food was great and Molly (boss) was SO nice! My boyfriend said its cool cause there's no where else you would get that combination hotdog and it was delicious! It was a cute little place and we'd totally go back.  :) They even gave me a doggie hotdog to-go for our dog!
