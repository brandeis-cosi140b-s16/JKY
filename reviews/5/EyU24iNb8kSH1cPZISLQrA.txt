They only have tacos...but they do a great job with them! These tacos are simple and amazing. They offer carne asada and chicken , both which are delicious, but My favorite is the chicken.  Definitely the best tacos in the scottsdale area and possibly the best I've had in Phoenix! Fresh, yummy and quick! Ive only been during the daytime...and both times there was no wait...but I hear it gets pretty busy at night on the weekends, so I'd recommend going earlier in the day!
