Fast food that isn't cheap fast food quality. 

You order at the counter and take a number. You are given a bowl of thin, crispy white [always fresh] corn chips while you wait and help yourself to the salsa bar as your food is made fresh to order. The food is consistently very good, made with fresh quality ingredients that come together better than a lot of higher end Mexican restaurants. 

I have been eating here since this Caramba location opened and have always been happy with the fast friendly service and the delicious, generous portions. Even the margaritas are surprisingly good, but watch out, they are very generous with tequila. The atmosphere, prices and wait times are that of a typical fast food restaurant but here you get quality food - and besides margaritas, you also have the option to order a beer or sangria with your meal. I haven't tried their sangria yet, but I have noticed that some days it's red and others it's white. 

This restaurant is always squeaky clean: clean kitchen, restrooms, dining area, and patio.

Caramba's may not be the ideal place to bring a first date - maybe wait until date #3, this way you can impress them with your great taste AND your practical side all at once.
