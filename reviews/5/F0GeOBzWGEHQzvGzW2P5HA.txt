My boyfriend and I have been going here since Christmas time in 2013. Within the first week we went 3 times. Day before Christmas, day after, and then again the next day. We have been back almost every week since (if not twice a week.) family and friends have flown in from out of town and I have made a point to bring them here. LILLY makes the best guacamole hands down and EVERY TIME I come here I order guacamole even when she isn't there. It should be the best in Vegas...Wonderful servers. Always joyful and on their toes trying to accommodate every wish of mine. Wonderful atmosphere inside or out side by the fire... Not only that, the food is amazing and proportionate. Ohh yeah Don't forget to order one of there drinks from the bar. tamarind lemonade is what I tend to order.  One of my top three restaurants I attend weekly and the best Mexican joint in town
