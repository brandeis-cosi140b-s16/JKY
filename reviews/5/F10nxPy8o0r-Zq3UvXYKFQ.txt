I was in town for EDC and if you've been to EDC you know that most of the food you consume if any is drive thru fast food. 

So before heading back to LA I was determined to find mexican food to fill me up b4 my drive a! I stumbled upon this restaurant and I ordered a chile relleno and enchilada plate it came with rice and beans. I also ordered a side of chips and cuacamole and to drink I went with a jarritos! All for about $14 

The portion matched the price. Plus the salsa bar was good. It had those pickled carrots I LOVE!!!

The staff was friendly but were distracted watching the Mexico game. I had to remind them about my chips and guac. But no problem. I would have prolly be watching the game also. Overall the food was delicious I will be back next year!
