Great food . Not too many authentic Mexican food places in the area. Definitely have the machaca burrito and any breakfast burrito is awesome. Trying the 5 rolled taco supreme tonight. Aguas frescas are authentic and homemade. Great service too. The cook goes into detail on making every meal a good one.
