I love this particular location because the staff is always nice, even during the mad lunch rush. The quality of the food is consistent and the simple layout makes it easy for me to place my order, customize my meal, and be on my way. Since the Moe's app has come along, I'm in and out even quicker. I just order and dash in at the time I specified I want to pick up my food. How cool! As long as I get the customary "Welcome to Moe's" greeting, I'm good!
