Stopped here for a quick bite during happy hour. I ordered a strawberry mojito and it was one of the best I have ever had. It was only $4 bucks. I also ordered some taquitos. They sure came out fast!
They were very good and plenty of them.
I had to bring the hubby back the next day as our pre-Weezer drinking spot since the HH prices are pretty amazing.
We were able to find a spot at the bar and get lit up before the show for so cheap! It was awesome. Service was great and the drinks were even better.
I have set up a mommy's night out here the end of the month I like it so much.
