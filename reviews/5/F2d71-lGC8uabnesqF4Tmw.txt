I had purchased a Groupon for this restaurant, decided to buy it about 20 minutes before time ran out, and I am so GLAD I did.  Now I have lived in Arizona all my life, from the Globe/Miami area, and I have had more Mexican food than any other kind when it comes to restaurant food.  It's my favorite and I'm pretty easy to please.  I give most mexican restaurants are a 3 or a 4 rating, probably closer to 4.  

This one far exceeds most of them.  I rated a mexican restaurant last week a 5, as it was very good and customer service was great.  This place, customer service was great as well, but the food, oh, the food.  I'm serious, at least the top 3 of the best I've ever had.  I would rate it a 10 if I could.  

I had a chili verde burrito with beans and cheese added in and my daughter had the carne asada nachos.  Mine came with rice and beans.  Rice and beans were very good.  So many times rice in mexican food restaurants has no flavor.  This time the flavor was great.

But what really set this place apart was the meat.  My pork was so tender and flavorful, not sure what they cooked it in, but I am still thinking about that meal today.  And Megan's beef on her nachos had that same wonderful flavor and was every bit as tender.  I would love to get the recipe for whatever they marinade their meat in.   

The toppings on Megan's nachos were very generous, lots of cheese, sour cream and guacamole on the side, pico de gallo too, which was great.  I asked for a sample of some of the hot sauce they had and our waiter came out with 3 shot glasses with hot sauce in them so I could try a few different ones.  

This experience was top notch from start to finish.  Restaurant was clean and nicely decorated too.  I didn't go in bathroom, only thing I didn't check out.

See you soon, Rico!
