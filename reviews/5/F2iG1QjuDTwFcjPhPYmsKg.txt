We didn't know if Fogon would be good because of the reviews, but we tried it anyway...and it was absolutely wonderful!  We had the guacamole which was made fresh at the table.  For dinner we had the beef carnitas and chicken tinga burrito. We also managed to scarf down the churro ice cream sandwiches.  Everything was excellent- not overly seasoned but mixed with delicious flavors. Portions are hearty and the two of us took home enough leftovers for another meal.  We enjoyed the Benihana-style atmosphere and chatting with the chef. The owner, Daniel, even stopped by to wish my boyfriend a happy birthday.  Staff were very friendly. We are big fans of Mexican food, have made the Mexican food rounds across the Valley and we will definitely be back. Very, very enjoyable dinner.
