*I made a page back in July for this location, but whenever I try to check in this is the only Chipotle that shows up so whatev!

I have loved Chipotle for many years now. I even have one of their shirts that say "Addicted" on it. 

I have been to 6 Chipotle locations in the valley & loved them all. But I love this location the most now because it is less than 5 minutes from my house, yay! I don't think they have been open for more than 2 weeks, which explains why they're a little slow but the employees here are friendly & generous with the portions. 

My Hubby & I get the same thing every time, bowls! His: chicken, rice, pinto beans, fajita veggies, a lil tomato salsa, cheese & lettuce. Mine: steak, EXTRA rice, no beans & EXTRA tomato salsa. Yummy in our tummies!!
