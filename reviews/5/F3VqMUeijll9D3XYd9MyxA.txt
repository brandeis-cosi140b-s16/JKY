We like Casa de Mina so much we're tempted to keep it to ourselves, but that would be selfish.  We eat there at least once a week and each time we try a new dish we're blown away. The enchiladas suizas, chicken quesadillla and sopa are all the best we've ever tasted. They have had a liquor licence for several months now, and make a good margarita. We enjoy the atmosphere - casual but nice, with linen table cloths and serviettes. And the service is superlative - friendly, well-trained staff who remember returning customers, and work as a team, attending to your needs whether or not they're assigned to your table. Tony and Pablo particularly stand out for their warm welcome, expert service and knowledgeable menu suggestions.
