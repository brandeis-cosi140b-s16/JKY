None better.  I've probably eaten here 10 or more times with various groups of people, and each time everyone involved was thrilled.  Here are some rules of thumb for a happy experience...1. Small crowded dining room with tile floor = lots of noise, so don't come here expecting explain the last ten years of your life to your half-deaf grandfather.  2.  Expect to wait...in the meantime, have a delicious margarita or three.  3.  Get the guacamole...worth every penny, especially when pomegranates are in season.  4.  Skip the bread...it's a Mexican restaurant after all.  5.  Pork tacos or enchilada suiza are the best things on the menu.  6.  Check out the restroom...be inspired.   7.  If you don't like this place, stop coming back so my wait will be shorter!
