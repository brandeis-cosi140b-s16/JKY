If your looking for authentic food this is the place to go to! It is not super fancy but the people who work here are very warm and friendly! I was brought warm chips and three different types of salsas that were very good! I ordered the bean wet burrito it was amazing!!! It was stuffed with refried beans, rice, cilantro, and onions, topped off with a good Red sauce and cheese and sour cream! I will definitely be back to this place !!!
