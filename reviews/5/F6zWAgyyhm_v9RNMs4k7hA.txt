For whatever reason, these shops are only south Orange County/ San Diego, Ca & Vegas! There was one in Riverside, Ca. But like most great things it woke up one day realizing it was in Riverside, Ca & then got the F--- out! L.A. Has Alberto's & Alvarro's etc.. (Their font and signage is nearly identical) but once you try Roberto's it's clear their ingredients are FAR superior than the other Taco chain(s)! I used to say Alberto's had the best drunk food, but after trying Roberto's, I can't even stoop to the Alberto's level anymore...
