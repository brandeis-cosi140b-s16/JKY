This is an unpretentious place that leaves a good impression that constantly reverberates... after you go you may just be surprised  at how soon you find yourself craving just a little something more off of their menu.  Simple dishes imaginatively prepared.  I'm glad it's a hotel restaurant because that means extended hours of business and access to a delightful breakfast, lunch or dinner anytime I want it.

I was so glad to see them give props on their menu to some of my favorite local farmers, whose produce is featured in many of the dishes.  Everything tastes super fresh and there are interesting flavor combinations all across the menu from the drinks to the chunky guacamole to the imaginative entrees.  Their tortas were perfectly prepared and are as good as the ones at Tortas El Guero on 16th Street (though El Guero offers far more variety).  I'll be back soon and look forward to noshing my way through the menu!
