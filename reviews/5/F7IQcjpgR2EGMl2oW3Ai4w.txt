First time today for lunch.

Interior- spotless, could have eaten off the floor if I wanted to.

Service, friendly, helpful and speedy, only about 8-10 minutes to get everything.

Got a chance to talk to zack, he was a serious food guy, he was happy as can be to talk to me about the food.

I had the dip trio, seriously licked the bowls.

chips were hot and delicious (i cannot stand cold chips)

I got 3 carne asada tacos, they were delicious, this is exactly what I am used to gettingt on the street in mexico, the people complaining about the size of them probably have not had tacos in mexico. I was there 10 days ago, and these are spot on.

I also had the corn, cant remember what its called there, but it was awesome! Reminded me of drunken snacking in tijuana.

I will absolutely go back. I have been to the other location in old town and the food is not nearly as good as this one, nor is the restaurant nearly as clean.

all in all, if you want some legit tacos, Americas taco shop is a perfect spot to get in and out in a hurry.
