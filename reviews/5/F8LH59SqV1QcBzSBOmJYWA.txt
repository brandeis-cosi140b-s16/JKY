I don't care what people say, but there are some chains that I love, and Rubios is one of them.  I love their original fish tacos.  I don't care for anything else on the menu.

And anyone who hates on eating in chain restaurants... I DARE you to come to Rubios.  Original taco plate, and substitute the beans for rice.  Yea, ... I said it!  I'm done here, you need to know nothing else.
