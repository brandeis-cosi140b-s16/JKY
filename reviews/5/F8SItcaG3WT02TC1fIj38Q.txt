We were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and we came upon this gem.  It was amazing. The Barbacoa was nice and juicy. I mixed it in with the red chili carnitas and wows air was a taste explosion in my mouth.  Their jalape√±o cream dip was so unique and refreshing.  Definitely coming back here again!!
