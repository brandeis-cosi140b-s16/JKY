Our second weekend in a row at this unbelievable restaurant! Service is beyond exceptional. Food is incredible! Ambience is A 20 out of ten!  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters I know and he absolutely loves this place and I like to eat healthy and love it too! Bottomless chips and salsa, three kinds of salsa!  If you are going to dinner with friends or have friends coming into town this is the place to bring them! Tonight we sat in a little outdoor room with a private fireplace! Oh, and by the way much less expensive eating here than in the Taqueria on the same property.  You get much more food! Perfect! Oh and they brought our food out so fast both times we have been here!
