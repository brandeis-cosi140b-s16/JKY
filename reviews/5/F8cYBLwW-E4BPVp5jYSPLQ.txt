Somewhat new restaurant in the downtown Phoenix area. Great addition to the neighborhood. It is located in an old church that gives it a majestic open space and feel. Plus they still have the stained glass and original woodwork which is very beautiful. Great selection of tequila and local craft beers. I had the Chipotle cherry steak taco, Peking duck taco, and the pork adovada taco all were excellent made fresh to order with great marinades and spices in a freshly hand made corn tortilla. They have a great happy hour. Everyday of the week. See my pictures for menus and happy hour specials. If you have not come down you have to give it a try. Very helpful friendly attentive staff and bartenders. Also has a nice diverse crowd and a great patio.
