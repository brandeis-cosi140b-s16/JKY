Amazing Mexican food! If it were on the strip, this place would be packed. Got the $6 guacamole which sounds crazy, but it is made FRESH at your table side and tastes soooo amazing. It is worth the $6 because it is a large portion so you can put it on any entree you order. 
I got the chile relleno and it was wonderful. 
The main event was the salmon asado! It had an amazing pur√©e sauce of deliciousness. 
MUST GO! Why aren't you already here?!
