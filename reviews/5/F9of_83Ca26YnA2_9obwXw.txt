This review Is for the location on Centennial. I won't bore you about how "I'm from California and thus and expert about Mexican food." As Roberto's and dang near every Mexican restauranteur is either from California or Mexico.

I usually pick up a burrito on Thursdays because that's my busy day at work and it's convenient to grab food from Roberto's on my way to work and it sticks with me all day even if I don't get a lunch. I'm thankful they are opened 24 hours as I can order whatever I want; breakfast or lunch.  The food tastes authentic, hot and ...fresh?? Or shall I say not as greasy as other locations.
Some locations are heavy on the salt but the cooks here make their food well. The restaurant is always clean. On my last visit, the cashier came from outside after sweeping. He washed his hands upon entering the kitchen and taking my order. This stood out to me because I work in healthcare and am mindful of such behaviors.

The cook came out and struck up a conversation with me in broken English. I couldn't really understand him but I appreciated the customer service enough to take the time to write this review.
