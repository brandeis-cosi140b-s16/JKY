Favorite Mexican restaurant in AZ!

Great atmosphere, laid back, great prices, and GREAT happy hour deals in the Cantina!

Every time I come to Phoenix, my friend and I always schedule a night out at Chevy's!  Even with the loss of a location, we still go out of our way to make time to eat there.

Candace or Caitlin are the best waitresses there...friendly, quick, and they even get my order right every time!!!
