I've been going to this place since 2001, since I'm new to yelp let's funky with it.
 Robertos is disgustingly delicious! You see the 5 pound carne asada fries before your eyes and you just feel happy. You take that first bite. You let it sit in your mouth, it's so goooooood, you feel like you're getting hit by a truck! That's how flavorful it really is! Indeed pleasurable :)
