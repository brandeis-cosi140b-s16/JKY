Love it!  I had no idea until my neighbor suggested it.  I am so very glad that he did.  The entire meal was so good: from the margarita, to the ceviche, to the main meal, and then...dessert...my oh my oh my, did we love dessert!  The service was very good, and the atmosphere if fun and light.  I will tell all my friends!
