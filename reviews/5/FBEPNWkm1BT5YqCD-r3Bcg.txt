I have been coming to this particular Filiberto's for a while now and the food and friendly service are consistently top notch. The bar is stocked with good tequila and they usually have something going on like karaoke in the evening to keep things interesting. It fills an interesting niche of taco shop fast food along with a nice bar that I didn't think would gel together but surprisingly does.  Food and drink specials for the most part are also pretty great as well.
