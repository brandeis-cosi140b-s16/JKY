We decided that we wanted to try something new so heard about Casa Layla. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and it had a nice decor. We sat down and had their salsa which was very good. We ordered and was not disappointed. I had a carne asada burrito which was fabulous and my girlfriend loved her chicken enchiladas. Also the beans and rice were better than other mexican food places we had been to. We will be back and plan to tell our friends and family about this great restaurant.
