Senor Taco is amazing. Great food, good prices, good service. The Bean Burrito enchilada style with red sauce is so good, beats out many expensive local Mexican restaurants and it is big enough to split between two people. The crunchy shredded beef taco's are really good and taste home made and not generic reheated. 

The salsa bar is really good and has great spicy and mild options. This girl loves her some hot sauce so any Mexican restaurant that has a salsa bar has special place in my heart. Senor Taco is great. Eat here. Often.
