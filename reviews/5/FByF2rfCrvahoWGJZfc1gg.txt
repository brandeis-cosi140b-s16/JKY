I'm from Chicago but I have traveled to Arizona many many times. I discovered this place on my first trip and now every time I vacation to Arizona I make sure I go to Indian Village MULTIPLE times. I love their tacos and the crunchy shell is amazing and they taste so fresh. I also like their enchiladas. The place is a dive but I often find those are the best places. The service is friendly, Bart, the owner, is wacky but he keeps you entertained while you wait for your food.  I usually browse in the shop attached to the restaurant. I can't wait for my next Arizona vacation so I can go to Indian Village again!!!
