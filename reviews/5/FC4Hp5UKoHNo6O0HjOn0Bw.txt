Love the Biltmore area and went to Blanco for the first time. The two bartenders working did an awesome job. The bartender Grady made my friends and I feel so welcome and ended up sitting at the bar for a few hours. If your looking for a classy place with great food and people hit up Blanco! P.S tacos are amazing!
