There was just something about this place that made lunch amazing. The taco's were great. the HOT salsa was very good. the place was clean. Went for lunch after the rush and it was nice and quiet. Staff was attentive, polite, and the other customers rounded out the Amazing experience. I'll be back the next time I'm that far away from home.  This place is the Nickleback of Mexican Places:) I rate it 5 out of 5 Churros.
