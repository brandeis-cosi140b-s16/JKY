Great food finds a way to distract me from other things like service or atmosphere.  I have been here several times and the food is amazing.  The atmosphere is somewhat non-existent, the building is a little shabby and there isn't much in the decor category and you know what, I don't care.  It's divey, get over it.  But if you want great food unlike anything you find elsewhere, this is the spot.  The service is always great and friendly.  I've not been too many places where they will let you sample the different dishes before you buy them.  I love this because the fusion of Mexican and Asian is unlike anything else and it's great to be able to try it before you commit.  

The ordering system is somewhat unorthodox but the employees are always willing to help you get exactly what you want.  My regular favorite is the jade red chicken, handgrenade chicken in a quesadilla, the black beans and the jerk-fried rice.  The best part is, the perfectly baked snicker doodle cookie they throw in.  

I dont give 5 stars easily but this place is fast, fresh and full of flavor.  For that, they earn my vote.
