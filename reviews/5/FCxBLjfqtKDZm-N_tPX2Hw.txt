Went in for cinco de mayo. Omar was working, with another new bartender, and the service was amazing. 
I was a little bummed they didn't have their normal happy hour menu but ordered chicken enchiladas and they were delicious.
I'm so glad that they not longer employ people who hate their jobs.
I'll definitely be back :)
