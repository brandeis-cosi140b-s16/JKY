Well, I have been to a lot of mexican restaurants in my time.

Casa Ramos, is well towards the top of my list.

The food is excellent. The service is excellent. I just love this place.

Someday, I swear I will try the shrimp dishes, but for the past few years, I just get the basic stuff. You know, enchiladas, etc. I know what I like.

I usually get photo #6 (I think). The cheese enchilada plate and a Bean Tostada on the side.
