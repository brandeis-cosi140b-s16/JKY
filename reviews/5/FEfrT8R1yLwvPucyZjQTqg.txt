Excellent.
A must for Mexican food.
Not fancy decorations, who wants a fancy place when the food is the best ever.
Our waiter, Eeron, was outstanding. He was so helpful and patient. He explained everything and helped us make our decisions. He suggested his favorite, enchiladas. He was right they were awesome!
We got a small dish of cactus, nopales, it was tasty. Kinda like a soft pickles pepper.  A must try. Authentic Mexican food at its very best. 
Come for the fabulous food, leave full and content.
You must go behind a convenience store , that is on university. They are set back from the street.
Words cannot say enough, just go!
