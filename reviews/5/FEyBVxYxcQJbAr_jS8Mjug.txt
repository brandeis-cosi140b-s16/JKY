My wife had the 3 taco combo with 2 asada tacos and a carnitas taco and she said it was good.  I had a al pastor taco and it was excellent hard to get the seasoning right but they nailed it.  The tacos were made with homemade corn tortillas and that's what sent it over the top. Love the elote it was hot and fresh.
