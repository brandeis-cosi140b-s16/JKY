We ate here about 5-6 times on our last visit to Phoenix.  

Amazing well priced food, so fresh and authentic.  The salsas were some of the best we've had!  Drinks were incredible too! 

The service was what really made this a five star.  I think Pedro was the exceptional one in all of our visits.  Thanks so much.

GO here!  you won't be let down.
