Awesome place! I come here all the time. Some of the best rellenos in town. I always get salad instead of rice and beans and the cilantro dressing is to die for. Rice and beans are good too, I just try to eat lower carb. I also enjoy the huevos rancheros Christmas style and the sizzling enchiladas, which are served on top of fajita vegetables with guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo. Most of their portions are big enough to share. They also have a decent selection of draft beers and high-end  tequila. Highly recommended!
