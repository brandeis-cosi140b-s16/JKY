FORGET ABOUT THE PARKING SITUATION! YOU ARE HERE TO EAT REAL MEXICAN FOOD! 

Extremely delicious, this is what AUTHENTIC is like. The moment you step inside, the smell of the grill and the food takes over and transports you to Sonora (or any other state in Mexico you'd like) and its pure magic. 

Prompt service that defies that of other places. Appetizers free of charge: chips and salsa, good salsa btw, and a small cup of frijoles rancheros, which you have to try with crumbled chips and salsa in the mix, makes them spicier and adds more flavor.

Best bets here are their wonderful carne asada torta, quesadillas de carne asada, pollo asado, I havent not liked any of the stuff I have had here. If this place were inside the W per se, it would inspire a chain of restaurants. 

Forget about the location, forget about the parking, forget about the fact that there might be homeless people outside, this is what true food tastes like in Mexico, and us Mexicans are lucky to have this place here in the Valley.
