Finally found a good Mexican place in Vegas! So I tell my husband I want Mexican for dinner and he tells me he found a place his coworker heard about. We get there and we were like what the heck it's Sapphire gentlemen's club! Pretty funny but thank goodness it's separate from the club, just right next door. No glitter found in our tacos :)

Service was great! We sat at the bar and the guy serving us was so friendly and the chef came out to bring us our flan which was free for checking in. He gave us his card and asked us how everything was and said to enjoy his grandmas recipe. It was really creamy and delish, passed the husband test since he's a flan snob :)

We got the Siegal dinner send spicy chipotle tostadas (three big ones for 7.50 a steal) cilantro rice was yum! Also tried the tres leche in addition to flan.  White Sangria and Brazilian wax for drinks!  Thank goodness didn't order another meal b/c the portions are good, would not be able to eat anything else!

Will definitely be regulars.  Was just talking about how there wasn't any good Mexican restaurants in Vegas besides the fast food street taco places, but now I know! What a gem with nice people and good food with decent prices. Leaving full and happy!
