zabas has healthier choices to choose from. i love that brown rice, potatoes and wheat tortilla are included in their menu (unlike chipotle). both places are still so good. i prefer zabas only bc they have more options to choose from. chicken was bomb, bomb. and steak was a little tooo dry for my burrito bowl. chips don't have much of that lime taste that i like in chipotle chips.
