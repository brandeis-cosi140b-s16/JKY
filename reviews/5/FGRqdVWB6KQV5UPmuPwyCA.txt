We dropped by Canonita wanted to grab a quick dinner before going to Tao night club, and this is going to be our MUST stop next time we're in Vegas.
We got Santa Rosa Barbacoa de Puerco and Carne Asada Nortena. Both were AMAZINGLY delicious! I've had quite a fair share of Mexican food, but this was surprisingly delightful. The sweet chipotle BBQ sauce perfectly complimented the Barbacoa. I didn't care much for the cilantro rice and bean though, but the meat was more than enough to satisfy my appetite. Boyfriend was in love with the angus steak, cooked to perfection. His plate was completely empty in 20 minutes.
Our waiter was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu. The food also came out pretty quickly.
