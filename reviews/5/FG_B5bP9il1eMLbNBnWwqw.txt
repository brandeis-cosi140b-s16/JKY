My wife & I had lunch with friends at Border Grill at Mandalay Bay on 8/18/11, and we LOVED the experience! We sat outside, and while a bit warm, provided great views of the lively Mandalay pool area. We ordered the guacamole to start, and it was perfectly done (you'd be surprised how many places screw up guacamole). My wife had the Chicken Panuchos Tacos and I had the Carne Asada Tacos. Both dishes were phenomenal! Our friends were equally enthusiastic about their choices. In addition to the terrific food, our server, Thomas D., was wonderful - checked on us, but wasn't overbearing. We would enthusiastically recommend Border Grill.
