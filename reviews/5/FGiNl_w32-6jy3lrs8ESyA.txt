I can't even begin to to explain how good the food is here! We came a few weeks ago, and my boyfriend wouldn't stop asking when we were coming back. The food is HOT, so be prepared! At the beginning, you get chips with a side of beans, spicy sour cream, red salsa, and green chile salsa... so good! My boyfriend got the Green Chile Plate and it looked and smelled so good. I got the vegetarian plate that comes with a bean taco(totally vegetarian), a cheese enchilada, chile rellano, and rice and beans. You will ALWAYS take food home for leftovers. The service is friendly, they bring your food out on carts, which is kind of weird, but who cares. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you like spicy (New) Mexican food!
