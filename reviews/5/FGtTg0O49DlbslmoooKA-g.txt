The menu is amazing, the food is beyond my expectations, the bartending staff is over the top..! Went up and above making sure we were happy with our Margarita's.  The waitress was really sweet and attentive. We ate at the bar twice during our stay at ARIA because we loved the appetizer (ceviche, salsa & chips) We ate a couple of seafood options and my mind was blown, the food was exceptionally good!. We will be going back the next time we visit. This has made our top 5 for sure!
