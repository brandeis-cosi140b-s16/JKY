Excellent restaurant! Fresh food. 
My wife and I are new to the area and decided to visit this place today for dinner. It just opened and it's our new favorite Mexican restaurant. Staff was great, the place was very clean and the food was fantastic. I hate when people just say things with out knowing the industry. This place is not over price and the portions are very generous. We will back and also tell our friends and neighbors. Keep up the good work.
