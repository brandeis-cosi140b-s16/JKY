Great little "hole in the wall" place.  The atmosphere is laid back and inviting.  The wait staff is fantastic.  The food is authentic and fresh.  The salsa is awesome, not too much heat but if you're looking for that extra kick just ask, they've got it.  My favs are the Chilli Colorado and the Verde or The chimi with the pork carnitas.  This is a definite go to place for my family.
