I love New Mexican Grill.  They have the best carne asada around (in my opinion).  I have ordered many things and all have been delicious:

The carne asada is delicious.  I regularly order the carne asada burrito, which comes with beans, guacamole and pico de gallo inside, but the good news is, those extra ingredients aren't so overwhelming that you are left wondering where's the beef?!  We have also ordered the carne asada street tacos (YUM!) and carne asada quesadilla, also delicious.

The chicken is very flavorful too.  Have ordered the chicken quesadilla kids meal, it was HUGE and my son (who eats more than any adult I know, didn't even finish it-although that may be due to the fact he enjoyed the chips and salsa bar a little too much).

The green chile pork is so good as well.  It's moist and tender and the green chile definitely has a kick to it, helps get those seasonal allergies moving! 

They also make a wonderful chimichanga, which can sometimes be hard to find, even here in Phx.  I know this for a fact because my father who lives in Florida, comes out to visit once a year and we *have* to go to 4-5 Mexican restaurants each visit in search of the perfect chimi.  Now I wouldn't trust his Floridian taste buds, but I make it a point to sample each myself for quality assurance purposes.  We have gone to fancy places, sit down places, casual places, hole in the wall places and this one, so far, has the most flavor machaca and perfectly deep fried tortilla.

Finally, they have a great little chips and salsa bar where you help yourself.  They make 3 types of salsa, regular, hot and a green jalapeno.  I mix all three into a perfect little salsa trifecta.  Their guacamole is excellent too.  As for the rice and beans, I have had both and they were tasty too.  

In conclusion, the prices are good, the food is excellent, the portions are big and I always love supporting local business!
