This taco bell was the epitome of what service should look like!  Clean Environment,  Organized Sauce Packets,  Not Just Friendly BUT Authentically Happy Employees. They have a dedicated wall for thank you notes and another wall stating their motto. It was a pleasant experience that I believe ALL taco bell restaurants should give!
