An epic Del Taco location, no doubt.  I think that I've been to this location on just about all my Vegas trips.  Not sure if it's 24 hour these days or not, but I recall having several late-nite blurry walks to it during my visits to Sam's Town and the Eastside Cannery across the street and a couple of blocks down.

TIPS:  Check out the "other" Welcome To Fabulous Las Vegas sign, as it's right along the way on the rocky highway median from the casino hotels.  Just be alert if you're wasted, as there always seem to be cop cars hanging out in the parking lots around here.  They bust people for jaywalking in this part of town, too.
