Ok, can I say I'm a tough critic so when I say this place is top shelf I mean it! The best fresh margaritas I have ever had. The guacamole is to die for, seasoned perfectly. Chips are crisp and fresh. I had a combo taco enchilada platter, was excellent and my husband had the grilled steak tacos. Flavor was superb. Must go to place in North Scottsdale. We will be back!
