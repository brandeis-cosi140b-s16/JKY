Just returned from 10 days in Las Vegas and wanted to be sure to write up El Segundo Sol for their excellent service. 

Was there for our National Meetings and we closed El Segundo Sol and Stripburger for a few hours on both Saturdays so our Coordinators could enjoy a delicious meal on the Strip.

Hands down, best decision ever. Kori Zornes was fantastic from start to finish in helping us pick our menu and in execution. We had 400 diners both Saturdays and everyone seemed to have an absolute blast. 

The staff were incredibly accomodating and very quick to replenish all food and drinks. Kori and the entire El Segundo Sol staff were amazing and if we find ourselves in Vegas again, it's a no-brainer that we'll use this restaurant again!
