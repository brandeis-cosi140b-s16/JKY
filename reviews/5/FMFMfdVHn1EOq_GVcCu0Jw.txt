People stop ordering TexMex type foods here. This is a "Mexico City" type of restaurant. If your preferred version of Mexican food is enchiladas go elsewhere, better yet, try something new such as the Alambre Tacos or number 15, try the queso suizo appetizer or anything except the pedestrian fair that is at most American Mexican restaurants. This restaurant is much better than it is rated as most of the  poor reviews are for TexMex stuff.
