I had the Carne Asada burrito with guacamole. Since it was from an airport place, I wasn't expecting much, but this was an excellent burrito. The meat was nicely seasoned, and the guacamole tasted home made. Hot sauce had a nice kick. I'll be trying this place next time I'm at Sky Harbor Airport Terminal 4.
