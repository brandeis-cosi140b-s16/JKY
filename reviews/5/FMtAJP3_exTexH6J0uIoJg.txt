The best green chili burrito on this planet.  Went to the old Casa Grande Union High School - graduated in 1979, and ate at this place at least 3-4 times per week. I live in Vegas now, but when I'm in Casa Grande, I have to stop by and get my green chili burrito and cherry sprite fix. Pure heaven. 

Now for the non-initiated. The place is a dive. You can order from the walk-up window or drive up. Since there are cattle feed yards all over Pinal County - there are lots of flies. I don't care where you are in this county - there are tons of flies. So be warned. If you eat at the picnic tables, the flies will find you. Plus, at times, transients from the nearby park wander around, asking for handouts. So, if flies and transients bother you, use the drive up window. But, by all means, if you're in the area - you definitely need to try their green chili burrito's. You will not be disappointed.
