I'm only giving it 5 stars because I'm in love with the food...shh don't tell.  Any who the personality and politeness of the staff could use some work.  I normally go to this one because sometimes it's just easier.  I've never had issues with the staff and the way they have treated me in the past.  So things have been good, I went to this Moe's on Saturday and it was bone dry no one there until I parked then it got crowded.  I went in and they did their normal annoying welcome to moes.  No big deal it's their thing.  Any who I ordered my food, I felt rushed so that was strike 1.  Once I ordered my food the guy who was actually fixing it act as if he was scared to give me the toppings I asked for.  Strike 2, then the manager I guess actually checked me out I asked for a bag to put my stuff in because I did order food for more than just my self.  Well he gave me the bag, I looked at him and thought WOW.  At that point I felt like I was at the self check out in a grocery store.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before, what happened to great customer service? I guess something simple as putting a customers food in a bag is too much work.  I was very upset by this, but I said ok no big I know how to put my stuff in a bag even though it was his job.  The high light of the visit besides how good the food is was the soda machine.  I must say that I'm not a coke fan but will drink a sprite with the best of them when I'm forced.  But this machine was amazing.  I was plesantly surprised about the choices this machine gave.  Like I said I'm not a coke fan, but I stood there for several minutes looking at the choices I had of sprite.  I was impressed by this and the food.  The employees attitudes suck really bad, they need a reality check. If the public is not something you want to deal with on a daily bases, then let me suggest getting a office gig some where.
