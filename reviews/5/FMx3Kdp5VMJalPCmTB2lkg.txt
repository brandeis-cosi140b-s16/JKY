Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing: THE COCONUT MARGARITA!!!!!  I love coconut and tequila but never had the two together until I came here.  A friend told me about it and it was on my "must do" list once I arrived.  It was well worth the anticipation.  FYI - there's a little place inside also called Cabo Wabo.  They do not have it there.  Go outside and to the right to find this place.
