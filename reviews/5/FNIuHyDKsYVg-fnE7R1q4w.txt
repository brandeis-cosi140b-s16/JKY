I love me some tamales from The Tamale Store.  They are absolutely delicious.  We always go and pick up a couple dozen, some to eat while we are here and some to take home to Chicago.  Our favorites are Green Corn and Cream Cheese, Poblano and Cheese, and Chicken and Green Chile.  Don't get me wrong, we love them all but those are our must haves!!  The family that owns the store are very friendly and helpful.  We return time and time again and always get great food!  I wasn't really a tamale fan before having them at The Tamale Store.  Go give them a try, you won't be sorry!
