My husband had been craving tacos. Cheapie little street tacos that remind us of California. We've lived in Arizona 6 years, and never found any that really hit the spot...till now. I found El Nopalito on yelp, less than a mile from my work. Husband met me for "linner" on a Thursday, and the place was empty. We ordered tacos al pastor, tacos de cabeza (for the hubby), a burrito al pastor, rice and beans. Our server told us the al pastor is the most popular, and I can see why. I liked it better in the burrito than in the taco, maybe because you get more flavor from a big bite of just the meat. Husband loved the tacos de cabeza. He said they remind him so much of the ones he used to get from a street vendor in his parents' hometown in Mexico. Rice and beans were great as well. The salsas were good (I like the green more), but the chips were meh. We will definitely be back, to try the rest of the menu. Our server was telling my husband about their huaraches in Spanish. I barely speak any Spanish, but I know that's what I want to try next time!
