"Good food. Good service. Clean and nice."

That was my dad's concise review but I will expand a little. Our family ate at Viva Mercado for our Sunday meal this week. I was most impressed by the service. The waiters and bussers were moving quickly around the room without pause to assist every patron. I always measure a restaurant based on how quickly they refill my water because I drink lots of it, especially with spicy food. I was never left wanting at Viva Mercado, I was continuously checked on and brought water, napkins, more chips, etc. 

The meal comes with chips, salsa, and bean dip, all very tasty. The prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay for this type of food but so worth it for the service and all the little extras you get. My meal was simple, just a chicken quesadilla, but delicious and the chicken was nicely seasoned. 

The meal was followed with a delightful little dessert course of a crisped tortilla with cinnamon sugar, drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. So yummy.
