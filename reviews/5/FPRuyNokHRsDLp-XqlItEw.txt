What a cool authentic setting that greets you upon walking into the outdoor patio filled with over 100 plants.

Lots of open beam wood work gives it a rustic but classy setting.

We had a group of about 15 and the service was very good.  My food was great and as far as I know everyone in our group had a great meal
