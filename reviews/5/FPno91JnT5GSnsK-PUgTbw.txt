They take credit cards now!

Husband went there at one in the morning the other day that's always awesome.

They have cream cheese stuffed churros. Yep that's right. It's not overflowing with cream cheese just subtle and it is awesome.

Last night I had carnitas tacos, guacamole and pico de gallo were already in there, really good. Excited to have an excuse to go get food from here again.

So far from what I've tried it's my preferred late night Mexican. Going to have to get a few more things to confirm.
