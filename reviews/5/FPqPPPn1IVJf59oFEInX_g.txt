One of my favourite Mexican restaurant's in the valley. Great food and a clean looking renovation.

Just be prepared to wait a while till you get served. The place is set up like a fast food joint but it is deceiving. Even when there are not many people waiting the food can take too long. But, for me, it's worth the wait.

Make sure you get the marinated pork tacos. They are selicious  (seriously delicious). All the meat is cooked amazingly so I can't imagine anything being disappointing. The ceviche was suprisingly fresh and tastey too. 2 words... the green sauce is a great addition to any meal here.
