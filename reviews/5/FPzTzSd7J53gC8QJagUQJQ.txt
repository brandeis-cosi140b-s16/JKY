Who knew we could get better tasting Mexican food in the airport than many of the places by our house?!

I had grilled chicken breast tacos (the rice that comes with it is so creamy and was quite possibly sent down from heaven) and my fianc√© has the beef nachos and wouldn't stop raving about the queso. 

Also the sangria rojo is very strong and delicious if you have pre-flight jitters like me!
