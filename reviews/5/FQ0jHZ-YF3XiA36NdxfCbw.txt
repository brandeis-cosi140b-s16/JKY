I live in AZ and every time that I visit Vegas Gorditas is a must! The Gorditas are absolutely AMAZING!  Being from the East Coast and growing up on DR, PR, and Cuban foods I've developed a taste for Flan. Las Gorditas has THEE BEST flan that I've ever had on the Southwest/West Coast.  If you decide to visit try the Mole Gordita and the Flan. Let me know what you think!
