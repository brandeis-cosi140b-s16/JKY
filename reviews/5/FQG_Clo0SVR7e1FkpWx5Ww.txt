Wedding Reception at Border Grill = Awesome

We had our wedding reception at the Border Grill at the Mandalay Bay and it was a blast- great food, great drinks, great service all around good time for everyone. We wanted something hip and new and fun and the Border grill definitely provided that. They also provide a coordinator at no charge to help you plan everything from the menu to decorations to music and anything else you want. We worked with Destiny Hampton and she was amazing. Very attentive and helpful. She definitely knows how to plan parties. All of our guests raved about the food and how much fun they had. I highly recommend this as a wedding reception location in Vegas.
