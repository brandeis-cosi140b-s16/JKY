Simple Menu. Great Food. Burrito, Burrito Bowl, Tacos, or Salad- four meats or vegetarian- ranging from $5.50 -$6.10. Needed something fast before we were picking up our new furniture at nearby Lawrence's; this fit the bill. We came here once before, but my husband didn't like it. This time he liked it!

Choose the meat- chicken, steak, barbacoa (naturally raised beef), carnitas (pork) or vegetarian. Choose the burrito, burrrito bowl, tacos or salad. I really liked my chicken salad. Romaine greens, topped with medium roasted chili-corn salsa, mild- pico de gallo, chipotle chicken, peppers & onions, corn, and shredded cheese and the side of chipotle-honey vinaigrette. There was so much flavor from both salsas and the peppers & onions, that I really didn't put too much additional salad dressing. (You can get it with sour cream and avocado but I thought it was fine.) It was soooo good- I finished it. My husband got the carnitas burrito- he called it a two fister- it's huge, I would probably only eat half. He really enjoyed it. (He got steak the first time, but it was dry so he didn't like it.)

I recently reviewed Baja Fresh as possibly being my favorite Mexican chain restaurant, but I think that I like Chipotle better. There is a kids menu ranging from $2.95-$3.95- quesadillas, taco, or taco kit (they build it- really neat!). Also, maragaritas & beer available ($2.75- $3.50). Sides are chips & salsa, guacamole ($1.50). Free refills on soda. The inside, which is industrial feeling, reminds me of Hash House A Go Go. The staff is fast and friendly, and the inside is very clean.
