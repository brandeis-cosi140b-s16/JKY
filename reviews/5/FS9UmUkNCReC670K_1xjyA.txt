Amazing service & food. I hosted a happy event last Thursday at the main bar and they accommodated us without a reservation. They pushed tables together for us and were very helpful. Tracy was our server and she was WONDERFUL. She worked so hard. We had about 50 guests come in and out for drinks.  She even stayed passed her shift to serve us.  I would definitely recommend this place and go back again!!!
