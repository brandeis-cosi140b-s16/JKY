After trying Juan's, it instantly became one of my favorite restaurants.
The chips, salsa and bean dip they bring before your meal are great. they never let our drinks go empty. the fajitas came out with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream with your choice of homemade flour or corn tortillas. i love fajitas and this place has got some of the best in town.

highly recommend this fine restaurant to anyone!
