We have been eating at Super Burrito for 3 years and stopped by again on the way out of town last weekend. We ordered an Adobada Burrito, which isn't on the menu, but the lady at the counter said no problem. The reason we asked is because the Adobada plate is one of our favorites, the seasoning is perfect and they brown the meat just right. We were so happy with our order that we called back from the road two hours later to say thanks and tell them how yummy it was! We will be going back and we will be asking for another Adoabada burrito por favor! BTW their Carnitas plate is delcious too.
