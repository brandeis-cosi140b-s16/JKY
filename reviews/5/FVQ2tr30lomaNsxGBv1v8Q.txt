I come from a small Arizona town, and while I like several "chain" Mexican food restaurants, I have missed that REAL Mexican food flavor. Here it is, found again, at El Rey Cafe! If you are looking for a fancy place with white tablecloths and china, this is not your restaurant. But if you are looking for friendly service and crazy good food, you've just found it.
So far I've tried and loved the butter chips, salsa, green chile, red chile, and chile relleno.  Looking forward to consuming the rest of the menu soon.
