I've come here since it was a Salsa's on Sardis Road North. A favorite for years and what I always crave when I'm hungry, and miss when I'm out of town. Great service, standard Americanized Mexican food but better than the others who try too hard to make it unique. Simply good quality food that tastes good and makes you feel good.
