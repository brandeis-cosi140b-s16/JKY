Their Chile Rellanos are out of this world, and truly the best that I have had in over 20 years. I chose to have them with beef, and swapped out the rice for black beans, to go along with the re-fried beans. Their salsa is very good, and tastes like a salsa that I used to go to a certain Mexican restsurant in Charlotte many years ago to buy by the container.  Portions are plentiful, service is good, everyone was extremely friendly, and prices are reasonable!  I'm quite sure that you won't be disappointed!
