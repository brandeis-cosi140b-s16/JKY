I am giving this Rubio's 5 stars based on customer service.

The girl who took our order was names Isabella. She was super friendly and helpful. She was patient with us ordering as one person had never been to a Rubio's before and we had a 2 year old running around. She never tried to rush us. She even gave me a coupon for a free churro to save me money on our order. She offered us cups for water while we waited. Then, when they gave us our food to go, everything was exactly as ordered and she even bagged everyone's orders separately so there was no confusion!

By the way, the food was good too! But it was Isabella's customer service that made that meal so nice!
