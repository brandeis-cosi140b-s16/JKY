Man, the Bonita's breakfast burrito is huge!  The Bonita's Big Booty Burrito must need apple bottom jeans! I enjoyed the heck out of my burrito.  The tortilla was soft and filled with eggs, bacon, cheese, potatoes and onions. For $5.55, this was a fantastic deal.  Especially since I will get two meals out of it.    

If you want fancy or absolutely authentic then this isn't the place for you.  If you want quick and tasty food at an affordable price then I suggest you try Bonita's. 

I believe it is owned by Mike Pullano, from Pullano's Pizza, a Glendale landmark! Just another reason to give it a whirl!
