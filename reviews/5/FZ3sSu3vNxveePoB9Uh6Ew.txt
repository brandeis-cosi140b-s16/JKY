After reading reviews on frijoles, I was prepared to be let down, but I was not. The food was delicious and unique for a Mexican grill. I ordered for my family of six two plates of nachos, three full size tacos, a tostada, a dinner size salad, and some street corn. I chose a variety of meats offered including pollo, carnitas, carne asada and lengua. Everything was delicious, but to me the carnitas and the carne asada stood out as being the best. My kids are young but they ate and ate until they were stuffed full. Often it is a challenge to get them to eat, but they loved the food here as did the grownups. I really liked how they were liberal with the guac, cheeses, and pico de gallo. All of it was fresh and awesome. I really should have only had two tacos, but I ate three and sampled everything else I had ordered, but the food being great it was totally worth it being stuffed to the point of discomfort. I had to go on a long and vigorous walk afterward just to not feel like it was a post thanksgiving food coma coming on. The 16 oz. bottle of Mexican coke helped to fuel my journey. The staff let our kids sample the juices, and they raved how good it was. Well done, frijoles! 

Two minor improvements could be made. Ok, first it would have been great to have all of our food come out at once, but they did serve it to us literally hot off the grill, so maybe just do the whole order all at once instead of jumping from order to order. Second, it was bit pricey to make it a replacement for a weeknight dinner on a regular basis. We may have over-ordered, bit it was still about $20 more than dinner at Cafe Rio. That being said, it was delicious and I left really happy :-)
