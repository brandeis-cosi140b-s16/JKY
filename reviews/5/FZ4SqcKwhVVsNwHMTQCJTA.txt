I am a huge fan of La Paz from my days in Atlanta, Ga.  I visited the South Blvd location many times and just experienced the new La Paz restaurant at Metropolitan.  

The food and beverages were awesome as usual and the service was excellent. The dining room is very large and the decor fit the feel perfect. for an enjoyable meal. 

I will be visiting La Paz many more time in the near future.
