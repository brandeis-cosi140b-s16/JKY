Family owned and operated and you can certainly tell.  The food was over the top Delicious and the family atmosphere made it all the better.  I ordered the enchilada with a taco.....perfect!  i can't tell you how many Mexican restaurants I go to that "say" they are authentic and then to be fully disappointed.  You won't find that here...Nope, it's amazing!  Can't wait to go back again!
