In keeping with the traditional Mexican cure for hangovers, I came here for a bowl of menudo Saturday morning.

For you non-menudo eaters, (myself included) I'm not sure how a bowl of cow's stomach is supposed to cure one of those hangovers where you can't bend over to tie your shoes for fear your eyeballs will pop out, but they say it works so I gave it a try.

It didn't work.
It was tasty and all, but I left every bit as hungover as when I went in.

Leading me to believe the real cure for a hangover isn't so much the menudo itself, but rather the idea that you're eating something so disgusting and repulsive, you're just happy to get it over with. Lending to the idea of feeling better afterward.
You don't though. 

Anyway, you've probably eaten things far worse than a bowl of spiced cow innards.... on a Saturday morning...while waiting for the cab to show up.

Not repeating. (either one)
