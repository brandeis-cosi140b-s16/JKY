This place is a bit of a drive for me in the East Valley, but it's worth it.  I used to have a go to taco truck  in Phoenix, but one day it just disappeared and we have been looking for comparable tacos ever since. Finally we found Ta'Carbon.  The only thing it is missing is carnitas, but they do the carne asada and al pastor so well that it makes up for it.  It is also immaculately clean and looks recently remodeled.
