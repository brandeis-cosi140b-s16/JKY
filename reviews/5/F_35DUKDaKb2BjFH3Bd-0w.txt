Great atmosphere, cool design and layout digging the hipster look. The chips and salsa where awesome, salsa had a nice kick and the chips weren't those cheap chips. The highlight of the night was the awesome battered fish taco and shrimp taco and Im not a big fan of seafood, job well done, great flavor with an awesome corn tortilla, also, the carne asada taco was incredibly cooked but i could do without the sweet tasting salsa, however thats just my opinion. Definitely coming back here!
