Everything was excellent about this restaurant. The service was very friendly and helpful. We had a party of 15 and even though it's a small place they moved tables around so that we could all eat together. We ordered a variety of food and everything was delicious! Tacos, menudo, birria, torta, and burritos. We are definitely going to be back here whenever we're in town.
