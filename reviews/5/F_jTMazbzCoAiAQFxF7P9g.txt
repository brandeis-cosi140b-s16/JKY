Straight up, son, we eat here like EVERY WEEK!   The chorizo tostada is on POINT!   The number 5 combo is my favorite it comes with the aforementioned chorizo tostada, a taco, and a bomb enchilada.  Get the green sauce on your enchilada, my ninja.  The cinnamon iced tea is the boom shpoof and i drink like 4 of them mugs before I leave.  Take your posse over and visit with the ultra friendly staff!
