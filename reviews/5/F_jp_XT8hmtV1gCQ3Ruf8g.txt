One of the rare reviews that I'm writing right after eating, and still sitting in the restaurant.  I ordered the Asada Taco plate, three fantastic tacos, good rice and excellent beans.  On top of that I ordered one pollo tamale on the side.  OMG it has been too long since I've had a good tamale.  Even the ice tea is fresh and tasty.  Highly recommend, and definitely worth the drive from south Chandler!
