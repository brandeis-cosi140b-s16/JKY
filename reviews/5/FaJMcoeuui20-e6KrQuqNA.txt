I am really confused reading these reviews.

I just moved here from Tempe. I'm used to pretty shitty service at Filiberto's so I didn't really have high hopes for this one. 

I've been to this Filiberto's twice.. and I love it. Maybe I just have beginner's luck? For one, this is the first one I've been to where they actually repeat my order back to me at the drive thru. Plus I an actually understand them over the speaker - the Filibertos restaurants I'm used to usually have really bad speakers. The employees I've interacted with have been really friendly. 

The food isn't the most amazing ever. It's just like any other Filiberto's. Standard fare. 

We'll see how my next two visits go..
