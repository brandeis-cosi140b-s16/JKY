Another Charlotte favorite is Salsarita's... specifically for the shrimp burrito. I don't know of another fast food/quick food burrito place that offers shrimp. Do you? If so, post a reply and let me know asap! Although the line was crazy long and slow... granted it was a weekday around lunchtime, the food was good and inexpensive. I'm a Chipotle girl all day but again... for a shrimp burrito... two thumbs up for Salsarita's.
