Certainly a diamond in the ruff. Everything i've had on their menu has been authentically super duper good! Not your typical greasy mess, I actually don't feel bad after eating here. The free chips and salsa they serve are bomb; chile relleno, camarones el diablo, and tortas are some of the best I've had in the valley. Try it out!!!!
