My family stopped here on a Friday afternoon during our vacation. It wasn't busy at all so our experience was a quiet one. 
The atmosphere was beautiful inside and out!  If it hadn't been for the fact that it reached record high temps that day, we would've eaten outside. We were able to sit at a table right next to the pond and it was really fun to watch the ducks and turtles swim. 
We were greeted and seated immediately, and our waiter was very attentive. My hubby and I both had the Pollo Fundido and is was soooo good!  The quality of the chicken was excellent!
It was also a fun little town to walk around after lunch. Next time we are in AZ we will be back!
