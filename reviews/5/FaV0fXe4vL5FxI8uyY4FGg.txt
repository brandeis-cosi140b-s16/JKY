Awesome taco plate! I always get the shredded beef tacos...one crunchy, one soft with Spanish rice and black beans. So dang yummy your head will spin! Lots of eye candy for both men AND women here too...ASU hottie's frequent this spot. When we are done eating we pop out the door take a right and hit up the candy shop next door for dark chocolate w almonds! A perfect meal
