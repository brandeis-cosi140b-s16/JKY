Absolutely the best "quick and dirty" mexican food place in Tempe.  The only other place I consider going is Los Favoritos, which is also very good.  But it telling you, not much beats Texanos california burrito, any of their combo plates, or their nachos.  Stay as far away from Fillibertos and run right across the street.  You wont be disappointed.  Also they have this creamy green salsa that is so spicy and amazingly good.
