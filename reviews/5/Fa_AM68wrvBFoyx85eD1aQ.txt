I live in LA and am SO EXCITED that "Carlos" has opened a new location that I can stop off in on my way to visit family in Phoenix.  Their food is one of the things I look forward to most when I get back to Arizona, even if it's only a few times a year - I can't visit without getting a #13 combination to go.
