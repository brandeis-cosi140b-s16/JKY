Let me start out by saying this place is awesome! I have been looking for a good Mexican place for awhile and I have to say as a fan of Mexican food that is my new favorite place to go. The Ambience is amazing and makes you feel like you are in a Cantina in Mexico. And you will absolutely love their delicious and exotic Margarita selection. I started out with a blended mango margarita and was eventually steered by our awesome and extremely friendly waiter to walk on the wild side and try their jalape√±o margarita which was fabulous. As for their food it was not only delicious and authentic but beautiful in presentation and extremely fresh. I highly recommend their homemade guacamole it was some of the tastiest I have ever had. Our awesome waiter recommended the special a fajita bomba which my wife had and it was amazing topped with guacamole , and sour creme. I had the enchilada suizas   And they were some of the best I ever had. My daughter had the carne asada steak and they marinate it something that makes it taste like heaven. For desert I was recommended to try their homemade orange and cream cheese flan and it was absolute heaven. We found our place and I will be returning next week to bring my mother in law here for her birthday. I highly recommend this place if you are a lover of Mexican food.b
