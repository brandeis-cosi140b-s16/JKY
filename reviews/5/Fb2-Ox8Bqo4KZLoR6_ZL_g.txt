I stopped in after seeing the reviews on yelp and was not disappointed.  I've always been a fan of these no frills local Mexican places. I had the Lazaro burrito and it was fantastic.  The carne asada was very flavorful and there were three or four full size shrimp, the pollo was there but seemed overshadowed by the other flavors. I would agree with some of the other reviews that there wasn't a lot of heat but the salsas were good and I added as desired each bite. The chips and queso were also great, the chips were definitely homemade and fresh. The queso also seemed to be homemade and had just the right amount of chiles or jalape√±os in it to be flavorful without being overpowering.
