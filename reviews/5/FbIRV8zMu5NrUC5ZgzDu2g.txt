I drive by all the time and finally stopped to see what it was all about. I was not disappointed! This is the best mid level Mexican food that I have had in a long time. I got the grilled chicken burrito chips and hot salsa all of which were very flavorful, but not over the top. Oh yeah, the tortillas are really good too!
