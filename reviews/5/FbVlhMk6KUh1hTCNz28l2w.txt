I went to Mundo for the first time the other night completely skeptical.  My friend had talked this place up so much that I was looking for any small chink in the service.  Lets just say that the food and service exceeded all of my expectations. 

When i walked in and sat at the bar i ordered a kettle and tonic.  The tonic was out of the gun but when i asked the bartender if he had any bottled tonic he was more then happy to locate a bottle that he had tucked away and the drink was a very fair pour.   

At dinner i ordered the prime  fillet.  OMG, it was the perfect temperature.  seared nicely on either side and cooked to a perfect medium rare with hints of red chili.  The green tomatillo sauce and chili sauce were an excellent accompaniment to the steak.   

The service was spot on and we did not want for drink nor food.  The atmosphere is trendy hip decor and every dish was thoughtfully prepared with attention to detail.   

I would recommend this place anytime for any occasion.  Thank you Mundo, the pleasure was all mine.
