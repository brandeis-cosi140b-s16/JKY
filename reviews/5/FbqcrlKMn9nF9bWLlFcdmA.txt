I stopped in to check this place out of curiosity and damn I'm glad I did! They did a great job making this place look modern yet relaxed at the same time! I had a veggie breakfast burrito and French fries instead of ranch, Delish! U never know what to trust with veggie dishes, sometimes u end up with hardly anything filling but this place did great! Plus the blonde bartender had quite the bod and some cheesy jokes  adorable. I will absolutely be coming back, worth the stop!
