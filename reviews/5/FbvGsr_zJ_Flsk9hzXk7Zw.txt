I disagree with the dated critical reviews others have written on this restaurant.  My husband, friends and I recently visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon before our flight.  The restaurant was clean and uncrowded.  

The house margaritas we ordered were delicious, generously sized, served in shakers, and left us all delightfully buzzed so we could better tolerate the oppressive coach seating  on our transcontinental flight.  

The waitress informed us the restaurant only pours Cuervo because the company that owns Jose Cuervo also owns the restaurant. 

Everyone in our group commented on how much they enjoyed their food.  My husband loved the crab cakes he was served.  The carnitas quesadilla I ordered was incredibly good.

Each person in our group was pleasantly surprised with the superior quality of the food and drink we were served. Such high caliber and tasty offerings are a welcome relief from the bland fare usually served at most airport restaurants. 

I look forward to visiting this restaurant again the next time I travel to Charlotte. .
