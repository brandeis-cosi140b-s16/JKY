One Word.....AMAZING!!!  Phenomenal food, amazing service, wonderful ambiance!! A HUGE shout out to our server Reina!  She is amazing.  

The only complaint I had was the butt heads next to our table, but that is not the fault of the restaurant.  As a matter of fact, they moved us and let us keep our AMAZING server.  This may be my new, favorite place!
