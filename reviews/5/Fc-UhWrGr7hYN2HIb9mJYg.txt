Wow! This place is a hidden treasure. Seen it here for while and decided to stop in for their happy hour. Beers $1 off and all soft tacos (except for shrimp) are $1.25.  I ended up having the fish, potato and pork tacos. Loved the potato, pork was damn good as well but fish was ok. Not bad by any means but just ok. The restaurant side was wicked hot, I know it's hot outside too but maybe the air conditioning was out that day!?! No worries, the bar side was dark and cool.  Enjoyed a few beers with my tacos. Overall nice experience and some great food. Will be back for sure.
