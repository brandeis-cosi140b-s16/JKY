We were in town from Arizona and in the mood for Mexican food.  We decided to try Aranda's although we expected to be disappointed.  Wow were we wrong.  We love good Mexican food and Aranda's has some of the best we have ever eaten.  My wife had the three chicken enchilada combination.  The chicken was moist and the sauce excellent.  I had a steak and shrimp dish.  It was also great.  If we are in the area we will return.
