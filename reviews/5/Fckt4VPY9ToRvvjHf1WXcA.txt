I am a big fan of Don Pedro's  The last time I went there my service was excellent and the food was great.  Here they have two different kinds of salsa for the chips.  One is a normal salsa and the other is kind of like a Salsa-slaw.  There is a boy that comes around and offers to make fresh guacamole.  We never get that because my fianc√©e normally goes for the Queso dip.  

They have Victoria Beer there but it is not on the menu.  

I asked for an Arbol Chili sauce and they had some!  I was pretty impressed by that and that's why I am giving 5 stars.  The Arbol Chili sauce is hot so if you want to impress your friends you should get it!
