I love this place, it's right down the street from my work so I eat here often. Every single employee is super friendly to me and the food is great.  
The breakfast burritos are to die for delicious, big chunks of crispy, meaty  bacon, no bacon fat. 
I also love the Carne Asada and chicken burritos, the Came Asada is always grilled perfectly and the chicken is stewed in a tomato based sauce. The Enchilada plate is pretty amazing as well and you can't beat the convenience of the drive through.
