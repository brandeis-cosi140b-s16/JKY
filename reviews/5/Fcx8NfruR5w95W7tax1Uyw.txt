Fast, Friendly, Decent Price, Fresh Ingredients- made when you order, kinda weird location.
I for some reason am now trying to figure out where my neighborhood taco stand is, and am judging them on their chili relleno burritos...everyone seems to put their own twist on them and you can tell what they are like by that.
At least I think so anyway.
These guys are different than the last place I went cause for 
1. They are located INSIDE of the mini market of a Gas Station- so the ambiance is a little awkward being that you are next to the "husbands-in-the-doghouse" gift section that most circle K stores have..while you are eating.
2.they made their Chili Relleno Burrito with lots of cilantro and fresco salsa, Monterrey jack stuffed peppers, no beans or rice or lettuce and a tiny bit of hot sauce (tapitio I think) and it worked! It was Fantastic.
If you go there you will find ample parking, their hours are regular, and it's pretty much standard for a taco shop to have plastic chairs and tables.
But not the rest of the inside of a gas station, but I am still going to call that a plus for an unusual dining experience heh..
