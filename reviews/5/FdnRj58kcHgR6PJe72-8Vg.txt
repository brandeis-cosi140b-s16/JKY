A Sunday family luncheon took me to Popo's Fiesta Del Sol - Maryvale (6542 West Indian School Road, Phoenix, AZ 85033). While waiting for our food to be prepared, my family enjoyed the toasty corn chips and lively salsa. An avid fan of comfort food soups, I ordered the highly recommended menudo, which came with a choice of flour or corn tortillas. The spicy, red soup was loaded with delicious hominy and tender meat and was made complete by adding the provided garnishes of oregano and fresh cilantro and onion. (Note- The menudo was listed on the menu as being available only on Saturday and Sunday.) The affordably-priced food was delivered in a timely manner and piping hot. Ample parking was available on both the front and back lots. The facilities were clean, and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
