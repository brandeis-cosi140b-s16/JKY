El Sol has amazing food. The Pollo Asado grilled chicken burrito is one of the highest quality burritos in town. Their Chorizo, Potato and Egg burrito is also excellent. The bakery pastries are great. They are closed Mondays. If you like El Zocalo in Downtown Chandler or Mango's in Downtown Mesa, this place is owned and operated by the same family.

Pro Tip: You can get a large container of their fresh salsa at the Sam's Club south of the restaurant on Arizona Ave and the 202.
