I was so excited when a Chipotle FINALLY opened up in Matthews, NC, because I recently moved here from Maryland. It doesn't compare to the Chipotle up in College Park next to the University of Maryland where they give a bigger portion, but Chipotle food is always great. I always get my favorite: Barbacoa burrito bowl with pretty much everything in it. They also have burritos and fajitas. Sides of chips with salsa too. 
This is a MUST TRY restaurant.
