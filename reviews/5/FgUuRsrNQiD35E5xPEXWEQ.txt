Of course the service and food are always amazing. HOWEVER, I write this review as a question to the owner directly. As a QSR (local sub shop with similar values in fresh food and quality service) owner myself, I understand that at least 70 percent of all transactions are made with credit cards. I am always looking for new ways to reward my employees for their hard work at no additional or minimal cost to my overall bottom line. With that being said WHY can I as a customer not reward the high quality level of service that I have consistently received from the staff and them not get opportunity for more pay, ALL at no cost for you! Employee retention is where it begins. Keep up the hard work!! You guys rock and I spread the word whenever I can! Let me reward them please!!!!
