Stopped in to grab dinner with a few friends.  I got the Americanos tacos with shredded chicken and they were amazing.  I'm not big on spicy food, which they were not, but even without spice the shredded chicken was so flavorful. 

This place is close to my work, so I foresee many repeat visits in the future.
