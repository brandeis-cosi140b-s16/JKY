This isn't my first time here at Tacos El Gordo and it definitely isn't my last.

This one in particular, is at the end of the strip, near circus circus and encore. I love Tacos El Gordo and I personally have not had any tacos better than this place. 

The special here is the Adobada (spicy pork) tacos. The server cuts the meat from a rotating pig that makes you just want to drool when looking at it. The tacos are constructed so quickly and I have been to vegas many times to notice the same exact server!

I also always order the Large Adobada Fries which can feed around 5 people. It is a whirlwind of flavor with a special green "crack" sauce that is so unbelievably good I cannot describe it any other way.

The tacos are about $2 each with the large fries being $10. For vegas, this is great, cheap food. I would order 3-4 tacos and split the fries with friends.
