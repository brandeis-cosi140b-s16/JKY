Miguel's tacos are so yummy. The food is fresh. The pico is awesome with a little bite of spice. They now have flour tacos! The price is super reasonable. Try the homemade Horchata! 
There's street tacos and then there's the ones from this location. I seriously need them each week. That's not a joke. I wish Miguel made his pico for sale because I would use it at home. Yes. It's that good. 
The chicken and steak tacos are some of the best I have had in the valley. Gabriella (one of the awesome people who work there) told me that they marinate the meat to make sure it's as tasty as possible. 
When you drive by them, no matter the time of day, there are always people in line. That says a lot when you look around and see who their neighbors are in the area who also have tacos on their menus.
