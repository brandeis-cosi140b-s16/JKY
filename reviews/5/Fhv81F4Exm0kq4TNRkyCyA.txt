I will start this review by saying the name is very appropriate. This place is hidden. There is no sign on anything. After circling the parking lot a few times we finally called and we found it it was right next to the ace harware. As we walked in, I was instantly impressed. A very small spot where the bar doubles as the kitchen. The wood fired grill makes the whole place smell good and gives it the cozy vibe. They play great music, make strong drinks and have amazing food. I have ordered a bunch of different items and they all are great. I reccomend going with enchiladas  or pretty much anything on the menu. Beware though as the food always comes out extremely hot. Also, get there early as this place is tiny and fills up fast. The food is worth the wait for sure though. It also appears that they have a pretty good happy hour.
