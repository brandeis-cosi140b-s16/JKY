I took my husband to C4 this week and we enjoyed some dinner and drinks.  The food and space were a solid four stars.  For appetizers we shared Chips & 3 Dips, Tres Queso Quesidilla and then I had the Veggie & Tortilla Soup while he had a House Salad for entrees.  I think we both agreed next time we might just get appetizers, drinks and dessert.

Here is the part that really bumped it up to 5 stars... "Sunsets at the Clarendon"!    Lounging on the rooftop patio with a Margarita in hand, listening to a great DJ, looking out over the city and watching the sun set.  Lovely!  We'll be sure to come back, and bring friends.
