The food at this place is on point. It's pretty new but I've already eaten here several times. Everything is very tasty and prepared fresh. It's a la carte style and you are able to try multiple things for a decent price. The owners came and asked our opinion on both visits, which I thought was nice.
I'll definitely be going back. My advice would be to save room for the dulce de Leche crepes.  They are on point.
