Love this place! Ok not authentic but they try! The prices are really reasonable and the portions were on the larger side. Everyone we came across from the bartender to the bussers were super nice. We got a whole margarita pitcher, 3 entrees and 2 appetizers for $60 some odd dollars. Well worth it! They also have a salsa bar you can graze over!
