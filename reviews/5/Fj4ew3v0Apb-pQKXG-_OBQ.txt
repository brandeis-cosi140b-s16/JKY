I've been coming here for YEARS and just thought to review it?  WTF is wrong with me???????????????????????
THIS is Mexican seafood.  I've been to other places and nothing compares!  I take a book, sit in back and people watch while creaming my "Make Me Yelp" panties as I eat my culichi.  It's D I V I N E!  Eat the shrimp with a fork but you sure as Hell better use a spoon to destroy the rest of the bowl and leave it clean!
Everything is fresh and the wait staff is loaded with recommendations.  Ask, and ye shall find. 
The snapper Veracruz is so good I often order 2 and take one home.  
The decor is fun - aquatic scenes that won't make you feel guilty for eating the seafood in front of you.  
At Xmas they had a Santa at the door!  The people here a super-friendly!  
They have their own parking lot.  You know it's a good place when yours isn't the fanciest car in the parking lot.  All kinds come here, despite the neighborhood not being the nicest in DoPho.  You can't miss it - even though I do pass it every time!  I think I'm too excited thinking of the shrimp culichi and my mouth is watering so much that I always manage to say "Crap, passed it again!"
Go.  Just go to this place.  You won't be disappointed.  I swear.  And, you won't break the bank.
