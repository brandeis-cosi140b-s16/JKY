AWESOME PLACE!! they have great food great prices and wonderful customer service I have ordered a couple times from them and I am very pleased the food is delivered hot and fast. I ordered tonight online at Eat24 and it was late so the delivery date defaulted for tomorrow, they called me to confirm if that was correct when I told them no I its for tonight, they said no problem and they still deliver to me after their closing time. What great people and the delivery guy had a smile on his face. I have found a new place to eat with a big variety & super yumny food. Highly recommended!
