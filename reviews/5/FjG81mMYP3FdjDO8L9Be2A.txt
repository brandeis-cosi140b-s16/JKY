I'm a sucker for good service.  When you walk in this chipotle, the staff look up, making eye contact with you and say "Hello".  From the very beginning I feel welcome and comfortable which is always nice when I am ready to dine out. 

The steak burrito I enjoyed had a little kick to it which was nice.  I'm not a huge spice fan or can even tolerate spicy food but this was different.  

With great service coupled with great food, I'll return sooner than later.
