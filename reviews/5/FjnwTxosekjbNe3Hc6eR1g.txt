This hole in the wall mexican restaurant has been around for years! Authentic mexican food is delish!! Breakfast plates are all soo good! Especially their all you can eat menudo or pozole! I love their stuffed green chile shredded beef chilaca style for appetizer mmmm!!! Can't go wrong with any chimichangas!!! My fav is the 2 green chile shredded beef enchiladas with rice n beans. Rice isn't red though but it is still delish! All their soups are amazing. As for dinner the carne asada plate and mixed fajitas are money!
