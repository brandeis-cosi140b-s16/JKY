1.)  5 Star, hand-made tortillas to order.  Ordered myself two extra just for the texture and flavor.
2.)  All the meats are ridiculously tender and spiced to absolute perfection.  I preferred the Lengua and Chicharrones Verde for tacos and the Barbacoa for the burrito.  
To be honest, I couldn't get enough, and the fact that the Abolitas were behind the counter making everything by hand.  I live in Summerlin and was happy to drive my way all the way over to the East side.
