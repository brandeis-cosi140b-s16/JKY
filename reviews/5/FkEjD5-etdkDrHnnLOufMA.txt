Coming from someone who ALWAYS goes with what is safe, which is chicken, I am definitely starting to try different things I normally would say NO! But oh my, this al pastor has stolen my heart.. love at first bite! This place is LIFE & I'm so upset I did not try it sooner considering I know one of the owners. Please TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK! These tacos are addicting. I went here 3 days in a row last week after trying the al pastor smh I have a problem. & the guacamole!! I do NOT like avacados... wow this place has me in LOVE with all the things I never cared for too much.
