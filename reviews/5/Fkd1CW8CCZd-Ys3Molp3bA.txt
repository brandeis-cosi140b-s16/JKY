Please check this place out! The food is excellent; fresh and full of flavor. The servers are helpful and kind, super nice to kids and when I went there on my birthday they presented me with a muffin and candle! Prices are on the low side, when I told my kids we were going to the "restaurant next to Woodmans" they got super excited, they love the chimichangas which are delicious but only an occasional treat for our family :) Hope they stay in business. 
Oh, and they have a beautiful mural!
