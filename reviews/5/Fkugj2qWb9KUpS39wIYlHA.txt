The first time I visited Scottsdale in the spring of 1990, my cousin took me to this Aho Al's, and I have been hooked ever since.  Every time I come back to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I make it part of my ritual to find the closest Aho Al's to partake of their delicious cuisine.  Is it authentic Mexican food?  Probably not.  But my wife grew up in southern Colorado and she swears the green chili relleno here is as good as it gets.  Even though we have a fairly decent sized Hispanic population in the Kansas City area, so far none of the so-called Mexican restaurants that we have tried have measured up.

I normally get a chicken chimichanga, but this time I opted for seafood enchiladas with shrimp.   I was not disappointed.  For my wife, the green chili relleno - and on this trip, no heart-burn after the fact.  She loved it, as always.  One thing that can often be overlooked and understated are the free corn tortilla chips they serve you after you are seated at your table.  Their salsa is okay, but their tortilla chips are the best restaurant chips I have ever had, period.  I have to watch myself so as not to ruin my appetite by gorging on the chips before my meal arrives.  

Service was great, as usual.  Prices are reasonable.

Overall, this trip, as all the others, was excellent.  Needless to say, next time we come to the area, we'll be checking out Aho Al's again, whatever the location.
