This is the best place to get homemade Mexican food in Scottsdale!!! The machaca was insane!! It melts in your mouth and has just the right amount of spice. The owners were so sweet and nice!!! Don't listen to these people who gave bad reviews.  I swear you'll
go and love it!!!  They probably think taco bell is good mexican :P
