I think I can finally call off the hunt for the delish type of Mexican food I miss from home in Texas.  Simple menu, good prices and freshly made food that left us wanting more.  

Our party of three ordered the beef chimi, the cheese enchiladas (no sauce) and the green chicken enchiladas.  At first we'd planned to order our dinner to go - that is until we laid our eyes on the salsa.  So many places just totally lack a good salsa, but this one looked bright and fresh.  It was delicious!  Vibrant and with a little kick, the mild salsa hit the spot.  And the self serve chips were perfect for our table.

The food arrived just in time as we finished up our salsa and chips, and it couldn't have looked more inviting!  We tucked in right away.  There was no conversation - this food was too good for talking!  

The place is cozy with only a few tables, but was still comfortable.  Plenty of folks came in and out for take out orders.  Each and every customer was greeted by a friendly guy, and the nifty credit card system even allowed for an emailed receipt instead of printing one out.  Great place that I will absolutely be trying again and again.
