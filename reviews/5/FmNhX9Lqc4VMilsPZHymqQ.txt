We just returned from Cilantro.  What a treat!

This is the type of restaurant you would expect to see in downtown Madison (or Chicago).  Fortunately, the Rick Bayless-trained chef has landed on the west side with such a fine restaurant.  

We were thrilled with the experience. The ceviche appetizer was bright and fresh, the spring green and beet salad was perfectly dressed with a lime vinaigrette, the entrée crab cakes were packed with crab, and the enchiladas pescado included fresh fish wrapped in scratch-made corn tortillas and a slightly spicey poblano sauce.  Each dish delicately balanced fresh ingredients and the flavors from Mexico.  Desserts are made on location and the tres leches and caramel flan were as impressive as the appetizers and entrées.  

All of this was enhanced by the vibrant artwork, pulse of international music, and translucent window coverings of azure blue and deep magenta.

This is not Tex-Mex, thank goodness!  It is authentic Mexican food and excellent. Finally, Madison has fresh, made-from-scratch Mexican food!
