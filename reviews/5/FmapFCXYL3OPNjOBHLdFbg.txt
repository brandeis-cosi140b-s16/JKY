I almost went to chipotle but this place is right next to my bank that I was also visiting so I figured I'd try it. I'm impressed and not easily so. Employees were super nice, helpful and really friendly. The restaurant looks immaculately clean and my salad tastes great! (Try the pork!) Yum!  I'll be back!
