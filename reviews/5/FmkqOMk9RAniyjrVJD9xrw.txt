My wife and I stopped in for an early dinner on Father's Day and were glad we did!  Loved the casual vibe and I'm sure when they open up the windows (too hot in June so they were closed) it's an even more perfect atmosphere for tacos and margs.  Speaking of margs I'm not a huge fan but I had a sip of my wife's blood orange marg and it was ridiculously good.  The street corn was right up there with the best I've had and we loved the braised beef taco (we also shared the crispy fish and the standard which were good but the beef was by far our fav).    

Can't wait to go back for taco tuesday!
