I have been going to Rio Rico's for years! Maria and her family do a great job of offering up some fantastic food at very very reasonable prices. The Verde green chili is very good as well as many of the other dishes

Another cool part of this restaurant is the fact that it's not a one hour wait on a Friday or Saturday night. All-around great food great prices!
