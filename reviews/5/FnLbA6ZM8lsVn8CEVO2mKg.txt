Stopped in here for a quick bite while in the area. I was immediately greeted by a very friendly cashier who took my order and made me feel at home with some small chit chat. The food was delicious, I has the ham sandwich; this masterpiece came loaded with many of my favorite ingredients: ham, cheddar, american, lettuce tomato, avocado, and just the right amount of pickled jalape√±os. On the side I was served a ketchup bottle filled with a house chipotle dressing which took each bite to another level. 

My melon agua fresca was made to order and was not loaded with sugar like others i've had. Food was great and their friendliness was just an added bonus! I am anxious to return and try some more!
