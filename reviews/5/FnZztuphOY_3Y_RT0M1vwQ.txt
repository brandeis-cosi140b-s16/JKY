I'm an East Side kind of guy and am one of those people who cross 1-17 maybe 3 or 4 times a year aside from a California road trip. I was tasked with finding some breakfast burrios for about 12 people on a Saturday morning at Westgate and Mr. Leno was the closest place that had good reviews, so I went way out of the way to try these guys out and take a risk, but Yelp has never steered me wrong! 

They were open early on a Saturday so that was a good sign, and they had a few breakfast burritos to chose from, also a good sign. Ordered a few different types including a non meat one for a veggie loving friend. While the cooks were building my burritos I took to the fresh salsa bar and loaded up on what I thought was a bunch of mild and medium salsas for everyone. Turns out everyone thought they were spicy which is perfect for me! 

Well I came back, everyone expected some Wendy's bs, but I handed them a Yelp sourced burrito that everyone loved. Almost everyone wanted to know where they came from and all thought it tasted great. 

So there you have it folks, if your in a 5-8 mile distance from this place, craving Mexican food and Mr Leno pops up, give it a go because chances are you won't find anything else this good without driving another 20 minutes. 

As far as interior, it's your typical taco shop, don't bring your date here, grab your date some food here and watch a netflix movie at home!
