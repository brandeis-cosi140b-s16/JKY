For midnight snacks, Mad Mex is about as good as it gets.  This new location on Highland is spacious and doesn't make you feel like you're dining at the same table as the 12 people in your immediate vicinity.  It has all the perks of the "traditional" Oakland location -- interesting beers, tasty flavored margaritas, great food, fun waitstaff -- without the ridiculous waits and high temperatures.  The parking is also somewhat better, since you're not competing with the eight-to-a-house Pitt undergrads in Oakland.
