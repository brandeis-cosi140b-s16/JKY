This is fast food.... That being said, it is very best fast food I have ever had. The staff was very friendly and the food was outstanding. Meat was slow cooked and tender. All food was very fresh. Sauces were original and flavorful. I signed up for yelp just to review this restaurant. It is excellent and worth a try. Meals were very inexpensive. About $6.95 filled me up and was the quality if a $16 meal.
