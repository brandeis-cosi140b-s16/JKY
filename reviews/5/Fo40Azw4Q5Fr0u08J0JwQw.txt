I recently visited for happy hour and I will be back whenever I'm in the area! The happy hour prices can't be beat! $4 house margaritas were just right and big! The food prices vary depending on the hour. We just made it before 4pm so our food was only $3! At 4pm it goes up to $4 and at 5pm it goes up to $5 which is still an awesome deal! The enchiladas were great! It comes with 2 normal size enchiladas and a little salad garnish. We mixed a chicken and cheese and the sauce was super yummy! I grew up in Southern California so I know my Mexican food. The chips and salsa were some of the best I've had. I may have gotten one semi-stale chip out of the huge bowl I ate. We also had a cheese crisp (which they don't have in CA) and although those are always a little plain for me normally, that excellent salsa slathered on there made it AWESOME! The bartender was cool and chatted with us as did a woman at the bar eating alone and one of the regulars was also very friendly. The bar is small, however, so I almost hate to let the word get out on this hidden gem because you better make room for me when I come back. The outdoor patio looked super fun & colorful to hang out on when the weather cools down. I enjoyed the ambiance of the whole place! I had intended on trying a chili relleno but I was too full on the happy hour bargains. I asked the bartender if there was chicken in it like one reviewer said and he said no. Everything we had was so good that I have no doubts the rest of the food is good. I can't wait to come back!
