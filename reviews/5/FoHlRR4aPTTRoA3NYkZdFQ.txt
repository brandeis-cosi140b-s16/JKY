This is a happy hour review.

This one is easy. We have been here for happy hour once a week since it opened. We bring friends here. We bring family here. We bring work here. We call it Juan Yummies now... We are addicted. 

Something like 100 tequilas to choose from. The host/owner (Andy?) know his tequila... ask him for a recommendation. We have actually started keeping track of our favorite teq's and he can make suggestions based on what YOU like and suddenly you know what to look for in taste and body. I hope this does not turn me into a teq snob.

Average patio (couple too many kids for our liking), sexy cute servers (love Jamie), and fast bartending.

Foodwise, you can choose your meat in all the traditional dishes and it's been fun to work through the choices. I like the carnitas and for god's sake get some ground beef in a hard shell... Who knew?  Also love the taco sauce at the salsa bar... kinda like the little taco bell packets, only tasty... if that makes sense. 

Yeah we can walk to Yummies and the prices are a little Scottsdaley, but dang it's good and you can eat and sip a nice teq for under $25 including a XX on tap during happy hour.

Take the drive. Mmmm.
