We have been visiting this restaurant for years. We love the consistency of the food and the friendliness of the staff. As the economy recovers this place is super busy. We visited on a Friday night and there was a 25 minute wait. However, we got into the bar and there were two seats at the bar that were separate. Their customer service was fabulous in the fact that they moved the other barstool down next to the one so they were together and asked everyone to scoot down. How cool is that. The customers were really nice and the fact that they didn't mind moving down. I always have the chili Relleno with rice and beans and my husband has steak fajitas. They are really really good and it's always consistently good every time we go. This is one of our favorite local Mexican restaurants that we visit about every month. We will continue to come back!
