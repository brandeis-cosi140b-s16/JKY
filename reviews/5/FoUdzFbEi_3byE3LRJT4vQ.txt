I realllly loved this place!! The whole family went and we each ordered the three tacos for $5 and some change, the chips and salsa $2.95, and we also got their flavored lemonade. We got the fish tacos, carne asada, pork, chicken, and chicken feta tacos....we all loved them and the problem was not being able to finish them. We could only eat two and ended up eating the other one later. I got mine without the cabbage and was pleased that I did because it would have been too much. I love that they put rice and beans in their tacos because this is how we do it at home. The lemonade was so delicious...I had the pomagranite and I was wishing they had free refills. The chips and salsa was very good as well and they give you plenty of salsa.

The place is adorable and they folks that work there were friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to get. I will be back to this place and also want everyone to check them!!
