Yelp is my go too when I am looking for a place to eat or to get an idea of what to expect at a certain place, I've turned to Yelp for years but never signed up until now. Menuderia Guanajuato has made me want to write a review! This place is amazing. I came across it on Yelp. My co workers and I are always looking for something to eat since we are limited to places near our work area. Let me tell you, this isnt close and it takes us our whole lunch time to travel, pick up our food, and get back, but so worth it!.
The menudo is amazing! This is true authentic Mexican food. The corn tortillas are hand made! The masa for the sopes and gorditas too! You can smell and taste the fresh corn masa when you are biting into them. The red chicken enchiladas are bomb! The chilaquilles, the mole, the rice! Everything I have ordered has been delish! Beware, the read salsa is stright poison! LOL. I had tears rolling down my eyes and a runny nose the whole time I was eating but couldnt stop being as it was so good. I would truly recommend this spot. Dont expect anything fancy, it's a small little house turned into a resturant, bright lime green with limited parking...but oh so worth it!
