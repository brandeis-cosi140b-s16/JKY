International House of Food is as legit as they come. I can't be more thankful that this place is within walking distance of my house as every time I've eaten here the food has been delicious. I've yet to try the Chinese options, but all of the American diner-style food has never left me anything but satisfied. 

The true stars of the menu thus far, however, have been the Mexican options. For my most recent visit I had the huaraches with the al pastor meat. Numerous flavors and an adequate amount of food make this a darn near perfect dish. 

There's a sick mural inside, it's a small operation run by genuine people, and it's a neighborhood spot, so I'd encourage anyone and everyone to give them a shot because businesses like this one are what we need more of.
