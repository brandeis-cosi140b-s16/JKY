Ok this may not be your high end on the Las Vegas strip Mexican Resturant but it hits all the points and I love it. My favorite new local spot. 

Ok grant it's located in the Fiesta Casino on Rancho it is not bad at all. The Resturant itself is very cool nice and huge. Extremely high ceilings and great atmosphere. The price were very affordable and they have tons of deals. Forget having to constantly asking for refills on chips and salsa, they have a self serve Chips and salsa bar which I think is original and super cool. 

The staff was nice and the chef came out to each table that night. I live in the SouthWest side of town so it's a bit out of the way but if I am ever coming back to the Ice Rink and want a good, clean nice Mexican place to eat at this is it!!!
