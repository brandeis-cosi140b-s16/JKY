Came here with my kids. Loved the decor. Definitely want to return for an adult night out. The kids menu was simple and ended with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. What kid doesn't love a little dessert... My daughter had the cheese quesadilla and yucca fries (steak fries)  and my son ordered off reg menu and got the ribeye tacos. He ate all three. Good sign. I had the cilantro cream soup. Had a perfect kick, really delicious. I then had the chicken enchiladas. The sauce was really good and I'm embarrassed to say I ate all of it, yikes!  Oh forgot to mention, chips and salsa were a hit! We even needed a refill in the red salsa. Service was a little slow, but maybe I expect quick service when I have kids. Definitely worth coming back for a date night. Looking forward to trying more items on the menu. Yum!
