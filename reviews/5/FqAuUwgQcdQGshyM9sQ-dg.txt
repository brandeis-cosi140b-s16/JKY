This was my first time to Casa Grande and was expecting to find authentic Mexican food... What I found was the most exquisite meal. The Carnitas Chimichanga with verde sauce added a spicy freshness not expected.  The spicy salsa with chips warmed my entire mouth and the fresh guacamole was chunky, cool and smooth to taste.  Thanks to Savannah's reco it was the best Mexican meal I have ever eaten.
