This is one of the best Roberto's in the valley. They've all got their different quirks and slight variations on some menu items, but this one's got it down. 

The staff is friendly, and remembers me when I come in. 

Check out the Carne Asada Fries, Carnitas Burrito, California Burrito, and Cheese Enchiladas. Great stuff.
