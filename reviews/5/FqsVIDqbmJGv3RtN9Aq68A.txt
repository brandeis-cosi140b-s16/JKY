I probably eat here 3 times per week. They always recognize me as soon as I walk in and they know exactly what I want to order every time. You will probably be greeted by Tim, the location's manager. He is always very friendly. As far as the food, I love the soft tacos with marinated steak. My wife loves their naked taco salad, adding fresh guacamole. For those who have not tried Qdoba, you don't know what you are missing out on. Definately go.
