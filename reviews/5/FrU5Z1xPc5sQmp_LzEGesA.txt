Not a fancy place. It has tables and chairs for eating in, not lots of decor. The food is great and inexpensive. You step up to the counter and order your food. I've been there several times now. There is a salsa bar with three salsas, cucumbers, radishes and other fresh pickled vegetables.  I've had the Carne Asada burrito, California burrito, Carne Carne Asada tacos, chicken tacos and a Chimichanga plate. The plate comes with rice and beans, which I don't usually like, but their rice and beans were much better than average and I ate them all.  All the entrees have large amount of steak and chicken, guacamole and pico de gallo. The tacos are made with two soft corn tacos.  Recently I ordered four tacos for my wife and I. My wife could only eat one and I couldn't finish my second one because they were so full of good food. I highly recommend this place. I gave it five starts because it's not pretentious and serves great food at a great price.
