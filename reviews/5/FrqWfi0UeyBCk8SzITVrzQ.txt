Seriously, thanks to the Mexican food gods for real tacos just off State Street. Chipotle, your necessity has been eliminated. I will forever be a Taqueria Guadalajara fan, but when on campus or downtown, this place cannot be beat for authentic Mexican food.

And please, don't go to a Mexican place and order a burrito or a steak quesadilla. It's about the tacos (that should always have cilantro and onions), and the gorditas, and the sopes, and the tostadas. Kind of excited to try the chorizo/potato option next time around. I love sopes, and while these are different than the TG version, they are also very good. Thick, fried (?) corn-pita type things topped with your choice of meat plus lettuce, tomato and avocado. Yum. 

They have good chips and salsa too. Ask for the bottled salsa too, as it's spicier and a little more interesting than the standard pico de gallo. Also have to love getting a filling lunch for 5 or 6 bucks. The servers are really nice and helpful as well.
