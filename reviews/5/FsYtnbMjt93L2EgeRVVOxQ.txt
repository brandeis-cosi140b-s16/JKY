We had a GREAT birthday  dinner for my sister.  Started with  the grilled  chicken  wings which were so good on their own-just the right amount of spice not too hot. Everyone  loved them!  Then, came our nachos.. My husband and I had spicy Thai chicken(again,  not overly  spicy IMO)  and the pulled pork nachos. We shared,  and  Both  really  hit  the spot. Finished  the evening with fried ice cream nachos.. Not sure I can put those into words.  Our server, I believe  his  name was Greg,  also on top of his game! You won't  be disappointed.  Definitely  going back  soon!
