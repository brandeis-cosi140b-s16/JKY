Slow to review here. But because I've been eating tacos. I have been going to Backyard Taco since the week they opened up. I am fortunate enough to work within walking distance. They have a friendly, helpful staff. The food is fantastic. All proteins and veggies are fired over a huge charcoal grill. The owners care about your experience and it shows. I love the Carne Asada Tacos and Tostadas. I suggest going weekdays around 11 or after 2. From 11:30-2 they can get pretty packed and it's not a big place. Anytime you go, it will be worth the wait, though. 

Ohh yeah...ask grill onions and peppers when you pick up the food. You have to ask.
