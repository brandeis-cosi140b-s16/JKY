Most legit mexican food I've ever ate. You know its good when your the only white person in there. Straight up authentic and everyone is very nice, including the chef who now knows me. Breakfast burritto has won "Best cure for a hangover" over last years winner "Pedialyte freeze pops". The only thing is a couple of times I've requested the God-like el pastor and received beef or non el pastor pork. Well worth the $3-5 bucks youll spend there!!!
