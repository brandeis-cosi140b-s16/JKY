So I'm not sure what the other guy was talking about Rigo's is awesome, the food is amazing and cheap, I eat there once or twice a week. It's not just me either, I'm in the military and everybody in my shop loves Rigos. We even have Rigos Wednesdays haha. If someone mentions Rigos I have to go there. I highly recommend this place!
