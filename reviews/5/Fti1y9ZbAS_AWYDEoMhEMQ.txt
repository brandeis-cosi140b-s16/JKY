I love this place.  Great small to medium-sized venue.  It is a good reason to experience downtown Phoenix.  You can take the light rail right to Van Buren and Central, and it is only two very short city blocks west.  There are many restaurants within walking distance, so it was easy to make a whole night of going to a show.

The show we saw was sold out, and yet it was very comfortable to be inside.  There was plenty of room to see the bands, and you could easily get a drink at the bar without too long of a wait or extra effort.

The drinks were priced reasonably.  I drank Tanqueray and tonic for $6 each and the wife had Stella Artois for $5 each.  The cheapest drinks were cans of PBR for $3 each.  They serve food, but we had just eaten at the Arrogant Butcher-- however I have heard they have a decent kitchen from a well respected source.

The floorplan is set up very well.  There are two entrances, east and west.  On the east side there is a lounge and dining area with restrooms and a bar.  Through a set of double doors is the stage area that has bleacher type seating in the back and plenty of standing room in the front.  The west entrance appears to be for the under 21 set during all ages shows.   Having the two entrances makes for a very quick and organized egress, which is convenient and safe.   There is a long bar along the west  wall, another set of restrooms, and an area dedicated for band merch, which was nice because we were able to talk to the opening act while they sold their own records and t-shirts.  The place is air-conditioned quite nicely.  The bathrooms were reasonably clean for how many people were there.

Overall this is a little gem in downtown Phoenix that makes me excited to get out and and actually be part of the small-but-great Phoenix night-life.
