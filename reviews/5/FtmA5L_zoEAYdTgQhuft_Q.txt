Hubby and I were excited to try Taco Haus as we are big fans of Brat Haus. Anything Payton does is going to be done fresh and excellent. We started with the halibut ceviche. It was light and flavorful.The Asian preparation was great for the fish. Hubby ordered the pork belly tacos and asked for the house made salsas to add spice. He said that he is ordering the same dish again. I ordered the 1/2 rotisserie chicken. The skin was thin and crispy (the way I like it) and the inside juicy and mouthwatering. Hubby had to help me eat it as they was so much there. Two delicious sides came with it- my favorite was the street corn topped with spicy popcorn and 13 beans slow cooked with pork belly (Big Daddy's favorite.) The drinks were fairly priced and the tres leches dessert literally melts in your mouth. The servers were friendly and well informed; the atmosphere is "joint like" with great music- makes you want to hang out for a while. This Saturday we are bringing our whole crew in for lunch to try more things.
