Well.... what can I say the tacos here are  AMAZING. If theres something I would die for in life it would probably be tacos.. lol jk.  What Im saying is these were to die for. why havent I been here before ?? 

I tried a couple different kinds of tacos
carnitas
barbacoa
and...My absolute favorite- COCHINITA ... delicious

also had the chips & salsa, salsa was really good. And lastly we had the Papas Fritas con mole y queso.

I recommend China Poblano to anyone in Vegas. 

also try a Margarita Sal de Gusano... topped with Salt air. its great
