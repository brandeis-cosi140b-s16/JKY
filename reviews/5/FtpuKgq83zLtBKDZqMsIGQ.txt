I've been here a few times and the service is superb! Adrian is the best server in the place! He's funny, friendly and of course, if you end up being a regular, he always stops to chat. The food is excellent and portions ate definitely generous! By far the best in the Steele Creek area! Cook time is usually quick as well. They're Queso and Guacamole are so good you won't be able to finish your meal because you filled up beforehand! I would definitely recommend coming here for any meal!
