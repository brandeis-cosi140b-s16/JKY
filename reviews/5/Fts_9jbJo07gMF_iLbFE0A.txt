Always a super fan of Barrio Cafe. The decor is very unique, the food awesome and a different style than we typically see in AZ. Think roasted meats, fish and veggies. They do have tacos and enchiladas on the menu, but it's definitely not your run of the mill Mexican food. My favorite is the Cochinita Pibil meal, insanely good roasted pork. they also have killer Sangria!  Expect to spend a bit more than usual on Mexican food, but it's well worth it!
