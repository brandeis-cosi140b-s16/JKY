I love how they make their own tortilla  and their meet is all soo fresh and juicy.   

I cannot believe I have yet write a review for this place!
This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets! I've eaten numerous Mexican Foods in Arizona; but to me, nothing is ever comparable to them. Every time I go back to Vegas, I have to at least get a horchata there.  Okay, that's a lie! I have to get at least one taco...no, make that two!!
I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line. 
Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion. 
I get so excited for places that are super delicious and this place is definitely worth the lost of water coming running out of my mouth. *drools!*
