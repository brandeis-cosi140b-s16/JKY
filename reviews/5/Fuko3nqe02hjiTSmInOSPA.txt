To be honest the bad reviews almost turned me away. However, we had a great time. The service was better than the food but just slightly and we enjoyed our meal immensely. 

We were greeted with smiles. Our little one expressed a desire to sit upstairs and a table was immediately cleared for us. When we balked at the stairs we were shown to the elevator. Our server was gracious and friendly and made great recommendations. When we lamented just missing the brunch and the 2$ mimosas she gave us free mimosa coupons! Food and drinks came out fast. Portions were genorous.
