So, after a few more visits I have to say I really love this place. Prices are so reasonable, it's ridiculous. The portions are huge, I almost always have to share to get through a whole order.

After seeing their post for Super Bowl bbq and catering, we couldn't resist ordering the nacho bar. We picked the fixings up the morning of the game and there was so much food for the very small price tag we had to pay. The ingredients were fresh and we were thrilled with everything. The game was a bore but luckily our nacho bar and good company made the party a complete success.
