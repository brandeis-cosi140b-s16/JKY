I was a huge fan of Mucho Gusto so I have to admit it's hard to walk into this building without craving their chili relleno with mushroom and walnuts. There's a great relleno on the menu at the revival but it's entr√©e size and I wanted to try some small plates instead. I had the ahi ceviche, which was a special. And the empanada. The ceviche was very flavorful with good spice. The empanada had a lovely creamy sauce. I enjoyed both of them. My friend had the Gypsy salad and it looked really delicious.
