Omg.  The food is so good I had to write this before leaving.   We are here for breakfast.  The blending of flavors is unreal.   So good!!!     My husband had eggs,  machaca and green chili.   He is currently experiencing a food-gasm.  I had a vegetarian breakfast burrito.    I never want this to end . . .
