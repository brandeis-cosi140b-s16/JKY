WOW!!! Was i surprised by this place. $.99 tacos that are super delicious and their salsas are amazing especially the red roasted chile salsa. It beats Salsitas down the steeet or any felibertos. Their meat doesnt seem to be sitting in containers, its always hot and seems not fresh but cooked well. Their adobada is really good, not authentic but beats any of the other places. And like i said $.99 tacos i havent seen any below $1.50. So i def recomend.
