Yes Five Star, 
I was very impressed with the food and price point. I mean, I am not into all that flash and fruo fruo looks. I look at the food. The quality of the meat was on par! They also provided pickled carrots and radishes and good salsa. This place can really compete with other taco trucks and beat'em hands down, I tell you. 

This is how good they are, there were these ghetto fabulous Mexicans from Cali with their gold chains and rings talking good ole' Mexican Spanish and ordering 30 tacos de carne asada to go! I mean you gotta love that! 

Oh and by the way, its near the Excellent Bar- Herb & Rye, so this makes for a great pit stop before or after you hit the bar. 
Til Next Time
