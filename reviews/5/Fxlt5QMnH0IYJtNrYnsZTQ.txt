I have eaten here twice.  The first time I got that salad thing with the radishes and cold shredded beef.  Salpicon or something like that.  I just told the guy I was looking for a salad, and he recommended it.  It was very fresh with generous sour cream and guacamole.  The guac was actually made out of avocados.  None of that fake "avocado spread" nonsense.  Plenty of meat on that thing.  Was happy with the food and price.

The second time, my BF got takeout for us.  He got the spinach enchiladas, and I got the shrimp burrito.  Once again, we were very happy with the food and price.  My burrito had lots of shrimp and fresh, crunchy veggies inside with a great sauce.  I remember that the burrito was $8, and the enchiladas were $5.
