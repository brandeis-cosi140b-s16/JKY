This is Roberto's without the hype. Extremely well made food to order.  Asada burrito and chicken taquitos were delicious. The salsa bar had dozens of perfectly ripe and cut limes which I enjoy. The only negative I had were the spicy carrots weren't crunchy - a bit soft for my liking. I will never go to Roberto's again!!
