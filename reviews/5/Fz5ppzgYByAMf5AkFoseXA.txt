I love The Clarendon Hotel and the restaurant was great!  I'll always have a very special place in my hear for this hotel but that won't change my opinion on the restaurant. 

We started with crab cakes that were terrific and I had ordered a sandwich that came with really cool potatoes.   I did like the potatoes better than the sandwich.  My dad had the same thing as me and he loved it.  My mom had a steak and potato salad and she really liked it.  My boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese and he loved it and so did I. 

I wasn't feeling super good that day or I would have ordered a martini and dessert, so I'll have to go back.  

Also, the rooftop of this hotel is rockin' with views, ambiance and dj's.  Definitely check it out one evening, it's a great place to have a drink with friends.  And the pool is the best pool in Phoenix!
