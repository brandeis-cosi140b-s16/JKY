Ha ha. The reviews here are hilarious. So my ex bf and I always go to La Perla. We have drinks and dance the night away here. We are usually the only non Mexicans in the group. When we first started dating, I thought what the hell am I doing here. It grew on me and I love it. The bartenders don't even speak English! We have a fun, unpretentious night here. People are nice and you see another side of life, instead of the typical Scottsdale places I usually frequent. It makes me remember who I am and that I can have a blast anywhere.
