While visiting Ryan he took me her since he knows i could eat mexican food every single day. It was packed when we came in but suprisingly we only had a five minute wait. The waiter immediatley came over and asked us if we would like something to drink, and came back as soon as we put our menus down to take our order. We were by no means rushed- you can tell they just know how to run a restaurant and run it extremely well.
Their salsa is delicious and they are generous with their chips- but the best part is the prices, holy cow are they reasonable. Ryan got a burrito bigger than my dog and it was only $7.95! I got the flautas and they were deep fried to perfection while the chicken was moist and delicious inside. While eating the lemon fell off my cup and onto the floor and the next second the waiter brought me over a plate of lemon slices- how impressive!!
The portions are enormous, but incredibly delicious and extremely budget friendly. I wish we had room for dessert- I'll definitely try it next time.
