I assume that if you're reading this, you're debating whether or not to come here. Stop reading and drive to KoMex right now. It's that awesome.

First, I'd just like to say that the idea of Korean and Mexican fusion seemed strange to me. But then I came here and learned the error of my ways. The food is great. Hands down. I had beef tacos and chicken tacos, which were amazing. The sauce/dressing on the tacos? Amazing. The hot sauce they gave me? Also amazing. And really well-prepared, too. These tacos were not skimpy! I also ordered the chicken teriyaki for my brother, and he loved it. For $4.99, you get a lot of food in that plate. It's really stacked, and is probably large enough that you might have some left over for later. I also ordered an order of regular fries and seasoned fries. Both were amazing, though they waited to be consumed at a later time as the tacos and teri were more than enough. Also, the nice (and cute!) girl working the front counter brought me chips and salsa while I waited for my food, which was an unexpected plus. It was great. 

All in all, I love this place. The food was great, the prices were fair, and the amount of food was awesome. You cannot beat that combination! No way!

Not only will I return to KoMex, but you can bet I'll be bringing people, too!
