I've visited mucho macho tacos 2 days in a row now and I'm pleased to report that it's great.

The menu isn't as authentic feeling (whatever that means) as perhaps some other restaurants but it looks and feels fresh. Definitely a step up from what you may have experienced before.

It's brightly decorated and the service was quick and friendly.

The crispy baja fish taco/burrito is excellent, as expected. The papaya slaw that came on the pastor taco was unexpected but really good! The grilled mahi wasn't as good as I hoped but the shrimp tacos were unbelievable. A new favorite for sure!

They have a "bang" tap!!

The only criticism is that the space is a bit small and it's already a popular place so seating is at a premium. However if you love or work close you can easily get a take out and find your own spot to eat.

Oh also the Dodgers suck but not everyone's perfect.

I'm happy there's another great taco place in the valley and I'll be a regular.
