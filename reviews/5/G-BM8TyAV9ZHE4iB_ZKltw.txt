Best Roberto's in Town, hands down! Chips and Guac, with 3 rolled chicken tacos, rice and beans is the way to go, all their food is great there. I take all my Cali friends there and any time I'm home, there for Viva Las Vegas or Punk Rock Bowling it's a great hangover meal, I love the OC but all the Roberto's here are in SD. The place is clean too! Staff is nice and the salsa bar is stocked with salsas, peppers, and even cucumbers!
