The Barrio Queen in their new Gilbert location is open less than a week. There a a ton of black-shirted staff taking very efficient care of the patrons. The kitchen seems organized and quick on this "Taco Tuesday". There are still several pages of the menu that are "coming soon".

The Saudero Azteca taco is terrific, with tender, well seasoned brisket in a tender tortilla. The carnitas taco is a bit less tasty, but the salsa verde brings it up to snuff. The camaron taco is very tasty, with one very large shrimp in the cabbage and sauce. The pescado taco has a nice sized chunk of breaded, fried fish with cabbage and sauce. Eat it first, if you get several tacos, as it cools rapidly under the sauce. 

The Casa Margarita was pretty average, tasting a bit bitter. Upgrade to a different drink that doesn't use the Agavales silver tequila. 

I had the Bu√±elos for dessert. It was excellent, but big enough for two (or four)!

Bravo for a great example opening a new restaurant!  The staff was just attentive enough, without being obnoxious. I will definitely be back!
