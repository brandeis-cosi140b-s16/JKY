I have eaten here for the last 10 years. Once again I am working in the downtown area and there are quite a few Mexican restaurants near me but I will always drive down to South Phoenix to grab food from here. In 10 years the food has not changed. It is the same great Carne Asada Taco's and Burrito's I have enjoyed over and over.

While living in Texas I would come back to Phoenix to visit and this was always on the list of places I had to go. Breakfast Lunch or Dinner this restaurant can serve up some of the best food in town.
