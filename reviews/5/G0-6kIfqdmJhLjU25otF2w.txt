I have not had many tortas in my time, but that was a mistake that now needs to be corrected on a monthly basis or so. This location is really not meant for gringos as I was greeted in Spanish and even asked for my order in espanol, but most staff are bi-lingual. It is just a matter of whether they feel like talking in English. Still, they all were very nice and smiled alot and the food was great. The menu is large, but I had to try the famous torta's and I ended up with a safe choice for a rookie. It was sliced thin well done steak with guac and mexican cheese and a dash of chipotle sauce on that great soft bun. Torta came with ruffles chips and they also served Mexican chips and a red salsa (which was good) prior to the meal. This was a good sandwich, all the flavors made every bite a joyous thing. Some excellent Mexican music in the background and a $10 check (with can of soda) made this trip into the barrio a successful one.
