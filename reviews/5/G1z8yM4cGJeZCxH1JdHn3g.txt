This is our favorite "lunch date" place!  My husband and I love to stop in and indulge in their food whenever we are in the area.  The choices are just as good as sit down Mexican, and far better than the average take out place.  (The only thing missing is the wheelchair back to the car after such indulgence!)  It is extremely affordable too!  This particular location is in a nice area, very clean, and the employees are polite!  We have also been to the location on Alma School further north, but much rather prefer this one.
