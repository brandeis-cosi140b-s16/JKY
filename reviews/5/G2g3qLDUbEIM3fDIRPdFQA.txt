so good!
I had the Cuban steak with onions, black beans and rice, it was perfect. I ordered a side of plantains that was enough for the whole table to share and they came with sour cream, my favorite. other people in my party ordered Mexican fare and truly enjoyed it. portions were large and reasonably priced.
The salsa and tortilla cheaps were outstanding.
Everyone agreed that this was quite possibly the best meal for the best price  in Vegas. 
Free parking across the street in the el cortez casino, no wait for a table, quick and delicious!
