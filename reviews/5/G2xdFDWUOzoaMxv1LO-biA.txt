The tamales are outstanding. I've had many tamales over the years and there was always plenty of masa and very little filling......NOT at The Tamale Store. The tamales are meaty, substantial and delicious. I look forward to the fall so I can try the sweet tamales.

We are having family over for dinner next Sunday and will be stopping here to pick up tamales.
