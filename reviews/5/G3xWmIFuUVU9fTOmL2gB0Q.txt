The food is served so quickly here, I swear they have mind readers spying on us in the parking lot.  But that doesn't detract from the food.  Everything is flavorful without being TOO greasy (I mean, it is still Mexican food).  The salsa is fresh-tasting and not too spicy.  The chips are warm and salty and the margaritas are just right.  The waiters are friendly, not so much for the hostesses.  The prices are reasonable as well.
