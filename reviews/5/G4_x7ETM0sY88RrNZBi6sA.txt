I absolutely agree with the post before me! It's a random tiny plaza off Indian School and the 51 on the SW corner Hands down, best fast, cheap Mexican I've tried in the central phoenix-ish area!! My all-time fave is a bean and cheese burrito with onions inside, enchilada style.  I also LOVE their quesadillas, which come with pico de gallo and guacamole and sour cream (which I never get at any of the "other" places- always have to order it seperately)! I seriously love this place!
