This place is amazing!!! It is pretty small so it seems like more of a to go kind of place, but we decided to eat there and everything was great! The staff was so nice and welcoming. The food was soooo good!!! Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've ever been to here in Vegas! I got bean and cheese burritos with enchilada sauce on the top and though it might seem like an easy meal to make it was above and beyond any burrito I've had, you could definitely tell everything was homemade! My fianc√© had the sopapilla CC Sizzle and he said the same thing avout his meal. My one suggestion is if you are ordering to go make sure you give yourself about 20-30 minutes as everything is made fresh so it takes a while, but totally worth it!
