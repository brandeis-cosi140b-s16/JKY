I'll just get to the point. Really good food, Great prices, Friendly staff and even the Chef came out to see how we were doing. I had the carnitas street tacos and they were bomb. Try the black beans if you get a chance. I really liked the place. I'll definitely be going back since its not too far from my location. BTW, it is located next to the Sapphires entrance.
