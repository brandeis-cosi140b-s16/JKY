Stopped off from the airport from returning from Las Vegas (which has great food). 

This food is delicious and I recommend the carne asda burrito. It was a little hot as I didn't have cheese with it, and it was amazing. Just as good as anything in Vegas and will return here again in the future. 

Great food hidden away in Mesa.
