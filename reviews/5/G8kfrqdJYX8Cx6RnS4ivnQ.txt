One of my favorite taco shops.  Don't be fooled by the rough exterior as the inside is the inside is very clean and nicely decorated with colorful mexican tile.  You order from the counter and take a seat where the friendly staff will soon deliver fresh chips and very good salsa.  Your food will also be delivered on a real plate - not wrapped in paper or in a styrofoam box like many of the other area taco shops.  

The Al Pastor and Carnitas are top notch.  I usually go with Al Pastor tacos but sometimes like get Carnitas into the mix.  I'm normally not a huge fan of ceviche however I really enjoy Mucho Taco's ceviche tostada.  The beans are excellent and I've had a really good chicken soup here as well.  Other reviewers have mentioned the Horchata and I'm looking forward to trying that on my next visit.  According to the server all of the aguas frescas are made fresh on-site, so if you're looking for Horchata Ole! (or Orange Bang! for that matter) you'll have to try somewhere else.

Almost forgot to mention that the prices are very reasonable.  My only complaints with Mucho Taco are that the taquitos are a little small and that Al Pastor is not available in a burrito (only tacos and tortas).  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for cheap but tasty mexican food in a casual environment.
