Wow,  by far the best tamales I've had to date. 
  My stepfather said that his tamale recipe came from his grandmother's recipe and she had cooked for Pancho Villa. I thought they were pretty good until I moved to San Diego. 
  A co-worker brought in some tamales his mom had made that were so good, she would make large batches and sell them to over 30 people who worked at the company. 
  Pancho. Villa would have shot my great step grandma if the tamale store had been around in those days!!! 
  I wouldn't have minded either, my ex-stepfather a real piece of work lol.  And the Tamale Store makes my recipe look and taste like a tamale kak uh.. 
  I would highly, highly, recommend a trip here, but don't be surprised it's not a sit down restaurant.  It's a take-out place and they have freshly frozen or what's hot options of tamales. Whichever you choose you definitely won't be disappointed.
