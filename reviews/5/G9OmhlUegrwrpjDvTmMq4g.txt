Oh my god.... Go here. My only error was I forgot to ask for pineapple. Soooo good. Vampiro was meaty and messy and fabulous. The taco adobodo (? Al pastor) was moist and flavorful and I love the white sauce, the carne asado with and without nepalitos, perfect with a healthy squeeze of lime... The nepalitos, as a gringa, I would probably cut it into smaller bits, the slab of cactus was a bit much, but I liked the flavor addition. Yum, yum, yum.... Y
The flan was rich and creamy and 4 tacos and flan set me back $15- oh and horchata too. Perfect for dinner back I. The hotel, then breakfast and lunch the next day.... Check it out!
