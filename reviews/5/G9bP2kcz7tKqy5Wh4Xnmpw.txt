My all time favorite southwestern Mexican place. Their complimentary corn bread is yummy. I can eat that all day. The dish you have to try it out is baked sea food plate. OMG it is made to perfection. Every bite of it is enjoyable . They happy hour menu is also very exciting with $5 margaritas . Love the interiors and the food here !
