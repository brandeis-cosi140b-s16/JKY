I really enjoy this place each time I eat here!  As some reviewer had mentioned, the wait when it first opened was a bit long for this sort of establishment, but they just opened. Bugs have to be worked out and it seems that that has happened. I have been here 4 times and the wait times to get food has defiantly improved. 

What hasn't changed is the quality of the food. The "taco lights" are my favorite!  They are basically a taco in butter lettuce with some other veggies. Get for those trying to watch their waist line!
