I had fish tacos and birria tacos the best tacos ever!  The fish was tasty and they have best sauce I've had on a taco. The chips were good even with no salt. I liked the beans too!  This is my first time here but it's close to home so I'm coming here instead of Robertos.  Next time I want to try the fajitas and shrimp tacos.
