This place has the best tamales outside of Mexico!!  After we arrived in Vegas, we headed straight for Dona Maria.  I had 2 chicken tamales in red and green sauce and they were amazing!  The chicken is so finely chopped  that it literally melts in your mouth.  The sauces are also fantastic.  My husband ordered the chilequiles which was also excellent.  The guacamole dip is also delicious and huge for the price.

We loved our meal so much that we came back 4 days later.  Don't miss this wonderful restaurant when you're in Vegas!!
