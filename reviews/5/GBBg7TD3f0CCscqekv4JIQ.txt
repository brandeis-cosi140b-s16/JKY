Here's my theory on the enchirito.

Bob, the marketing director at Taco Bell was someplace else that day, a million miles away as he pensively doodled at his lunch, fork in hand.  
He had an ominous task ahead of him...come up with a new product and fast!
After all, It had been some number of years since he and the team jackpotted-out with that seven layer burrito.
He needed something new. 
Something different.

Time slipping away, he continued to mindlessly needle at his lunch...on this day a number two; the enchilada and bean burrito.
And that's when destiny came calling. 

Holy Shit he thought to himself, snapping out of his daydream. I think I have something. 

        "Wait a second....somebody..SOMEBODY RUN AND GET ME A PAD AND 
         SOME PAPER...I'VE GOT SOMETHING, THIS IS BIG PEOPLE, HURRY!"
       
Bob indeed had something.
All that poking at his number two had managed to combine the burrito and enchilada into an unrecognizable mass, and that's when the gods, copulating at that particular moment, shot a wad of inspiration directly into Bob's uniquely undersized brain.  

         "We're going to call this...are.you ready... .THE ENCH-IRITO," he exlaimed
          proudly to the marketing department.

There were cheers and wild applause from the team. They knew Bob just hit another jackpot as he had so often done in the past.


Well, you know the rest of the story, another star was born in the Taco Bell line-up.
Way to go Bob. (and whoever ran after the paper and pen) 

This is all just a theory, based on a set of postulates including a spork, beans, cheese, a tortilla, and an entire marketing staff, optimistic they'd hit another home-run without a Spanish speaking Chihuahua.

Tip: If you're sick of everything on the menu, try a bean burrito with green sauce. It's not on the menu but TB will make it for you just the same.  
It looks like snot so don't look at it and get all freaked-out.
Just eat it.
It's tasty, kinda hot.
