Cabo Fish Taco was the first place I found GOOD tacos in Charlotte.

Being right in the middle of NoDa, Cabo Fish Taco has a bit of a cult following. Why, you ask? Because it is delicious. The ambiance of the restaurant fits perfectly with the NoDa location (excellent artwork, quirky decorations). And, wait, did I mention that it's delicious?

I got a tavarua wahoo taco, as well as a BBQ mahi taco. Both were incredible. The spicy avocado salad was one of the best pasta salads I've ever eaten.  I also ordered a glass of Sangria (it was on special for $3), and it was light and crisp. I would go back in a heartbeat.
