In love with this place!!! The food was absolutely delicious and the service was phenomenal. Love the complementary chips and salsa, the salsa was BOMB I've never had such tasty salsa in my life! The portion of the food was huge and prices were great. Love the decor of the place, very colourful and cute! Definitely recommend it and will definitely come back!
