I have Facebook friends that are always checking into this place so after two years, I finally decided to hit this place's 2 for 1 happy hour which is everyday from 4-8pm. I love this place for its rock music, friendly atmosphere, Caribbean theme. It is located in a busy area where Hofbrauhaus, Hard Rock Casino and airport traffic area but still is convenient to get to. 
The paradise rolls were fantastic and all the other items on the menu are reasonably priced. 

The ownership is friendly and there are plenty of TVs to watch sporting events. I will become a regular here and start telling others about their happy hour.
