We decided to try this place after seeing it advertised at the movie theater.  We were seated and our waitress was right there with warm chips and salsa. I ordered the Sopes which were very good. This is the first Mexican restaurant that I've been in that had Sopes. My friend had the make your own platter. She had enchiladas and a tostada which she said was really good.  The service  and the food was very good. I would definitely go back.
