Omgosh a must for Tortas.. if u are ever in Vegas u have to check this place out. The service is fast and the food is to die for. Don't judge before u try.  A whole in a wall for sure but the best food in town. U can have tacos de canasta the way they do them in Guadalajara , Tacos dorados y tostadas de queritos..  but the best by far is the Tortas Haogadas they serve the juice on the side so u decide how spicey u want it!!! A must try for sure!!!
