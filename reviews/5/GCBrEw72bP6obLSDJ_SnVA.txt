I love both the owner of this place, and the food. 

The owner is a funny, great and caring guy. Every time I go to Taco Del Mar, I'm really impressed about how welcome he makes you feel and how hard he is trying to make his business work. 

His food is really yummy, and a great price to boot. 

I LOVE the shredded beef taco. 

I tried the Nachos today, and they were okay - wishing I had gone with the Taco's (Yumm!) 

We have had a salad there too -- another good choice. 

If you are looking for some good food, at a good price, with some good mo-jo to boot; please head over to Taco-Del-Mar!
