FINALLY, Chipotle came to Charlotte! Slowly but surely, many locations are making their way around town.

I absolutely love avocados, and Chipotle has the BEST guacamole I have ever tasted. I have no idea what they do to it, but it's just amazing. 

I'm a vegetarian and I usually get a burrito bowl or a burrito. I always ask them to mix the burrito contents before rolling it and it tastes so good. The service at the counter is quick-- it's a great place to eat on the go. 

The chips are great as well... I have never been disappointed with Chipotle!
