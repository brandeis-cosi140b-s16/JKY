Wonderful lunch! I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were delicious - small, double-shelled street tacos with Cotija cheese and pico de gallo. My husband had the Enchiladas Suiza and those were delicious as well. My mom had the Chile en Nogada but I am not sure how that was since she hate it so fast I didn't get a chance to try it! :) Wait staff was friendly and everything was delicious. The fryer was down today so I didn't get to try the churro rellenos but next time I am getting it for sure!
