This is by far the cleanest Roberto's in Las Vegas! I've been to a whole lot and I would drive clear across town just to come to this one, it's always clean..the food taste amazing, like....the food is the same but this place taste more fresh, if that makes sense lol! When I moved her and I found out about this place, I come at least 2 times a week!
