Been to Scottsdale eight times in the last three years. Happened to come by this place by our car service driver from Brooklyn. He highly recommended it. We tried it the next night and it is without a doubt the best Mexican food we have ever had. The happy hour is incredible, the nachos are amazing. The portions are enormous. The staff very friendly and accommodating and attentive. Incredible little place. Do not miss out.
