What a relief, finding an overpriced restaurant in Las Vegas that is actually worth the price. After endlessly searching on YELP for a good Mexican restaurant I came across El Segundo Sol so glad I did. To start, we order the chips and salsa best salsa Fresca I've had tangy well seasoned, then I order the guacamole which you get to choose how mild or spicy you want it, by far the best I've had as well. My wife that hates avocado was even willing to taste it and ended up loving it too. That brings me to my chicken Tinga enchiladas accompanied by black beans and cilantro rice. Wow super tender, juicy, well seasoned chicken filling and the green sauce!! amazing. My wife order the combo fajitas, steak was tender almost melt in your mouth!!! seasoned to perfection. The chicken had a charred smoky flavor that was incredible. To wash it all down I had the cucumber mint margarita which I have to say and I hate to sound redundant but again the best I've had. I will highly recommend this fantastic restaurant and will be going back.
