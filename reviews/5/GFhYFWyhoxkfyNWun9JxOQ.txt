This place is amazeballs. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the second you walk in, there is a warmth and minimalist but lovely atmosphere. Then, once you taste the food, you stop caring about what the inside of this place looks like because you have to leave and go slap your mama because it's that damn good. The brisket tacos are unlike anything of the same name that you have ever tasted before, the street corn will henceforth be the corn that all other corn is measured against, and the shrimp papusa is this explosion of all these flavors so delicious that you won't even want to swallow (ahem, sorry). OH and the butternut squash gnocchi in the chorizo sauce with the queso fresco cheese??? make like Nike and just do it. Go here,  you won't be sorry, I promise. One of the best tapas places I've ever had the privilege of dining at. Yep, ended that sentence in a preposition but I don't care bc this place made me not care.
