Been here a couple times now, both in the drive thru.  Quick and friendly service just like a drive thru should be.   This is not your Filiberto's, Eriberto's, or whatever chain and certainly not a Taco Bell!  No offense to those places but this is much better in my opinion!  I've had their tacos and just recently the chicken fajita combo...YUM!  Love the rice too!
