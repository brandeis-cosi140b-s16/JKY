This is my favorite restaurant in a city crowded with excellent choices. Mission is in it's own league and continues to be creative.

I'll quote my prior review:

"The Almejas Al Vapor is an incredible dish." Words do not do this restaurant justice....it's really that good. This time we tried a new twist....the Mini churros for Dessert with a small milkshake. Incredible!

I love coming here when it's NOT tourist season. It's still packed and still requires a reservation, but it's much more relaxing. 

Wonderful experience. Bobbly Flay probably eats here :-)
