A happy series of events led me here when I had initially planned to go somewhere else and I am so glad that I did. The tacos are amazing, of course. My personal favorite was the mole taco but it's hard to pick just one because everything I had was so good. Wonderful interior d√©cor and a very relaxed and intimate atmosphere. I fully intend to come here as often as I can. Oh, and the horchata was phenomenal. All in all, easily the best taco place I have been to.
