Here on a business trip and stopped in to see what it was all about. It was their soft open, so no Tequila for us! But we didn't mind. It's off the strip a bit, which is nice for parking purposes. I ordered the queso blanco and it was delish! Also, the chicken and steak fajitas and everything was cooked perfectly. Veggies were saut√©ed to perfection! Will keep this place in mind the next time I come to Vegas.
