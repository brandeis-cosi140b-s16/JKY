Another trip to the south side made us wonder in for some MEXICAN food. 

This Place is very Nice . Very Clean & friendly. Not too loud and plenty of seating available.

I ordered the Emilianos SPECIAL combo.

 DAMN You better be hungry to finish these TWO FULL plates of really good food. A taste of just about everything on the menu. Our Waiter was very helpful and made sure that everyone's drinks never empty. Including my Dos Equis .

As usual the parking sucks in South Side , But , there is a garage across the street.  just plan to spend an extra $5.00 to park.
