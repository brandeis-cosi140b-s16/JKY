If you want a completely authentic home-made style Mexican meal in Tempe, this is the place to go. Everything I have tried here is delicious, and it's all WAAAY better than you'll get at any Mexican chain restaurant. Again, we're talking authentic Mexican food, not the commercialized crap that you get at the chains. I think the few bad reviews on here must be from people who don't know what real Mexican food should taste like. 

I have tried several of their burritos (the new Pollo Adobado burrito is my favorite), the chimichanga, enchiladas, rolled tacos, enchiladas, and I'm sure a few other things that I'm forgetting, and everything has been excellent. And their fresh homemade chips are very good too, and they have a variety of freshly made salsas at their salsa bar. The only thing I've had that I didn't like was the shrimp tacos, the shrimp didn't taste fresh and they were just weird overall. 

My favorite thing on the menu? It's a tie. My go-to meal when I'm starving is easily the #23 combo - 3 mini tacos with your choice of meat (pollo asado, ground beef, carne asada or carnitas), all loaded with fresh guacamole & pico de gallo, along with a side of refried beans, rice, and a soda - ALL FOR JUST $5! It's so much food I almost never finish it all. And my other favorite thing is the Pollo Adobado burrito - it is HUUUUGE and loaded with flavor, it's unbelievable. And when I'm just in the mood for a big mess of junk food I'll get the loaded fries (basically a nachos supreme type dish but with french fries instead of nachos....mmmmm....). 

Check it out, you won't be disappointed. And FYI you will probably need to wait about 10-15 minutes for your food since everything is made fresh, but it is well worth the wait. In fact, I think I'm going to head over there right now. :)
