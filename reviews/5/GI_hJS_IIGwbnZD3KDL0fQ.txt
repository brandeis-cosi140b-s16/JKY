Seen on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. A fan after the first visit! You can sample some of their items, the staff is knowledgeable, and the food is super flavorful! Ended up ordering the 3 items hubby and I sampled: the carnitas, the jade red chicken, and the emerald chicken. The jerk chicken fried rice and beans were the perfect sides. Great prices, great food - can't wait to go back!
