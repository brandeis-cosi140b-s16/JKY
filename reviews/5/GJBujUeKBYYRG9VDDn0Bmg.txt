They never let you down! 

The bacon, egg, and potato breakfast burrito is an eye opener... Which helps in the morning.

Carne Asada burrito it hands down awesomeness in a tortilla!

However, my favorite plate is (drum roll) the Chicken Chimi!!!!! Epic deliciousness, golden fried... Same color as the streets in heaven. 

We will never stop coming here...

God bless you Mexteca!
