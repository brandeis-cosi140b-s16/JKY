I decided to try this restaurant again, the first time it was very salty.  So I'm gave it another try, we went and ate inside on November 10, 2012 and the staff were very nice.  The food we tried this time was excellent, I had soo much food that I had to take it to go, my little girl even enjoyed it and normally she just like to eat the chips and that's about it but this time she at some beans and rice and some of my fajita quesadilla.  I got the chunky style guaccamole and it was awesome, of course I had some left over.  So I decided to eat the rest of it the next day, it was a good and bad idea, the flavors had time to settle I guess and it was soo hot that I had heart burn for two days but it was really good.  I look forward to going back, oh yeah and we was fortunate enough to hear the staff sign the happy birthday song it was by far the funniest thing I've ever heard.  So all around we enjoyed the food and had excellent service.
