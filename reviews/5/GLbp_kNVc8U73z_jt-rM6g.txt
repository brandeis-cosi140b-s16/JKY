Seriously my favorite fast Mexican food in Las Vegas. I've been eating at this location since I first moved her about 8 years ago. Same amazing quality since. I don't understand people on here saying the service is bad, every time I walk in I get amazing quick service. I know there is a language barrier with many of the employees so some may take their demeanor as rude but they're just trying to do their job. I prefer this place over chipotle any day. Quality food that's always hot and always fresh. I also love the seating area here and usually stay to eat there. Also don't forget to grab a brownie on your way out, they're delicious and only a dollar WOW. Would recommend this place to anyone!
