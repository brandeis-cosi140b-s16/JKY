If you are looking for the best Fili-B's type place in the Phoenix Metro area... This is it. You can pretty much order anything and be happy with it. I have been eating there for about 10 years now and have never gotten sick(except for when I ate too much). Some might say eating shrimp in the desert is risky. This is the only place I eat shrimp. Their Shrimp burrito add cheese minus the tartar sauce is amazing! Their carne asada fries are pretty good too! I have tried almost everything on the menu except for the Menudo.
