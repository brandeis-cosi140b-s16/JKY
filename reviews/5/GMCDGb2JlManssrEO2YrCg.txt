Loved it ..wife and i looking for place to eat as we were going up and down Scottsdale rd lucky she noticed the sign and we turned on thomas and pulled in..was impressed at decor new and nice..Hostess was very helpful in giving suggestions, server was also great. the owner gave us sample of their Caldera Margarita. whoohoo spicy.. we had regular Margs instead..the food was outstanding..chips and salsa to start , bean dip, and a green chile queso. wow..then we shared some apps that were on special for sunday evening..Had and awesome dinner with drinks for less than $50. cant say enough good things..they are new just opened couple months again..we really wish them luck wish was closer to home , but we will be back.. Nice bar and TVs.
