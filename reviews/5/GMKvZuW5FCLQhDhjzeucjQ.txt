In town for business & found this place on Yelp. It was close to my hotel & on the way to the office so I decided to check it out. The place is bright & clean. My order was taken right away. It took a few minutes to get my food, but it was freshly made & delicious! I ordered the torta Cubana & agua de melon. I was also happy they took my Amex card.  I will definitely be going back!!
