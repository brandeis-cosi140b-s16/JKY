Kelis was wrong. Her milkshake doesn't bring all the boys to The Yard, it's Chef Silvana's tacos. Fantastic concept, location, and food. Chef Silvana is legendary. I really like how they make the guacamole at your table. Barrio Urbano brings cultura to The Yard and it sure tastes good. They also have the biggest $2 Taco Tuesday selection around!
