My family visited Tex Tubb's for the first time tonight. As a vegetarian, it is often difficult to find any interesting choices on a regular menu. This was definitely NOT the case here. Many vegetarian options and all of them sounded delicious! I went with the the vegetarian taco platter and  all 3 were fantastic. The service was WONDERFUL everyone went above and beyond to make sure my Mother in-law (who uses an electric scooter) had everything she needed, including bringing her warm water, soap, and paper towels so she could wash her hands after eating. We will definitely be back!
