LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE. I seriously go a coupe times a month. My husband is obsessed with the Sonora Dogs. I get the #1 and love it. Their bean dip is fab. If you are looking for tasty and pretty fast service stop on by. 
 It is so good when I did a teacher luncheon this was the place I ordered for for 70 people. Amazing prices.
