I LOVE this place!! I used to live about 5 minutes walking distance away and watched this place while it was under construction turn into this! Now I drive almost 30 minutes! All of the staff is welcoming and friendly. If there is a long line, don't be alarmed because it moves quickly! Not to mention the food is delicious! Gadzooks is great for lunch and dinner. With great food, great prices, and a vegetarian selection you can't go wrong! :)
