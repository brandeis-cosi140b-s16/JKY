Whoa! This is my new favorite hole in the wall. It's currently in the middle of a tiny carneceria but they are moving by the end of the year. It sounded like they might be planning on becoming an actual restaurant, rather than a grocery counter with food.
Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food. Huh!
The owners are Korean, but they speak Spanish. Linda, the owner, said her husband was cooking her some food and everyone was interested. And their fusion food was born.
I started with a bulgogi taco. I think I prefer Hanshik BUT...the taco was $1 and muy delicious.
I then got a bulgogi teriyaki bowl and a pork tamale to go. The teriyaki bowl was $5 and the tamale was another $1. That food will probably last me for 4 meals.
The teriyaki bowl is delicious. I mean, best teriyaki bowl I've ever had. Yum. Yum. Yum!
And the tamale was even better than the teriyaki bowl! 
I freakin' love this place. Cheap, delicious, creative, good eats. I couldn't ask for anything better.
I will be back..again and again.

Edit:
This place has moved and is now a full-time restaurant, rather than carniceria with a food counter.
If you're looking for atmosphere, forget it.
If you're looking for delicious comfort food, go check it out!

I haven't eaten everything on the menu (yet), but most everything I've had seems to have Korean influences, which makes sense given that the owners are Korean.

I got some wonton soup today. It's really not much like traditional wonton and Korean flavor peeks through....but it's delicious, comforting, and a bargain.

The tacos are now $1.25 and still muy delicious! 

I came in for takeout, but Lynda still brought me out a side of chips with salsa and guacamole. The chips were kind of soggy in the middle like homemade...and that's the way I like my chips, but others might disagree.

Still, a ton of food, and a ton of flavor, for very little money. And I still love this place!
