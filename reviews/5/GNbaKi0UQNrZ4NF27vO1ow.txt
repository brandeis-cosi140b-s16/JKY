Great Mexican food in Pittsburgh! The entrees are great for two reasons, the meat quality and preparation is top notch AND the sides are equally worth talking about. Beans and rice were phenomenal in comparison to the other Mexican places in the Burgh. The chiles rellenos con queso y espinaca, chicken nachos, chorizo enchiladas with tomatillo sauce and barbacoa flautas were all 10/10 delicious. 

Pro tip- ask for the spicy homemade hot sauce. Not to spicy, perfectly flavored with peppers.

The coconut flan and the fried banana dessert were worth coming back for alone. It was totally affordable for the four of us (with 4 dinners, apps, and desserts: under 70 bucks).

Service is great- it's an authentic Mexican restaurant and the staff clearly cares about their food and your experience eating it. Loved it.
