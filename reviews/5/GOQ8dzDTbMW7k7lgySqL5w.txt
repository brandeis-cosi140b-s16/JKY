I love this place! They're been and cheese burritos is fantastic. The carne asada burrito is huge! Tuesday tacos are cheap and filling. All three; shredded beef, ground beef, and shredded chicken are yummy. Their tortas are wonderful; the bun is just right every time. I prefer the carne asada. The street tacos are also another one of my favorites with red sauce. 
My new favorite is the grilled chicken salad with light oil. Yummm!
Have never had bad food here.
