Best restaurant, food and service in Las Vegas! We went for lunch and enjoyed it so much that we went back for dinner. The selection of cocktails, appetizers, and entrees is exceptional along with the service from ALL the waitstaff. My favorite part was the "company" cars that give you a complimentary ride back to your hotel on the strip. Great restaurant and definitely will be going back next time I visit Vegas!
