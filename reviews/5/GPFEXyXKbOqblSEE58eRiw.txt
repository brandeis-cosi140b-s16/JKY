I think Ellie read my review.  The place is a little more spiffed up.  I still don't care I love their food so much!  We've had the Green Chili and Steak on FRY BREAD!!!! OMG!!  This thing is incredible!!  We also have tried the shredded beef burrito.  They are huge and delicious.  We ordered the guac and we could hear the cook mixing it up right after our order!  That's what I'm talking about!  Also, the chips and salsa bar (complimentary) make it so worth while to eat in!  The chip are in a little machine that reminds me of a popcorn machine to keep them warm and there's several fresh salsas to choose from that are kept in a covered refrigerated station.  It's nice not to have to fight the flies like at other salsa stations! ;)

I told you before, I'll tell you again! GO to ELLIE'S!!!  While you're there, stop next door to Carden's Cafe  & Bakery under new ownership for a sweet treat afterwards!
