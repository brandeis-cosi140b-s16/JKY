My husband's coworker recommended this place for the amazing bean burrito. We decided to give it a try and I am happy to report that I fell in love with the bean burrito tonight. I really like the chips and salsa too. You've got a big fan in me America :) I am going to tell my friends about this delicious restaurant! Looking forward to going back again and again.
