Whoa! Delicious! Stopped in for a late lunch with my family. The meats have such amazing flavor. The staff was friendly and gave you tasters if you are a first timer. The Decor was interesting but in a good way. Very excited this place is a mile from our home we definitely will be frequenting this place.
