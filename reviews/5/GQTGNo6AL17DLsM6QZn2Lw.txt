Amazing menu and it's all 24/7!!!

Don't let the location fool you, in fact embrace it. Plenty of parking or valet service.

Chef Paco has put together an incredible, authentic menu that he and the staff serves 24/7. Non- GMO and organic ingredients are the rule here, the menus even list the source farms for many of the items. Large selection of vegetarian and GF options - and and the chef is great about making  modifications for vegans (mmm...churros). It's a true Vegas dining gem. 

The vibe and  decor are great and the staff is super friendly. Be sure to check their web site or Facebook page for all of the great specials they offer though out the week. Chances are if you stop here once, you'll find yourself becoming a regular.

The private room is great for groups, I had a dinner for 40 and everyone loved the food and service. They personalized our menus and really made the night special. 

It's also a great location for dinner before a Las Vegas 51s baseball game. Loving the Veggie Bowl with a house margarita! Great service even during the dinner rush. Come to think of it, I'll probably be back after the game too!

If you want to surprise someone by pulling into a Gentleman's Club parking lot when you were to be going to dinner make sure you come around to so you are taking Industrial south and turn into the parking lot - or distract your guest from looking at the building as there is now large lit signage on the street side of the building.
