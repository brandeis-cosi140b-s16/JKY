Wow!  Food was GREAT!  Bean dip was ooohh soooo yummy!  Unfortunately for my wife, it has meat in the bean dip.  Salsa was very good.  

Fresh Guacamole was really good too!

Baja Fish Tacos.. $.99 each on Wednesdays *AND* $1.50 Coronas too!  The fish tacos were grilled, not fried and came out PERFECT!  They came on corn tortillas and didn't need to be smothered in salsa or tarter sauce.  

My wife got a Veggie burrito with some tomatillo sauce (had GREAT flavor).  She was VERY pleased!  The location of this place isn't in the best neighborhood, however the food is GREAT!
