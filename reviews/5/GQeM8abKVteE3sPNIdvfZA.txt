Oh my god this pizza. Sal's has a well-deserved reputation for having the best pies in Madison. The joint is jam packed pretty much every night of the week, and for good reason-- It's absolutely delicious. My table shared a fig gorgonzola pie and some thai chicken pie, with a burrata appetizer. All of it was well balanced, with fresh ingredients, seasoned nicely and it made me want to eat pizza for the rest of my natural life. In addition, they also serve taco specials. The special when I came in was some kind of scallop taco, which I reluctantly said no to, just because I was there to try to pies, but now I am full of regret. I'm sure it would have been the best taco ever. I'll be back soon!!
