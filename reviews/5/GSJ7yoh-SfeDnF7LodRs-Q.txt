Just heard about burrito express a couple of days ago, and I live in the outlying area.  I have to say I ordered the burrito supreme and it was fantastic.  The tortillas were excellent and the burrito had a great flavor profile.  Will definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking for good Mexican food.  Thanks Greg you have my business.
