Mad Mex is awesome! And is one of the things I miss the most about Pittsburgh. The Pico Burrito is fantastic (probably the thing both I and my non-veg friends ordered the most while there) as is the Potato & Black Bean Taquitos. For non vegetarians I have heard great things about the Tortilla soup and some of the other burritos...

In terms of crowds it totally depends on the times, if you are going for half price food which was available between 2-4 PM with student Id or after 11PM then yes its crowded but for 4 bucks for a huge burrito in a town full of college students thats expected. The atmosphere is quieter and better for talking during peak dinner/lunch hours when the food is not half off.
