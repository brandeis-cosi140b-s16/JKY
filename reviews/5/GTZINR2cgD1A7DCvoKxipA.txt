Authentic Mexico City food. Tortas are big and include all the fix ins, avocado, lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, cheese, good amount of meat. Quesadillas and huaraches are longer than 12 inches and the tortilla is homemade maiz. You can also get flour but if you want the full effect you gotta go with maiz. Everything I've had so far is great. They also have homemade snow cones with fresh fruit, mangos, coconuts,  fruit, elotes, gelatinas, flan, ice cream,  fresas con leche and so much more. Putting this place on the map for people who want real authentic Mexican food and aren't afraid to try a little 'hole in the wall'. Adding pictures of the menu and some of the items we got. Sorry they are half eaten but I thought of taking after I had finished my meal lol. On the weekend they also have barbacoa which I haven't tasted but the parents say it's pretty good!
