After a few long hours of shopping, we were famished.

Along the way home my husband pointed out Habanero's. He said he wanted to try it so off we went. 

The establishment was very clean when we stepped foot inside, the cashier was very helpful and answered any questions we had. Prices are very reasonable and portions are big, our total for our meals with three drinks only came out to $30. It's definitely a step up from Roberto's. 

Item's ordered:

- Fish burrito
- Carne asada burrito
- 2 carne asada tacos
- Chicken taquitos meal

The taquitos meal came with a side of rice and beans, there were 5 taquitos, which was surprising because most establishments only include 3. They were topped off with lettuce, cheese, and guacamole. The carne asada tacos were served on an average sized tortilla instead of the typical small ones and came topped with tomatoes, lettuce, cilantro, and guacamole, surprising as well since most places charge extra for guacamole. Carne asada burrito was huge, so was the fish burrito. Downside, they use frozen fish sticks for the fish burrito. You could taste them, that's the only complaint. Overall, everything was good and had good flavor. They have a good variety of self serve salsa's as well. 

Employees were very nice, we came in with our two small boys and the cashier put on a movie for them to watch meanwhile we dined, so thank you Habanero's!
