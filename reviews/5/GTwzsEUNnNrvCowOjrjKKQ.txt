Wow! Finally some REAL home made Mexican food!!! Had the chicken mole taco and the grilled chicken tacos too! Both were full of flavor and tasted great! The rice and beans were fresh and tasted great! Pricing was decent for 3 tacos, rice and beans 10.00. Place is a good size and very colorful atmosphere! Staff and service was great as well! I will be visiting this place often! Keep up the great work! The only negative about this place is that the food is too healthy! I was starving an hour later!!!
