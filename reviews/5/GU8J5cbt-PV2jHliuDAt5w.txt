Great for lunch on a warm spring day on the patio. Went with my bf and got some mango margaritas on special for cinco! Waitress was really nice and brought us extra chips and salsa already packed up with our Togo boxes. I thought that was an awesome extra touch without us even asking... Now we have dinner :)
