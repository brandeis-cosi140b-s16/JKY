Yes, sometimes the service can be slow. If you are in a hurry, I'm sure that there is a taco shop somewhere close to you. If you are looking for THE BEST Mexican Food restaurant in Phoenix, El Conquistador is it. I cannot recommend this place enough to everyone I know. The old location used to be close to my house, but we still drive 15 miles out of our way to come here every week. The food is consistently outstanding. My favorite is the enchiladas verdes con pollo. Delicious!!!  The new location is at 5350 West Bell Road, Suite 123-124, Glendale, AZ 85308.
