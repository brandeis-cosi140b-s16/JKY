I love their fish Tacos, probably the best I have ever had!!
plus I'm always greeted very nicely and the couple the own and manage the place are very sweet and nice.
Highly recommend it for lunch or dinner, too bad I live 20 minutes away in Tempe, Still worth the drive I do to go there once every 2 weeks or so, just can't stay away!
