I'm going to weigh in here after eating on the other side of town at a more expensive restaurant. We love this place and eat here when we want Mexican.We should have come here tonight!  It is informal, fast food but the fish tacos are really good and the food comes ready for you to spice yourself over at the salsa bar (great idea!). Flavors are always good, the food quality is high for this kind of a place and it is very competitively priced.
