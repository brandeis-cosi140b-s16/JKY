The only place to get great New Mexican food in town.  Just a small spot with great food and wonderful staff.  They are always so friendly.  Some nights there are lines out the door depending on whats on special.  Every year they sell fresh Green Chile from New Mexico and roast it outside. When you order your meal ask for warm green chile sauce on the side-YUMMY.  Their Red Chile sauces are heavenly too! For those of us from that part of the Southwest coming here is like a trip back home.
