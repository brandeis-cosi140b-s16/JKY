Now THIS is authentic.. Little Mexico I call it.

I'm not even into tostadas or octopus but my boyfriend made me try his octopus tostada..that was super good and i don't remember what my plate was called but it was some type of cheesy shrimp..shrimp drowned in cheese. I had plenty of chips to eat it with and their cute huge glass of a strawberry smoothie. Try everything on there.. You won't be disappointed! Everything taste so home made and hot as its served!
