My two kids and I ate at the Julio G's quick counter service area for lunch today. We had the sampler platter which was really good and more than enough to feed all three of us. Chips and salsa were great, service was friendly. Where else can you get a nice Mexican lunch for $10 for three people? We will certainly be back.
