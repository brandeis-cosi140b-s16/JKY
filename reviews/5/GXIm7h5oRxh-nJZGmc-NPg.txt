The epitome of "hole in the Wall" as most of us say it, "El Rincocito", takes the corner as its name means, of a tiny strip mall that shares a parking lot of a condo complex. This strip mall consists of a small convenient store, a laundromat and the taco shop. When you look at the outside of the taco shop, a plain white building with a simple blue sign, It doesn't seem like much. It's a small spot that fits the kitchen that practically opens up to a single picnic bench inside. Outside are a couple more picnic tables and a makeshift condiment table. The menu is simple, but has the spanish to english translation of it's items. They have tacos, burritos, tortas and soups. I decided on 2 carne asada tacos. They have two sizes, small and large. I get the small. When they come out the meat is sizzling and you can smell the corn tortilla. The sizzling morsels of meat look delicious and are mounds on my plate on top of the four corn tortillas. They give you a plate of cilantro, onions, radish and some limes all freshly cut and smell amazing! I take one of the corn tortillas put some meat on it. I start to layer the cilantro, onions, and radish and the colors of the layers look beautiful. I squeeze a bit of lime to top it off. Now for the bite! All the flavors send my mouth on a trip! It's so fresh, refreshing, and tatses great! Definitely the closest to a taco shop in mexico I have ever had! The two small carne asada tacos actually had enough for four. they give you a good amount of meat that is enough for the four corn tortillas they also give you. The same goes for the large tacos.The price to portion ratio is really good. Also, they have two types of salsa, red and green. Unfortunately my stomach can't handle spicy foods and I didn't wanna ruin my story so I waited to put it in the end :) The service is great and usually it's the same 2 cooks.They do speak broken english, but definitely try to use what little they know. They have a tip jar so be sure to tip them!
