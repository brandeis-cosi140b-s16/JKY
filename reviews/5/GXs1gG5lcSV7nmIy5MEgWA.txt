So the first time i came here was because It was closer than robertos, but so glad that I did, now i come back here because the food quality is high end at fast food prices.  The food is fresh, the machaca is made with fresh cracked eggs that dont sit in a container all day, and this is by far the cleanest taco shop I have been to.  The spicy green taco sauce is awesome.  Today I'll try the poached marlin, carnitas, and adobada tacos... and the flan is home made.
