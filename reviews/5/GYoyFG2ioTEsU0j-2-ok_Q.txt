The dining experience is more than I'd expect from a place like this. It's like I'm dinning at a 5 star restaurant-- I'm exaggerating, of course--with people coming over and asking how my food is, asking if I need anything else, taking away my plates. Can I give you a tip for god sakes? 

I'm always impressed when people learn my name and that definitely earns points from me. Right now, I'm obsessed with their pan seared salsa verde shrimp tacos.  You gotta try them! I have horrible cravings for those bad boys.

They also make sure you keep coming back.  One time, they messed up my order and because of it, they gave me a card that entitled me to one free taco for my inconvenience.  I wasn't even mad or upset about it, but I wasn't gunna pass up a free taco either.
