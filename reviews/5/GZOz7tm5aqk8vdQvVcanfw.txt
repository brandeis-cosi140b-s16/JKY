I've been here a few times, and its always delicious! I almost always order their carnitas tacos because well, it is pretty tasty! Shrimp tacos are delicious too, but imo there's too little shrimp in them. Their asada is ok, got a lot better than last time I came. All in all, I think this is a great joint to visit if you're looking for affordable and tasty mexican food.
