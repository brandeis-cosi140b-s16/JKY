I have not visited a Qdoba since 2009 when I left Seattle. When I moved to Charlotte and found out there was one here I was amped. My memories of this place did not disappoint. It was everything I remembered.

The chicken was juicy and seasoned, fork tender. The Mexican gumbo was spot on. The guacamole was to die for. I am happy to be reunited with one of my favorite places to eat. Everything was fresh and the service was great.
