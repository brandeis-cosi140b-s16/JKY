Yay for street food! And this one of my favorites in Phoenix. Food is served out of a kitchen trailer behind Charlie's ... cheap, very tasty food, including the best carne asada I've ever had from a commercial source. I had a chance to try even more of their great food at the appreciation gathering for the 2009 Pride Volunteers. It was fitting that Phoenix Pride chose them to cater the event; helping to set up Pride and making it run smoothly was hard work but a lot of fun, and this was a delicious way to cap the event.
