Beat the crowd! 
We are first timers here. Wasnt sure how to order but the friendly staff and owner was there to make sure everything went smooth. Just 5 days open and the crew did an A+ job!

Ordered 4 Jaburritos. And all of them were delicious! 
They have a few different pre-selected menu items but if you want to create your own they have that option too. 

Definitely going to eat here again!
