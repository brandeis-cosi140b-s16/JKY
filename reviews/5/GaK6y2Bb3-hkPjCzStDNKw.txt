If you want Great Mexican. Nice servers. Unlimited salsa & chips. To be stuffed because portions But Sooo Goood you can't stop eating. Then way down Florence is Mia Amegos. Some say not authentic Mexican But  Good enough for this redneck. I think it's the Best. Now we eat couple times a week. If you are not sure what to choose- just ask the waitress to surprise you I have done several times and always Sooo Goood
