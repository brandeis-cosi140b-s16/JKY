Legit.

The menu is very very simple, but the food is outstanding. The location - not so much... However, I would definitely come back here if I was in the downtown area. 

Molly and I sampled everything they offered on the menu (there's like 3 things, and they are basically all different versions of the same thing), and we both ordered seconds. It's a small place - there's more seating on the patio outside than inside. The owner said he wanted to do a food truck - I think the menu is probably better suited for that. 

This place kicks the collective asses of most of the fancy Arizona Mexican "Street Tacos" that you would find around the Valley. This is definitely more authentic... as others have stated, it's very much like something you would get in Mexico (though I've never had anything nearly this good in Mexico).
