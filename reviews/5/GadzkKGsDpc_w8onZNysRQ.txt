I cant believe I haven't written a review on one of my favorite places yet! I love me some Cantina Laredo!
Andy and I come here all the time, Edwardo is the best bartender ever. We always call ahead to make sure hes working because he truly brings the whole experience together. 
The happy hour is amazing here. They have a full HH menu that is 50% off and it includes a few of our favorite items. 
The very first thing I have ever tried here still remains my absolute favorite. The Ahi 
Mini-crispy tacos with sushi cut ahi tuna, chipotle aioli, jicama slaw and guacamole. The ahi is so fresh and flavorful. The guac is homemade to perfection!
On to our second favorite. The Tacos de Barbacoa. Slow-roasted brisket with marinated onions, monterey jack cheese and cilantro. delish!
The crab cakes are also very good. But the apple pie... you cant beat.
The apple Pie comes in a hot skillet and smokes with Mexican Brandy Butter and topped with cinnamon ice cream. I could go into a diabetic coma and be ok with it by eating 5 of these.
And you cant forget about my favorite part of any meal... THE DRINKS! Their house-made margaritas are great. Edwardo was telling us that they do not use sweet and sour, which is great because most bars do. To make their margaritas they actually hand squeeze every juice that goes into them. And you can truly tell. They even have pineapple infused tequila which makes for great shots.

I highly recommend visiting this jewel tucked away in Tivoli Village. Not only is the restaurant stunning, there is so much more to discover here.
