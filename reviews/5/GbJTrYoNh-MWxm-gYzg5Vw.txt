This place is always clean when I come in. There aren't usually many customers, but the atmosphere is so pleasant that I keep coming back sometimes just to be in the building. It has a very authentic feel on the inside. Nice dark green carpeting, clean red leather seats and pleasant music. Chips and salsa are promptly served and your drink comes quickly (and I'm weird about the taste of water, so trust me when I say the water here tastes great!). The servers are always very nice and they don't make a lot of small talk (huge plus if you're like me) so they take your order and take it right in. The seats are comfortable and the decor is relaxing, with two TVs to watch. Food comes out in literally about 6-8 minutes. I SWEAR ON MY LIFE this place had the BEST Carne Asada Burrito I have EVER eaten. The meat isn't over-salted, the guac inside doesn't take up a lot of room but it tastes so refreshing. The Pico De Gallo served on the side tastes incredibly fresh and the fact that I eat it and enjoy it is a testament to Don Lencho's because I actually hate tomatoes. I also hate sour cream but I eat it here because its so light and delicate tasting. The lettuce served on the plate looks and tastes freshly chopped. I don't think anything I've eaten here wasn't made here. My plate is always clean at the end. (I also usually order their Mexican rice to accompany my taste buds while I visit burrito-land) I can't believe what a gem this restaurant is and I will always come here when I want Carne Asada. Its so fairly priced. I literally pay about $6.50 for their Carne Asada burrito and the side of rice is $2.50 so my bill always comes out under $10. I tip them well every time as a result. If you haven't been here yet, you should visit. (Seriously I went on a cruise vacation down the southwest side of Mexico and NO place had a burrito this good!!!)
