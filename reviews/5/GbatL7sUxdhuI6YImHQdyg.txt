The food was great, and the service was excellent.  We had a group of almost 30 people, and this group has gone to a lot of restaurants together.  When service over 20 people most restaurants have an issue getting that many meals out in a timely matter, so we have just come to expect it.  Well not here, Once the first plate was served all the others were served as fast as 2 waiters could hand them to us.  Oh buy the way the manager was smart, since he recognized one of us, from another large group, he gave us all the drink at happy hour prices.

This place knows how to bring people back.
