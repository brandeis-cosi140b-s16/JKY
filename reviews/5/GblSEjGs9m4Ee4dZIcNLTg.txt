I've only been there once while in town for a conference, but MAN OH MAN was Vida ever delicious. I was with a group of 7 and expected sub-par service with such a large group, but our waiter was on point and very responsive. The chips & salsa and guac weren't anything earthshattering but better than your average Mexican dive restaurant. The entrees really brought down the house. I had just the simple tacos and was blown away. The tortillas were just ever so slightly cripsy, light, and very very fresh tasting. I generally hate when beans and rice get together (and they were definitely frolicking together on my plate), but the black beans were seasoned just perfectly and made a great complement to the meal.
