LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Very casual, come as you are atmosphere. We usually get it to go so we can stuff our face w/o being judged...lol Taco Salad is one of my favorites. Don't let the word salad turn you off cause seriously there is nothing healthy about it. Lots of chicken, beans, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and guac. Oh yeah some shredded lettuce too. 
My second favorite is the carnitas burrito. OMG sooo good! 
Don't forget to try the homemade green sauce, red sauce and pickled spicy veggies.
