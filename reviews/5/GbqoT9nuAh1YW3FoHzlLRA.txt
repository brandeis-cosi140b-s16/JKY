I remember eating here very often when it was located at the previous location. I graduated and moved on and now I come back to review and they have moved so I am wondering if my opinion is even valid. However, for whatever it's worth, I do want to share that their beefsteak tacos with cilantro and onion with a hint of lime is absolutely as authentic as it gets from Mexico. I always ordered the tacos with rice and beans. If not ordering take-out and dining-in, I do agree with everyone's love for the never ending chips and salsa. I almost got full for over eating the chips one time. Despite the apparent decline in service from other reviews, I am purely making my high marks for their authentic Mexican tacos and bottomless chips and salsa. I am a creature of habit...when I find something I love and taste, I stick to it and don't order other things on the menu. I only went their to eat my beefsteak tacos. Uno mas!
