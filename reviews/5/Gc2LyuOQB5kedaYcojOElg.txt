Now THIS is a Mexican restaurant! (Not just a glorified taco and burrito making machine!) Atmosphere is sophisticated but unpretentious. Great drinks, attentive service and OUTSTANDING sensitively prepared food. I had their seafood enchiladas and the shrimp and scallops inside were clearly fresh and delicious. Had flan for dessert, which was among the best I've ever had - - light and fluffy and not too syrupy sweet. I shall return!
