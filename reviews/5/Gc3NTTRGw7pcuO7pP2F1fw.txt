This is hands down the best green chili burro and tacos you can find. The flavor is absolutely unbeatable, the green chili burro is like nothing you have ever tasted before, it is a tastebuds dream, so much in just one bite. The tacos, both chicken and beef are just amazing, the crispy shell and the flavor of the meat is just heavenly. 
 Lito's is a must try, once will never be enough. The down side is it has limited seating about 6-10 people , so might be best to order and take it to go
