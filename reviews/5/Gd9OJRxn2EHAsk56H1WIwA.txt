I've been following the scent of green corn tamales covered in green chili sauce since this family owned establishment was on the south side of Phoenix.  The crispy chicken tacos are excellent and do ask for a side of the green chili sauce to dopple on top.  I agree with Pity D.  --Much better than Frank and Lupes or Los Olivos.  Hey they got cold beer too.

Say hi to Gloria for me... she is the sweetest woman on earth.
