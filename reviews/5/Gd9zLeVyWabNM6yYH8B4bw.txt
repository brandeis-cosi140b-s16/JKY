This place was awesome. From the music to the food to the atmosphere. I came here with my husband for dinner and we were impressed upon walking into the place. We live in San Diego but were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10 year anniversary. We decided to come here in search of Mexican food. This restaurant did not disappoint, which is saying something since finding authentic Mexican food is pretty easy where we live. 
We ordered off the happy hour menu and got a variety of tacos plus the chips and salsa. The salsa tastes very fresh and the chips are delicious. The chicken tacos were so good. 
We loved the staff. Loved the music. Wish we could come back!
