Found this place to be a fun hang out. Hard to find a place that has  Hookah. Full on restaurant food (Actual cooked food not microwave heated) and it has a dance floor with live dj too. cool place to come if you want the best of all worlds; Hookah, food music and the don't rush you to get out. the have a large space so you and your friend can spend time together and not feel like you are on a time restriction. We were always asked if we needed something and were not felt neglected. 

If you want a place to hang and chill for a while, I highly recommend this Place.
