On my way to airport to get a flight back to Dallas and I stopped at this place. Shredded beef burrito - awesome!  Very beefy, no skimping, and mammoth for $4.00. I knew It would be good when I unwrapped it and the saw the ultra-fresh  flour tortilla.  Also got a shredded beef taco. Only $1.50 and it was very fresh with freshly fried shell. 

If this place only rates 3 or 4 stars by the locals - they must be getting some great food elsewhere.  I'm goo through the drive thru again next time I'm in town. BTW: the drive thru service was faster than I expected.
