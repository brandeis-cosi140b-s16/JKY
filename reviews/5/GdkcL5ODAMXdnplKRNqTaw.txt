Truly one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale- and that's saying A LOT as we are blessed with an abundance of exquisite food here.

Came here for the first time on a first date and absolutely loved every moment -company included! ;-)

Firstly, the d√©cor, ambiance, candles, and dim lighting here is really beautiful and romantic. 

I had a superb white Sangria and we ordered the tableside guac and housemade chips to split. It was a generous helping and both were astoundingly delicious. I will say that while the guacamole is stellar here, it does not (IMO) unseat the undisputed Guac champion- Barrio Queen (which is right around the block). 

The chips were better here though.

Main course- I ordered the Florida Grouper with Paella reduction, banana crab croquette, brussels sprouts, crispy quinoa & pickled gueros. This fish was SO BOMB. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. Who knew Grouper was so good? The brussel sprouts (which is not my fave vegetable by any means), crispy quinoa, AND the crab cake were also uber yum-tastic!

My date had the Alaskan Cod which came with Purple & romanesco cauliflower, toasted farro, leek & garlic mote & smoked pasilla sabyon- he raved about how tasty it was.

For dessert we ordered the fried bananas which came with dulce de leche ice cream (or gelato?) and this outstanding peanut butter moussey-stuff on the side. So freakin' yummy OMG.

It's pricey, but 100% worth the cost. Will definitely return!
