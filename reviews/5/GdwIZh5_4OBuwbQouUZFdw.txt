Cantina! I LOVE this place!

The patio is amazing. They updated it a few years ago and it is incredible now. The front bar also has a really cool vibe to it, and the back room is good for large groups and dinner.

The food here is really actually very good! I used to just come here for drinks, but the brunch menu is to die for, and the dinner and late-night food is notable as well. Very vego friendly, with veggie taco options and other snacks and sides, all which are worth trying at some point. The red salsa that comes with chips is super sweet and spicy, but the guacamole is my favourite to go with a meal or as a snack. For a while there, my friends and I were Cantina guac addicts.

The drinks are cheap, especially for a place with as nice an atmosphere as Cantina. The margarita menu has everything you could ever dream of at a Mexican bar, and I've tried them all. The El Camino and the strawberry one are my favourite. The beers are also cheap, with lots of local and Mexican selections available. They have micheladas, too, but I have yet to try them because I can't seem to stop ordering margaritas here even when I try to tell myself to order something new.

Thursday karaoke night is worth checking out. You don't have to sing, just go and enjoy it. There are mad drink specials that night, too.
