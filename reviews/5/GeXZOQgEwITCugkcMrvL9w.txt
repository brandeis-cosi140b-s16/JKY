THIS WAS AN AWESOME FIND!
Took a road trip with my Dad, and he guided me to this place, awesome. Very few places can pull off the authentic ambiance and Mexican flavor. I dare say it gets close ( I said close not there) to my Mom's cooking. 
Went here for brunch on a Sunday, mellow. 
They bring out chips and a good salsa, next when you order they bring you SOPA!/soup as an appetizer, included. Huevos con chorizo, are great. Next time I'm in Vegas, will make the trip over to this place on my break from rolling the dice. 
Worth the trek or cab ride if your looking for a hangover cure.
