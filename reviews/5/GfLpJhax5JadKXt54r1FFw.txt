We think it's perfect for what it's meant to be - an inexpensive but quality Mexican place.  We have been there about 4-5 times to dine-in, and we will be going there anytime Grandpops is in town.  I can not confirm that I have been there to pick up a carne asada burrito right before they close.  The salsa bar is nice - between the 4 of us we have to make 3 different combinations of salsa.  We would give it 4.5 stars if we could - had to give it a 5 to balance out the others.  It's family friendly - small dining area - can only seat around 25-35 people.  Definitely a family owned place, which is a plus in our minds.  They are closed on Sundays.
