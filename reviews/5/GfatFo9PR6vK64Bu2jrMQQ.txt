Just had brunch here and it was fantastic.  Our server Lorenzo was great.  We had a Bloody Mary and it was very spicy.  Could have used an olive or two but even without it, we loved it.  I had the brisket burrito with egg and jalape√±o. The salsa that was on the side was fresh and spicy as well.  We can't wait to come back.
