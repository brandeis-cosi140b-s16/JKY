I grew up in Arizona and enjoy many different styles of Mexican food. People who know the difference between Sonoran style, Baja style, Santa Fe style, and Tex Mex style Mexican foods understand that this is great food. Garcia's is a great Sonoran style mexican food restaurant. This location is one of the newer locations in this chain, and the carry on the 60+ years of tradition very well. Sometimes service is hit or miss. But the food is always spot on. Make sure you know what you want, what style mexican food you are expecting before trying something new.
