There seems to be a few negative reviews here, but I think whatever they've been smoking has affected their taste buds.  I grew up in Southern CA and have seen Mexican food from mom & pop hole-in-the wall joints to the latest trendoid fantasies.  I think Agave is the best "upscale" Mexican food I've encountered, by a large measure.  The margaritas are exceptional as well.   Also, if you ask if they have any hotter sauce than the three they serve by default, they have a nice Habanero based sauce that fits the bill nicely (I was there with my 84-year-old mom who grew up eating hot chilies on a farm, and likes her Mexican food *hot*).   I ordered a black-bean, chicken & grilled veg burrito (I forget the exact title of the dish), that was world-class, the treatment of the sauce & cheese on the outside reminded me of some of the best Italian calzone's I've had, and the flavor of the components inside was truly awe-inspiring.  The service was excellent and friendly too.  I'll be back to try some of their other goodies, and soon, as Agave was an incredible taste treat.  The only thing I could find wrong with it if I was extremely picky, was the music was a little louder than I would have liked (weekend at peak of dinner though, so it was not all that unexpected).   I'd go there just for the margaritas, if that was all I was after, as the house margarita was exceptional, and I tried one other which was equally good-- in itself no mean feat, making a really good margarita is an art, and I'd say at Agave, there are artists in both the kitchen and the bar....
