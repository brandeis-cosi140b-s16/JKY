The food is delicious, having only naturally raised meats, Non GMO ingredients, and organic produce. The food is all cooked to order and prepared right in front of you by very high energy, smiling people! The dining room is kept clean and you can see right into the kitchen which is also very clean and organized! My favorite is the brown rice, pinto beans, fajitas, chicken, hot salsa, and the best guacamole made fresh every morning! Healthy, delicious, and filling and very quick service. There was 20 customers in front of me and I had my food  in 7 minutes!
