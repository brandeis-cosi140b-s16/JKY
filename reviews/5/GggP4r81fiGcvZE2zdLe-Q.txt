Very friendly, sweet owners. Very DELICIOUS, authentic Mexican food! The beans were so good, and we loved all their homemade salsas. I had the carne asada burrito and loved it (which was a change for me - normally I'm a true-blue vegetarian burrito lover!). My husband order their tacos, and then went back later to order to more, they were so good. What a great little restaurant!
