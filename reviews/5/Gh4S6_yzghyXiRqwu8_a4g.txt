5 stars for a neighborhood fast foodish dive? Yup.

Carne asada is great here of course, but really, I love being a 4 minute walk from some of the best Birria de Chivo ever. Big chunks of lamb, little chunks of fat, in a spicy, soupy broth. 

Great head, too. By that, I mean I love their cabeza taco. 

Plus, they are open late.
