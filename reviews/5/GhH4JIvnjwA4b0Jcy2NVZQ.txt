Great portions ! Food is delicious and very flavorful.  

Environment is cozy to me with lots of tv's giving it that sports mexican bar theme going.

Family friendly, and they have plenty of boothes(for parents).

The team is very attentive and on point.  Didn't have to ask for one refill and I drink a lot !! (Water)
