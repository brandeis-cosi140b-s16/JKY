As we weren't in the mood to go out tonight...ok it's a football night! We decided to order delivery. We didn't want the same ole pizza or sammys so we tried the little brother app to Yelp called Eat24. That app lists all delivery and take out restaurants. We had never tried this place before but most of the reviews were great. 
We ordered three entr√©e dinners. I had the biggest tamale I've ever had in my life. As I had let my hubby order for me I thought it was a burrito! And so full of chicken. And obviously not too much masa. The cheese chilies releno (can't spell) was not breaded. This was awesome. My taco was not the best but that was completely MY fault. I left it in the container too long and it became chewie. But what was in it was great. 
Lime rice and beans completed the dinners. 

We will continue to try new things at this location and even stop in.  Great Dinner!!
