This place is incredible. 

From the guacamole that includes fresh mexican cheese & orange, to the perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY spiced carnitas, I simply cannot find anything bad about Gallo Blanco. Even the chips and salsa were great, with fresh chips and some absolutely spicy/delicious green and red salsas. 

Hip atmosphere, melt in your mouth pork, delicious carne asada, and great prices help round this place out for a 5. 

Thanks again for the great meal, Gallo Blanco.
