One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants around. Awesome chips ad salsa, great environment and great nice and friendly service. Food comes out fast and fresh, no complaints at all. Favorite meal is the burrito meal that is covered with cheese and sour cream and awesome tender juicy chicken inside burrito. Highly recommended Garcia's!! Can't go wrong
