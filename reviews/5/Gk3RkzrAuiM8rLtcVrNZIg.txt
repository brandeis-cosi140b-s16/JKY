I think Chipotle is my favorite fast food chain, menu-wise. No complaints about the food sold by Chipotle. It's always been fresh, flavorful and reliable. I think their guacamole is the best of the fast food restaurants.  The quality is worth the money, in my book. The restaurants are always decent-looking and they do an above-average job of keeping the "amenities" section clean and stocked, I think. 

The amount of food you get definitely depends on who is on duty. I've asked for extra rice or extra beans, and some workers are tightfisted, while others are more reasonable or even generous. 

(Now, if this chain would be more cooperative regarding their tomato pickers, I'd have no qualms about frequenting Chipotle!! Yes, the political is personal...)
