The quality of their meat (not meet as it is spelled on their menu,  lol) is second to none, and they are not shy putting it on whatever you get either. Their cheese is top notch and they have the absolute best fountain Coca-Cola I have ever had, of all things. They are consistent, friendly, and not overly expensive. The place is clean, and other than the spelling errors on their menus both inside and out, this place is absolute perfection!
