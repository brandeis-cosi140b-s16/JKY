Super legit Mexican food. Better than other local chains ending in "o's". 

Great prices. Regular chicken burrito is like $5.02 with tax.

Eat here about once a week for the past 6 months. Had about every burrito and platter on the menu. Can't really go wrong. Adobada is a little greasy for my taste but coworkers and friends have enjoyed it.

Personal favorite burritos: regular chicken, california.
