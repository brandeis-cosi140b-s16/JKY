Good food! Have been searching for a reasonable Mexican restaurant in tempe for a while now. The first time I drove by I didn't stop because it didn't look like a sit down restaurant. After reading some yelp reviews I decides to give it a go. I am glad I did. It was priced very fairly. Their specials are awesomely priced, and very tastey.  Great rolled tacos with rice and beans. Pretty good salsa too. Little upset at the lack of free chips/salsa, but overall a dinner for two and chips was under $20. I'll take that any day of the week. I plan to return soon.
