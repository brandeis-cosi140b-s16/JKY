I love chipotle. They have a next generation business model, they support ethical farming practices and use high quality ingredients. I eat here all the time, I always see them rotating their foods, keeping things fresh,  checking temperatures. I love everything about chipotle. I will continue standing behind chipotle and any businesses that are conscious of their impact on the planet and their impact in the animals they farm. More businesses need to get on track like chipotle. Lolol I'm sounding like a commercial but I seriously cannot emphasize this enough
