I just moved into the valley and found Carlsbad Tavern.  I've been back three times in three weeks.
I just love the fairly authentic New Mexican food!
I just love Hatch green chiles.  Their carne a 
Asada and carne adovada is fantastic!
Their drinks are wonderful.
My only suggestion is that the owners send their waiters on a field trip to Albuquerque to sample the real thing so they are more knowledgable about what the serve.
