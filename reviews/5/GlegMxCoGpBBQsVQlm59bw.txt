This place has one of my favorite dishes in this town. And while I know everything they put out in this place is not perfect, the consistent perfection of this one dish garners them five stars in my world.

                  CONSOMMÉ LOCO

Consommé is a clarified chicken stock. And theirs is a complex concoction served with chicken pieces (white meat only), rice, cilantro, onion, and avocado. And I add a few hearty squeezes of lime for good measure.  It's soulful and simple and demands attention.  

I always get the soup and a carne asada quesadilla. The deed fried quesadilla is always perfectly seasoned and crisp. The gooey cheese and crispy pocket puts those (healthier, lighter) quesadilla to shame. 

Aside from that amazing soup and the delicious quesadillas, they are one of the few places that has a deeply interesting and flavorful sauce on their chilaquiles.  

I've tried their tacos and a few other plates and been satisfied. Not overwhelmed, but satisfied. I would not recommend their tacos when there are so many other great things to try at Antojos. 

That said, I have such respect for the consistency and quality of the food coming out of this place. I'm always surprised that they are not more crowded. Oh, there won't be many open tables when you get there for lunch, but you'll order and be served very quickly. 

I don't know if this place is still considered a hidden gem since it has been lauded and discussed in a number of publications. But it is one of the rare gems in this valley. And I can't wait to go back.
