A refreshing change in the boring Phoenix cuisine. Highly recommended if want to liven up your palette instead of dining at some cookie cutter chain restaurant. Adobo Dragon is located in DeSoto Market which is was formally a DeSoto auto dealership. It's a wonderfully restored building with a quaint casual atmosphere.
