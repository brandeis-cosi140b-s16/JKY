Food and service was excellent! First time here and as I was deciding the worker never made me feel rushed. He welcomed the guest behind me as I continued to choose between beans or no beans. After he was finished with me, he instantly gave them the save positive attitude he gave me and apologized for the delay in assistance. Great service, great food, great price! COME TO HAWAII!
