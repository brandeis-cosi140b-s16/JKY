Wow!!! Absolutely LOVED this place!!! Out of all the restaurants we went to in Vegas this was our whole family's favorite. They had a separate line for specific foods, so make sure to pick the line for the food you want. The line for the Adobada tacos was a lot shorter than the line for the Cabeza tacos and moving a lot faster so we ordered Adobada tacos.  Mmmmm. Delicious! So glad we decided to try this little gem in Las Vegas NV! Will be back next time we're in Las Vegas.
