The BEST Mexican food in the Valley.Hands down.nothing fancy not even a spot to sit and eat indoors but if your looking for Sonoran-style Mexican food this is THE spot great green chile,the best tacos around and if you love re fried beans like I do,do not leave here w/o trying these,on a tostada,on the side,but if your not watching calories for the next month,in a burro w/cheese deep fried OMG! This would be my choice for a "last meal"  I challenge anyone to give me a better spot than this,and please do not say Carolinas because I will hunt you down and slap a B*#+*
