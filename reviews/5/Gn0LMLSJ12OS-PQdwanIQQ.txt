This is the brand new Cafe Rio right of 215 beltway on Durango. It's big and beautiful inside. The food is amazing just like all the other Cafe Rios. Because it's new, the lines are long around lunch and dinner time so expect 10 mins or so. The line keeps moving though so don't sweat it.  Also parking is limited due to construction but there are more spots out behind the building. 

I really enjoy the salads but make sure and tell them shredded lettuce because its more bite sized. Also ask for a scoop of Fresca sauce if you want to add a little spicy salsa.

Burritos are good too but get them to put pico and lettuce inside. Always get it enchilada(smothered) style so they send it through and melt down the cheese and sauce. I usually do mild(green sauce) with the chicken or seafood and the red sauce with Pork or beef as its a bit sweet.

So happy to have a location down the street from my house now. Gonna have to start walking here to work off all the calories. ;-)
