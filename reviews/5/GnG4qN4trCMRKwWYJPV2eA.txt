Best mexican fast food in the Mesa area that I've found so far.  I personally find their crunchy tacos are more well seasoned then their traditional soft tacos. Which is a little weird; but I imagine, they're more popular anyways.  They have the best fast food enchiladas I've ever tasted hands down! 

I also have had the chile relleno which was a little too coated.  I think there was more batter than chile relleno and they didn't deseed the chile so it was mega hot; but still tasty. Also had the beef sope, which was good, but I found out I'm not a huge fan of lots of masa.  Their pastor tacos were a little dry and not completely trimmed of fat, so watch out.. Similar situation with their steak and chicken soft tacos--dry meat. But for $1 a taco, you can't really complain.  The soft tacos are the size of street tacos but loaded with meat.  The crunchy are your normal size and are a little more expensive.  Their rice is pretty exceptional since it has chunks of carrot in it and their refried beans are not that bad either.  For some odd reason, when we've had leftovers, they're better the second day.  I'm guessing it's because it was fresh when we got it.

They've got a drive thru which is pretty nifty.  We did eat in one time but I ended up being the only female there and was pretty uncomfortable until some other gals walked in.  The neighborhood's a little rough but it still could be worth going in for their salsa bar which includes an avocado salsa and limes--they have to go containers for their salsa bar.
