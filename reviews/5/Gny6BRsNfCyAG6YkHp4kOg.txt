I was about to give this place four stars, but I'm going with five, hoping to boost the taco joint's overall rating.

I have no idea what these bad reviews are talking about. I have eaten here twice now, and I have had a great experience both times.

I recently moved to Glendale/Peoria from San Diego County, CA. San Diego's kinda famous for its burritos (I don't know if you've heard; they're kind of a big deal) so I have high standards. But I was not disappointed here.

Twice now I've purchased the carne asada fries. The fries are crinkle cut, and the meat is tender. The salsas are great. 

My partner likes the chimichanga plate and the carne asada burrito. Apparently "the shredded beef in the chimi is perfect, and the shell stays crispy without getting soggy." But with the burrito, "the tortilla is just amazing."

Also, prices are great. I fed my whole family - four full grown adults with big appetites - for $30. Definitely coming back whenever we don't feel like cooking.
