Absolutely love this place.   The ambiance, the skirt steak.....the MARGARITAS..
They are exactly how I like them, strong & cheap.   

Sunday is ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR?  Yes please.
Bottomless mimosa's were incredible one particular Sunday, I truly felt like our server was like a Wimbledon Ball return girl with the speed and perfect timing of her mimosa pouring skills.  TOP NOTCH.  After finding our own seats (we had an awkward sit down but after being shuffled to 2 other tables) and the chips and salsa showed up, immediately rectifying the situation as we began our affair with the chips and it's salsa sidekick.   

Any longtime downtown resident was terribly concerned about any business being successful on this seemingly jinxed corner.   PAZ knocked it out of the park.   Hella5 on the stars.
