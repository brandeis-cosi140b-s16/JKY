Well, it took a couple of years, but I found the BEST Mexican food in the Phoenix area (I know, bold statement) thanks to fellow yelpers!  The food, decor, wait staff & value were second to none.  The chips and salsa were fresh and delicious.  For dinner, I got the steak a la chipotle, and Angie got the chicken a la crema.  Both come with fresh tortillas on the side, and the servings were huge.  Mexican rice, refried beans & small portion of fresh cabbage were incredible.  They also both came with fresh, sauteed mushrooms which went perfectly with both dishes.

The only negative I can offer (which was difficult, 'cause almost everything else was perfect) was the fluorescent lighting - no one wants to be reminded of "work" when they're trying to unwind with a nice meal - and the lighting reminded me of that.  Outside of the minor lighting snafu, I have nothing negative to say about this place.  We will be back, soon!
