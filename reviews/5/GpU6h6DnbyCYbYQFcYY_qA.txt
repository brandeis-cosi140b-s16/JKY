Hands down, the best Mexican restaurant in South Phoenix. The food is always hot and fresh, and the salsa is to die for! This restaurant is a legend for my family, and I.  I can remember coming to this place when I was 9 or 10 years old, and I am now 30 years old. This place is great and law enforcement/fire fighter friendly which is a plus in my book. For breakfast, I recommend the chilaquiles, and machaca
 Lunch and dinner I like to eat the shredded beef tacos, shrimp soup, green Chile chicken enchiladas etc. Everything is really delicious.
