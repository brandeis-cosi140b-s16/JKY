Came here a second time with my boyfriend, thought since it was Tuesday it would be slow .. Nope, totally packed but we got the last booth( thank you). Got the pineapple shrimp which was amazing, boyfriend got this huge plate of Carne Asada with he said was great... The manger tonight was Sean and he is amazing , he talked to us about the food and told us some hilarious stories.. Worth the trip just to talk to Sean. Rork the server was great .. My favorite place by far.
