decided to try this place after finding it here on yelp its right down the street from tacos al Gordo which we usually go to and never saw its sort of hidden. Definitely try this place it's very clean they have drive thru and are very nice you can feel the love in this place! 
Better yet my tacos came out nice and hot and the tortillas were thick and cooked right!
They actually give you your money's worth definitely picking this over tacos al Gordo next time
