Excellent service, great food and great location! We have never had to wait to be seated. Servers have been prompt with welcoming you, getting your drink order.  In other restaurants we often have to flag someone down to get a water or soda refill, not here. The employees are cheerful, prompt and don't waste time. They have good attitudes! They treat you like they are glad you are there and happy to serve you! They act like they truly enjoy their job and that shows in their service and the overall environment of the restaurant! Kuddos to them!
