Ask me, "Jason, if you can only eat a burger from one place for the rest of your life, where would it be from?". My answer is, "I will eat Fat Boy boygers from now on please." If you haven't had a burger from Fat Boy, and you think you've had "the best burger in town", you're wrong. You haven't had the best burger in town until you've had a Boyger from Fat Boy. It trumps em' all. 

We've been coming here for years, and we never tire of it. For Fathers Day, this is where I want to go each year. 

It's a hole-in-the-wall mom-n-pop shop and is family run. Able and Co. are ALWAYS pleasant and friendly, who does a great job in juggling business and family. It's nothing to be in there on a Saturday and see Able come in with the little ones in tow, having just come from soccer games. He remembers us by name. 

The Boygers are amazing. Flat grilled, fresh, and juicy. Their veggies are always fresh. I love getting bacon on mine. If you don't like your bacon crispy, be sure to let em' know when you order. Otherwise crispy it will be (which is just they way I like it!!)

I have had the Pastrami sandwich, the Pastrami Boyger, their chicken fingers, their pizza, and their Hawiian Boyger. In all the years we've been coming here, I still haven't had the Philly Steak, but only because I lover the Boyger and the Pastrami so much, I have a hard time ordering anything else. Everything we've ever had here, is out of this world. It's the one place, literally, the one place, we can go as a family, and there is something that all of us can order and be exceptionally happy. 

Like fries? Their fat fries are BOMBER!!! And they are always too hot to eat when they bring them out to you. I'm a fry snob, and I love these fries!!

Being from the East Side, we really try to support East Side businesses, espically those that are local owned. As long as Fat Boy is here, we will be there with them.
