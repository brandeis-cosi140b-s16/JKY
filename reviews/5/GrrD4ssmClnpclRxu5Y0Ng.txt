I love La Fiesta!!!    My daughter and i eat there at least once a week.
The food is ALWAYS great.... I have never once become sick from eating at La Fiesta.
Im thinking that since i eat here every week that i would have become sick by now if these... (oh i felt like a got hit by a truck comments were true)   The waiters are always very nice and helpful.  I find it odd that someone gave a bad review because they were asked too often if everything was okay.  (really)?  
So anyways after seeing some bad reviews that are quite funny btw,  i felt like i really needed to let the community know that this is a great place to eat,and have a good time.
Oh...and i see a lot of the same customers in here quite a bit,so im not the only one who thinks this place is great.
