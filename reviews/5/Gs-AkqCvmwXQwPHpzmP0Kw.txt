When I first arrived here it just was to find a seat to wait for my friend to arrive. Once I got seated I was excited to see a special for a pacifico and a shot of Patron for $8. When the bartender (Nancy) greeted me I was pleased to see she was happy to comply and get my shot and of course the beer but wanted to make sure I wanted that first since she didn't want my beer heating up. I ended up ordering the most delicious Margarita I have ever had after I asked her recommendation it was this delicious spicy watermelon mango drink. I thought I took a photo of the menu but after three drinks in I think I somehow forgot so I can't tell you the name EXACTLY but its a 10$ drink that is so delicious...It tastes like the type of Watermelon Aqua you'd get from a taqueria but it had a salted chili rim and tequlia... My favorite part of the whole experience was that I got good SERVICE with a smile! that happens less and less these days so I would recommend giving this place a try if you are at Aliante or in the mood for a good Margarita..I know I will be back soon because I LOVED my drinks...
