The most authentic Mexican I have ever had. Very simple menu, not like big Mexican restaurants where they have too much that you don't know what to choose. Made to order so everything is fresh. I got a chorizo, pork, and chicken taco. All three were awesome with the chorizo being my absolute favorite. Will definitely go back.
