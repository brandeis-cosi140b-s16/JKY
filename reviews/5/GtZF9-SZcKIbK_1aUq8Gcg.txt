We were in the mood for a taco shop but didn't feel like dealing with lines out the door as is common for some of the downtown taco shops.  

Service was excellent and they are super friendly.  Also, they have tacos with chicken breast and this is huge because I am a poultry racist.  (I just can't get into dark meat. I've tried.)  If you dine in, they bring you chips that are DELICIOUS.  Perfectly seasoned and the salsa is so good they should sell it.  (In hindsight, I should have asked because I would have loved to take some home.)  My fajita tacos were perfectly seasoned and they serve the tacos "naked" which is pretty genius because then you can visit the salsa bar and add to your heart's content.  

It's definitely divey, hole-in-the-wall-y but that's okay.  It's just off the 17 and quite convenient.  I will absolutely be coming back.
