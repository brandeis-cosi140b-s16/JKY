I don't eat Mexican cuisine very often, so I was very impressed by this restaurant. Absolutely fantastic service. Our waiter, Ernie, was very knowledgeable-- I had to ask him what he would recommend and we went through a gauntlet of questions just to get it exactly right. And I'll tell you-- it was perfect. The staff looks happy to be there, and genuinely care about their customers. It's fantastic.

The food is absolutely delicious. They serve up the fajitas by setting it on fire first, then serving it on the table. Super cool, and really pulls the atmosphere together.

I love this place, and will definitely be returning.
