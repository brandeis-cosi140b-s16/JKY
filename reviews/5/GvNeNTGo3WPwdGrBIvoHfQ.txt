The concept is typical - fast Mexican with a build your own food walk akin to Qdoba, Chipotle, Panchero's... But Salsarita's just tastes a million times better to me. I think it's the pinto beans. They're a mixture of cooked beans and smooth refried beans. Or perhaps it was the marinated chicken that almost had a smoked flavor. Whatever it was, my burrito bowl was out of this world. A madhouse of Mexican flavors for a smart price. 

My stomach wasn't remotely tore up after.
