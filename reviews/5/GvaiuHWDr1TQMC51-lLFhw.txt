Absolutely love the food here!  Some of the options sound a little weird at first, but everything tastes great!  I have been back many, many times to try out different combinations of enchiladas.  My personal favorite is combo of a spinach/mushroom enchilada and a cornbread enchilada.  
It is very crowded at lunchtime, but the service is quick.  If you order take-out, you'll be on your way in just a few minutes.  For eating in, I recommend stopping by in the early evening.
