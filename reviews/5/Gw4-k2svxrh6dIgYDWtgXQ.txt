Best lunch value in Las Vegas. You are served chips and 3 different dips (bean, salsa and avocado). Then out comes Fideo soup. You get to choose 2 items (Tacos - crispy or soft shell, Burritos or Chili Relleno). The meat can be beef (shredded or ground), pork or chicken. You also get a Margarita included with your lunch. Since I have to return to work, I always ask for a Virgin Strawberry Margarita. One of my favorite place to eat!
