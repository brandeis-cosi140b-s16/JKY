By far one of the best Mexican places downtown.  Their menu is not just burritos with American cheese like the other typical so called "Mexican" places around the corner.  Their chef has great traditional plates that you will find within the colonial belt in central Mexico. Skip the trip to the south and come try a torta, enfrijolada style.  The drinks are great, definitely a strange place to find a great spot but it goes to show that with good food, everyone will come and come back.
