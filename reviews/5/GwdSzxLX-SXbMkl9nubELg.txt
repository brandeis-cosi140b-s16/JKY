What can you say bad about the place? Good Mexican food for a good price. I eat here once in a while because it's near my home. I got carne asada fries and carnitas plate. Both bomb! Carnitas meats has a nice crisp to it and delicious taste. The asada fries were huge and Tasty as well. Will keep coming to this place.
