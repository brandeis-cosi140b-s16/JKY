We decided to try Cilantro's to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. Boy are we glad we did! We have lived in AZ for 2 years and have yet to find a GREAT taco to our liking. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and welcoming. My husband and I ordered the steak taco's. They were so delicious! The steak was very well seasoned with a lot of great flavor. It was a ton of food (2 taco's, rice, and salsa with chips) for a reasonable price. The salsa bar had a handful of options. It was fun experimenting with all the salsa's. Our son got the mini cheese quesadilla and loved it. We will definitely be going back to Cilantro's in the future!
