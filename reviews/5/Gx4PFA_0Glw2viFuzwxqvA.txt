Super legit. Chips and salsa were good (salsa wasn't good, it was great).  Ordered the chili verde burrito and my wife got the carne asada. So good. I ate my leftover (nice, big portions) chili verde burrito for breakfast this morning. I'm usually a cereal guy, so what does that tell you.

Headed back home to Wisconsin now, where the Mexican food mostly sucks. Will be dreaming of quick service in a clean little restaurant called El Sombrero.
