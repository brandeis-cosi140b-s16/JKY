My quest for the perfect tamale is over. I've found it at The Tamale Store, and I'm here to Yelp about it.

The tamales have a perfect masa (outter corn dough, not to be confused with the corn husk) to filling ratio. Often times I find that there is too much masa, but these achieve a perfect balance in each bite. The masa is moist but not mushy and absolutely scrumptious, but not too salty. Did I mention they were moist? Usually, tamales have me reaching for a glass of water to help ease the dryness down my throat, but these were perfection!

I had the green chile pork and chicken mole tamales, both of which were evenly shredded and seasoned well. I honestly can't see how you could go wrong with either of these, so if you're like me and fear a disappointing meal when it comes to a food favorite, try these first and then venture out in future visits. And you WILL be back for future visits :)
