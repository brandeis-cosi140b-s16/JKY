A+ in my opinion.  We just spend a week in Mexico (not our first time there...) and Cucos had better food than we found anywhere (Puerto Morelos/Playa del Carmen) south of the border.  The Cuco burrito is my fav and the margaritas are amazing.  We will continue to come back, the food is truly authentic.  This place beats other area Mexican chains BY FAR!  Keep it up!  Can't wait for the next time:D  My mouth waters every day when I drive past.
