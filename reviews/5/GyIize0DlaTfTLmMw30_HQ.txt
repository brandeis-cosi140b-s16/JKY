I recently ate at Super-Mex on Sunset and it was absolutely amazing! there Guacamole is creamy and the texture is among the best I've had. I ate the "street Tacos", the Carne Asada Quesadilla  and Ceviche. 
Honestly between the crazy good Salsa and the above mentioned meals...I am already planning my next dinner outting.
