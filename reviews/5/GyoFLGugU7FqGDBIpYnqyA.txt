So this is my second time with Dos.  I went for the brunch. Not sure why so many negative reviews.... This place  is great. We had Maria as our server. She was very knowledgable and had great recommendations. She is from the original agave, and even remembered me. 

You get a complimentary cocktail with brunch (choice of margarita, mimosa, screwdriver, bloodymary, coffee or tea). We sat on the patio. i ordered the 3 egg omelet with chorizo. I will come back again!!!!  It doesn't open until 11am. Perfect for a Sunday. Must go!!!
