Absolutely amazing!!!  Have been looking for a taco shop like this for some time since I moved to the PHX area.  I must say - I finally hit the jackpot.  Cabeza, tripas, pastor, carne asada, ceviche, etc....it's all fantastic so far.  They even do red munudo on the weekends (for that lovely hangover).  I HIGHLY recomment this to anyone who appreciates real mexican tacos.
