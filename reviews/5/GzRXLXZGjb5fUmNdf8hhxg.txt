These are the best Tamales I have had in a very long time.
They have several kinds.

I have only tried the Corn and the Green Chile ones.

I need to try the Spinach, and the sweet ones (for dessert).

I personally am not a huge fan of meat tamales, so I will just extrapolate, and say based on the ones that I have had, they would have to be delicious.

I have always got a bag of 6 to go, and I usually have 3 or 4 of these for lunch during the week. Green salsa on top from New Mexico and we are good to go. Yum!
