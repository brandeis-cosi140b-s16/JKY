This place is delicious! It just opened less than 2 weeks ago and we've been there twice. The service is great and the food is delicious. They give fresh chips and salsa. The pupusas are only $1.95 and are great. The street tacos are $1.50 and are really delicious. The taquitos and burritos are also fantastic. The al pastor and the carne asada are both good. We went with a large group and everyone was very happy with the food and the service. Everything is homemade and fresh! Highly recommend! We will be back a lot!
