Just love the Border Grill especially if you can get a table outside. The patio has a great view of the Mandalay Bay pool and lazy river and some shaded tables. Our server was great, very helpful and friendly. She was willing to go the extra mile to help us have a wonderful lunch. 
The following dishes were excellent. The Guacamole was creamy and tasty. Carne Asada tacos and the mahi-mahi fish tacos were juicy and perfectly prepared. We were not big fans of the 2 different syles of rice but the beans are a keeper. Of course do try the Margarita's. O-Lay
