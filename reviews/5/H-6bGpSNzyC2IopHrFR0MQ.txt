I love everything about this place.  I have been here numerous times and it is always fantastic.  My favorites are the al pastor tacos and the carne asada with chorizo tacos...so good!  The chips and black bean dip which come complimentary with all meals is delicious.  The food is fresh, flavorful and very tasty.  It's also nice that there is a public parking lot next door so you don't have to fight for a parking spot.
