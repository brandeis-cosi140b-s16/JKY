I'm a regular here with my girlfriend at least a few times per month. I like original fish tacos and she usually orders the skinny tacos which are wrapped in lettuce instead of a corn tortilla. I think they only have 110 calories each or something. The service is always great! When we sit in the dine in side Rosie is usually working. She is so nice and sweet and very patient when we have trouble making up if we want tacos or something different. Sometimes at night Andrew works and he is very nice and helpful and offers great service. We've visited serval times after midnight and the bartender Brian is very friendly and offers great service. He try's to up sale the drinks or Dessert but you expect that from any good server/bartender. They are always quick to refill your drinks or take your plates away once you are done..  I am from the Northwest which has great service and I get the same kind of service when I visit here.
