I love this place and the fact that it in walking distance.  They do make mistakes but they fix it in no time for me. The service is great. I'm not a huge Mexican fan but I love their taco salad.  For those of u who think they are in need of real Mexican food. Well here's a hint.  This is arizona not Mexico.
