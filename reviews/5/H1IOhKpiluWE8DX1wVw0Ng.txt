I'm just going to come right out and say it----- Best authentic Mexican food in Madison. I've tried so many taco joints in this town and finally I have a winner! 

Real Mexican cheeses! Homemade torta buns! Fresh fried homemade tostadas, $2 steak tacos. Winner, Winner, chicken dinner!

My favorite part about coming here is the fact that when I finish my free chips and salsa, they ask me if I would like some more. They even give me a choice of traditional homemade red salsa or salsa Verde. Love it! 

Mexican coke or any other traditional Mexican treat, your choice! They are all available.

From the time I put in my order to having a plate in front of me, I think they average around 5 minutes. Super quick service!

They are connected to Pan & Pan Mexican bakery, and when your finished eating I would suggest grabbing a sweet roll or donut for dessert. Yum! 

The servers are awesome! Very catering and caring. "Just ask and you shall receive" must be their motto. Great! 

Excellently priced.
