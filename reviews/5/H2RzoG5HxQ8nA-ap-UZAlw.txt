This place beats my old favorite in downtown Matthews (El Valle).  Great good with unmatched customer service.  Even the owners came out and asked what we thought about the food.  $2 Blue Moons on special, salsa was the best I've ever had, supreme nachos were awesome.  Wife had the fajitas and loved them.  Plenty of open seating available, nice set up, give this place a try.
