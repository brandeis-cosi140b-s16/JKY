We almost didn't go due to a couple of bad reviews but decided to check it out for ourselves. Glad we did. Greeted with a friendly smile by girl doing clean up. Waited on by friendly server who made our orders neatly and promptly. The other folks behind counter quickly responded to our special requests with a smile. We ordered nachos and the whole crew broke out in a short rendition of 'Nacho Man'. Fun, friendly,  clean atmosphere.  Very good food, just like the CR on Centennial. Looks like this location has cleaned up their act.  Perhaps those who wrote the bad reviews will give them another try after all and rescind them.
