Went looking on Yelp for some place different in the neighborhood that I had not tried. This place came up 7th on the list.. Should have been in the top 5. 
If you are looking for REAL Mexican food, not Tex-Mex this is the place. 
Family owned and operated, which I love supporting local, they serve genuine food from Puebla, Mexico. 
The salsa verde is excellent. My husband had the chicken enchilada verde, all white chicken wrapped in fresh soft tortillas and topped with green sauce and creama. Need to go back soon to have them again.. they are that good. 
One daughter had the carne asada tacos which were delicious and the other daughter had taquitos that were homemade and tasted great. 
I enjoyed the Mexican corn on the cob, a must try if you have never had it. I also had a small shredded beef sandwich, Polonas . 
For dessert, the flan which was rich, creamy and lots of flavor and an order of churros which were filled with caramel sauce.. 
Everything was spot on, and I can't wait to return! 
If you're looking for atmosphere its not here, but if your looking for an excellent meal, this is the place!
