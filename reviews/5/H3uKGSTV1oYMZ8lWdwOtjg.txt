i love the food here the beans and rice have amazing flavor. i've been going here for years i love this place. i use to live in phoenix and the drive here was always more than worth it. this is my top spot for the phoenix area for mexican food. the salsa is super super amazing in every way. if i could rate this place higher i would. prices here are great always. i now live in fresno,ca and great food like this is hard to find !! if you do find good food here it won't be consistent and cheap trust me been looking for two years now. anyways i highly recommend poliberto's to any and all who like great food. 5 stars isn't high enough..
