I visited Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for the second time ever this past week with a friend and some coworkers. I was the only one of our group who had ever been before (the Gilbert location).

Long story short, we were all VERY impressed. We actually decided to come here instead of Chipotle for the novelty of trying something new and were SO glad that we did!

It was lunchtime and the line was pretty long, but the wait was well worth it. We were all really impressed to see tortillas being MADE FRESH while we waited. The sight and smell of that... YUM!

All the ingredients looked and tasted very fresh and the portion sizes MORE than justified the cost of the food. We all decided to order some variant of burrito and we all really enjoyed our meals.

The burritos are briefly toasted, too, which is just another tasty touch that you don't see elsewhere. I ordered my burrito enchilada-style, which means it was fairly swimming in sauce - just the way I like it!

To be honest, I would come to Cafe Rio again before going back to Chipotle. (And that's saying a lot, because I really do like Chipotle.)

If you haven't been to Cafe Rio Mexican Grill, I'd highly recommend it. You're bound to love the food and quick service, not to mention the quirky, colorful atmosphere and outstanding value.

Well done, Cafe Rio! Five stars.  :)
