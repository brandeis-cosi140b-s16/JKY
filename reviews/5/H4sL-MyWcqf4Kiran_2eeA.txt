Oh so good!  I get take out from these guys every week or so and have never been disappointed.  I'm a creature of habit and am addicted to their chicken burrito.  My husband loves their twin chimis.  It's a little hole in the wall restaurant with hardly any seating, but they consistently deliver great food which is not something every restaurant can claim.
