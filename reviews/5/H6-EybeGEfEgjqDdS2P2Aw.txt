Chuy's is kind of divey but it's cheap and the food is excellent.  The margaritas are not bad either :)  I love the salsa bar, which offers you a variety of salsas and spices to put on your chips.  I also like that, though you order at the counter, the servers still bring your food to you.  You can also open up a bar tab and don't have to pay up front if you plan to order more later.
