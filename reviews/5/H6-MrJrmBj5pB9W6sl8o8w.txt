Have you ever had a Huachitlacoya? I had not either. Luckily, I long ago adopted the method of ordering Mexican food that went:

I don't know what that is. Let me have one of those, please!

So happy that I adopted that method!

Also so happy that I found Huachinanga, it is by far the best Mexican food that I've experienced in the valley. GO!

They are also one of the only places that has Habanero Salsa that is hot, but does not make you want to spit out your food. Go easy on it, it is habanero, but it is so good!
