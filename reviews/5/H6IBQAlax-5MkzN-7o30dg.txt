Tried this place the other day and had the green Chili and pork burrito combo (Uno on the lunch specials).  The portion was a good size and it is served with rice and beans.  They also serve chips with bean dip and salsa while you wait for your order.  This is going to be my go to Mexican restaurant in town.
