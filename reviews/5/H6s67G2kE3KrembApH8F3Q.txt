Really a good spot. Stopped in here waiting for a friend to meet up before heading out and about downtown. Grabbed a seat at the bar and everyone was really friendly customers as well. Within no time I was hanging out with a bunch of strangers who I felt as if I'd known for years. Service was awesome even though they were crazy busy. Definitely a spot to check out not for just one drink, you'll want to stay awhile.
