Damn good Surf and Turf Burrito, I was very skeptical about the sea food in these taco joints especially when I tried asking for one at filibertos and it was terrible, but this place served it up proper.  2nd time here and it's been nothing short of great.   
The only down fall here is probably the hours because I live close by and I could really go for a late night burrito that the other failed taco joints are known for.
