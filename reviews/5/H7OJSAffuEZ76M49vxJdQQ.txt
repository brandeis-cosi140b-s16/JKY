The Tamale Store sets up a booth at the Farmers Market in Anthem - I drive down just to get my Tamale Fix (TF). Pork with Green Chilies - my favorite. Very, very addicting. Even better with their Salsa Verde on top - killer. Not cheap - $33/Dozen - but these are big, very high quality tamales. And they are packaged in Pairs - making it easy to only thaw what you want.
