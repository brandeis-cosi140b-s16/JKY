RE-OPENING! I hear Mexi Casa is opening under new ownership & management & they will be open for St. Patrick's Day, Tuesday, March 17, 2015. I don't know if they will have green beer but I am sure they will have green margaritas! I can't wait to try their Tex Mex-style food and check out the new atmosphere.
