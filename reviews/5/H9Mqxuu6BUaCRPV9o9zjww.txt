This is the BEST location and has the greatest staff!!! The table side guac is to die for!! The food is always hot and fresh, and the staff and service is always wonderful. We love when the Mariachi Band plays it gives an even more authentic feel. Keep up the great service. The South location has a great view of the city but the service and food have something to be desired.
