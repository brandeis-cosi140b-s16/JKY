I am a HUGE fan of Filiberto's. I used to live 1 block away from this particular Fili-b's... I have been to numerous other locations throughout the valley and I can say with confidence, as a Filiberto's critic, that this is BY FAR the GREATEST Filiberto's on the planet! Frequent this one so much, that the staff recognize me. But all in all, Fili-b's as a whole: 

Great food, great prices, FAST! 

Next time you go, have a California Burrito, no pico, no guac, xtra sour cream for me. Gracias.
