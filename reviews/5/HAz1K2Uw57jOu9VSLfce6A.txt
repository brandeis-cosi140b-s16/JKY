Went in for lunch on Saturday.  Place was not busy yet and we were seated right away.  Very chic ambiance with great decor and strategically place flat screens.  

Our server was excellent and wakes us through the menu a bit.  We got Mexican corn and a street tacos (pulled chicken and carne asade).  Food was plentiful and delicious!  Wife and I agreed right there and then that this is our new favorite Mexican place in town. We had enough to bring home and have for dinner!  

We plan on checking them out for dinner next time.  Can't wait!!!
