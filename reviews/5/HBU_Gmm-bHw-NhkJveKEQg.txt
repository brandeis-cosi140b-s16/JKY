My husband and I drive over from Henderson just for their tacos. These are hands down the best street tacos I've had in Vegas. The prices are unbeatable, $1 for the tacos, $.25 for toppings (cilantro, onions, salsa). The tortillas might be smaller than what you're used to at other restaurants, but three tacos are enough to fill me up. If you can't handle spices, beware of the red salsa. It's got quite a kick, but it's oh so good!
