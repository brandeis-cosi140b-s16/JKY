We loved the venue's sign...which was the first factor in stopping for a drink and tapas.  We are still waiting for the assistant manager (female) to get back with us on ordering a venue shirt.  Other than that, the drinks were strong (which we like) and the food was crazy awesome!! We are definitely going back!
