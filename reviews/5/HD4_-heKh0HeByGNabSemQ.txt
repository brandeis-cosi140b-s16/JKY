I lived in Tucson for 16 wonderful years, leaving with my three children, new husband and two stepchildren in 2002 for New York. New York is wonderful in many ways, but truly is lacking in true authentic Mexican food. And there is no fooling my family. So when I come back to Arizona to visit my family here, the first thing I want is authentic Mexican food. Since my parents and sister live in Apache Junction, we find our fix at Los Tacos. The place is immaculately clean, the staff courteous and genuinely kind. I think we'd have a longer conversation if I spoke Spanish but their English is just fine. The food is cooked to order, the tortillas homemade. There is a salsa bar with salsa fresca, roasted hot peppers, spiced carrots, salsa verde and a nice chipolte salsa. I am not sure if they serve coffee as they are always so kind to let me bring in my morning addiction, Starbucks Vente. My son, who came on this trip with me, wakes each morning to walk the two miles to Starbucks and then a few steps more to Los Tacos. What a wonderful way to start the day. I can't recommend them high enough. Definitely worth the four mile walk each morning.
