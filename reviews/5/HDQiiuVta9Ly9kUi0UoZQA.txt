I have been going to Don Jose ever since I can remember.  I love the chips and hot sauce.  I always get hot sauce and chips to take home.  My favorite item is a beef burro enchilada style with a side of beans.  Their enchilada sauce is the best.  They also have the best cheese crisp in town.  I haven't found a cheese crisp that is as good as a Don Jose cheese crisp.  You must try the cheese crisp.
