Had the pleasure of popping in here for lunch today. I was extremely happy that I did since I've been seeking a solid taqueria in Charlotte for the last few months. I originally thought I'd try my hand down Central but to my surprise this little gem called Taqueria Mexico was right under my nose (i.e. down the block from where I take real estate classes) the whole time!

In the spirit of what it is I couldn't help but order an onslaught of tacos for this lunch adventure. I went for a variety with steak, spicy pork, chicken and shrimp (that's 4 tacos) and paid just around $6 which I didn't think was bad at all! Not to mention, these guys were loaded with all the good stuff. All the meat was perfectly spiced and I always appreciate an "oh so thin" but double wrapped corn tortilla taco. To add to this already delightful slathering of taco bliss was the trio of salsas. Of course, the hotter the better which means I was particularly fond of the spicier of the three.

All in all some great authentic Mexican food and THE place for tacos as far as I've experienced in Charlotte. The next time I'm here Ill be ordering a burrito as per the many positive reviews I've seen from others. Until next time, adios!
