If you know me you know I love Mexican food. Maribel's is doing it BIG over here and at low price. 

It's nothing fancy here so if you need to be seen or require a mariachi band killing your ear drums than this is not for you. 

The menu is limited and at the same time everything I have tried has been stellar.
1. Chicken taco combo (3 street tacos, rice , beans) $6. All white meat chicken seasoned well. It's going to be hard to try more of the menu because this my shit. 
2. Carne Asada taco combo- same as above and real good. 
3. Chicken Enchiladas (comes with two) - Pretty damn good. 

I LOVE their guacamole, homemade chips and red salsa, rice and beans. I bet even just a bean burrito or breakfast burrito would be bomb here. 

Point is food is solid, affordable and it's a local family owned business. I have to give props to the server Ozzy (I hope that's her name. It may be Izzy. I know I suck.) Her service is on point and she remembers me which scores major points and tips. 


Maribel's gets the World Cup of Mexican Food for Green Valley. Nacho Daddy can drown in their scorpion shots and well Lindo is Lindo. I'll be right here with my homies.
