Found the new location in my hood and couldn't be happier about it. Empty for dinner last Friday night but not for much longer. The new space is large and has a bar, with beer and wine coming soon according to the owner. These are super nice and hard working people that will make this place wildly successful in these parts I'm guessing. Delicious bulgogi flautas and a cheeseteak I'm still thinking about if you're wondering what we had. Same great food, and now unlimited potential in this new spot. I see big things for this place here and probably 10 more pounds around my gut. This city's affordable food options get better every day.
