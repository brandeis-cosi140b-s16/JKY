Went all around looking for some great authentic Mexican "hole in the wall " place to eat when my brother who lives here recommended here. My son had to use the restroom and to my surprised, it was clean. The place was very clean and not too busy. It was almost 2:00 pm and they offered lunch specials till 2 and we just made it. The waitress was very nice and friendly and offered us chips and salsa. I didn't eat any but my 3 brothers ate and said it was good. My son a picky eater ordered hamburger and fries (which I was glad they had on the menu). I had the #6 enchiladas lunch special. It came with rice, beans and salad, just enough portion. It was served on a hot plate and it was good. I didn't need any meat, cheese was just good! My brothers had the #8 combo which they ate all! The rice and beans was good too. I found a new place to come eat good authentic Mexican while visiting family in Avondale.
