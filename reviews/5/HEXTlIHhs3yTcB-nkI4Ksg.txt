As a local downtown, I'm always looking for new places to eat. I happened to stumble across this place and wow. 

At first thought, it has a mall food court feel. Multiple genre of foods which is served quickly. I been here on multiple occasion and every time, I am never disappointed. I had the ramen and burrito there. Flavors are excellent for the price. Definitely a place to check out if you're balling on a budget.
