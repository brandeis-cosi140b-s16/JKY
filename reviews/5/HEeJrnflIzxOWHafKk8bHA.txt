Great little hole in the wall, which is what we were looking for. Despite myself coming in like a bull in a china shop - spilling my salsa on the floor, and dropping the box that contains all the salsa cups for customers - the owner was awesome and just smiled. The food was great! Great meals, $1.50 street tacos, desserts.. Def recommend and will be back for more! Hopefully I wont take anything down this time...
