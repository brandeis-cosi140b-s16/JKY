I give 5 stars for excellence in their quality of food, flavor, variety, affordability, service and customer service. I just found this shop on yelp on a look out for something new to try out in this neighborhood. Their staff is very helpful in assisting during order placement. Tamales can be picked up as soon as they are ready. If you call ahead, they can tell you when your fav ones are going to be ready. We tried the southwest chipotle and green corn with cream cheese. Let me tell you, if you have a thing for spicy foods go for the southwest chipotle.  100% vegan, full of spice & flavor and nowhere else to be found. We will definitely be back!
