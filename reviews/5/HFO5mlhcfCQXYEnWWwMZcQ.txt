A group of 3, we were asked if it was our first time there.  Since it was, they offered samples of all the beef, pork and chicken flavors.  We all got the 3 large tacos in the following flavors: barbacoa beef, the green chile chicken/beef and the tinga chicken.  YUM!!!!!!  They were incredibly delicious and we will be back- a lot!!  My personal fav was the green chile beef/chicken.  Had a kick to them, and oh-so-yummy!!  What a great find- thank you, Yelp!!
