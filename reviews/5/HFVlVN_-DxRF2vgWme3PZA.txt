This was formerly known as Roberto's.  This is my favorite taco spot!  This specific location only!  I always get the same thing here and that is the Carne Asada Fries with everything but beans.  They usually make the fries crunchy but not burnt, but today some of them were soggy.  I am a big fan of their food here.
