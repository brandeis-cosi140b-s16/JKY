We went last night for the Sonoran dogs. They were outstanding. As one Yelper said, it's the best bun she's ever had. They taste like butter and so pillowy soft. We each ate two plus had horchata (which was just eh) and were stuffed.

It does look like one of those joints where you think, "This is gonna make me sick". And yah, it wasn't the cleanest. But it was really, really good. The bacon is thin, I believe, so it cooks up faster on the grill. 

Note: it's a CASH ONLY place. Plenty of parking.
