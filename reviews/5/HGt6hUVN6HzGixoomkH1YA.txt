The idea of a Hawaiian infused Mexican style eatery is genius.. It's like chipotle but with Hawaiian options. I always get the sea weed rice and the Kalua pig. It's some of the best I've ever had. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. I've tried a lot of Kalua pig around town and this is definitely the best! They have good salsa too. I like the mild pineapple one. A must try if you like Hawaiian food.
