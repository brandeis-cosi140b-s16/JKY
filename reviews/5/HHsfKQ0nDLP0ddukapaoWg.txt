I have tried various things on the menu--and might I be the first to say get the quesidilla filled with carne asada and be prepared to eat something super delicious, huge and super filling--and I love everything here!  This is my go-to place for Mexican in this area.  Ramiro's is better to me than almost anywhere I've eaten which includes the old line Mexican places here in Phoenix that people brag about.
Prices are cheap, the people taking your orders are always happy and super nice and the food...ahhhhhh, the food...is delicious!
When I want to break my diet and go hog wild this Ramiros is my favorite place..oink!
