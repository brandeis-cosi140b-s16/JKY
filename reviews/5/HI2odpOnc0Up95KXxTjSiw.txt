White boy friendly!

Walked in to this friendly environment with my wife and not only were we treated great, but the food was awesome! Totally a cost effective hole in the wal lil mex restaraunt... Mmm delicioso! Would highly reccomend, and we will def be returning i only wish i would have ordered more of the tacos el pastor :)
