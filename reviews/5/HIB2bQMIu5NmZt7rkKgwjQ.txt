Went there last night with for the first time, and loved everything about it. Our server Melissa was very helpful, from navigating the beers on tap through the menu and specials. I had a BBQ Mahi Taco and a Lemon Grilled Shrimp Taco. Both were very tasty, but I was kicking myself for not getting two of the BBQ Mahi tacos. For a side item I got the spicy avocado pasta salad. Like the tacos, it was filled with flavor. 

I look forward to going back. Highly recommend it.
