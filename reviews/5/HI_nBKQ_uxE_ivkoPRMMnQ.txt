You wouldnt be able to tell there is a restaurant from the outside but it is there and it is awesome! So glad I took a chance on this place. Every time I have been there the food is great. Love the mexican food and my buddy always gets the Greek Gyro and says it is also amazing. Would love if it was open on the weekend but it will just have to be a place for lunch on weekdays.
