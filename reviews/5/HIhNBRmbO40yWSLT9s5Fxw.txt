I came for a late dinner tonight at 9:50 PM and I was greeted by Bonnie. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free options. She even changed her gloves and washed her hands. Thank you Chipotle for having lots of options that are gluten free and furthermore thank you for educating your employees.
