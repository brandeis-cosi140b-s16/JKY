I love Rubio's and this location. I always get the kid's quesadilla, it's wrapped in the same style of how a burrito is wrapped. They also have great rice and their mini churros are delicious. Rubio's is also a lot more upscale for a fast food chain, and I love the decor inside, too bad they had to remove the fish tank though. But, I love this location, the employees are really friendly.
