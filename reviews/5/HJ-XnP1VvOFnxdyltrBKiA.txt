Love this place it looks small from the outside but its a real good size inside. The food has always been amazing the last time i went i ordered the crayfish marinated in butter limon and chile i forgot whats it called... anyway it was amazing! Service was amazing too. My daughter doesn't like chicken nuggets but she loved the dinosaur chicken nuggets and French fries. The price is a little more the the other marisco places around but it wont stop me from going again.
