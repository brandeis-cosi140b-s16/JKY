I love this place. My work is a few offices down and have been going here for a few months. Very reasonable prices and staff are friendly. I love the shredded beef rolled tacos. My husband had the carne asada burrito with the green sauce. He loved the flavones and burrito did not have fillers like some other places. Very authentic. Chips and salsa good and fresh.
