Welcome to Surprise Daniel!  Wow, we have needed a great, reasonable Mexican food restaurant and now we have it! 

I ordered the simple, beef taco and cheese enchiladas combo. It came with rice and beans. All of it was fresh, hot and extremely flavorful. (I was surprised the beef taco was ground beef, but it was still delicious.). Even the free chips and salsa were awesome.  Everything is made fresh, nothing from a can or pre-packaged.  Portions are large and the staff was very attentive and friendly. 

I can't wait to come back with the family and try their happy hour!  (2-6). My first visit left me loving this family owned and operated Mexican restaurant in Surprise.
