We come here all the time and the food is always exceptional. The fajitas are wonderful specially the chicken ones and they can put prickly pear cactus in them.  They will make you fresh Pico de Gayo if you like. Everytime we come here the service is awesome we love this place. My boyfriend and I totally recommend it.
