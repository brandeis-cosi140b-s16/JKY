I was introduced to La Barquita by a friend a few weeks ago and was impressed. Mi Suegra is from Jalisco and her cooking has made my palate very discriminating of Mexican food. I went back with her the other day and we loved it!

La Barquita jumped to the top of my list for all-time best Mexican Food! 

The flavors are tremendous. The Carne Asada was prepared to perfection. The salsa is top shelf. If you want authentic Mexican cuisine, this is the place. No frills, just a good tasting meal in a comfortable setting. The service was good too.
