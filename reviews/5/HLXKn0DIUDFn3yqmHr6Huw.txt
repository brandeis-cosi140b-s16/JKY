The place always has a wait and we have gone in and left because we couldn't even get a spot at the bar a couple times. We tried again but went in later and the bar had plenty of seating. The bartender was so friendly and knowledgable. Made suggestions and was flexible with any changes we wanted to make. Food was really good and the drinks were unique. Jalape√±o mango margarita made my breath smell for a day but it was worth it.
