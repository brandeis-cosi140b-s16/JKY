I adore Moe's. I love the fact that you get free chips & salsa with every purchase. Sometimes I just buy 1 taco and with the chips & salsa, that makes a meal. The Art Vandelay vegetarian burrito is recommended.

They close early. So after work I'd have to rush over to grab a burrito before they closed up shop.
