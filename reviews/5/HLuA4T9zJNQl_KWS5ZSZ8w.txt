Like I said, when I want something, I know what I want!! Good all the way around... Nice crisp with my chicken and moist, waffle was hot with a bit of a crunch on the edge... And the cold coke in the mason jar hit the spot... Looking forward to coming back with live jazz on the menu in the evenings...

Came back in less than 24hrs with my family & the same thing applies that I said yesterday. The tacos were added and my son enjoyed!!
