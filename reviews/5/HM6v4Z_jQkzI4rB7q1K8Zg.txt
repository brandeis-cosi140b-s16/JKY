This is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat downtown! Last time I was there we had exceptional service and Jake who brought out our food was very kind and efficient! He even burned his hand trying to take our hot plates out! He recommended the flapjacks and I was very happy with them, definitely going back for the friendly service and great food !!!
