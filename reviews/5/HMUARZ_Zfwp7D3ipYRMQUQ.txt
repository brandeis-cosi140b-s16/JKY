I wish there was a 6th star....

Went here for lunch with some buddies on a Thursday afternoon and was bummed that the Shrimp and chili Relleno was only on the dinner menu. The bartender heard me talking about how amazing it was and volunteered the have the cooks whip it up special! 

ABSOLUTELY my favorite local Mexican dish and restaurant.
