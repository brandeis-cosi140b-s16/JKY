Boy am I happy I tried this place.

Let's go chronologically. Love the surroundings, definitely has a cozy feel inside. The service was great, absolutely loved our waitress. 

The margaritas(one house, one frozen sunset) were awesome. I almost never drink them or like them, but I managed to enjoy this one, that says something. The salsa was delicious with a great kick to it. I had the adobada while my buddy had the tampiquena. Both dishes were fantastic, the rice and beans were phenomenal. Loved every bit of it. Nothing was too greasy, everything very nice and hot and came out quick. 

For dessert we had flan and sopapillas, both some of the best I've ever had. I can't recommend this place enough. GO GO GO.
