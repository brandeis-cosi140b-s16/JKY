Everytime my family and I come to Vegas we always make sure to stop here before leaving. Is being a very Hispanic family this is the perfect place to go, mariachi comes & play, the waitresses are all bilingual and amazing customer service, the portion sizes are huge! Although a little on the pricey side, it's so worth your money everytime!
