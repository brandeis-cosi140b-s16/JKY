Just in town for the weekend and my boyfriend was craving a good taco shop - WE FOUND IT! the simplicity of the restaurant and ingredients used - proves it truly does not take much to please customers. The gentleman who took our order (possibly the owner?) was very friendly and personable to every one who came in the door. 

If I lived in Phoenix this would be a go-to spot - can't wait to come back again!
