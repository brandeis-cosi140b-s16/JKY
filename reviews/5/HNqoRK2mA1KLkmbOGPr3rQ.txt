So my favorite Thai Restaurant Archi's on Rainbow is closed today and tomorrow because of Thanksgiving.  So we looked up for some great restaurants in Las Vegas and Javier's came up.  We weren't very sure if it's the same Javier's as the one in Irvine, Ca.  

So we decided to stop by just in case it is  because we love the one in Irvine.  Indeed it was, and boy are we glad we stopped by.  

They have the best spicy salsas in this universe, not to mention, the best carnitas.   The service was on par and the restaurant is immaculate.  Probably the cleanest restroom I've ever seen at a restaurant.  It's a little pricy, but it's worth every penny. 

Yay! One more great place to look forward to dine at whenever we are in Vegas.  


Tips:  If you can't handle too much spicy, becareful, the Salsas is pretty spicy.  And I eat pretty darn spicy.
