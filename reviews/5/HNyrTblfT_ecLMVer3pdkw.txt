This Roberto's is legit! Went  in 2 weeks ago at 1am, and the salsa bar was stocked and fresh! The green sauce is amazing!!! They also use chicken breast here too! The place was nice and clean and the cooks were friendly!!! I love me some rolled tacos with a side a rice! Lots of cucumbers and radishes too!
