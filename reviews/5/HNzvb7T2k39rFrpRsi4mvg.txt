Asado is my new favorite Mexican Restaurant and is within walking distance from my home!  I certainly enjoy hot food and they've not let me down from that aspect. It's not often that I use sour cream to cool off a bit, but I'm glad it's included with the Pork Adovada. I also highly recommend the Green Chili Burrito and am pleased they offer it Green, Red, and Christmas style. 

One caution I have is the chips and salsa. They are addictive... You will request more... Then the food will arrive and your foolish man pride will tell you to finish that second batch of chips you couldn't do without. You'll then be challenged to eat even half of your entree before your spouse takes away your plate send says you've had enough! I speak from experience, it's happened to me three times now.
