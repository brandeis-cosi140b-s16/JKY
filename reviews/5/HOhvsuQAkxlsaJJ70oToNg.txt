Inspite of the lackluster reviews, I Decided to try this place out because its 24 hours and close to my house. So i get to the place around 5am. The drive thru is not very well lit besides the menus and its a very quite and vacant area when you pull in. I wanted to just test the place out so i didn't order anything to big or crazy. I Went with just 3 Carne Asada Tacos.

I pulled up to the window. The guy took my money i think about $8.50 and i proceeded to wait a good 5 minutes at the window. I Have no problem waiting cause usually that means its made when its ordered. Order came up and i told the guy i want red and green sauce and jalapenos. He looked at me and said very matter of factly YES OK.. Was kinda funny.

So i get home thinking they are probably going to be some wimpy little tacos, As i open the box i'm amazed at the huge size of these things! Loaded with lots of meat, pico de gallo and guacamole. They tasted as good as they looked and i will definitely be back. I'll remember to take a picture next time. i just wanted to dig right in!!
