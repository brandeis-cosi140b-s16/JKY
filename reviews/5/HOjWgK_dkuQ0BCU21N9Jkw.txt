Okay Ive been to Qdoba, Chipotle and now here. Qdoba i wasn't impressed, Chipotle, you get your money's worth but Baja Fresh blows them out of the water! The first time I went (Monday) I had the Shrimp Diablo. First let me tell you, I like spicy.. like nose running, tongue swelling spicy, got me? im not saying it was that hot but it packed a kick that none of the other 3 came near and that's without drowning it in available hot sauces. Not only was the spice level sensational the shrimp are not little canned geisha shrimp, they are "multiple chews" large and they don't skimp on them either. Last but not least they pack that burrito with an equal amount of everything.. not 80% rice. This burrito is as heavy as a bar of gold and it's defintely worth it's weight.

P.S. I know my rule is go 3x before 5 stars but that doesn't apply to "fastish" food.
