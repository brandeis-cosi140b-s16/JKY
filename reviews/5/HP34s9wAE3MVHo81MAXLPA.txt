Simply the best Charlotte has to offer. Must order food item is the shrimp and crap dip. All of the fish tacos are delicious. I highly recommend the Azula Rita as well. 

Service is usually quick and friendly. My only complaint is that it can be a long wait to get a table, but that's the price to pay for going to one of the most popular restaurants in the area. Also, you can't make reservations here, which is another side effect of the above.
