Still love this place!

Jorge, the manager, is so nice.  I come here so much, he knows me as soon as I walk in and can even take a guess as to what I'll order (I'm predictable).  Amazing manager, and super friendly staff.  I love the food here.  I never feel sick after I eat here, just full, satisfied, and nourished.

...and I'm the duchess, with so many check-ins, no one has a chance of dethroning me.  lol
