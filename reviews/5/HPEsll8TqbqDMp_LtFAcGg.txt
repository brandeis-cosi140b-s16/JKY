5 stars cuz, why not? There's finally a Chipotle near my house so now I don't have to drive all the way down to Craig and Losee to get my chicken bowls! 

I read some reviews while I was here and can I just say, the people complaining are ridiculous. Most of the complaints are about how busy it is and how "slow" the service is. Um HELLO... They're new. And they're 1 of 2 Chipotles in that general area of North LV. What do you expect? While I was there I did see the rush of customers come in during dinner time and it did get extremely busy in there, but service was still quick and efficient and they were able to get everyone served in a timely manner.

Maybe the people complaining were excrutiatinly hungry and really couldn't handle waiting in line for 5-10 minutes or something. Who knows.
