I think that people that give bad reviews for price are not giving valid reviews.  You see the menu before you order with the price on it.  Using local fresh product isn't cheap like Niman  Ranch Pork products that are All Natural, humanely raised, and don't use hormones or antibiotics.  The burgers and shakes here are amazing and if you want a cheap over processed burger that you can leave on the kitchen counter for a year without getting moldy then go to any one of the corporate places that are on every street corner.  If you want gourmet burgers and shakes made with real non processed product then go to the Stand.   Appreciate what you eat and how it is made.   Yes you will pay for it but you won't have to worry about how it will effect your health or your families health in the future.  I flagged that dude.  Tool.
