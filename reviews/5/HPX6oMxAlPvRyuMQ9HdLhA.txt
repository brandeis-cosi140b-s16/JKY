I think I have a new favorite in the quick service Mexican food game, and that is one of my favorite contests ever.

I was all prepared to get a salad but then, then I saw the magical tortilla spinner. I couldn't resist. 

I created the business listing while I was in line, waiting for it to be my turn. Was I in line for a ride at Disneyland or to get tacos? Its decor sort of reminded me of Frontierland at D-land, but the food was definitely better quality and price than that place. 

The service was quick and to the point. The food was especially delicious, considering I fancy myself a connoisseur of quick service Mexican food. I don't think they do their meats/dairy as responsibly as Chipotle, but I could be wrong. I had never been to a Cafe Rio until yesterday, so it's all new and shiny to me.

I did like how they put "Tips to Not Get Fat Off Our Food" in the bottom corner of the menu. (My words, not theirs, but that's definitely what they're meaning to say.) In case you don't know, you can save food for later and not eat it in one setting. OMG GUYS, did you know that??? Did you know that you don't have to eat all the food at once? Cafe Rio definitely makes it easier, as they put lids out to make everything a to-go box if you want.

I will definitely be back to try out the different things on the menu, but a single taco with rice and beans was enough (and yes, I did take some of it home).
