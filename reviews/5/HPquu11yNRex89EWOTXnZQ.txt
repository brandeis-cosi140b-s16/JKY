Azteca is a fun Mexican restaurant with great people and even better food!  The interior is decorated with bright colors, Aztec patterns and designs, and the servers wear over-the-top uniforms modeled after traditional Mexican formal wear - it feels like Cinco de Mayo everyday (and gets even better ON Cinco de Mayo!).  

On weekends, a table-to-table cart makes fresh guacamole, which is incredible, and a lady makes all tortillas by hand as they're ordered.  The portions are heaping, the prices low, and the margaritas are big enough to swim in.  From what I know about REAL Mexican cuisine, the mole sauce is pretty authentic and the cactus salad is very fresh and bright.  Great time to visit is Sunday, when they have a live mariachi band that makes sure to serenade each table and takes requests.

In my humble opinion, there isn't a better Mexican restaurant in the South Charlotte area!
