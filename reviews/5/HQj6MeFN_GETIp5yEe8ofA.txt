This place is AMAZING!!! Sushi in a burrito! I had to give it a try and it did not disappoint! They also have other options for those of you that aren't on the sushi train. 
The service was awesome! And the overall vibe was fun from the pops of color to the environmentally friendly decor. You gotta check this place out!
