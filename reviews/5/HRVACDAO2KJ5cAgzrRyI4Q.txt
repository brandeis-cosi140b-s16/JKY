At 2:45 AM I wasn't sure what to expect for quality in this Mexican Food restaurant and a chain none the less. But, I was surprised!! I ordered the #13, beef chimichanga, rice, and re fried beans!! It was so outstanding! Quick service, fresh vegetable bar, awesome salsa!! Overall, very impressed, I see why after 50 years this chain is still going strong.
