Dana is mentioned in a couple of reviews and now I know why! She's amazing; such great, warm, friendly service! 
We went last night to Hecho & were blown away by the food. Why does this place not have better reviews?
First off, their There's a Name For That margarita/Modelo beer mix was soooo good. Served in a a chilled glass, just the right mix and when you're done, you still have leftover beer :-) The jalape√±o margarita was a bit too sweet but so good. It was spicy and smoky and disappeared way too quickly. 
The Ahi Ceviche was so fresh and the tortilla chip it sits on was perfectly crunchy and portion size was great: 3 large chips overflowing with cubed ahi & delicious avocado.
The mole chicken enchilada and refried beans were tasty & well-seasoned. I do wish it'd had a little more mole sauce on the plate. 
We also got the carne asada tacos & although I wasn't thrilled about the bacon on there, it tasted so good I didn't mind it. I seriously need to find out how they do their tomatoes in this dish because they were crazy delicious. 
Delicious Mexican food in a very unexpected place. Between the food & the Alejandro Fernandez concert, it was a great night!
