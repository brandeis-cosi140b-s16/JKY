This place has a great location that is perfect to people watch, really good food, and really good service. We went there for dinner because we were staying at the MGM and were seated right away and our waiter was great and really attentive. We weren't super hungry so we just got an appetizer sampler and some sangria. The appetizers were sooo good and their chips and salsa are super tasty too. The sangria was strong and really tasty. This was a really fun food experience and I would definitely recommend it to anybody visiting Vegas!
