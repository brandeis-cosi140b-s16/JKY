Great restaurant by far one of my favorite ones on the strip. Being a local you don't ever want to go to the major casinos, but being it was a date night we decided to go to hecho en vegas and it was the best choice because we had the best service by our server Saul.  He suggested the tastiest dishes and drinks for us to try. Once we decided on dinner he suggested fajitas so we went with his suggestion and by far the best meal I had in a long time. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends n family.
