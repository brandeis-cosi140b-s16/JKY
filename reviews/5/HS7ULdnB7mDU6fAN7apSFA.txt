Very good food. This is where I take family and friends when they come to town.

The #6 enchiladas suizas is the best and I always get the shrimp. The sauce is great in everything and I cover my plate with it. 

Every Chimi is great especially the seafood one. 

I have been going here with my father in law for the past four years. This year they changes the portion sizes, doubling everything on the plate. We quickly increased our attendance. He goes every Sunday for the menudo. 

My F. In L. also introduced me to their pozole. It has this incredible tioponcho pork, with their signature rub. The bowl is huge and it is served with tortillas and fresh chopped cabbage onions and limes.

My wife loves the pork quesadilla, also tioponcho.
