This little jewel of a Mexican restaurant does not know what bad food is, I have tried many different menu items and all leave me wanting for more. Try the lemonade too, what a refreshing way to wash down all that tasty food. If you have never been try to make it but be careful as it only opens for breakfast and lunch so if you get there after 3:00 pm you will miss out. The excellent food and friendly atmosphere will keep bringing you back. - Tamales Guadalajara, food like the one mom makes at home.
