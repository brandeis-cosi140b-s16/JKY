Best Tacos in Phoenix.  If you want better you have to go all the way to Tucson to BK Hotdogs.  I looked and looked for something similar in Phoenix and always came up disappointed.  Not here. the Carne Asada has that smokey flavor and it's just on point. The caramelo is really good as well.  The have Sonoran Dogs but for some reason the city does not let them wrap the dogs in bacon.  So it does taste different.  If you want Sonoran dogs go to Nogales Hot Dog stand.  if you want best tacos go to this place. Hands down Legit.
