I just want to mention that the caldo de res here is really very good.  I pack away a whole bowl.  I've had caldo de res other places, and this one is particularly fresh tasting.  The beef is nice and tender, the broth is flavorful, and vegetables are fresh tasting.  

I don't claim to be an expert on the dish, but of all the places I've eaten at in Madison, it's my absolute favorite.  I'd order it again, and again (and in fact I've been doing that).
