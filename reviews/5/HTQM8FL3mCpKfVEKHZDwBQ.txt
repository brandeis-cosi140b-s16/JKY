Today was our first experience at the Restaurant.
 We knew that it would be a home run when we were greeted by Ron the manager.  We told him that we were first time customers. He spent at least ten minutes at our table suggesting different dishes on the menu.  So we would be ready for Bill our server.
Who was spot on.

We also met Don an old timer at the restaurant.

Great dining experience, everyone is so friendly. It is like a neighborhood hangout. 
From the girl who delivered our chips and salsa. To the girl who delivered the shot of Tequila. 

We will definitely be back to see Bill and the gang.

Very surprised to see negative reviews.
