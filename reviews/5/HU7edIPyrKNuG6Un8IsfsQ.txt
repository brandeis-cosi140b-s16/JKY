In Tempe for spring training. Wanted something lite. Found tortilla fish on yelp and it was 2 mile from our hotel. I was expecting a hole in the wall Mexican place but it was in a Walmart shopping center next to Panda Express. We ordered one fish and one shrimp each. They came battered on a corn tortilla and you add your own toppings. The fish was nicely cooked and the toppings fit the bill. I was satisfied and met my goal of trying to eat better even on vacation.
