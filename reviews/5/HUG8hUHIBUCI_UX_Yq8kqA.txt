Another day, another burrito. Ordered the chile relleno burrito and added veggies to it and it was surprisingly good. The poblano was deep fried and I slathered it in the salsa verde / smokier salsa rojo from the salsa bar. Food came out lightening quick and location was very convenient to the venue next door.
