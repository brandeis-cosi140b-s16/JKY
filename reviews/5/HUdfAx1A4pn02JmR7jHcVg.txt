this place is very good and so cheap... I go at lease 2 times a week the menudo is delicious red or white, the tortas are so bomb and the chilaquiles are so bomb ... top it off with some nice people and homey feed like you are eating at a friends house and their nana is hooking you up a plate highly recommend it...
