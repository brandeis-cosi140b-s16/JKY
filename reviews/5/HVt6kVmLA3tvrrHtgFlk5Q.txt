My boyfriend for months has tried getting me to enjoy Filiberto's, but I just can't stomach it. I've tried numerous items on their menu and all have left weird tastes in my mouth. But one night we decided to give Los Fav's a go and I have fallen in love since! I've tried their breakfast burritos, their nachos, their carne asada fries, a lot of different items! I love all of them. I'm a way too picky eater but they make it so easy for me. Just the other day I called ahead and the young lady who was working took my order over the phone and it was ready at the exact time I walked in the door to pick it up. They are always so nice and friendly and quick too! I love this place, I'm a new regular!
