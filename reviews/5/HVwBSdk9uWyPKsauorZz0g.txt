Ah-mayyyyy-zing food! I love this place. We were regulars at the Queen Creek location. We went once or twice a month and never had a bad meal. I would go just for their chips and salsa alone - they're home made and delicious. But everything else is great too. I'm addicted to the shredded beef tacos. And the nachos are incredible. And the restaurant itself was beautiful, especially in the spring with the scent of orange blossoms in the air. We were completely bummed when we arrived one night to eat and found it closed down. Then a few weeks/months later we happened to be driving down Elliot Road and we saw the El Rico's sign - woohoo!! Since then, we've been just a few times as it's a bit of a drive. But we go every chance we get, and the food is just as amazing as it was at their Queen Creek location. The new restaurant is quite nice, kid-friendly, with a patio and live music sometimes. And the service is friendly and welcoming. We're so happy to have found the new location. I would recommend El Rico's to anyone.
