Best Wings in Town!!

I have been frequenting this place for years and really enjoy their happy hour specials. They typically offer 2-for-1 on any adult beverage from 4-8, which can't be beat.

The Mexican food is rather poor in my opinion, but I try to order their chicken wings at every occasion I can get. They don't use your typical Buffalo sauce or BBQ sauce, the wings have a house recipe sauce that provides a sweet heat that causes me to keep coming back for more. Even the average consumer will enjoy their wings. I have family and friends who come to Vegas to visit and they ask me to take them to Cantina as soon as they land at the airport. With a college bar feeling inside you will see a wide variety of patrons from the occasional suit and tie to a spring breaker in a bikini (Hard Rock pool is across the street). Highly recommended.
