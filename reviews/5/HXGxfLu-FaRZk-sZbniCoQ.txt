Wonder if this place is in "the square".  If not I imagine this so called square to be similar which I envision as a place where everyday people live.  With all that said the food was excellent and authentic.  Surprised not more of these place in Phoenix.  Great wet burrito and nice selection of tortas.  Mine was excellent with grilled onions a smear of retried beans and a touch of some spicy bite inside.  Service was good and attentive but we did get seated by the ice room.  High traffic with workers walking in and out but it doesn't really matter.  My son and I will be back!
