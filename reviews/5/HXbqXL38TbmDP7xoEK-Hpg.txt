Awesome fish tacos!!! We dropped in for a snack in between meals and opted for the combo. 2 tacos of your choice a side of fries and a drink for 8.99. We got 2 full fish tacos which was both fish and shrimp. They bread and fry the seafood which is just the way I like it. They give you tacos plain (just tortilla, pepper, cheese and fish-they don't skimp) but their salsa bar is where it's at. Here you customize your taco. They have an array of salsas, sauces, veggies, and even coleslaw to top your tacos with. I LOVE THIS!  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh, pico was on point, no mushy over processed salsas here!  They also had squeeze bottles of mayo, chipotle dressing, cilantro dressing, ranch and of course hot sauces. All were awesome.  I almost got full off 1 taco! Now their fries, you don't expect much but these were some of the crispiest fries I've ever had! The tacos were very reminiscent of some we've had in Baja Mexico and I'm so glad we found some here. 

Service was on point. Ruben the co owner was very friendly and while we ate our tacos he was very attentive to other patrons and even took the time to explain the salsa bar to a gentlemen. They seem very into making their customers happy and comfortable. 

He let us know that Tuesday they offer a buy 2 get 1 free taco special and that if you like their Facebook they offer additional deals. 

We will definitely be returning!
