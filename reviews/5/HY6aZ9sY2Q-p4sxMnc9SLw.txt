No joke, this is probably one of the best Mexican places I've ever been to. It's a small cozy place in central Phoenix, where they have local artists work hanging up the walls. The price is not cheap,  but it's worth every single penny for what you get. 

First, I had the Barrio Bomba Margarita. Phew! I was buzzed a quarter way thru lol It was very tasty though! Two thumbs on their margaritas. I had the shrimp tacos and boy they were phenomenal! Life changing shrimp tacos! My boyfriend had their seafood enchiladas and he loved it too. Their servings were very generous. Last but not the least, the churros were amazing! I read an article that it's one of the top 10 best desserts in the greater Phoenix area. No wonder! It is to die for. I would go back here just for that.

P.S. We are huge fans of the murals outside the restaurant! Such great work.
