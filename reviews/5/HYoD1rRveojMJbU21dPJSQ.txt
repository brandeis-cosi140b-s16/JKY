We're from out of town and asked a friend where to go for dinner, and she said hands down The Mission. After going, I agree with her. It was a packed scene at 7pm tho it quoted down a bit by 8:30. Service was excellent despite the heavy crowd and they seemed to have a choreographed dance down moving through the restaurant in and out of the kitchen. Our waiter was knowledgeable and steered us through the rather full menu choices. The table side guac was fun, and the pork belly app was creative. The mahi tacos were a bit heavy with the breading. And overall decor was very well done. Would go back if we're ever back in Scottsdale.
