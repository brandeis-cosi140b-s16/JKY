My lunchtime favorite. I usually get whatever is on special, and it is always delicious.  Chilaquiles--oh my god.  Plantains topped with ground beef and guacamole.  Excellent homemade soups--poblano with cream, lentils with bacon, tortilla.  The meat fillings for tacos, enchiladas, etc. are tender and well-seasoned.  Even the standard rice-and-beans sides are exceptional compared with what you usually get at a "Mexican" restaurant. They serve whole stewed beans, and the rice is cooked from scratch and seasoned (i.e., not from a box).  Skip Mad Mex, which is overpriced and always disappointing.  La Palapa is the best Mexican restaurant in the 'burgh.
