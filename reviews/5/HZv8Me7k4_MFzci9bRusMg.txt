My first time trying Fausto's. I got a chicken burrito and an order of rice to go. The chicken burrito was delicious. Lots of  fresh chicken. I think they put an entire chicken breast in the burrito! I have ordered burritos before at other places and by the time I get it home it is mush because  the heat from being wrapped makes the tortilla thin and mushy. But this was was perfect. I liked their rice too. Plain but flavorful. The staff was very nice and understood English which meant my order was correct which is not the case at some other places. I will definitely be back to try other items on their menu.
