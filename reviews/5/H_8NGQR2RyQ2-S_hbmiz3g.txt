If you're looking for an authentic Mexican joint, this is a pretty great choice. The service was great, the staff was friendly and the food was super tasty! They even had the nondescript red and green hot sauces, a sign of any great authentic Mexican restaurant.

When you order, they bring your drinks out to you once you sit down, along with some chips and fresh salsa. They also sell soda imported from Mexico, made with real cane sugar! You haven't had a Coke until you've had one made with real sugar, let me assure you.

I went with the chicken fajitas. The food came out very hot, the tortillas were quite warm and it was all very good. The chicken was some of the most tender chicken I've ever had, no joke. It was seasoned really well and was just amazing. My girlfriend got the carnitas burro and was very happy with it, but she agreed the chicken is where it's at.

When we went in, it was about an hour to close, so the place was mostly dead, which may be why our service was so good. But, they seemed to genuinely want to make their customers happy, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the same level of service when it's busy either.
