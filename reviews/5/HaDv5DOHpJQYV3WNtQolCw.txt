We usually come for breakfast and have Chorizo con Papas y Huevos. Delicious. Also recently tried a beef tamale and it was delicious. Their salsa is always a treat. It comes in three styles and you mix and match to create a heat profile all your own. A landmark restaurant in Glendale, it has a cozy ambiance and features a Mariachi band on Sundays just in time for brunch.
