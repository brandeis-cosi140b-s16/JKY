My husband and I have a thing for burgers... Let me tell you if you get the bun right and the burger we love it!!! We loved the soft bun toasted perfectly on the inside and the burgers were so delicious, a little small for my husband but perfect size for me! The fries had a very interesting seasoning and I think a little sugar mixed in surprisingly a delightful twist of that is what it was!
