My favorite lunch spot by my work. 

When you look at it from the outside, Pepe's Taco Villa looks like a hole. But walk inside and it's surprisingly nice. They have a nice little bar with a big flat screen (currently watching the World Cup and eating a taco). 

As far as the food goes, I've only tried the carne asada tacos, but I gotta say, it's some of the best carne asada I've EVER HAD. Juicy, flavorful, and delicious. And they include Guacamole on the tacos (awesome). 

Come here for a nice little sit down lunch or takeout and you won't be disappointed.
