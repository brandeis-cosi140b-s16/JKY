WOW!!!! This place is amazing! Last night was my first time and I was very impressed. The decor is beautiful, sets a great atmosphere. The food was very good. We started with the mexican street corn, the flavors were great. I highly recommend the mussels and the mexican pho!!!! I will definitely be dining at sumo maya again!
