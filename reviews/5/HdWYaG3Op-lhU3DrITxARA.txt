While visiting an old friend we decided to stop in here for lunch, she said we had to sit in Barb's section. 
Chips and salsa came to the table, but Barb was already greeting us with her bright smile & quick wit. I'm so glad we ate here. Barb made me laugh & enjoy the meal we had together. 
Thanks Barb for brightening my day & a memorable lunch.
