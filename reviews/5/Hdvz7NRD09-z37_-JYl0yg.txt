I really love this place and could eat here every other day!  The chicken tacos crispy are my favorite.  The meat is so tender and flavorful and the cheese is fresh, fluffy and not too salty.  Also, the green corn tamales are better than any I've had.  Always fresh and light and simply outrageous!  The bean and cheese burrito is crazy good too.  The tortillas are the most delightful around.  Very inexpensive and it is locally owned.  The same staff has been there for years and always is friendly and remembers me and that is a nice thing!
