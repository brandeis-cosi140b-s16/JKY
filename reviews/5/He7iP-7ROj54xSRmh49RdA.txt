I was so thrilled to find this restaurant, thanks fellow Yelpers! My gf is from the Yucatan and she hadn't ever found any place in Vegas that has food from there. So I took her here hoping that she would like it as I saw they had a few dishes that looked authentic. It turned out she really enjoyed it! She was really surprised to see that they had some food from her area. She ordered the panuchos which of course I had to try and they were really awesome. I had the house special enchiladas with a verde sauce and crema and they were really delicious. I don't often order stuff with verde sauce as I prefer the red, but these really are special. The sides were all good and the prices right! Only little thing I'll mention on the downside is the lighting. I can't remember complaining about lighting before, but this place was definitely on the dark side. We sat in the middle which was kind of dark so I wanted to maybe move to a booth, but that was super dark so we stayed at our table. Certainly not enough to stop me from coming back, maybe next time we'll bring a candle. :)
