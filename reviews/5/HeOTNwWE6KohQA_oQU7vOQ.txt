What a delicious little secret... We stopped in for a late breakfast, but you can order from breakfast and lunch/dinner at any time. The green chile beef burrito was very good, although I felt like it needed bit more spice. I added pico de gallo and it was delightful.   Their chorizo is homemade and so flavorful. No weird red grease like regular chorizo. It was exceptional! We ordered the chorizo, egg, bean burrito because we don't care for potato in burritos. It was really good. They are healthy sized burritos. They will fill you up!  We also had a pancake, which was SO tender. I rarely eat pancakes, but I am still thinking fondly of that one. Prices are crazy cheap too. I almost felt guilty, because I have sure paid a heck of a lot more for a heck of a lot less. We are excited to go back for dinner and try some tamales, rellanos, carnitas, etc.
