Milagro Gill is a fave spot for Dinner & Happy Hour. I met a good friend of mine, Lisa, for Happy Hour! We enjoyed the Chips & Guacamole along with the Chicken Wings. To end our festive evening, we shared of Avocado Cheesecake with Strawberries & Mangoes and a Delish glass of Moscato. 

Service here is always the best. I'm certain I'll be back soon. Cheers***
