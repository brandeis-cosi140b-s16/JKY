LOVE this food. Most authentically Mexican food I've found in a long time. This is not tex-mex... it is authentic and oh, so good!

Try the beef tongue. It only costs about a dollar, and will open your eyes to a new cut of meat! The tongue is tender and flavorful, it tastes like braised stew meat.

Every single thing I've gotten here is just incredible. It is so fresh, so tasty... great, now I'm hungry!

My only complaint is no alcohol.

** Edit: They've expanded! So now there won't be such long waits to get to incredible tasty tacos!
