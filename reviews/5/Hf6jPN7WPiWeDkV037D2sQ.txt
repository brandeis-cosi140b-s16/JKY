Wow! Who would have thought something so good could be found in the strip mall behind Coco's? With just one bite of their carne asada nachos, I knew that this was, indeed, a find. $9 will get you a basket filled with thick tortilla chips, pinto beans, shredded cheese, melted cheese, carne asada, and pico de gallo. They give you three freshly-made salsas, on the house. I particularly liked the one that looks like stewed onions and bell peppers. It has a nice home-made feel to the restaurant. The owner was very nice and welcoming. I will be bringing my out-of-town guests here for good Mexican food.
