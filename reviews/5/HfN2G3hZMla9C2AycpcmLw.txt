Second time here
I just had the most amazing Mexican food since I visited Mexico. It was great to have a true taste of authentic Mexican dish, so close to home. This place out does any competition. They have quality and humble customer service, that any restaurant wishes to have. My faith is good restaurants is now restored. It was funny to see someone complain about the food then ask for a box to take home lol. Thanks Casa Layla
