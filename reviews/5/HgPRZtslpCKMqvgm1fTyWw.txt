Planned a large dinner party for a work event at Border Grill for the 2nd year in a row.  After spending hours in a trade show hall, it's nice to dine out on the patio! :)  Great service, great prices and super tasty food!  I would recommend the skirt steak and their guac rocks.  Had dinner on Tues and then lunch again on Thurs. Love this place.
