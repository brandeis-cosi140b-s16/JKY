I went here because of all the great photos on Yelp, and I was NOT disappointed.  My husband and I both ordered the pork carnitas fajitas.  I don't know if I can order anything else, they were so good.  The chips came out with a smoky and hot salsa.  The fajitas came out sizzling.  There were green and red peppers, onions and mushrooms with the perfectly cooked pork.  Oh my, this skinny girl ate a lot!  I can't wait to go back.  

I am thrilled as I don't like the cheesy Sonoran fare served at most Mexican restaurants around town.
