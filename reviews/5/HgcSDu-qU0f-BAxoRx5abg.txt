To compare with another tamale place that I used to frequent, this place wins based on the tamales. 

Their tamales here are good, the masa is perfect texture and isn't too dry. They sell a few of them hot during any given day. They sell all of theirs frozen everyday, pending not getting sold out.

Only thing which is a little upsetting, is that it isn't a restaurant. There is only a small sitting area to wait. If you get your food you get it to go. Also, it's tamales only, no real sides to get with your food. I wish they had more, but for what they are 5 stars. I love some good tamales.

Their hours are reminiscent of them not being a restaurant.
