Dick's and the related restaurant, Richardson's are excellent - probably the best New Mexican food I've had (outside of New Mexico of course) - they are always tops on my list when choosing a restaurant.  Service has always been excellent, and the food memorable.  For group dinners, Dick's Hideaway has a private room (often called the 'family room' in many traditional New Mexico restaurants) that will seat close to 20 people I think - an excellent place for small business dinners.  Whether eating in the private room, in a booth at Richardson's or at one of the bars - it's a great choice.
