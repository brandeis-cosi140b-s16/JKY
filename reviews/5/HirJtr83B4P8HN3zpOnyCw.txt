I arrived in Phoenix at around 9pm for a business trip, checked into my hotel, then realized I was hungry and everything around me was closed.

I pulled up yelp and looked for some cheap latenight eats, and found this place.

Getting to it is a bit of a pain if you aren't local as the roads are split by their light-rail system, even when they are one way, so being on the wrong side of the tracks, means you can't turn to get here.

I wasnt sure what to expect when I pulled up, but what I found was pretty awesome. Standing alone in the middle of a parking lot, at midnight, was La Frontera. A jack in the box around the corner seemed to be the only place open other than this, that I could see. But here I was, with literally 20+ other people in the middle of the night, getting some awesome food.

The selection is pretty standard. Tacos, Burritos, Tacos, etc. with your choice of the normal meats (Asada, Pork Verde, Chorizo, etc. The staff primarily speak Spanish, but  it wasnt an issue to order, Although they did call my number in Spanish, so I could see that getting confusing if you don't know Spanish)

The food was FANTASTIC. Best Carne Aasda and Chorizo I have had in a long time. Fresh toritllas, great tasting meat, good fillings, a good size, and cheap. Tonights  my last night and I am going to try and make it over again before I leave Arizona, as it was that good.
