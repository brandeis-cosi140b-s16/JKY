I really love this place, I've been to T&T two times, and each time was great. Their tacos are sooo delicious and there black beans and pinto beans are perfect, just enough seasoning and the perfect consistency, not watery or too dense. The atmosphere in the place is full if energy because its not enclosed like other restaurants. You can look out into the casino which adds too the experience here. The service here is great too, especially with the free tortilla chips and dip you get, FOR FREE! Lol I definitely want to go back soon.
