I was kinda of scared because a lot of Las Vegas is filled with chain restaurants or fancy fusion restaurants that are wholly insufficient in delivering this kind of food.

I think I found my favorite Mexican restaurant. They did everything right. Good salsa. Good beans. Homemade corn tortillas. Even the little side salad was atypical for a Mexican restaurant, it was good. And we haven't gotten to our meal yet! Which ended up being great!

The folks that work there do a good job and checked on us regularly.
