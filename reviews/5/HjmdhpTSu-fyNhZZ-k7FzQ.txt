Really solid Mexican restaurant. Been here twice and each time it was a good experience. I plan on going back many more  times. Staff is really friendly. I would rate their food 4 stars since it's nothing extraordinary, just the basic Mexican food we all love. Since their staff is so friendly I am giving them 5 stars.
