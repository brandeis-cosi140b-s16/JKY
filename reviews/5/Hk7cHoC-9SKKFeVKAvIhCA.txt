I love this place. I've been going here for over a year and even since Maya opened, I still choose this place every weekend. They have great drink specials, great tunes and bartenders. We met Jake, the owner, and Mike the bartender manager and they were awesome. They make amazing mimosas and honestly care about everyone liking their drinks and having a great time. If you want a chill, awesome time, go here.
