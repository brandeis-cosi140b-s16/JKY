Polibertos is awesome, It's my favorite go to restaurant if I'm still up by 1am. I've tried their #23, carne asada fries, shrimp quesadilla, shrimp cocktail, fish tacos hot hate and its always hot and freshly made and so delicious! Ya the scenery is not the nicest but if your only looking for somewhere to stop in and pick up something to go back home or work with for lunch with this place is great and affordable. Although I will admit sometimes it takes awhile for the food to be ready! But just always trust that the food will be great.
