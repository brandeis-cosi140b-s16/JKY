Dan Feinstein has a "fine" taste for authentic Mexican dining. Paco, Executive Chef from Mexico cooks with passion and love coming from his deep rooted background of family recipes it will make you fall in love with his food.  He cooks healthy as well quality  Non-GMO ingredients. For example, the flan is made with organic eggs and natural cane sugar.  And if you have a flare for exotic cuisine, there are saut√©ed grasshoppers on the menu. 
 The margaritas are the bomb plesantly poured by server Alcia. 
Monday is 50% off for locals and Tuesday is 50% off for industry as well. There are specials throughout  the whole week! 
Genius paring with the two establishments by Peter and Dan Feinstein!
