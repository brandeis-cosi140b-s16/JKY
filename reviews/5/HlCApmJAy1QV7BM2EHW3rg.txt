Just opened this month, the place is set up really well.  The inner part actually has lighting that makes it look like you are sitting in an outdoor plaza.  Right now, I think because they just opened they are incredibly overstaffed, but that isn't a bad thing.  The food was excellent and different from the normal mexican cuisine.  My friend had an avacado enchilada that was amazing...and very different!  My fajita chicken salad with guacamole and zesty lime dressing was perfect, and the latest boytoy had something with an egg on it that he finished completely.  My friend is vegetarian, and there were tons of options.  For dessert we had a dulce de leche cheesecake that was perfect!  The staff was friendly and willing to please, I'll definitely go back! 5 Stars.
