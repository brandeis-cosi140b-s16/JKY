I stopped in today for lunch on my break, I ordered 1 carne asada taco. I'd have to say this was the best taco I've EVER had. This was no ordinary street taco. It was bigger than average and loaded! These guys have been open for a week now and their lunch crowd is unbelievable, you'd think they've been there for years! I went back through the drive thru and bought 3 more and took them Togo. 
This place is a MUST try for sure. Keep up the good work guys.
