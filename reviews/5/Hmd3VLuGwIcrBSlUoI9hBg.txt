Chronic Tacos? 

YES!

The second I walked into this place I was blown away.  Tucked away in the middle of Summerlin is a place called "Chronic Tacos" that breathes new life into this other wise sterile shopping center.

First impression of the place that hasn't been open a week... what is all this writing on the wall? Did all this writing happen in less than a week?

They supply the sharpies and you are welcomed to write on the walls and tables.

They have an employee come up to you when you first hit the line and they get you a drink while you wait on what seems to be the honor system.

They carry coke products and I opted for the safe choice of Minute Maid Lemonade.

I came at 8:30pm at night and this place was still busy!  The music was blaring, the line was friendly, the staff was friendly, the entire place was like entering your cool friends house in high school.  

When my turn came up, I opted for the Carne Asada Burrito which I had made with: spanish rice, black beans, "baja style" sauce, pico de gallo salsa, cheese, cilantro and onions.  My meal with the burrito and the drink came out to under $9.

Let me tell you, all the staff are super friendly and I have never seen a group of people that appear to absolutely love their jobs!  A very refreshing experience.

After we sat down to eat, we were greeted by 5 different people that offered to refill your drinks or take away your trash.

I am definitely coming back to this place very soon!

The food was great!  The atmosphere was great!

I asked one of the employees and they say they are open from 9am to 9pm.

One more thing - Scream "I Love Chronic Tacos!" and just see what happens...
