I have always considered this a cheesy restaurant (no pun intended) but after eating at their dine-in on Indian Bend road, I was pleasantly surprised!  Great extras and great food!  Open 24 hours a day is pretty cool.  
On a side note I think the mall owners are going overboard on inexpensive Mexican dines... Taco Bell, Filbertos, and now Chipolte and on the same corner.  Poor planning and a little unfair to the restaurants!
