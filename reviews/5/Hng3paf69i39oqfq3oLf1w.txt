Me and my gf had the strawberry margaritas. They were really good and strong but it was just too sweet for me. I would suggest them but just know they are very sweet with sugar as the rim garnish. 

For dinner I had the enchiladas with ground beef. I love enchi's but this place it a tex mex so no that they are not authentic Mexican style. I like the tex mex so I love these enchi's but for others they might be considered bland. But to each his own. Service was quick. Was there on a sat night and was super busy. Sat at bar thinking we had 45 min. Had table in 10 min though. I guess they realized who I was lol:-). Good food and drinks. Chips and salsa really good too. Couldn't stop munching.
