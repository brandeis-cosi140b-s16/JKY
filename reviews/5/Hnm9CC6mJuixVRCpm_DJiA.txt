I was suprised this was in a nonedescript strip mall but had such panache! The food was delicious. I thought the guac was outstanding. The carne asada taco with a flour tortilla (yay) was very tasty and the Inca Salad was divinity. The salad had such a combination of textures;  quinioa, nuts, avo- with a citrussy vinegrette that was so so good.

We will definitely return. The Happy Hour pricing was a treat on the weekend!
