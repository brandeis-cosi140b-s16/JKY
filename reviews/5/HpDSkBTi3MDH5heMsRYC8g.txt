You should get very excited right now because this place is AWESOME. I can't stop talking about it. The corn tortillas are really, really good. Maybe some of the best I have ever had. The al pastor taco is also very, very delicious and I have never had anything like it before. It is authentic, but relate able for those who have mostly a tex-mex cuisine in the past. The staff could not be nicer and the place is cozy and cute. It is worth the drive. Oh, did I mention it is crazy affordable?

Get there, really, hurry up. You won't be sorry.
