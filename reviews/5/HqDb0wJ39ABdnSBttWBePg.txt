In the dictionary under 'Hole in the wall' is a picture of Tacos Atoyac. Not your traditional taco shop or Mexican eatery, Atoyac destroyed my expectations. A good friend suggested this as a lunch destination and when we pulled up, I gave him the "you've got to be effin me" look. I humored him and am SO glad I did. I tried a little of everything, which is easy to do here, and all of it was very tasty and high quality. None of those mystery bites of meat you might endure at other eateries.

Long story short....High quality, high value, low prices.
