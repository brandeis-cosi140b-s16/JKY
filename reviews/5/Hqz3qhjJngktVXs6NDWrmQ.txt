This place was amazing and the best Mexican I had in AZ.  It is very similar to a San Diego taco shop & the prices are excellent.  They have a salsa bar with hot carrots, a big plus for me.  

I had rolled tacos with guacamole & cheese and a shredded beef hard shell taco.  They were all great.  The locals appeared to really like this place and told me they come at least once a week.  

The inside was a little dirty (tables not clean) but when asked they did come clean them.  You could tell they had been and continued to be busy & the cashier did everything, but cook.   I am so glad I found this place on my trip, you must give it a try.
