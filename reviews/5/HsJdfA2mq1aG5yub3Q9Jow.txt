OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!  I went here for lunch today and they had lobster tail tacos.  I come to this location about once a month.  It's incredibly clean and the service is always friendly.  I like to see confusion on peoples' faces when I break out my Spanish and place my order.  
The lobster tail tacos were A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!!!  Big hunks of lobster tail (langostino) and a pinkish sauce served in huge corn tortillas.  I got the combo, which comes with a side of rice and a side of beans.  You can choose refried or black.  I love their black beans.
Another thing I love about Baja Fresh is their salsa bar.  My favorite is the baja.  It's a smoky chipotle salsa.  I always get a bunch of different salsas to take home with me.  Their green salsa changed, but it's still really good and tastes so fresh.
There are NO microwaves here.  I have a "thing" about microwaves and rarely use mine at home.  I think it's strange to heat up food without something...hot.  *shudder*
Anyway, it's a clean facility with fresh food and many different options.  I'm still thinking about my langostino tacos, even if this is a chain.
