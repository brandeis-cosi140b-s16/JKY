Street tacos...but inside!

Best tacos ever? Yeah I have to say so. They have every type of meat and style that I can think of. 

Ok, so the store is laid out in stations for different types of tacos/food. Start near the entrance furthest from the dining area and start loading up your tray with anything that looks good.

I recommend to get the mexican style street corn, a vampiro if you've never had one, and definitely the al pastor (pork on rotating spit) tacos. One of the guys there even gave me a slice of beef tongue (lengua) to try and it was awesome. I would probably get this on a taco or even a vampiro next time I go. 

The only downside is that the tacos tend to get pricey because you want so many. But it was worth it. Thanks to Suzanne O. for showing me this place!
