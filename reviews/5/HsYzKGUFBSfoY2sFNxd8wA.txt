Best Carne Asada tacos in the LV valley! I've been searching for years to find Mexican food that comes the closest to the way my grandmother makes it. Sadly to say, I just can't find it, but along the way I've discovered a lot of great places. Fausto's is a small store with BIG taste. You may believe that you can find similar at Roberto's, although I love Roberto's I believe Fausto's is better and has more of  a homemade style feel to its Mexican food. Get place to go at anytime
