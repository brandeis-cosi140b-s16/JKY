Highly recommend this place!!  Fantastic food!  Very filling!  As a matter of fact, I am still full after 3 shredded chicken soft tacos and a carne asada burrito.  I went to lunch 8 hours ago!  Food is served very prompt and is absolutely delicious!  Taco bell, Mad Mex and other "authentic mexican" establishments are like puke compared to this place.  You order at the counter and then your're seated.  Before your meal, you are served tortilla chips and the best organic salsa this side of the border!  The interior is bright, yet not too overwhelming.  A nice blend of deep reds and black.  I always love to find new places to call my own.  Please include this place as a precursor to your daily siesta!
