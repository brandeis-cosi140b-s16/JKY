I haven't had EPL in a long while - I'm so glad I decided to have lunch here. The food is always fresh tasting, the chicken is ONLY grilled to perfection - they don't fry anything but the churros, fries, crunchy tacos, or tostada bowls.
I love the salsa bar with its variety, and the cashier was amazingly friendly.
EPL has never let me down on flavor, it's consistency for service, and it's atmosphere.
I have not eaten fast food Mexican in about 20 yrs, I find quality places like this or family owned places are usually the best places to get your grind on.

If you haven't tried El Pollo Loco, you're missing out on good grub :)
