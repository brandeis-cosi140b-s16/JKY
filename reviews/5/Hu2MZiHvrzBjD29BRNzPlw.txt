Small, unassuming restaurant. Best chorizo and eggs in the valley. The beans are tasty, flour tortillas are fresh and the potatoes are seasoned perfectly. The owners and their family members are the only workers. Don't expect anything fancy. Parking is a pain because of light rail construction but well worth the hassle.
