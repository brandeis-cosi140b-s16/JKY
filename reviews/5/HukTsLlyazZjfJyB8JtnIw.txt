I know what many of you must be thinking -how can a Filly B's have 4.5 stars? Well I'll tell you how, It's not your average Filibertos. There is a hostess when you first walk in.  The bar is on the left.  Yes folks I said a bar! There's a big screen, music, pool table and full service bar! Boom.
You sit down at a table, there is a waitress and you are given actual menus.  The staff is so cool, friendly, and humble. Everyone I bring here is surprised its a Filibertos, yet the same good food and low prices as all the other chains.

Foods I would suggest would be the carne asada tacos, nachos, steak ranchero, chorizo con huevos, ceviche, bean & cheese burritos & most importantly the deep fried ice cream.  Can I get an amen? Come down and bring some friends.

Tip- the drive thru is now open but I highly suggest foregoing the drive thru & stepping on in!
