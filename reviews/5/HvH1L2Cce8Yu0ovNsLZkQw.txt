Had another great experience here with a group of 5 and many different dishes were ordered.  Everything delicious but noticed red sauce was hotter than usual.  Loved the warm chips with the freshly made salsa!  Many people wait on you so you are never in need of anything.  I cant wait to go back for a more expensive evening meal.
