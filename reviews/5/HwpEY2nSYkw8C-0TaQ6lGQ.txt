I went there around lunch time and there were only a couple other customers which was nice. I ordered a machaca and egg burrito and they didn't have any problem making it for lunch which was great. My wife ordered the carne asada quesidilla. The food came out very quickly and we just had time to make our to go salsa cups from the salsa bar. My burrito was very tasty with a lot of meat and egg. I really liked the pico de gallo style with it. My wife really liked her quesidilla, she really liked the tortilla it was wrapped in. The reason we stopped by was because whenever we passed by on our way home the drive-thru was always busy even on Easter morning. We will be back to try different stuff, so far really good.
