I've been coming here every week for the past  year and didn't think to write a review until now. I've tried a few things on the menu and almost always end up getting the chicken tacos. The fish taco's are great too. 

The customer service at this location gets 10 stars. Sometimes it takes awhile for the food to come out during lunch hours, but the wait is always worth it. No other fast food restaurant I've been to (especially Qdoba's, Chipotle, and Baja Fresh) even compares to Rubio's.
