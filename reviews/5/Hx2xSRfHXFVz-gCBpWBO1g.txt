I have been coming here for a long time - before it became CC's it was Chuy's, one of my favorite places for a casual meal. When Chuy's closed I was pretty bummed out.  I am so glad that Angela and Joyce took over and kept the place going - with pretty much the same recipes!  The food is as good as ever!  Great food, fair prices and a self serve chips and salsa bar.  How can you go wrong?  Highly recommend the 1/2 or 1/4 chicken, although the salad is really goo too.
