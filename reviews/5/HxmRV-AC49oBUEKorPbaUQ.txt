Jaime totally rocks!!! She knew what had onions in it and how. Never had someone as knowledgable about the intricacies of the menu. We were impressed with her ability to remember all of our altered orders. Also, I'm so boring, I get the same thing at every Mexican restaurant, Chimichanga with Carne Asada. I have been to hundreds of places and this, by far, has the best Carne Asada ever!!! It's tender and smoky. Gracias!!!
