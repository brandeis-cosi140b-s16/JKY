As part of our effort to get out and around to different parts of this fabulous town we have now lived in for eight months, we ventured over to Tivoli Village to check out the area. When there we saw a couple neat places to eat, but we decided Cantina Laredo looked like a cool place to take the family. We came in and sat on the patio outside. It was a beautiful night and Tivoli Village is a cool place to look at, so the patio is a plus to this place. Alexandria voted on us and did a fantastic job. She knew the menu very well and helped us select our entrees. They have a good kids menu with great pricing. We had their Chille Con Queso dip as an appetizer along with there chips and salsa. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with black beans and rice. The tacos were phenomenal, I had no choice, but to clean my plate of them. The black beans were also good. The only complaint I had was the rice which was okay, but had a lime flavor that was a little overwhelming. But, overall really good. My wife had the Chicken Quesadilla for her meal and enjoyed it. We wanted to try the Mexican Apple Pie which looks amazing, but we were too full. Oh well...maybe next time!
