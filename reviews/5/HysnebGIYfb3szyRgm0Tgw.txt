My wife and I tried Los Dos Molinos a few years ago on a whim, unsure if I could handle the spicy food they advertised.  To put it simply, I loved the food and I kept coming back.

Before I touch on the food, I want to give credit to the staff.  I've seen the same group of  people working there for a couple years.  They are friendly and do a good job managing an often busy dinner hour.  The service can be a little slow if they are really hopping, but instead of worrying about it I enjoy the chips and salsa and relax, knowing that a superb meal will be coming my way.  The kitchen is small and there may be a wait on your food, but trust me it is worth it!

About the food - my favorite dish is the "Special G" Adovada Burrito with red chili.  It's a delicious pork burrito smothered in cheese and red chili (my personal choice).  The red chili is always spicy, but it can vary quite a bit depending on the batch of chilis that were used.  

The frozen margaritas are superbly smooth and pack a pretty good punch.  My favorite is the prickly pear flavor - give it a try if you haven't before, it is quite good!

So, do you like spicy good?  If so, I'd highly recommend giving Los Dos a try.  Good food, good drink, friendly staff, all from a family owned businesses.  What's not to love about that?
