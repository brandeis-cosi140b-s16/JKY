This place is awesome.

Their portions are huge, but their prices aren't.  I've been here over 30 times and the food is always really good.  I just got a HUGE breakfast burrito with steak, eggs, cheese and potatoes for only $5.29, you can't beat that!

Their carne asada nachos are huge enough for two people.  I always like their carne asada quesedillas too.  Those are just my preferences, but the tacos are huge and cheap, the rolled tacos are tasty, the fish taco comes with lots of fish... you see where I'm going.  

Make sure to stop in and try their red sauce, they're really good, and I particularly like their spicy onions!  

Go here, you can't go wrong.
