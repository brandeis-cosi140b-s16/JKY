We were one of their first ten customers when they opened the downtown Glendale location. I was so excited to see them in North Glendale . It's not fancy, but you get great food at reasonable prices. Their red tamales with sauce are to die for. My favorite chorizo is still Carolina's , but they run a close second here.
The carne asada rocks!!
