Our family loves Tosinos! We've eaten in and taken out, and the service is always quick! The staff is friendly and accommodating. Our food has always been great. We've tried the Carne asadas fries, the Super nachos, bean and cheese burrito, quesadilla, California burrito, and torta. My husband thinks cream should be included on the torta, which was his only complaint, but otherwise it's yummy. The meat is always yummy, even our 11 month old like it! The store is always clean, which is a must! It's definitely a place we'll continue to frequent as long as we live in Gilbert!
