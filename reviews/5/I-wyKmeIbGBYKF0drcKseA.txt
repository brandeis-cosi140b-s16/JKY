I have enjoyed eating at fat burrito for years. Every time I go, they deliver with the same great quality and yesterday was no exception. 

There are so many great things on the menu from the burritos to the quesadillas. I particularly love the chicken soft tacos. 

Their variety of fresh-made salsas are among the best. Do yourself a favor and get a side of case so dip with whatever you get. That stuff is awesome.
