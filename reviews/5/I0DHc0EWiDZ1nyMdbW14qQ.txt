Wife and I went here for a late dinner and were lucky enough to be seated immediately as it was crowded.  Word of warning - if you aren't sure exactly where this restaurant is in it's plaza, and arrive after dark as I did, you may drive around a bit.  I circled twice before spotting the sign (pun intended). 

I had a pickly pear margarita on the rocks.  Excellent!

Appetizer - chips and salsa.  $7!  Underwhelming and not recommended.

My meal was the roast pork loin on a bed of mac and cheese seasoned with New Mexico green chiles, surrounded by tempting sauces.  Very well presented/plated.  Pork had crispy, flavorful edges.  Mac and cheese not overwhelmed with creamy cheese, and great chile flavor.  Devine.

Wife had salmon tostada -  salmon on a bed of black bean mango salsa. Salsa was cool and flavorful.  Salmon very good.  Complex flavors.

For dessert we split the soppapilas (sp?) with cinnamon ice cream.  Very nice presentation and subtle honey flavors in the sauce - perhaps too subtle.

$108 for the meal and it kicked Houston's butt (where dined the previous weekend) for almost the same price.

Interesting decor - the lights mounted on framed cowhide which is covered in chicken wire were ... interesting.  Variety of interesting seating available, including some comfy looking curved sofas.  Bar inside showing the Winter Olympics - of which I am just about at overload - but no TV sound to disturb the dining experience..

Next time I'll get there in daylight to enjoy the views and a drink on the patio which looks like it would be loads of fun.  Highly recommended.
