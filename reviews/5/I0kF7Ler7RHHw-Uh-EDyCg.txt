Thank you Yelp..because I would probably have never ventured out to visit Las Lupitas if not for the ridiculously high ratings, and I'm glad I did because everything was awesome!
They have a display case with a number of raw meats including chorizo fresco, fajita steak, different hams, pork belly and other pork cuts, chicken thighs, and even blood pudding. The end of the display case has a number of Mexican cheeses (oaxica, queso fresco, chihuahua were among some I saw). All of the meats and cheeses seemed to be between $5-8 per pound except the thin fajita steak was $10/lb. 
They also have cooked carnitas and barbacoa, and I order a pound of each ($7 for carnitas, $8.50 for barbacoa) The barbacoa was well-seasoned with a good hint of chile and other spices and was pretty tender. The carnitas weren't seasoned as heavily but they were SOO tender. Aside from making tacos, I actually used leftover carnitas for BBQ sandwiches the next day which were also incredible!
They also sell tortillas that are literally warm off the tortilla press when you get them for just $1/lb.
They had different salsas to choose from as well- salsa verde, one with arbol chiles, pico de gallo, an habanero salsa, and plain red salsa. Each was $2 and they are cash only because the salsas do not have barcodes apparently. I just got the salsa verde, but I wish I had tried more because the salsa verde was incredible!
They also sell avocados, Mexican sodas, and beer that I noticed. The service was friendly, everything I got was incredible, and the prices were really cheap for the amount of delicious food you can get.
