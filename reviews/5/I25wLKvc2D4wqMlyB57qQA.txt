Just devoured my breakfast torta- scrambled eggs, retried beans, cheese, and guacamole. It was served on fresh bread. Yum! This fast food restaurant has typical mexican meat options: chorizo, milanesa, carne asada, etc., (not sure about veggie or dairy free ) Las Famosas De Jose are reasonably priced and very filling. My 7 and 12 year old also enjoyed the food and the fresh orchata, pineapple,  watermelon and cantaloup drinks.  We will definitely return. Don't let the open 24 hour sign deter you. It was clean.
