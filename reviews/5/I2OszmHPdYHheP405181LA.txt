Since Espo's has returned, it's given me a reason to go back to chandler in search of some decent Mexican food.  This joint really measures up to some of the best Mexican food in the valley and when it went away it damn near brought a tear to my eye.  The Green chili is the best, and it hasn't changed in flavor since its return.  I recommend the El Jefe burrito, its steak and green chili with a kick, the green chili its hot and the steak is tender and peppery.  
Espo's hasn't been open very long and so the soda fountain isn't working but they gladly gave me a free soda when I needed a refill.  The staff is pretty friendly and they were appreciative that we came back to dine there. I highly recommend this place for great Mexican food in chandler.
