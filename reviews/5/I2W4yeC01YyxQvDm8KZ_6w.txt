Loved the quesadilla tacos!! The place is small but very clean. You wouldn't expect to find great food as it looks like any other little hole in the wall.. They dont have a soda machine and all their drinks come in an old fashion soda bottle. 
They also have an outside taco stand serving the same delicious tacos you get inside. Everyone is super friendly and very helpful. 
I will definitely be coming back for some more delicious tacos!
