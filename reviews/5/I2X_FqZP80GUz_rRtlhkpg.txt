This place is the gem of Vegas!! For all your late night meals Laurita's California Burrito is affordable and darn good! If you are running low on cash/want a quick bite late at night, Laurita's is your place. Great menu options(over 20+) and service is prompt and courteous. The food feels authentic and makes you want to return after long days/nights on the Strip being open 24 hours a day. All day everyday meal status in Vegas!
