This is like a Zaba's, but with a Island taste. The steak has this great slightly sweet taste and is amazing. They also have homemade bark, which is amazing as well. They have trantional Kahlua Pig as well. In addition to the food, the people that work here are amazing. I was greeted and asked several times if I needed anything and if everything was to my liking. I have already been back several times and will continue to go here.
