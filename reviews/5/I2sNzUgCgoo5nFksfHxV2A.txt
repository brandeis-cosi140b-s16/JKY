Great location this is a well oiled team working on the lunch shift during the week. I have come here many times and had great service that was fast and friendly. Everything that I could ask for in a lunch time hang out. I will also say the food separation for Vegans\Vegetarians is great and the employees don't mind changing gloves and that is a HUGE plus in my book.
