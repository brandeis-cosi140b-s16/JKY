Love Don Tortaco! My family and I eat there at least 1-2x a week! I recommend walking in to order as their drive thru speaker is horrible and makes it hard for the employees to hear the order. The staff is super friendly and the food is great, quick & cheap! We love the carne asada nachos, bean and cheese burritos and chicken Tortas. The California burritos are soooo good, but sooooo huge!
