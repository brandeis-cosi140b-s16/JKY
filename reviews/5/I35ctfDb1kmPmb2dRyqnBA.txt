San Felipe's Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. I've been coming here since it opened, and I haven't been disappointed yet! Here's some of my favorite things about them:

Happy Hour - San Felipe's has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You can't beat that!

Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and they're quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!

Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipe's is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. It's a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)

Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. I'll definitely be back!
