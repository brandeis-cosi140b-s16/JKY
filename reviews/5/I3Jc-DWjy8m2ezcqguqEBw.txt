This location has always gone above and beyond for me.  I have Celiac Disease and cannot ingest gluten.  Not only do they know their menu well (all of them) to steer me in the right direction, they follow the corporate guidelines for gluten intolerance perfectly including changing gloves, spoons, containers, washing hands, wiping down the line, etc.  They go out of their way to make sure you feel safe eating there.  What I especially like is they don't make you feel like a pain like sometimes other locations and restaurants can.  For some reason, them seem to understand that my need for them to follow protocol is a serious thing related to my health which I appreciate.  Even when I order online, the manager reviews often times what they've done or notes that they did follow gf procedures which gives that extra piece of mind.  I've been there many times especially when busy and I appreciate when one of the staff recognize me or my order which makes me feel welcomed and appreciated as a customer.  I have written tot he corporate office regarding their inconsistent gf protocol in each store (which is still better than the average restaurant and their understanding of gluten free) and mentioned that this location goes above and beyond and should be used as a model location.

I appreciate all they do!
