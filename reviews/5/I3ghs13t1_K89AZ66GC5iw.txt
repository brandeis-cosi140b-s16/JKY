This was our second Camacho's experience. We were very excited to return after our first visit. 

We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night at 7pm, none-the-less) by a very friendly and attentive hostess.

First, I had a Blue Moon on Draft, which was poured just right and served with a slice of orange. My wife had the largest Margarita I've ever seen. The service was fast, friendly and professional, and the drinks were wonderful.

They then served out chips and we requested the table guacamole ($8.95) which is absolutely fantastic. Made with fresh avocados, lime, cilantro, jalapeno, etc....right at our table. (This was the main feature that brought us back from last visit).

We ordered the Chicken Taquitos and a Chicken Enchilada dish. Both were fantastic and flavorful.

The decor is excellent and we were treated to LIVE Mariachi music by 5 very fine musicians. 

The price was a little high, but my wife's $18 margarita and the $8.95 (well worth it) table guac are probably the culprit. (our check was $58....$12 tip for a total of $70)

We will certainly be returning.
