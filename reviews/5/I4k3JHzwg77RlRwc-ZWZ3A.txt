Really good food and a large qty our sever was really nice and willing to work with us. I like spicy my mom did not and willing to dumb down spices for her. The chips they give are hand made and gave me three diff salsa's the pink one is really good if you like hot :-) very friendly atmosphere and relaxed they make guaimolie sorry don't know how to spell it but you have to ask for it. It is not openly offered but I think you eat it with the chips not sure. But very good food. If you like salsaritas, they have nothing on this place and forget chilies :-) oh BTW this was my first time here
