When I first came to town in 93 the Realtor showing me commercial rentals took me here for lunch.  And I got a bit of a history lesson of Southwest Phoenix.  I got part of the story about Garcia's becoming a chain and being sold and this one location being bought back.  As he used to own a home where Maryvale High School is I also got a history lesson on John F. Long (whom I later met as a customer) and the build up of the Maryvale neighborhood just to the West of here.

I enjoyed that meal.  Since then I have taken business acquaintances, relatives, dates and friends here.  I have yet to have anyone complain.  It's not so spicy as to turn people off.  The thin chips are always served warm.  They used to serve two salsas, now they only serve the mild except on request.  The food is consistent every time.  The only thing I have ever had I wasn't enamored with was the margarita I once had.  The service is always great except it is consistently hard to get the bill.  They can handle several 10-20 party groups at a time.  During dinner hours they quite often have strolling musicians.

This last time I stopped in for lunch and got the chimichunga lunch special for $8.00 which came with rice and beans and chips and salsa.  I was stuffed.  The food came quickly and was just as I expected.  When I got there about 11:15 there were still plenty of parking spaces, by the time I left at 12:00 the parking lot was packed.

I don't hardly ever give 5 stars and I am pretty sure I wouldn't on a one time visit here but how else can you rate a place you are willing to drive from wherever in the Valley for and not be worried about whether anybody with you will like it.
