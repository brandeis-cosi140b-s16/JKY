Stopped in and the owner was very friendly. He showed us some paintings he did, and even sat down to talk with us for a bit. The enchiladas were good and the carne asada tacos were even better.

I also had a mango jalapeno margarita. I normally do not like frozen margaritas, but this one was fantastic. We will be back.
