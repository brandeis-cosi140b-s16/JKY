My friend and I went for lunch last week right at opening (1030) and while my meat filling (barbacoa) was ready, my friend's (steak) was not.  In exchange for our having to wait, they comped our entire meal without our even saying anything or lodging any kind of complaint.  Plus the barbacoa was phenomenal as always.  Love this place and their willingness to "make it right" is refreshing.
