This is how I feel about this place:

If I was on death row and they asked me what I wanted as my last meal, I would say the Enchiladas Mixta from Three Amigos in Charlotte.

Yes, that dinner plate was that good. Best I have had since I moved here in June from Chicago. It has one enchilada jalisciences, one enchilada verde, one enchilada poblano, one enchilada en salsa tomate, and a nice slab of grilled skirt steak. Each sauce is the real deal. As good as the ones my mother-in-law makes and she is a top notch Mexican cook. The steak grilled to perfection.

That plate alone earns this place a 5 star rating and I'm basing that on the fact that every Mexican joint I've tried here absolutely SUCKS. If I'm going to eat Mexican food I don't want watered-down-not-too-spicy-yo-quiero-Taco-Bell-faux Mexican food. If you do, then this is not the place for you.

As for how the place looks, if that even matters to you, it is an absolute hole in the wall and not very spacious inside. Location and lot are sketchy as heck and I love it! It's like visiting Little Village in Chicago and knowing that the cook in the kitchen knows how to throw down but you are not sure if you will survive the visit. (Chicagoan inside joke.) Add cheap prices and you've hit gold. Packed on a Saturday with 10 minute wait time. Waitstaff is attentive and eager to please. Good choice of beer and the margarita seems to be popular here.

If you have had better, than hit me up and tell me the next place I should try, but for now this is my spot.  

PS- Even the chips and salsa are 5 star rating worthy. 

PSS- I will have to visit again and force myself to try something else on the menu just so I know if other menu items are just as authentic. For now, this is a rating based on eating the Enchildas Mixta, chips and salsa, small guacamole, and drinking a nice $4 glass of rum and coke.
