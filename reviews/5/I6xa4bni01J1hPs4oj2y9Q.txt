I've been there three times in the past week ... outstanding food, great prices.  I'm not much of a salad eater, however I really dig on their salad.  I skip ordering any dressings and go straight to their fresh salsa bar, grab a cup of the hot green salsa, and use that instead.  

Highly recommended for a quick, tasty, inexpensive Mexican meal.
