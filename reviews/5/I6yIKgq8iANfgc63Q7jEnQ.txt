this place is my family's favorite ! they have great foot long burritos for $4.99. it is huge, packed full of whatever you want . that is the best price we can find for the quality. the soft chicken tacos are amazing. the serving size is definitely a great value . we never had a bad order . all are made fresh. we love it! beats Taco Bell anyday.
