Ever since I moved to Las Vegas from California in 2004, I've been looking for Mexican food restaurants that remind me of home. Even though it has always been against my best judgement, I had to settle for the inferior Roberto's. Settle no more. 

I work at a school up the street from Molcasalsa and surprisingly I never ventured in until yesterday. I ordered a carne asada burrito and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. While I waited for my order, I filled up ramekins with molcajete, red, and green salsas. 

My order arrived after a few minutes and I started with the burrito. The beef was tender, the pico de gallo bright and fresh, and the guacamole was silky smooth. I loved the taquitos, too, covered in creamy guacamole and cheese.

What surprised me was the restaurant's namesake, the molcajete salsa, was my least favorite part of the meal. However, both the red and green salsas make up for it in the taste and spiciness categories. 

I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the food is great, and great Mexican food is rare in Las Vegas.
