Yummy yummy. I had one of the best enchiladas from here. The tacos are good too. I was greeted by a very nice lady and they had my food to me in no time. From the outside its not that flattering but inside its so cute, they also have a patio area which is nice during the summer. Their margaritas are great plus the prices are good.
