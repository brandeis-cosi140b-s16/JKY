Ok, so I never met the owner, have no past with him, yet from the first day I started dining at Phranks restaurant, he has done NOTHING but made me feel like I have known him all along. Get here before the lunch rush because it gets absolutely packed, and for all the right reasons. Phrank isn't just any ordinary restaurant owner as you will see him at the register himself, ensuring that all his customers receive the satisfaction they deserve. The food you ask? I come from California and lived in Las Vegas for three years looking forward to every trip back home for some decent Mexican food, and when I met Phat Phranks, it was love at first burrito.
