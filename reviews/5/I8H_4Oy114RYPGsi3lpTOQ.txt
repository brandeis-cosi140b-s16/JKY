Visiting Phoenix for a conference and saw great reviews of this place on Pinterest: Luncha Libre did not disappoint! We had the Chicken-Dilla, it was delicious! All the ingredients were fresh. The chips and salsa tasted amazing, just the right amount of spicy. The drinks are very refreshing, they're served in huge mason jars you can take with you. Prices are right on point. Staff is super friendly and helpful. The place is nicely decorated with merchandise of Mexican Luchadores, very unique.Will definitely be coming back to Luncha Libre everytime we come back to Phoenix.
