Had dinner here last night with family and after reading all the other reviews, I decided to write mine. I have been coming to this location for a few years. Never have had a bad experience. After seeing the negative reviews it makes me wonder if the people had actually came here or they are just natural whiners who complain about everything.

1st. When we arrived we were promptly seated. Just like all the other times we have been here. Even when we come for a birthday celebration and have 15+ people we never wait more than 10 minutes. 

After being seated we had chips and salsa brought to our table immediately and our drink orders were taken shortly thereafter. I can't say how long because I don't carry a stopwatch to time how long everything takes. Apparently others do reading other reviews where they say they sat for ten minutes, it took 10 minutes to get drinks, etc. 

When our drink orders were taken, our server asked if we would like any appetizers to start. We ordered two cheese crisps.

The cheese crisps came out in a timely manner. (Again not timed.) They were very good. Definitely recommend the cheese crisp for an appetizer. 

After bringing drinks the server took our order. She was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with our orders. I had the beef chimi with rice and sour cream and guacamole. Here's the only negative thing I have to say about this restaurant. The red sauce on top of the Chimi was a little sweet for me. My cousin ordered the same thing and made the comment that the sauce tasted like ketchup. That's not a bash on the food. I just didn't care for it. Next time I know order without the sauce on top. 

We also went to the bar area. The bartender, Taylor, was very friendly. I have known Taylor since I started coming to Macayos and have never had an experience that was unpleasant. The guy is always smiling, friendly, and happy. 

It was an overall good experience and I definitely recommend everyone try the food here.
