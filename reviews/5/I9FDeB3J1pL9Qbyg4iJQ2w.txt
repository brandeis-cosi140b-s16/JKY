Just tried this place for lunch. Old Latino grandma was sitting there eating, watching me look over the menu and said "the red chili is very good!" She was right. She said it was the closest thing she's found to her homemade recipe. Looking forward to trying other menu items. I'll definitely be back. Can't believe they've been there 19 years and I never ate there before. This could be the best hole in the wall Mexican food in mesa. We'll see. Gotta go back 4-5 times to know for sure.
