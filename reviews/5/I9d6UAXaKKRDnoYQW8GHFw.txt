what a great surprise to find that the horrible pizza place has turned into a fantastic little Mexican restaurant! This place has excellent service and to-die-for street tacos! Pretty good selection of beers on tap as well as what ever mix drinks you could ever want. Another great thing for me was the jalapeño avocado salsa. ¡Delicioso!
