My whole family adores this place
The shrimp taco and shrimp diablo burritos are amazing. 
The carne fries are fantastic and I love their fresh red salsa 
People complain about the wait but it's worth it. 
A quick drive up the hill home and this is a quick and delicious answer to a fast family dinner!
