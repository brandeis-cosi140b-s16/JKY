Best salsa in town and I've lived here for 37 years and been to the Salsa Challenge every year, but nobody beats Mi Pueblo. I like to mix the mild and hot 50/50. All their food is delicious and very consistent. Not as greasy as *bertos. So glad I live right down the street. Oh yeah, their party platters are awesome too.
