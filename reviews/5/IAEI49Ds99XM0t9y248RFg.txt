The best customer service ever!! Our waitress was very attentive, offered explanations of their various dishes, attentive to the free refills of horchata and jamaica water. Every dish we tried was excellent! Their specialty was my favorite- "la Costra" which you can choose from various options. I had the shrimp and fish. We are definitely coming here again on this same trip in Vegas. The presentation and service was more than expected for their very budget friendly menu!
