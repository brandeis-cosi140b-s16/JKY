Holy mole! La 15 is Oaxacan heaven. Food is generous and wonderful, Ricardo is helpful and friendly, and the horchata comes in a pitcher with a straw. "This place is a keeper," exclaimed my lunch buddy. We eat around the valley at least weekly and seldom return to the same place twice, so this was high praise indeed, seconded by me. Can't wait to try more delicious dishes here.
