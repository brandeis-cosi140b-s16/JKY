I know I can only echo the raving reviews of others, but I think it is important for little places like this to make it. 

The food is to die for.  The chips and salsa are fresh.  Hands down the best homemade tortilla chips I've ever had. My fiance had guacamole which he loved, along with Chorizo burrito and taco which were amazing.  I had the chicken fajitas which were fresh and very well seasoned.  Everything comes with a green and red sauce on the table and the green sauce was especially good.  We put it on everything! The portions are large and the price is small. 

The place itself is pretty small, but it only adds to the charm of it.  The service is the best I've had in a long time.  Give Mas Amigos a try, you will not be disappointed!
