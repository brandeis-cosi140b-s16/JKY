My experience has been delightful. My friends and I came in for a bite and drink while MNF and we enjoyed the food.. I had the Kung Pow Shrimp Tacos... Yuuuummmmm!!! Also had the el pepino margarita, it was perfection every sip of the way. My friend had the deep fried avocado tacos... Pretty good too. I will be coming back to watch the super bowl :)
