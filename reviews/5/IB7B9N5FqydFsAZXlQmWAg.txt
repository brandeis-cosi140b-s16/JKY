I usually go during the lunch hour. The place is always busy and very popular. The crew is hustling about, helping customers and they're courteous, friendly, and eager to help. The smell of food fills the air and it's plenty loud with conversation and kitchen activity. 

The portions are normally hefty; you will not leave hungry. The food is fresh and always tasty. It's a little on the greasy side, but as much as one might expect from a local favorite Mexican food restaurant. 

The place is on a crappy-looking strip mall with limited parking. It's not very good looking and the dining area feels slightly cramped. However, the service and food make up for it. I highly recommend!!
