Everything we had was DELICIOUS!!! We ordered mini tacos (carne asada, chicken and carnitas) with rice & frijoles/chips & salsa. Salsa tasted freshly made.  Finished it off with Churros. Seriously, best Mexican food we had in a while. In love with their rice & frijoles. Our picky 6 year old even finished off a bowl of their rice.  They were very friendly and helpful. Already thinking of having lunch there tomorrow.
