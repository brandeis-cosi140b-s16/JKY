After you eat here, just once, you'll be wrecked on eating tacos anywhere else in Phoenix.   Take 3 friends, and order the "special" where they bring a char-broiler to your table with 3 different kinds of meats.  Like $24.   Order guacamole.   It's actually guacamole, not mush.  The salsa is fantastic.   Kind of a rough neighborhood, but close enough to downtown you'll be fine.  Brush up on your Espanol and be prepared for some of the best eating you've ever done.
