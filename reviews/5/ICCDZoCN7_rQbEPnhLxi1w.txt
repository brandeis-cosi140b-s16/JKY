I just arrived here about a week ago from Virginia to visit my mom who lives in Glendale.   I simply love places like this.  Cozy, friendly, inexpensive, and good food.  Waitress was very friendly and the salsa is very good.  I had the shredded beef burrito with red chili sauce and is was so good!  After reading some of the reviews I realized I missed out on the horchata!  :(  Next time!
