I stopped in today as I had a taste for fish tacos. I was greeted by Caroline who promptly took me to my table and took my drink order. She came back quickly made a few suggestions about the menu, recommended the fish tacos as they were sauteed mahi mahi, so naturally I jumped on this! Two minutes later two different types of salsa and crispy warm chips were presented. (best salsa ever, the tomatillo is served warm!! It's got some heat to it and it's delish)
Probably 10 minutes later my taco's were served with cilantro rice and black beans. I don't care for cilantro and mentioned to Caroline I would ask for the taco's to be served with out it next time, at that time she offered to get me tomato rice to replace the other, I turned it down, I had enough food to eat as it was! The taco's were a delicious. Overall the experience was great.Even the manager Dave stopped by to say hello and check on me. And not once did I have to hear my yound server say NO PROBLEM!! She was professional and gracious, I'll go back for sure, can't wait to have a margarita next time.
