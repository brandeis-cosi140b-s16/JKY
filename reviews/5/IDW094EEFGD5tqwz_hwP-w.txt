This is a review for the fellas, but ladies - pay attention:
Guys, there is only one reason to go to the mission, and it's to take your lover there and show her that you are a man of distinguished tastes and also that you have slightly too much money, but not too much that you're frivolous - just enough extra that you can afford things like expensive tiny tacos and fancy drinks.

When you go to the mission, maybe it's best to eat inside, because the lights are low, and the wood is dark, and it's moody - do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a romantic atmosphere.  So first get some drinks, and I recommend their margaritas, or their tequila mojito, but if you're a guy only order the tequila mojito if your lady already knows that you are a strong lover, because you don't want to send the wrong message, but it's an amazing drink.

Next, it's time for the tacos.  Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.  They're sold three at a time, so your will order three tiny tacos, and your lover will order three tiny tacos as well, and then maybe once the food comes, you have an opportunity to swap one.  Or maybe two.  Do you see what I'm saying?

Finally, desert.  Hey, get another drink and get some fried bananas - that's both a suggestive dish, and something delicious, and it lets you both set the mood for what happens after dinner.

That's it.  If you don't like the food or drinks, you don't know what good is, and if you haven't set the mood right, then you have nobody to blame but yourself (or maybe you need to be more discerning about your choice of lovers).  The Mission.
