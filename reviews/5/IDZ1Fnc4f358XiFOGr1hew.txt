Mike and I ate there last night.  The frozen Margarita's are awesome!  I had the shrimp tacos with grilled vegies and Mike had the ground beef enchiladas-Wonderful.   The salsa and bean dip for the tortilla chips is great, too.
Our server and the staff was top notch.  It was a great dining experience.
