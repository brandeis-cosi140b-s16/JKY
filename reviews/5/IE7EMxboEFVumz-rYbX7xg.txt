Tried all the burrito places recently and find this one the best! Pricing seems to be the same across the board. The food here is tasty, not burnt like at others and a great amount of it.
Service was fast and friendly and it was a lunch rush!
Quality AND quantity here!!
Fresh Chips and queso awesome... Chipotle doesn't do queso! What? ?
