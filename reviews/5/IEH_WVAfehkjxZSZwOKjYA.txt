I really do hate Mexican food.  I'm too picky to enjoy the massive amounts of pepper flavors and onions that permeate this type of food.  However, there is one place on earth that I would choose to get Mexican food any day of the week.  Bajio!

I was actually introduced to this place while I was in Utah and was ecstatic to find it here in AZ.  There used to be one on Stapley that we went practically every time we went out to the EV.  Unfortunately, that location is no longer.  Anyway, Bajio prepares high quality and flavorful food that doesn't break the bank.  My favorite items are the ones with the shrimp.  Just trust me and get it, you can thank me later.  Their salads are also really great and a nice alternative to the heavier fare.

I really wish that Bajio would come downtown and make my dreams come true, but until then, I guess I'll have to make the trek up here to get it.
