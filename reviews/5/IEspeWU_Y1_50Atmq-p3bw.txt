My family went to Popo's for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it. The service was excellent (ask for Whitney), the food came out quickly and everything tasted very good. Some of the best mexican rice I've had, and my chicken burrito enchilada style was really good as well. Portions are very large. My husband had the $.99 margarita and said while you can tell it only costs a dollar, it was good for what he paid for it. No complaints. We will definitely be back!
