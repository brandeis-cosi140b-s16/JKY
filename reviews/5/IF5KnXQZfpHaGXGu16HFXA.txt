La Palapa used to be an unsuspecting stand in the Strip District, a hidden gem to stumble upon for the best authentic Mexican grub in the city.  Now, La Palapa has moved to the South Side (taking over Thai Me Up's old location)--and the food as only gotten better.

If you don't want to try a taco or quesadilla, which are excellent, I'm a huge fan of their mole chicken (mole poblano con pollo). A cup of their soup goes a long way, too, and they have a solid variety to choose from--tortilla, black bean, fish, and vegetarian.

I haven't tried any of their desserts yet, but I can't wait to come back and try the flan. It's a small space, fairly unsuspecting, but it's hard to be let down with something this authentic.
