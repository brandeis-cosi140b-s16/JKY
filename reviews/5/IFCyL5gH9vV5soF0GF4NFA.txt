Seriously so delicious....we tried a little bit of everything and it was all so good. The salsa is delicious...the chips are coated in this red chili powder that add just the right amount of flavor. The sizzler burrito is amazing..the sizzler tacos were bomb..and the sizzler sopaipilla was next level. You need to try this if you haven't.
