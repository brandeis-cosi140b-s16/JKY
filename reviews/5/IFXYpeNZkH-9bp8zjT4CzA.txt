Same concept as Chipotle but with a delicious Hawaiian twist which, in my opinion, makes it sooooo much better!!! You're greeted with a smile and the pricing is quite reasonable when you consider the portions. Do NOT skip out on the coconut bark!!! If you're unsure, ask for a sample. You'll be hooked!!! Their guacamole is also delicious. I usually make sure to get some on the side to have with chips later.
