We were watching a show this afternoon, and they were featuring wet burritos. They inspired us to search nearby for a place to try. We were pleasantly surprised to find this place, as it is very close. Based on the great Yelp reviews...and a photo of the exact burrito we craved...we were headed out the door two minutes later. 
There were two people working, and the restaurant was clean. The flat grill was really clean, which was very nice to see. The interior is very simple, with no decorations. Not very inviting, but we were taking our food to go so that did not bother us. 
We ordered one burrito pastor, and one carne asada. They were done quickly, and we headed home. The food was excellent. We will definitely be coming back. Clean restaurant, friendly people and excellent food...check, check and check!
