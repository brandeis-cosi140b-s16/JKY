Great ambience a little too crowded but that alone says a lot of the place :) waiting time was an estimate of 30 mins for a party of two (too long) we decided to wait next thing you know it only took 10 mins to be seated (thumbs up) to drink I ordered a blue margarita on the rocks it wasn't too strong but I could taste the right amount of tequila in it!  chips and salsa were delicious! Had our fideo soup which was great not too salty like other places! For dinner I ordered Enchiladas de Mole! To be honest those were some really good enchiladas! Loved the mole sauce you can actually taste the home made sauce that makes it authentic! For dessert we ordered a Flameado now that was pretty cool! It's ice cream in flames! Be careful and make sure to blow it! :) we Would definitely be back as it's a great place to socialize and hang out with friends or family!
