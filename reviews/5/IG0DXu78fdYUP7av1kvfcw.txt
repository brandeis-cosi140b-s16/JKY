This place rocks and I love everything about it! I am so excited to have something local and great food that saves me a drive to California! The tacos are awesome and they are so fresh and delicious. I think this place is better than the other similar restaurants in the surrounding area. It's a wonderful place that is kinda hard to get to but is worth it when you get great fish and chips which my toddler loves! I like the shrimp, pork, or chicken tacos. My husband loves the grouper, beef and pretty much everything on the menu! I haven't tried the calamari fries yet but I'm going to the next time we go. We go here at least once every month and would go more if we could. This place is our go to place when we are visiting relatives in Gilbert and any time we need a taco fix!
