This place is awesome. Free chips, salsa, onions and peppers. I had the 3 entree plate. Comes with fideo soup (sooo much flavor). I had the 3 asada tacos ranchero. They were soo good and so big. So much flavor. The rice and beans were also good. The salad they serve with it was super fresh. I ordered a margarita, also super fresh! You can tell they make it fresh and not from mix. The staff is amazing. Very attentive and friendly. They are sincerely happy to have you there because of how new they are. Overall this place is amazing. Finally we have a Mexican restaurant on this side of town that is actually good!!
