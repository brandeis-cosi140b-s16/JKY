Oh Los Sombreros, you steal my heart every single time!!! I have dreams about your hibiscus enchiladas. Each time I eat there I can't wait to come back the next time! It's always amazing to me how many people are foodies living in the Valley and somehow have never been your restaurant. I've always been to the original, never to the new location. I just love the ambiance of that one. Tucked away, a quiet nice surprise when newbies come with me. It's always fun showing them for the first time. The queso fundito, I typically get the shrimp, is right on point. Your margaritas are awesome, however had led me to some rough mornings the next day!! The last time we came it my boyfriend and I did the tasting menu, as it was his first time and I thought it would be nice for him to try multiple things. I think it's a great concept and has some really nice diverse choices. Every time I've been your staff is helpful and friendly without being too overbearing at the table. I recommend you to out of town guests every time! Thank you for your continued commitment to Valley dining! See you very soon!
