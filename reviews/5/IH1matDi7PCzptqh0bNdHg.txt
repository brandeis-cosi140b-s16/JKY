A hidden gem on the strip - but probably not for long. We came on Friday night at the end of everyone's shift, and while they had a day of work under their belts, they treated us wonderfully, especially our server Matthew T. Blood orange jalape√±o margarita was delicious and smooth. Chicken enchiladas were also great. Everything was very fresh. Tucked away on the first floor of the Forum Shops.
