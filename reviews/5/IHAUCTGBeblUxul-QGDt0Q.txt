This place will be my new go to. Restaurant week allowed us to experience three courses and glad that we did!

The salsa was fresh, and we had the option for more chips.

The frozen cocktail was refreshing. The desert lilly wasn't too sweet and had lovely floral and citrus undertones and paired well with our meal. They have a frozen drink du jour. 

We couldn't decide whether to do make your own guacamole or do the three course. Eventually we decided on the three course dinner with the papas gravas and glad we did. Great sauce and a healthy portion- enough for two to split with a couple pieces left over. We sat outside and watched the make your own guac so we'll definitely be back for that.

The pollo and mushroom tacos were amazing. Definitely get the mushroom you won't be disappointed.

After all this food we were stuffed. Topped off with great customer service we can't wait to come back!!
