Okay, so I rarely dole out 5 star rating but IT&B is awesome. We went here after a long ass day and it was just what the doctor ordered. 
We were greeted by one of the owners, whom was exceptionally nice and overly apologetic for the wait. We had a group of 7, no reservations and arrived at 7:30. We were expecting to wait, but he insisted it was abnormal and offered us each a drink as the restaurants apology. 
We got a strawberry marg, Dirty South Andres and a traditional marg which all were awesome. 
The chips, salsa and gauc are amazing. I'm from LA. We don't fuck around with chips and salsa so believe when I say they are good. 
We all got tacos. An assortment. We got a both types of fish taco, carne asada, shrimp, chicken and carnitas and let's just say it was silent for 10 mins at our table of 6 girls and myself while we stuffed ours faces and looked up at each other reassuringly. If you're in Vegas and want a inexpensive meal - off the strip - go to IT&B. 5 stars. All night and day! 
The decor is legit too. Chalked full of kitschy Mexican art and candles. I was a huge fan of the taco chested Virgin Mary in the entry!
