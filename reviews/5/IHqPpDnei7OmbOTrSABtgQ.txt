Went with the my husband to check out the quad. Ventured over here for a bite. We sat at the bar and first off they bring water right away. Being a tree huger I'm a little torn by that. I do always ask for a water to start. I ordered the Palermo and  my husband had  Pancho Via. My drink was outstanding and made with great tequila. I think they make there own house brand. The Pancho via is jalape√±o  tequila watermelon and cucumber. Of course I had to try. So refreshing! I will definitely have some of those come summer time. We had the sopes and lobster tacos. Both were very good. Great dj and as others mentioned mechanical bull. Nice environment plus they have a little lounge area and balcony upstairs. This will be great in the summer. 

TIP: we parked at Cesar's forum shops valet and crossed the street. I think this might be the easiest  parking.
