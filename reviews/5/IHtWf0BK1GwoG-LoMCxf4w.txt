Terrific gourmet Mexican inspired dishes.  Enjoyed the house ceviche--made with Mahi.  Very flavorful mixed with spices and avocado.  Tamales were excellent, actually addicting.  Complimentary chips and 3 salsas were very good as well.  Atmosphere is ok, just don't love that it's in a mall but so are all the other restaurants in Vegas.  Would definitely return.
