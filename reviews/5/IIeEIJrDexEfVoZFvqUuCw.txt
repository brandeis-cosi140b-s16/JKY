We wanted menudo this morning, but since we live in Avondale, we were resigned to go to La Canasta all the way in Phx.  Decided to check yelp and found Michoacan.  So glad we did!  This is the best menudo I've had since nana made it last!  It was clean, cooked perfectly with a delicious hearty broth. Tortillas are homemade, bread is fresh.  Also tried beef rolled tacos and a chicken chimi.  Both dishes were excellent, crispy and fresh.  Great prices.  This is our new menudo spot and ill be back soon to try a quick burro.
