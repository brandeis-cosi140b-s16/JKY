def one of the most authentic fast food places around. service is always a 10/10 and the food is at least a 9.5/10 every single time. i have never had a bad experience in any way shape or form. prices are pretty reasonable. a little more than the filiberto type places but the quality is way above and beyond!!! be wary of the one on estrella and the one on mcdowell though.
