When you need tamales, go here!  They're better than the ones you can pick up at the mexican restaurants, and tons better than the homemade ones offered during fundraisers.  The Tamale Store's tamales are some of the best I've ever had; homemade or professionally made.  You can buy them at farmers' markets or at their location north of Cactus on Cave Creek on the west side of the road in a tiny strip center.  When I picked up my tamales the staff was friendly and very helpful to explain their various flavors of tamales, and the kitchen looked super organized and clean.  

No grainy masa here with only a few shreds of god knows what meat - the masa is the perfect consistency and the quality fillings are generous.  They offer many, many different kinds of tamales from the traditional to unique, spicy to mild, savory to sweet.  Prices are competitive with other restaurants, and lower than many whose tamales aren't nearly as good.
