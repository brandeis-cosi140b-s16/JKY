If you're looking for great tacos, tortas and burritos just like the kind you'd find on the streets of Mexico then this is the place.  

The torta de asada is my favorite.  A Torta is a sandwich made with the meat of your choice.....beans, pickled jalapenos, cheese, tomato, lettuce and buttered bread.  The burritos are also yummy.  In the burrito you get meat, onion and cilantro, the beans and rice come on the side......and the red salsa is so good.

I normally go there for lunch but I'm sure the food is great at any time of the day.
