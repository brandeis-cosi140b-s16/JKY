You can never go wrong with a burrito at chipotle. 

Today I order 6 burritos for everyone at the office. Honestly, I thought they were going to get my order wrong. I was surprised to see how effective they were, they communicated with each others and got my order correct and on time. The staff is always helpful and with a good attitude. I will continue to come to this location.
