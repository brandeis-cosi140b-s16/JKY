Awesome food! I'm partial to New Mexico's style of southwestern/mexican cuisine and Carlsbad does it right. Just had the enchantment platter, chicken blue corn enchilada with green chile, carne adovada burrito, and a chile relleno with a side of rice & beans and sopapilla. They'll top it off with the requisite fried egg if you ask too. Everything was fantastic,  service was great, and the atmosphere is fun. Highly recommended!
