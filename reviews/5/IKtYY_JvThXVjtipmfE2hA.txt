This is as good as it gets - for cheap, fast, fresh and awesome Mexican food.  I always have to stop at this location for a breakfast burrito with no less than 5 cups of hot sauce and a horchata.  The burrito is enough to eat on for the whole day, but the horchata is gone too quickly.  The early morning staff are always friendly guys just waiting for an order.  I think they are a little tickled to see me (a tall non-Latin lady in business clothes) ordering a honking burrito with tons of hot sauce.  

So good.  So cheap.  I miss you Polibertos.  I want to open one in my area.
