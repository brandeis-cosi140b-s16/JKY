Had 3 tacos with rice & beans plate, the pastor was delicious! Meat was flavorful, salsa was spicy and everything was fresh. Fruit water of the day was watermelon and blended to order so I was even more stoked that I stopped in to eat here for the first time.   

I will be coming back. Service was excellent and almost full service, you just pay at the register at the end. Inside was very clean and though minimal decor, a large mural spanning two inside walls gave the place some personality.  

Outside lacks curb appeal, but the area is safe (I live 2 blocks away) and seeing it so much it's quirkiness has grown on me. I get that it's a breakfast/lunch place, but only thing I'd change is to be open later. I'd love to come for dinner but closing at 6pm is too early for me!
