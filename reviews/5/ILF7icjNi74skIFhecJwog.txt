I went here with my dad on our way through Vegas. Soon after we walked in we were greeted by the manager (?) and he walked us through the simple menu in Spanish.

We went with Aldobadas and Lengua. Both were very good, but my favorite was the Aldobadas with the pineapple slice.

The place looks too have opened recently. It's small inside, simply decorated with bright colors.

The food kitchen is open so you could watch everything being made.

Taco prices were mostly 2$ ea. The meat seemed good quality. They are on the small side so expect to order 2 or more.
