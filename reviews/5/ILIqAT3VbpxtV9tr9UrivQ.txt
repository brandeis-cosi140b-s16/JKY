The staff here is always friendly.  There's a sign on the wall saying it's a certified training facility, and they do a wonderful job.  Sadly I've never seen customer service like this at another TB around the valley.  Order is ALWAYS correct and I order some complicated, add this take this off, they always get it right.

While here on this trip I noticed that the 'large' cups that come with the meal have shrunk!  Fountain Mt Dew is one of my guilty pleasures and when I go for TB it's a double treat, I was a bit saddened but realize I sure don't need the bit of dew I was missing!
