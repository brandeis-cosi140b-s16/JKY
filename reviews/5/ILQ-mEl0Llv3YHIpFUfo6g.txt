Been going here for about a year.  Its great and on our regular rotation of places to eat.  The only 2 things I have had there is the Green or Red Burrito but its so good that I don't want to try anything else.  The ladies at the counter are ALWAYS nice and the food is ALWAYS great.  The burrito I get is 3.99 and they give you a cup of chips with salsa.  The best I've had in central Phoenix and we tried most of em.
