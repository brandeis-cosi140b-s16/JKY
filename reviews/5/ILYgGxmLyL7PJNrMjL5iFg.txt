I came to Border Grill while I was on vacation a couple weeks back. I'd found a list of the 10 best brunch spots in Vegas, saw they had one with a Mexican/Spanish influence and booked a reservation. Initially I wanted to come because of the bottomless mimosas but after a very long and trying Friday night instead I ordered a 'refresher.' Note: refreshers are the best hangover helpers around. I was with four other girls and we had the best waitress ever, whose name I wish I could remember! I just remember she had medium length dark brown hair and knew everything about the food. She ordered a few things on the menu for us to get everything started. All in all everything we had was fabulous. We had: churro tots, fruit, home fries, pastor taco, tamale, shrimp and grits, biscuit and gravy, lobster pancake, quesadilla.... and so much more I can't remember. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of were the biscuit and gravy.

If you're in Vegas, check it out! This place is definitely worth a trip. Ask to sit on the patio so you can look out on the pool.
