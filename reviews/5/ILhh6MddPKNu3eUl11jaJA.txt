I'm so happy that Espos is back, I love their food!  Although casual and the food comes out on Aluminum Foil Bowls, it stacks up with any other high end Mexican restaurant in the Basin. 

I love the El Jefe Burrito, it's even better as a Chimichanga, Enchilada Style!  It is a must try either way if you haven't yet.

As I mentioned this is a casual place, but they have a nice patio out front and the restaurant is actually super clean.  In-fact, it has the nicest bathroom of any casual eatery I have every been to.

On a side note, last time I visited Espos, I noticed they have applied for a liquor license; Yea, Margarita's!

Give them a try, you will love it!
