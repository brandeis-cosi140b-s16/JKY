I visited this restaurant last week for lunch with two other friends. We only had an hour for lunch and that was plenty of time! Our food came out quickly and hot. I ordered the arroz con crema. It was soooo delicious.  The servers were also very friendly and attentive.

One of my new favorite Mexican Restaurants. I will be returning soon.
