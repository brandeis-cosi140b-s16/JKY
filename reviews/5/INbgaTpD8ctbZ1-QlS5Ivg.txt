Went to Mando's yesterday and it was fantastic. I had the chile verde burrito this time. My wife and daughter both had the chicken burro and of course they were great. If your looking for great Mexican without all the cheese and junk this is the place, just meat, rice, beans with the onion/cilantro mix. Being that simple your food has to be good! I also live the fact that it doesn't taste salty like alot of Mexican places. If your nearby you should stop by I've never been disappointed.
