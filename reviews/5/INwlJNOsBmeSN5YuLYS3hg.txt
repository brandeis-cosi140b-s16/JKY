A little pricey but the food was amazing! I got the pineapple infusion margarita and it was also delicious, you can really taste the vanilla bean which is why I ordered it. I ordered tacos with rice and beans which were very good in quality and my BF ordered the chicken burrito which he loved. Chips and salsa were not complimentary like most places but very fresh, we spent about $70 bux for just the two of us...
