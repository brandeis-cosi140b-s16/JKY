Yelp has helped me discover so many incredible places recently and this is one of them! By far, this place lives up to its name "The Kings of Tortas" (translation for Los Reyes de la Tortas)! 

Not only are the tortas spectacular, but the service is something you don't find very often! The host was incredibly happy and kind. I told her that this was my first time visiting the restaurant and she kindly walked me through the menu. 

While I was waiting for my order another employee (I think he was the manager) asked the host if I had been helped. She said, "yes, and it's her first time here". I then asked him how spicy the red salsa on Torta Ahogada was, he said "not very spicy". Once my order Take-Out came out, he also brought out a free Torta Ahogada for me to take home! I was so grateful and shocked that he would give me a free torta just because I enquired about it! This is something that showed me how amazing their service was! They have gained a new lifetime happy customer!
