Incredible Mexico City Mexican food (in, you guessed it, the steadily gentrifying barrio) - with absolutely no hint of regional Southwestern or Sonoran flavor, which typifies just about every other Mexican restaurant in town.  A neat non-descript building from the outside, but a wondrous surprise inside.   White tablecloths aside - it's the little touches that strike you:  

* The Coca-Cola in old-school glass bottles ala Mexico. 
* The Virgin Mary/Guadalaupe tall pillar candles at each table.
* Friendly, professional and candid servers.
* The french bread and tapenade.
* Your tableside made guacamole which is hands down the most innovative and tasty guac I've had in a while.  And I consider myself a guacamole junkie. 

I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza, which were flavorful and tender covered in a terrific tomatillo crema.  Great choice, but next time I'm having what my friend ordered - the cochinita pibil.   It's slow roasted for 12 hours every day - and the pork just melts in your mouth.  They have a huge tequila list and a Mexican (who knew?) wine list that ain't bad either.

The Chiles en Nogada (the poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, garlic, pecans, apples, pomegranate and apricot) blew me away!!
