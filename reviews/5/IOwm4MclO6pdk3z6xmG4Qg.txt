I was immediately blown away upon arrival. I was craving tacos, and the place that I had my Groupon deal with was close. Being the yellow that I am I yelped, then called to make sure that Los tacos was opened. I then drove here and pulled up in their drive thru. Daniel the owner asked me to pull up so he could help me since it was my 1st time here. I pulled up and asked for tacos. Not only did he give 4 different meat samples to me and my boyfriend, he gave us like 6 agua frescas samples. My heart was set on the Mango pineapple... We were provided the best customer service ever, and he even have me the address to his dad restaurant in San FranciscoI can't wait to try it when I vacation out there in a couple of months... This place is the best.. I'll be back everytime I'm in Vegas... Thanks Daniel
