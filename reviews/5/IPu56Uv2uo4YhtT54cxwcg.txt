Seriously something special. Living in Arizona you know there's a million taco shops on every corner. I stumbled to this place because a friend lived near, and must say this is by far one of my favorite taco shops! The tacos carmello is really something special. Flour tortilla with white cheese and carne asada!! Don't sleep on these. Also I feel like you can tell a lot about a place by there beans, and they have some of the best beans in Phoenix. The prices are great and anytime you go into a ethnic restaurant  and lots of people of that ethnicity eating there, you know it's official!!
