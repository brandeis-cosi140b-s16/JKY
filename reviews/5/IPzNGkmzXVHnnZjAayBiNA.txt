This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. The ambiance, the food, the service. This place has it all. I was a fan of Richardson's but the Rokerij is such a nice place and I hope they will continue to offer both menus. My only beef is we booked a table for a group on Open Table and when we got to the restaurant no reservations. Honestly I think the problem was on Open Table's end. We ended up having to go to a different place but that can happen anywhere.
