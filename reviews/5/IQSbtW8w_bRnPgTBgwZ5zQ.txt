I went here for the first time today, and I'm glad I did.  My dining out options are limited due to a gluten allergy, and I was looking for something new to try.  Was I ever impressed that almost everything on their menu is gluten free!  I had the sweet pork nachos and they were amazing.  The price wasn't bad either.  This is my new favorite for Fresh Mexican since my options at Baja Fresh, Rubio's and Chipotle are somewhat limited.
