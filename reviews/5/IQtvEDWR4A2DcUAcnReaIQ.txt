My favorite local spot for Mexican cuisine. The hostess Rimma is always so friendly, professional, and sweet. She seems to remember the regulars, including myself, which is a big plus! She even checks with me to make sure everything is okay, which makes me feel like she really cares. The food is always top notch (hats off to the chef) and I always feel comfortable when I come here. It doesnt matter if it is slow or busy, Im always treated great! Thank you :)
