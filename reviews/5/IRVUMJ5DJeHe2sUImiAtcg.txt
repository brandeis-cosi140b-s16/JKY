I cannot say enough good things about Chipotle.  My only complaint is we don't have one here in Hawaii.  

Their burritos are divine.  Flour tortilla, filled with your choice of cilantro-lime rice (they now have brown rice too), pinto or vegetarian black beans, choice of meat (braised carnitas or barbacoa, adobo-marinated and grilled chicken or steak)  guacamole, salsa and cheese and sour cream. You can choose pico, hot or mild sauce. They now have the option of a shell-less burrito in a bowl.

The food here is fresh, fast and tasty.
