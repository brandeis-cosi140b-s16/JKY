El Dorado remains a first-rate dining experience. Wait staff is trained to a high standard; they are professional, courteous and efficient without being intrusive. Neil, our server tonight, is one of the best I've encountered bar none. Ask for Neil, if possible. Everything else in my first review of El Dorado Feb '15 remains true; ingredients are fresh, meats the finest cut/grade (and non-GMO) and the jalape√±o and cucumber margarita best EVER! Accolades to bar staff, too; these guys know their cocktails. El Dorado remains a Las Vegas gem; authentic Mexican cuisine at its best.
