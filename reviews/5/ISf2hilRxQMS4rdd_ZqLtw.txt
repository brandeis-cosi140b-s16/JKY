So I work right down the street from this place and I eat lunch here at least once a week.

The set up of this place is somewhat unique. When you walk in, you walk up to the counter to order your food. If you order a combo meal they give you tortilla chips and this really good hot salsa. When your food is ready they bring it out to you. 

I always get the same thing here: veggie burro without cheese or tomatoes, add extra cilantro. The burro is a pretty decent size and it's full of delicious pinto beans, cilantro, avocado, and onions. I can get that and a small drink for $7, which is not bad. 

The staff is usually very friendly and welcoming and the place is kept pretty clean.

It is good for small-medium sized groups as there is ample seating and booths. They also have plenty of outdoor seating.
