Del Taco FTW!

I love fast food, well, good fast food and DT is it. I love ordering a small Del Burger, Quesadilla and their awesome, crinkle cut fries. The staff when we drove through were actually very nice, detailed and got everything right. The prices continue to be reasonable. I wish we had Del Taco in Pennsylvania, especially stores like this.
