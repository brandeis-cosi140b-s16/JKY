Hands down one of the best places to grab a burrito or tacos! Personally, I'm a huge breakfast burrito fan, and Los Taquitos' always hits the spot. My boyfriend always gets some sort of a burrito from there (even though it's not a breakfast one) as well. Their tortillas taste so unique, and that's honestly an important part of a burrito! They have amazing rice and beans, and their red and green sauce is pretty decent as well. 10/10, would eat here 7 days a week if that wasn't extremely fattening.
