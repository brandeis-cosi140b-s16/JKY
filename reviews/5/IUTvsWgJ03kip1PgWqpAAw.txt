Anytime I move to a new place, one of my first priorities is to find a go-to Mexican spot. Luckily, Cantina 1511 was the first one I tried, and I've never looked back. 

The salsa is probably the best I've ever had, perfect combination of salty and spicy (but not too spicy :)), and the chips are the perfect thickness. Every single time I have gone for dinner, I have ordered the chicken tacos (Ancho Pollo). The beans and rice it is served with creates the perfect compliment to the exciting blend of Ancho chicken, avocado, pica de gallo and chipotle sauce. Absolutely perfect. And the brunch! Goodness, the Avocado Bake is absolutely fantastic. "Citrus poached eggs nestled inside a warm Hass Avocado, topped with melted mixed cheese and habanero crema, served atop a sizzling Al Pastor potato hash and garnish with roasted corn salsa." Seriously, get it.
