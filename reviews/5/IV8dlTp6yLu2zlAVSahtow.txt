After reading the good reviews, my sister, kids & I decided to try this restaurant out. We were welcomed w/ a friendly greeting upon entering & seated right away. 

As everyone mentioned, the food was great & the portions were huge. The burritos were like whoa! Loved all the tacos. The chicken tacos were my favorite. Everything seemed so fresh from the chips to the salsa. I loved the flavors of all the sauces. My kids loved the chicken taquitos. 

One time, I ordered the kimchi fried rice w/ an egg & I had leftovers for days. It's freak'n huge! The service is excellent. They made sure our fresh chips fresh guac & fresh salsa was filled.

 I appreciated the fact that they sell the cold glass bottled soda beverages that use pure cane sugar instead of the corn syrup crap out there. 

It's also nice that they have different kinds of food options. American, Mexican, Asian or Fusion. It's great because my oldest son isn't too fond of the Asian flavors but he likes Mexican & American & my youngest loves the Asian flavors. So w/ their menu being so versatile, really helped make the our decisions easier for the whole family. 

The whole meal was an amazing value for us. Great food, great service & unbeatable prices. What more can u ask for? I can't wait to go back & get some more of those delicious chicken tacos. In fact, I can't wait until they have a location closer to my side of town in the southwest.
