Tried this place for the first time tonight.  I love that they are open late, serve coke products,  have a fun atmosphere and decor and the service was great.  

Our server suggested the nachos as an appetizer... which was absolutely terrific.  For dinner,  we took his suggestion and ordered the taco sampler plate, which had rice ans beans with carne asada, carnitas and Chicken.  I have to say my favorite was the carnitas,  I will for sure order that or the carne adada next time.  

I also ordered the corn, omg this was delish.... something really worth ordering.  

We will for sure be visiting this place again,  a new favorite.
