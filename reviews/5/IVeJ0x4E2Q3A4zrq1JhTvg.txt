After finding out about this place on a Vegas podcast I listen to (Shout out to the Five Hundy By Midnight Podcast!) I make it a point to come here at least once on my trip.

These are hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten. So good!

My standard order is usually 3 tacos and a Horchata to wash it all down

I highly recommend the pork belly tacos (I usually order at least 2)

They have seating both indoors and out (under a tent) and as you can imagine, seats indoors (AC!) in the Summer fill up quick.

Tacos are $2 each and a bargain if you ask me.

Can't wait to go back and get my Tacos El Gordo fix!
