Beats out any of it's competition. The tortillas are made fresh- which makes a huge difference in the flavor. I've never had a bad experience at any of their locations. SO glad we decided to give it a try. Definitely have become a regular. 
P.S.- that creamy cilantro dressing is so good- my husband and I have to get extra sides of it... which anything we order... try it :)
