Love this place.  Tried it once and we keep going back.  We now consider it our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Champaign.  Chips and salsa always fresh and delicious, wonderful margharitas, and the most delicious fresh food.  The service has always been friendly and fun, too.  Did I mention the chips and salsa are incredible???
