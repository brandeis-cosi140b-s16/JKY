Was in Scottsdale Healthcare and wanted take out lunch. Ordered 2 tacos, one shredded beef, one chicken. The tacos were fantastic. They are the crispy kind but authentic not the cheap crispy kind. If you have ever been to El Toreador in Redmond Washington it was very similar. I would definitely repeat business here.
