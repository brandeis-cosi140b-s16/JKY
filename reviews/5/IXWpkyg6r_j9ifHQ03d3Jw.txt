I have been waiting ever so patiently for Gadzooks to open. I felt like that chic in the Mervyn's commercial standing at the window, saying "open, open, open." I drove by today and saw a parking lot FULL of cars. I quickly pulled over and ran to the door to snag a place in line. 

It was totally worth the wait. They make the tortillas with fresh masa while you are in line, so it is totally fresh. The meat is incredible and the sauce is so flippin' delicious. I topped everything with pickled onions and a fried egg, my favorites. 

I am a little apprehensive about this place opening though, because it is within walking distance to my house. I can feel my wallet crying already. I am going to be here often to try their other combos.
