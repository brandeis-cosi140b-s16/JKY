Just took a casual day trip up to Fountain Hills and stumbled on Hometown Dogs.
WOW!  I am a Matlock when it comes to hot dogs and my girlfriend is just so so on hot dogs.  Well even she loved her Philly dog.  I had the Chicago, which I can never pass up, even though they had a Detroit dog and that's where I'm from!  Love those Chicago Dogs.  I also only eat Vienna Hot Dogs.  Well the brand they use is fabulous.  I was very pleased.  Also got a sample of the award winning salsa - excellent.  The Hot Dogs are over sized and the trimmings are just perfect.  Definitely recommend this place.
