Five or six choices, from beef to chicken to vegetables.And they are all juicy and delicious! 
Add toppings like tomatoes and onions as MANY as you want! And there are also several sauces you can choose from, or just mix them into your unique favor.
The quality/ price ratio is extremely high and definitely worth visiting!
The only shortage might be that there are no seats that you can only take away or sit on the stairs.
