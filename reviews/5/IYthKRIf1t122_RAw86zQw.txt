WARNING!! THIS PLACE IS DANGEROUS!! 

Look, I love Mexican food and yes I understand that RIo Cafe is the same concept as Chipotle and Qdoba, but according to my eyes and my taste buds, this place is waaaaaay better. And according to my wallet and my checking account waaaay more expensive too, almost double =S (hey nothing is perfect). 

First of all the tortillas are AMAZING!, they are made right there in front of your eyes, all the ingredients and fresh, and they give you so much food! I confess that I am piggy, I eat A LOT, but when I go to Rio, I never finish a meal. My favorites are the salmon salad, the nachos (hey I'm a girl still growing up haha), and the tacos. I like the barbacoa, it's just that sweet kick in that pork that I love so much! 

I have to make a confession: Yes, I agree, it is DELICIOSO to eat here, but a little too expensive for my budget, HOWEVER... I keep going back.... why?? Because they have the BEST Horchata I've ever had in my life and believe me, I have tried many horchatas in my life.... just sayin'. So go ahead!! Give it a try!!! Even if you don't want the food, go ahead and try that amazing Horchata, DELICIOSO!!  RIQUISIMO!! YUM! =)  

Ps.- If you are on a diet, don't even drive near it! Even though everything is fresh, there are a lot of calories on those yummy tacos/enchiladas...even the salads. Read the nutritional facts menu before you order if you are being healthy conscious about what you eat. (see? I care people, I care...)
