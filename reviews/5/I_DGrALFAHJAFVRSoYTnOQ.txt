I'm very excited to discover that Los Dos Molinos has arrived in Ahwatukee! If you've been to their other locations, you know they're known for excellent (and spicy!) New Mexican fare. From experience though, you can find less spicy items on the menu, if that's your preference. But I recommend to try the hot stuff!

They have 4 locations in the Valley, but this is definitely a family business. The new location is open (in the Safeway Plaza on the SE corner of Chandler & 40th St.), and seems to be doing a brisk business. Since they don't yet have decent signage, and haven't been doing much advertising, it must be mostly word of mouth bringing people in.

Tonight I went to check the place out - but the wait was too long, so I will return soon for a proper visit. I'll update my review as soon as I can! It's interesting to note that Los Dos Molinos is located very near to Secreto's New Mexican restaurant. It'll be interesting to see what sort of competition ensues!

The hours are:
   Monday dinner only 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.
   Tuesday - Saturday 11 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. and 5 p.m. - 9 p.m.
   Sunday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Enjoy!
