My family and I just recently moved into the area and have been coming here since. The server staff is always kind and gives us as much time as we need and is friendly. I have no bad things about the servers to say. The decorations around the restaurant are very home like with vibrant colors. The taste of the food is great and I recommend the flan for desert! Can't wait to go back!
