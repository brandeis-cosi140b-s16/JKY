I was excited when this store finally opened up on Sahara. Being a 3rd shift worker, you don't find a lot of places opened up after 7pm other than fast food joints. 

I ordered the Carnitas burrito bowl, which is pretty much a burrito with no tortilla. awesomeness's like a mega salad. :) I like the concept at Chipotle's...hmmm a Mexican subways? ha ha. The food there is as fresh as it gets and they also offer fresh chips and salsa (with the extra charge) along with what you order. 

Surprisingly they also sell beer there, so who says who can only get a drink with your burrito at a dining restaurant? Thumbs up on the liquor license.
