I'm here way too often, more than I'd like to admit.

My boyfriend and I love the food. We love the staff.

It's not always easy taking our picky a** orders. And, they always get them right with a smile.

Not too long ago we were by the location on Ray Rd.
We decided not to go just because we love this location far too much to "cheat".

We're always at comfort here and leave with a satisfied tummy.
