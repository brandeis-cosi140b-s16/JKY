Chipotle is one of my standby choices when I want a meal that I know is going to be consistently good. Today I just went in with a friend for chips and salsa and we decided to be adventurous and try the margaritas since I had heard they were actually really good. Well, I was right! They make a mean margarita here, and along with some chips and hot salsa it was a nice little snack break.
