It was my first time at this restaurant and the staff were very welcoming. The tables and seats were very clean which is rare in some other places. The food is great!! I love their grilled corn I would definitely recommend them. I had the shrimp, chicken, and carne asada tacos each one was better than the other. The shrimp and crab ceviche was also excellent. Overall, great experience and I will be back again soon.
