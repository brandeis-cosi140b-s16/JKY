Saltys does it again! Even though it was a little slow in there still had fun with the staff! Diego was very helpful with tequila and since they were so slow the staff was hanging around the bar and got to hae some good times with them. Staff here is always upbeat and friendy. Always love coming to this place no matter if they are dead or busy! Great "cheers" feel
