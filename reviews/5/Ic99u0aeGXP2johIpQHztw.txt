The bartenders Justin and Elizabeth are amazing! They treat me like family every time I go there. Excellent place to chill out and watch the games inside or outside. Great food. The Barbocoa over a bed of rice is amazing. They stay true to their Ensenada roots with the decor. Best local hangout spot
