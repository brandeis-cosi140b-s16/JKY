This is the real deal!!!

When you go in, you will be hard pressed to find a Gringo eating here. 

Just read my fellow reviewers reviews, and you'll see that the variety and quality are unsurpassed.

Always Latino families, and if you don't speak Spanish or have any idea what to order, your fellow Latino diners will gladly give you suggestions and help you order. 

My only suggestion; Have one of your companions grab a table, while you put in the order. 

This place beats any other place in town for authenticity. 

Don't miss out!!!
