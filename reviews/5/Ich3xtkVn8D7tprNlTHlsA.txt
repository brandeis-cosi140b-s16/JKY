Had Phat Franks for the first time just a few hours ago. Very impressed with the food and Frank. 

He and his helper (didn't catch her name) are very cordial and really make an effort to offer exceptional service. 

Ordered one carnitas and two chicken tacos. They were phenomenal! I love tacos and try to sample as many as possible. Frank does a great job. The meat is flavorful, moist and plentiful, the corn tortillas fresh and the toppings are near salad like proportions (cabbage, cilantro and onion). I opted for the spicy salsa (there is a mild, green and spicy) which had a nice kick to it. There is no salsa bar, your choice is added to the order. 

The price, as I recall, is about $2.89 per taco. A little on the higher side, but they are worth it as the overall size and meat portion trumps the other tacos I've come across.

The place is also very clean and the food is made to order and prepared quickly.       

Phat Frank's is simply PHantastic!
