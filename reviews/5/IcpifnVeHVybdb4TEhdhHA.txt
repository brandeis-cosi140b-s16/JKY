Welp, I've found my favorite local place.

From the decor to the food, everything about Most Wanted is top-notch. I met a friend here for lunch on a Sunday. There was a steady amount of people coming in and out, but the service certainly didn't suffer. Since it was our first time in, we were offered samples of all of the different meats...which made it incredibly hard to choose, as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. But there's no guessing as to which you will like...you'll know! The people who came in after us had been in before, but asked to sample a few anyhow, and they seemed happy to oblige. I ended up getting 3 large tacos: Creamed (chicken), Cochinita Pibil (pork), and Barbacoa (beef). All of the meats were incredibly flavorful. We shared a basket of chips and guac which was tasty too. There's also a salsa bar with 3 different heat levels available, plus all the limes and jalapenos you could want. My advice? Skip the fountain drinks and peruse the cooler of bottled varieties by the door...you can't go wrong with the legendary Mexican Coke.

Finally: the decor. I was in love from the moment I walked in. I love bright (some would say tacky, but whatever) walls and glitter. Add in some badass Lucha Libre portraits and masked heroes flying from the walls and you have Most Wanted's vibe. Basically, it's a delicious heaven for me.
