Chipotle is my number one top fast food place to eat. I'm always in the mood for chipotle due to how good and fresh their food is. There's nothing on the market that's as fresh as chipotle for the price you get. Chipotle has come to be one of the most powerful and fast-growing fast food chains in America. My friends and I have all agreed to chipotle is number one on our list as top fast food chain in America.  Not just that but the most healthiest that I would say out of my Opinion. I try to eat healthy at times so I'm not gaining weight. And by me keeping up on my way I normally make the decision of going to chipotle rather than McDonald's or other burger fast food places. If you're looking for a place where you can get a good meal/healthy/fresh food then this is the place to go
