Truly a hidden gem!! Everything we've had here is fantastic! This is also one of the only New Mexican places you can go where the green chili is about flavor and not just melt-your-face-heat. The garden enchiladas are amazing and very different from any other I've tried, the burger with a chili relleno...so darn good!! No matter what you choose, you won't be disappointed!
