We had nothing bad here!  From the start of the queso fondido with poblanos to the burritos, tacos, quesadillas to the lonches and even the margaritas!  Our party of 6 enjoyed each bite and sip. Fresh fresh and tasty tasty!!  Would recommend. Although not the fanciest meal we had this weekend it was my favorite!
