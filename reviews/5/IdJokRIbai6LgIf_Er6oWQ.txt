do you know how hard it is to find decent REAL street tacos? the kind you can get in Tijuana or mexico city?? this place does it for me. the street tacos are packed with meat and onions and cilantro. the burritos are huge and will make a mess of your shirt..but you won't care because you can't stop eating it. i'm the NORM of frijoles. i live in the NW..but you better believe id make this drive for some good tacos, elote, burritos and the aqua fresca drinks.
