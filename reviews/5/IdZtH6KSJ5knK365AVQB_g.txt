This restaurant is amazing! 
Service - everyone is so friendly and welcoming!
Food - tasty and comes in large portions. Nachos appetizers are great, in-house guacamole is the best i have ever tasted, several types to try.
Drinks - Delicious margaritas, lots of flavors to choose from, but the classic is awesome. 
Atmosphere - light music, beautiful art on the walls. A very casual and authentic place.
