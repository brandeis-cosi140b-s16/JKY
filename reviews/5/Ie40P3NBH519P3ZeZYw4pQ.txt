LOVE this place! And, best of all, it's in my own town of F.Hills!

Tried the recommended Pollo Fundido and was not let down. They used a very generous amount of chicken and was nicely made. Chicken was stringy and moist - perfectly done!

Had 2 House (frozen) margaritas - sooo delicious! NOTE: I had a HORRIBLE hangover on Sunday from 2, yes 2, margs. Not to be snotty (well, I am a liquor snob, I guess), but they use Sauza tequila in their mix. No bueno. I had such a horrid headache that felt like I had 8 drinks.

In the warmer months, enjoy patio seating in the back w/their relaxing fountain! Love that they have so much greenery around their patio.
