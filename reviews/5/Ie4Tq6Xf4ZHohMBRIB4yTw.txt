Amazing little Mexican Food place. I am constantly on the quest to find an amazing Chimichanga, and I finally found it here. The food was amazing, the price was great, and the people were very friendly. It is definitely a take out place, but it is worth the wait of having to bring it home. Absolutely outstanding.
