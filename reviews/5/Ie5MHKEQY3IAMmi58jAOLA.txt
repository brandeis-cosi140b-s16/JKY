I really don't want to rate this spot because I want to keep it all to myself, but then again the only reason I found it tucked in a Convenience store is because others took the time. I knew when I walked in it was a special place. Ben greeted me & immediately apologized for the wait. Then a personal introduction & a hand shake at a taco shop at a gas station? That's service. They had several large orders in front of me but I didn't mind the wait as I got to see great fun & fellowship with every customer that came in. My anticipation was building as I smelled the al pastor tacos all the way home. And they did not disappoint nor did the Burrito. This place is a gem & I'll be back. Maybe tomorrow!!!!
