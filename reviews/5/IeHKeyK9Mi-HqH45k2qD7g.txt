Me and my family go here all the time.  It is authentic Mexican Seafood for sure.  I've had several different items and all are great.  Sometimes the service is a little slow (depends on which waitress you get and how busy they are) but the food makes up for it.  
Don't worry about not speaking english, go enjoy and you won't regret it.
Yes the music is loud and it's always super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.  If your not from this part of Mesa yes you would think the neighborhood bad but we have never had a problem.
Again the food makes up for it all!
