If you do not like Chipotle, you have some issues. Cheap, fresh and ethical! lol 

It is amazing, what else can I say. They can have an off day here and there, but that only shows that it is made fresh and not from a package. Even on a bad day, it is still good. I love you Chipotle!!! om nom nom nom
