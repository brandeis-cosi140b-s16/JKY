In short, amazing!

In long, this place has an awesome selection and mix of food.  I love that the location is somewhat tucked away.  Although I wish this restaurant all the success in the world, I love the low-key feel of the place.  The staff is super nice and accommodating.

They offer samples so if someone has never been here, they'll be able to sample their many selections before diving into something that they might not particularly enjoy.

I appreciate the option to eat with chopsticks.  They also have some spice that I have no idea what it is but it's widely available by the soda fountain and is quite tasty.

Saving the best thing about this restaurant for last, they GIVE Snicker Doodle cookies with your meal!!!
