The only disappointment was that I haven't been here before.  My wife and I are from Tucson and feel we were spoiled with many options of good, authentic, Mexican food there.  We've been here for two years and found a couple decent places, but none that compared or worthy of calling "our place".  We've now found it!  We stopped in for brunch on a Saturday and were the first here.  We were greeted courteously and seated while waiting a few minutes while they finished making the fresh chips.   We judge every restaurant with their chile relleno, and this one was up to par!  My wife smiled with every bite, and my chilaquiles were probably the best I've had.  They had the right amount of red chile but still had a nice crunch due to the fresh tortilla chips.  Can't wait to come back for dinner soon.
