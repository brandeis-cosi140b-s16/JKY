Omg this place is phenomenal! The service was impressive and the food was delicious. My sister raved about this place and my mom and I were running errands nearby so  we decided to try it out - I'm so happy we did! We both ordered a shrimp taco and then got some chips and guacamole as well. The tacos and guac were amazing! I was still hungry as I hadn't eaten much that day so I went back up to the window and ordered a bean & cheese burrito (tip: ask for queso fresco in your burrito!!!). It was so yummy! It is a drive thru but they also have patio seating and a restroom right on the side of the building. It's a cute little place and truly wonderful food. We will be back very soon!
