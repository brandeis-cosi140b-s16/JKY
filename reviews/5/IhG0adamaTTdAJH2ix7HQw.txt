I'm glad I didn't pass up the opportunity to eat here after finding out where it was located- to which I thought was inside a strip club only to be right beside it inside a different room. Whew.

Despite the location, the food here is fantastic. I'll be honest, Mexican restaurants aren't really at the top of my list when it comes to dining out but this place might alter that thought a bit. Everything was FRESH. And just as the billboards around town states, everything is organic and GMO free. You can definitely taste the difference in freshness dining here vs other Mexican restaurants.

I had the Shrimp Quesadilla meal since I was craving it and my God it was divine. The shrimp was fresh and the side of guacamole and sour cream was to die for. I literally died and gone to heaven about five times during this meal. No exaggeration. I've also tried my friend's Carne Asada bowl (BOMB) and a side of rice and refried beans; which is honestly my favorite part when eating Mexican and even that was a different tier in taste and freshness.

The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Flan since it was too sweet and thick to my preference but that can't stop me from giving this place five stars. I'll definitely be coming back to try the other things off the menu along with their cocktail selections. I hope you do too.
