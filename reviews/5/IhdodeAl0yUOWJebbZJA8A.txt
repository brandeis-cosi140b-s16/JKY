I really enjoy coming to Azteca!!  Mexican is my favorite food and this place is awesome!!  Great food and great service!  And the prices are reasonable.  I have also been to the one on Woodlawn and it's just as nice!  The servers are always upbeat and friendly.  I would really recommend you come and try :) I will definitly be coming back!  I have many times!
