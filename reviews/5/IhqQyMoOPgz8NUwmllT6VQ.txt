Who knew that I would have to travel to De Forest WI in order to have the best fajitas I have ever tasted? I was traveling through for work and saw this place had good reviews and was close to my hotel. Soooo glad I came, the fajitas were on point with the best caramelized onions and peppers I have ever had! Will for sure come back next time I'm in town!!
