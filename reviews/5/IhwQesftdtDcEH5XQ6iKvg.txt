My receipt said Mazatlan, but the signs say El Patio Authentic Mexican Food.  Yet another fabulous Vegas meal off the strip.  I couldn't believe people were waiting in line across the parking lot at Chipotle when they could be eating here.  The decor tries hard.  The service is top notch.  The chips are thin and tasty and the salsa is mild and yummy.  I got the veggie burrito with a verde sauce instead of the ranchero sauce it normally comes with.  It was deliciously flavorful and filling.  With a sparking water and tax, my meal came to $7.54.  Fantastic!  The only negative was the noise, which first consisted of one TV, then consisted of another TV showing something different at a louder volume, then finally was drowned out by the terrible song the blasted from the jukebox.
