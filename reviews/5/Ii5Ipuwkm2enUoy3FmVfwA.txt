Really loved this place, my mom told me about it and I'm glad I checked it out :) Nothing like homemade pupusas but this satisfied my craving, I really liked how they were not that greasy compared to other restaurants. I liked the empanadas de platano, although they were on the greasy side, they were pretty good. Also it did not take that long to get my food, I went on a friday evening and there was not that much people.
