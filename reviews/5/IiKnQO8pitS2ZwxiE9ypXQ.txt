The best Mexican food our family has ever eaten including Mexico.  The owners are great, the place is immaculate and there is nothing that is not  SENSATIONAL!  We eat at the restaurant and do many drive-thrus and serve clients and friends.  They all love it.  Our sons discovered it when they were here for our youngests bachelor party.  They are still raving and coming back next week so they can religiously eat there!  Just finished our carnitas, there is no place in AZ that has better carnitas.  Every time is an amazing experience.  People like Jack F in Fountain Hills should restrain from writing negatives when its based on 5 years ago.  Not fair to such a great place.  HELLO....different owners, no negatives, an amazing place.  Sad to see people do that unfounded!  If you like Mexican this is your place!  LOVE IT!!!!!
