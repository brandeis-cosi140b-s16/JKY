Tacos & Tequila! I don't think there is a better combination of food and drink anywhere, especially if you're from California! T&T has perfected this. 

The wait staff is really friendly and professional, service is very quick and efficient, the drinks are STRONG and tasty, and Saturday mornings they have some very entertaining mariachi music going on! Those guys were very talented musically and comedically! they came over to our table and asked what our favorite type of music was, and they provided some popular songs, mariachi band style. Kudos to T&T for that fun entertainment! 

The food is perfect here. One of the biggest highlights is how much meat they give you on your tacos. You can see in my photos below that they DEFINITELY don't skimp on the meat at this place. I've never had more delicious and filling shrimp tacos, and they were worth every penny! They have a great selection of dishes, all reasonably priced. The complimentary chips and salsa were also delicious. 

They had margarita happy hour going on when we went Saturday morning during brunch hours. The house margarita was 2 for 1. ($12). It was STRONG and sweet and one was enough to get the job done for a lightweight like myself, haha. 

Two thumbs up for T&T inside the Luxor!
