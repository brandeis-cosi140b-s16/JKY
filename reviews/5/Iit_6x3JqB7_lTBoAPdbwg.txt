Great food!
Friendly service!
Attractive restaurant!

Anaya's Fresh Mexican food is how they bill themselves. Fresh for sure!  I loved my dish. It was arroz con pollo (chicken with rice). An attractive plate that included lightly sauteed zucchini, mushrooms and peppers in a spicy sauce. A generous dish so I had leftovers--a lot of food for the price. Lunch buddy enjoyed the same dish except with prawns (shrimp).

Anaya's has an extensive menu, the usual Mexican fare but lots of different dishes and many that included seafood. They open early and even have a drive thru where you can get takeouts, like breakfast burritos or lunch or dinner. How convenient!

The Mexican furnishings and decor are authentic and outstanding--a cheerful atmosphere. Our server had a great attitude, friendly and helpful. 

Anaya's is a new family-owned restaurant in Glendale. I hope it does well because it has a lot to offer. Looking forward to another visit and trying some other dishes.
