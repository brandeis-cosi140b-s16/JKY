Great find in N. Scottsdale. Chips are cooked in-house. Very good. Had the Hatch Chili pork enchiladas. Just enough heat to get your attention. Probably best enchiladas I've eaten.  My daughter got the seafood enchiladas which were a little different than what you typically find, and were very good also. Service was very good especially since it was a very busy Friday night. Planning to go back before I leave.
