Thank you Yelp for once again steering us to a fabulous out-of-the way spot we would have never found without you! 
Chips and Salsa are brought to the table (thank you). We also ordered some guacamole. Fantastic. The sangria was above average but the margaritas were out of this world! Our server Jose (helpful, courteous, attentive and all around A+ server) recommended the Shrimp Tamale and it was amazing! I had garden enchiladas which were also great but second to the shrimp dish. Also had the Mexican risotto as a side: sublime. The Mexican corn side dish was good but didn't really mesh flavor-wise with my dish so I think I would have enjoyed it more with a different entree. Too full for dessert! Then, the cherry on top: we got a discount for our Yelp check-in! Whoo Hoo!
To sum up: superb food, exceptional service, delicious drinks, delightful ambiance. Worth the trip off the strip.
