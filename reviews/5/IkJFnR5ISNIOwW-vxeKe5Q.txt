I have a very serious Taco Town addiction. This has become a mandatory stop at least once a week for my work friend Ashley L. and I. This place takes tacos to a whole new level!

Part of the appeal is that the service is extremely quick, and the lady who takes the orders (I swear she never gets a day off!) is pleasant and doesn't miss a beat. It's a good option for workday lunches. Sometimes we take it to go, other times we will eat in the restaurant. It isn't anything fancy, just some tables and chairs, but it gets the job done. The focus should be on the food anyway, right?

My favorites so far are the chorizo and the carnitas. The chorizo is spicy, but not too much so that it overpowers the other flavors. The carnitas is tender and packed with flavor. Everything is always served piping hot, the onions and tomatoes are fresh, and rice and beans (if you like them) are a great addition to make the tacos a little more filling. They give you an amazing sauce on the side, and are even thoughtful enough to include lime wedges even when you're ordering for take-out.

I say in complete honesty that I could probably eat here every day and not get sick of it. I should mention that the menu goes way beyond tacos, and some day I might try some of the other items... maybe. Definitely worth a stop if you work downtown or are in the area for lunch!
