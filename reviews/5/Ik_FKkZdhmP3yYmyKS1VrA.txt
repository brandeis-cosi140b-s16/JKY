Oh love... It's a good bond between a girl and a restaurant. I wish I could eat here all the time! The chips they give you are so yummy! They have an avocado creamy salsa makes me so happy. I love the chimichangas and there is a burrito similar to a chimichanga with chicken and a white cheesy sauce! During Christmas they make tamales... can you say heaven? :)
