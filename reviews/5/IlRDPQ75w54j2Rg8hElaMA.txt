I have been here before in CA and in NY and this was actually the best experience I had so far. Hands down the beauty of this place for me is their corn salsa.

They make their own chips and taco shells, they fry in soy oil so it is mildy healthy.

What I love about this place is it is cheap, healthy and conscience of quality food for the bang for your buck.
