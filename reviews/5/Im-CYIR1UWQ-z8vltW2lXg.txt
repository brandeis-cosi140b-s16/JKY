We waited a bit for an outside table since it was nice out. Nice view of the open kitchen right out in the street. 

My girlfriend and I each ordered a frozen margarita but the machine was broken. We got some non-frozen variations instead. A grapefruit and sage margarita, which had the right amount of savoriness and bitterness to counter the usual citrus sweetness. My girlfriend's sake margarita was a beautiful fuchsia color and tasted great. 

We split some "build your own guacamole" with radish and pepitas. Nice crunch and we loved the tiny sliced chilies dotting the bowl. 

We also split some tacos which come 2 per order. The duck confit tacos, topped with hoisin, chiles, pickled cucumber/cauliflower, mint and cilantro. Each ingredient contributed to a crazy savory/sweet, hot/cool, cooked/raw combination of flavors and textures. The carnitas tacos were our favorite. Tender, juicy braised pork shoulder with crispy bits, avocado, salsa verde, onions, and a crispy strip of chicharron on top. These were packed with juicy flavor. Super rich meat, cut with the acid from the salsa verde. A must order!! The tortillas were nice and chewy, we saw them making them in the kitchen (to order?).

We split some chocolate mouse cake for dessert after deciding we didn't have room for more tacos (but had room for dessert). It was super rich, and not too sweet, thumbs up.

I kind of wish the tacos came 3 per order (smaller sized tacos) or were smaller but a few dollars cheaper, allowing for more easy sharing. I would have loved to try a few more tacos but between the two of us we only had room for 2 tacos each.
