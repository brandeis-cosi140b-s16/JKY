So over a week later, we came back. Night and day...... Literally. We went for dinner tonight and everything was absolutely amazing. Everything! It is my husband's birthday and of course he choose Elvira's. The staff was friendly. Not the same staff that was there for Halloween lunch. Our server was so friendly, I wish I had her name so you all could ask for her. (Shoulder length dark hair, glasses, had a huge smile and a perky fun personality. Our busser was so attentive as well, friendly and right on top of everything. He was a young kid. We were so impressed by the way he worked my husband approached him when we left and tipped him out. Very impressed, I hope we continue getting service like we did tonight because we plan on coming back!
