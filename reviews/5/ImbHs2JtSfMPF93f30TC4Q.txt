I would drive past this place the in the 33 years that I've lived in Phoenix (basically, my whole life) and never stopped by until I started dating my girlfriend (now wife of 7 years) 10 years ago.  The first encounter I had with the salsa was, "hmmm, this is different.", until I discovered the awesome fresh chunky salsa a couple weeks later (you have to asked them for it!).  We go to Jordan's at least once every week/every other week.  The food is very good, but we come here for the friendliness and family feel of the owner, Joe Jordan, his son, Joey and the list of supporting casts of Robert, Tony, Roni, Erica, etc.  Great to bring your family.  Read the other reviews...many have been going to Jordan's for years/decades for one reason or another.  Whatever that reason is, it is definitely a staple in Mexcian restaurants in Phoenix.  Joey is constantly making improvements to the place and it is showing good potential.
