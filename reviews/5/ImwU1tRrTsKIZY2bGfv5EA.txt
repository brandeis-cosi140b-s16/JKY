Oh, I 've worked a half a mile from this free standing building for over 10 years.  Several different restaurants have lived and died here, but I had not been inside this building until today.  Previously the closest American Mexican restaurants were over on Woodlawn, so this is nice to have so close.

Mar Y Tierra is clean, open, and a little more organized than the other nearby Mexican joints.  A sanitation grade of 98 is displayed behind the counter.  The service is quick and efficient.  The food is cheap, the portions are decent size, and it tastes good.  The menu is nowhere near as extensive as an Azteca, but there's still plenty to choose from.  For $5, I got a shredded chicken burrito (not huge but a good lunch size) and some beans and rice.  The chips and salsa were good, but salsa was very spicy.  

Due to economics and close proximity to the office of this place, I'll be going back often.  They were busy too, so hopefully they will stick around a while.
