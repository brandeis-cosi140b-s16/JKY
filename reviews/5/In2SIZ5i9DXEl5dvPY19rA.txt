I went to the outside little "truck" vendor and it was off the chart fabulous. They brought me in with the smell coming off the griddle and the corn tortillas were great, the lamb special was amazing and I got it loaded. I also bought the small container of guacamole which was totally on point for me.  I loved it. They had a small salsa bar and i didn't need it. I just loved this simple, nice and reasonable meal. Was so perfect for a beautiful day walking in the strip district.
