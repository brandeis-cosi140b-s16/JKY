Best salsa ( ask for the chunky) ever!  Everything we ordered was excellent.  I got chicken chimichanga, and my husband got some combo plate.  Also got a cheese crisp.  No complaints about anything.  Service was fast and friendly.  Mexican food is my absolute favorite and I have eaten almost everywhere.  This may be my new fav!
