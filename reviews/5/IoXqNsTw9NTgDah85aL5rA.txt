Well I have to say that both me and my girlfriend had our reservations about this place, but I have to say it was really quite authentic and delicious. I have a pretty good tolerance to heat and spice, so that being said the shrimp tacos were hot like fire. But the cooked just right to not make them rubbery. Then the fish, really light and flakey and spiced just right to get the smokey flavor that any Mexican fish taco needs. And the steak taco I had was really flavorful and awesome! Lastly the speed and the friendliness of the wait staff, the food came out right on time and the drinks were prompt. Our server Emily was so friendly and she immediately made us feel like part of this newly created family that wanted to take us on this food journey. (Yeah corny but it was pretty authentic Mexican food).
