Yeah I know we are in Las Vegas and I choose a California restaurant, what can I tell you it looked so good from the street we decided to check it out.  I am sooooo glad we did it was really worth it.

First the ambiance is great, we even sat outside in 95 degree weather because it was that nice.  The inside turned out to be amazing, with these supremely high ceilings and modern decor.  The staff AWESOME...

We ordered Queso Fundido (cheese dip) with chorizo and the Beef Flautas as starters.  There was so much food in front of us I knew we had over ordered again.  The Fundido was fabulous, ooey, gooey and tasty.  It is served with fresh tortillas in a warmer, excellent.  The Beef Flautas were not my fav, the beef was dry from being cooked and then fried, but the green sauce it's served with was amazing, oh so tasty.  For lunch we ordered the Chicken Fajitas and the Chicken Limon.  Each entree has a choice of soup or salad, we chose one of each.  The salad was very light and the house dressing was very refreshing.  The soup was a black bean soup with creme and oaxaca cheese, this was slightly spicy, very tasty and worth coming in for a repeat visit.  Hubby did not feel his fajitas were spiced properly, he said they were lacking in flavor.  My Chicken Limon was a little dry, but it was excellent in flavor.  The mashed potatoes it was served on were definitely worth coming back for too.

All in all we have found a new place we will be spending our money at as often as we can.  OH YEAH, how can I forget the margaritas were the BOMB, really perfectly made.

Our server did tell us that since this place is so new the menu has changed a few times already and quite possibly could change again, so please keep that in mind when you go.
