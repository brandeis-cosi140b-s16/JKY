No matter what time of day. No matter what time at night. Robertos never lets you down...this location especially!! There is a very nice lady that works there, and she is always going out of her way to make my experience the best every time. I've taken numerous friends and family to this Robertos, and they've all loved it. The patio outside is always clean and pleasant to eat on. Whenever I decide to get rich, there will definitely be that nice lady running the Roberts I put in my house!
