This place is amazing!!!  This place is the very definition of a 'hole in the wall' and it totally delivers on every level.  I have had the Chile Colorado, Steak Picado, and sampled the Chicken Mole.....all have been fantastic.  And if you like real homemade corn tortillas...this is the place to go.  If you go while they have Happy Hour, don't be afraid to order the Margarita.  It's not  the usual pint sized glass you get at most Happy Hours....this is a legitimate fullsize 'Rita!  I can't wait to go back again to try something new!
