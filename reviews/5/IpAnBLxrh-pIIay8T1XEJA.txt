I was so pissed off last night when i ordered a torta from fillibertos.  It was disgusting...all the carnitas was burnt to hell...etc...

i was so mad- that tonight I set out to find a delicious torta. I found Kissi...WOW.

That was the best torta I have ever had. I had the pierna...the bread was very fresh, the meat was soft and perfect...ordered everything on it and added pico de gayo. I am pretty consistent and when i find something i like i stick with it. This is now my torta place.

Oh and they were very nice...i have never seen a menu like that, they explained all the different stuff...never heard of "pastor" or "pierna", etc...

Awesome.
