So I went to Mr. Leno today because I've been craving tacos, good tacos.  Craving has been feed.  First let me state that the service was friendly and fast.  I got the rolled beef tacos due to someone else review pic and a chicken taco.  Needless to say I bite off more then I could chew literally.  The chicken taco alone was huge.  It was filled with nicely seasoned chicken, a mound of cheese and fresh lettuce.  I can't believe it only cost $2 for this monster taco; make sure you tip well when you order this because you're getting a steal.  
The salsa was delish as well as the rolled taco with guacamole.  I stated taco was good instead of tacos because I could only eat one after the chicken taco.
I will absolutely go back.
