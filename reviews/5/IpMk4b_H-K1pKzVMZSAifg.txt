Ate for the first time at Ha!banero today and enjoyed the fresh ingredients offered. The window to the kitchen showed the workers busily preparing more meats, veggies and such. 

My wife ordered the burrito bowl for $6.50. It had rice, beans, shredded beef, veggies, salsas and all the usual sides like guacamole. 

I ordered the tostada bowl with rice, beans, carne rojo (pork with spicy red chilies), cheese, habanero salsa and sour cream.  I got the special which included chips, salsa and a drink for $7.50. 

Everything was very fresh, well thought out and delicious. The price for the burrito bowl seemed a touch high but all-in-all: a very good lunch. 

Give Ha!banero a try. I think you'll like it as much or better than Chipotle.
