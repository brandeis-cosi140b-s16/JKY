This is a local Russian watering hole. House mixed hookah flavors were fantastic and the atmosphere is upbeat yet relaxed. I wish I could speak Russian to join the karaoke night! Authentic borscht made in house was delicious, I felt as though I was in Russia again:) I would recommend this to everyone! Although I rated $$ the alcohol and hookah ($13.95)are more than reasonably priced.
