This place has THE BEST carne asada in Phoenix.  I've tied many many other places, even places that say that theirs is the best. But Filibertos never says theirs is the best because the best doesn't have to say it. They have proof. They've hot the carne asada. And they don't fill their burros with rice and beans to fluff their food.  It's all goods. You've gotta pay extra for that stuff.
