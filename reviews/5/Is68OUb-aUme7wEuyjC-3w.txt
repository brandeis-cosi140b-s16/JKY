Little yellow house with a graveled drive but looks are definitely deceiving here. The inside is spotless and very modern with a full bar and friendly staff. Started out with their signature strawberry/habanero margarita.  Unique, and served in a tall glass with lots of lime, ice and a pink Himalayan salt rim. Basically, we tried almost everything on the menu-well there were 4 of us-and each dish was better than the last. The corn tortillas are hand made and each dishes attention to detail makes the dining experience one of a kind. Loved the ravioli and the roasted corn was delicious    Save room for dessert the Chocotorta with a homemade toasted marshmallow on top and French press coffee with very thick cream.
