I fell in love with Mexican tacos all over again.  

Happy Hour 4:30-6:30 = half price tacos.  Awesome, nay, amazing Tacos. 
I lived in Mexico for 6 months.  I've had my fair share(OK, fine, more than my fair share) of Mexican street cart tacos.  I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.

RCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they're served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They're serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they're blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I'd pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not "authentic" but it's still damned good.  I've given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*

On a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It's a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn't quite the same, but it still brought back memories.  

Oh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)

*(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it's not on a spit, it doesn't have a pineapple at the top, and there isn't a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)
