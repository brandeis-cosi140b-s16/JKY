ARE THEY OPEN AGAIN YET?

I swear it's been forever since I've seen they closed for the summer. Anyways, hope they are so we can resume going. My husband's family has been going to this place for his entire 30 years of existence so it would be blasphemous to give this place less than 5 stars for the sense of tradition it holds in their family. 

There's not anything I could quite say about their food or decor to set it apart from other Mexican restaurants...but it's just El Charro! You either love it with all your heart or...you're indifferent to the place! lol 

One thing's for sure, you always get your food FAST. They have their system down pat in the back, and I've seen the same servers there for the three years I've been coming to this place. Ryan's seen the same servers since he was a little kid! So they must treat their servers well.

El Charro's will always be a family favorite. It's an oldie but a goodie!
