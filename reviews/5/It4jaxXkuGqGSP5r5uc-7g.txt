I work down the street from this place. Coworkers rave about it. Now I know why. Go get the carnitas! Its so good! I don't know whats on it but the spices are great. The chips and salsa is perfect. Not too salty, thick chips. The salsa isn't overly spicy and I could do shots of that stuff, its so good!
