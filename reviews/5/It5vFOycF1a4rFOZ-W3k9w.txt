Such great mexican food that I can't even knock it down for the creepy ambiance- located so close to a strip joint that you can't be sure you didn't go IN the strip joint, when you enter the place... red velvet walls, and the bar located central to the room , with booth tables around the periphery...we were skeptical ... but the great reviews kept us from running away.. and the food was worth it! the table side guacamole was the best I've ever had!!! I wanted to try the ghost pepper salsa but because they charge YA $13.50 for it- couldn't justify it, as I'd be lucky to dip one chip in it... too hot to have a bowl of it!! My cheese enchiladas were great- my husband's chicken and beef fajitas looked to be as good as he said they were... we love mexican food and are regularly disappointed... NOT HERE! really, really great food!!
