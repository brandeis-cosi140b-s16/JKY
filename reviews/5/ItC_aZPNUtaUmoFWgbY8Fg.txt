I never noticed anything that creeps, crawls, flies or slithers let alone anything that i would consider unsanitary while ordering or eating from this location. My favorite is the 5 tacos of carnitas,asada ,lengua adobada,or pastor and a drink  for under 5 bucks. No joke.there isn't anywhere that serves food this good for this price.
