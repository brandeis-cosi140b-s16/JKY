The burritos. So good! Had one at about 2pm on a Saturday and didn't need to eat again all day! The frozen margarita/sangrias are also awesome and delicious. The decor is super cool -- they are totally working the whole "day of the dead" theme, and it's great. Service was perfect: friendly, attentive, and informative. Great experience!
