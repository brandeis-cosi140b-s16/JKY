My husband found Las Cazuelas while doing a search for best restaurants in Las Vegas.  There are a lot of small Mexican restaurants and this is by far the best we have found so far. The food was great (fresh, flavorful, and authentic)  and the prices very reasonable. 

We will be back and bring friends and family!!
