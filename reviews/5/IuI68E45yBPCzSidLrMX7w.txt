Mexico City is the best lunch joint in downtown Pittsburgh, hands down. There are two locations, one on Wood St. and one on Smithfield. The original is on, Smithfield, but the new one on Wood St. is larger, and in my opinion, nicer. Also, the restaurant on Smithfield just obtained their liquor license and put in a nice bar. I haven't stopped in for happy hour yet, but I definitely plan to in the summer.

I've tried many things on the menu, and I've been thoroughly pleased every time. However, my favorite is the Mexico City Burrito. No matter what you get, you will always leave full, so come hungry (and be prepared for the post-lunch nap). During Lent, they usually have a fish taco special that is awesome. It come with two fish tacos and tortilla soup.

I've been to many Mexican restaurants all over the country, and I have to say, this is my favorite, and in my opinion, the most authentic. While the atmosphere isn't that of a 5-star establishment, the food is definitely 5+ stars. If your in downtown Pittsburgh, do yourself a favor and check this place out.
