I have been searching for good Mexican food since I moved here December 2011. I had a place I loved in AZ and even found a place in Alaska of all places but for some reason Vegas was lacking in my kind of Mexican food! Being pregnant, when you crave something, you go somewhat crazy till you get it, so in desperation I came on yelp to find something with some good reviews and found El Panzon! My hubby and I left immediately to try it and I got the green chicken enchiladas and I was SO pleased! Now I can have my Mexican fix when I crave it, which happens a lot! Thanks to all the previous reviewers who saved me from going crazy from cravings!
