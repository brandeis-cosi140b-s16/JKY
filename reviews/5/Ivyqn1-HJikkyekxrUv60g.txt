Found this place by happenstance while trying to find Albertsons. We came in on a Monday and discovered their half off tapas special. We admittedly went a little crazy and boy were we glad we did! The tapas was amazing. We ordered the grilled asparagus, tempura artichoke hearts, sea scallops, calimari, ribs, and ox tail. All of these dishes were incredible. 

Unfortunately, they were out of the escargot. Guess that leaves something for next time! :) We finished dinner off the Spanish coffee and the lava cake. 

We will definitely be back and with friends/family too!
