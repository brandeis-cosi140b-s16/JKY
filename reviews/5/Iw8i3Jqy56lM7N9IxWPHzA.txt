FOUR stars ....should be 5 and this is why ! Talk about a trendy menu everything never fails to delight all my senses.The Grilled Romain is a work of art .....the food continues to be consistent and excellent ...fantastico!!!good job star chefs! NOW we should move to the bar .Kogel is the doctor of drink pouring..really he is .Never a dissapointment on his watch .I can honestly say his drinks are Officially Infatuation Approved .Dining at Taco Guild, a really cool neighborhood restaurant has a communal and familar vibe ...giving it charm.Justin always meets customer expectations .Watching him work the room greeting customers and cleaning tables it seems he generally enjoys what he does best ....and that is be the best GM he can be! I'll BE BACK
