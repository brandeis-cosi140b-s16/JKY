My husband and have been driving from Scottsdale to eat here for many years. The restaurant very clean and service is superior. The waiter also knows what we are going to eat and brings us hot fresh chips and salsa right away! Love the ceviche! Yes, the neighborhood is dicey and the parking lot is tight but the food is oh so worth it!
