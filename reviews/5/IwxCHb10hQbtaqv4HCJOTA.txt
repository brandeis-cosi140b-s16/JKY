Wow! Food is amazing quality here. I was just passing through from Phoenix to Tucson and made the quick trip down Florence Ave to check this place out; I'm so glad I did. In my neck of the woods this meal would easily be twice the price. The Spanish rice was delicious -- normally I leave the rice mostly untouched by it was so good here I gobbled it up. You wouldn't know from the outside of this building that the food would be such high quality. It looks cool inside too.
