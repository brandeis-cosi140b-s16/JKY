I love this place! We always come for Lunch and it's always packed, I enjoy the fish burrtio, but I'm not the biggest fan of fish, but I like it here bc it has pineapples and other things so I don't get the fish taste.. I also like  the self serve salsas. The service is always fast and I love to sit outside on a nice hot day to enjoy my phat burrito!!
