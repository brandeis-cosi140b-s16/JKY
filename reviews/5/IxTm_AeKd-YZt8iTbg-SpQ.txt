Whaa WHAAAAAT!? Are you kidding!? This is real authentic Mexican food! I know because I lived in Mexico 5 years and my Mexican boyfriend is here with me, born and raised in DF (Mexico City) and he loved his food! Felt like he was home. The Golden Margaritas were insane! So good ! And the service outstanding !!! We had a Bruno Mars look-a-like waiter named Oscar...equally as good of a waiter as he is charming! (My my) to top it off, it was fresh delicious food, beautiful atmosphere and awesome people-watching on the street down by The Linq!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! Im a Vegas local and I will be back!
