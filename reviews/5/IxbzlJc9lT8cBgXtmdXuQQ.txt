(Have been back now three times since the original review.  This place is awesome.  I've had drinks, coffee, appetizers and a bunch of different entrees with my wife.  Everything is good.)

I went in to this place to hear a couple of my music buddies play near the beginning of 2010.  I knew nothing of the food or the place.  Because I was by myself, I got a table immediately which was not normal on a Saturday.  (There was a line out of the door at 8:30pm.)

I got to the third item on the menu as described below:

"C H I L E S  en  N O G A D A
Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions,garlic, pecans, apples, pears and apricots finished with a delicate almond sacue and pomegranates $21"

I didn't read any further.  This is what I ate.  It was one of the most interesting and tasty entrees I have ever had in Phoenix.  I was thinking about it all week,  I tried to describe it to my wife but I couldn't.

The people who claim that the parking and neighborhood are less than ideal are not lying, but it's not that bad.   Honestly, I would risk having my car stolen to eat this food.  Heck, I might risk stealing your car to have this food.  Look, if you want safe, I'm sure you have a Chili's near your house that will gladly allow you to share your money with them.

I want to give the place 5 stars, but I think all I had was this one entree and probably water.   I remember liking the olive and bread that came before the meal, but my recollection is blurred by the Chiles en Nogada.  I really need to go back to verify if this will be a long term thing or a one-time fling.
