I judge a Mexican restaurant by their enchiladas and fried ice cream. Excellent on both here. Viva gave generous portions of chips and salsa. After we ordered our dinners, Viva gave us bowls of soup. We weren't expecting that. But the soups were delicious. Our dinners came with good size main dish, but also huge portions of rice and beans. For dessert, we ordered our favorite, fried ice cream. Delicious! Oh, can't forget the margaritas. Yummy! And for $6.99 for a huge 22 oz...double yummy!
