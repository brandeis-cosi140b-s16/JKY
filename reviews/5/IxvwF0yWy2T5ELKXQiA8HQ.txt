Ok, we have been trying to find a good raspado (Mexican snow cone) place for a while. AZ was starting to disappoint me. I have had raspados in Mexico but like i said have struggled to find a place similar to the ones in Mexico. The raspados I had here have been watery and full of ice which is your typical american snow cone. The best we had found was in Tempe, which is way way too far for us. We yelped raspados in the west valley and thought we would give Raspados Neza a try. We walked in and saw a menu with limited items, only raspados, which was ok cause that's what we were wanting. The owner was a sweet talkative man who was proud of his product. I was scared this would be just another watery raspados with nothing but ice and hardly any lechera (sweetened condensed milk). So we ordered, I selected the pecan raspado, my husband the arroz con leche (rice and milk, has an horchata taste but thicker) and my daughters the coconut and the strawberry raspado. We had them all with lechera. I had my first sip of my raspado and OMG I was soo happy! My pecan raspado was sooooo delicious. It was creamy, tasty, and had the perfect amount of ice. Some places add ice cream to the raspados, which I love, but these did not need them at all. I tasted all my family's raspados and all were so good. Also one thing to keep in mind is that these raspados are naturally flavored and have no preservatives. So they are not too bad for you. The raspados are $3 for a small and $4 for a large. So this is it guys we have conquered in finding the best raspado in west Phoenix. Thank you Rasados Neza we will be back very soon.
