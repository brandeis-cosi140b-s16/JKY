If you love Mexican food, you will LOVE this place and come back.

We had some carne asada tacos and al-pastor tacos, also a Tlayula con carne.  One word to describe the food: EXCELLENT.  Tacos Atoyac experience was great.  We killed it.  From the corner of my eye I noticed some people coming in the door that couldn't stop staring the rest of the peeps enjoying their food.  (Hasta unas se√±oras se saboreaban antes de que ordenaran jejejejee).  I washed it down with an ice cold Sidral Mundet.  (I hadn't had a sidral mundet for about 4 yrs already).

Whole in the wall.  Tall white guy at register and his staff were all very courteous.  

Definitely considering coming back.
