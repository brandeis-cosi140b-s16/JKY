This place is located in the Fry's parking lot on 51st and Olive. Don't let that fool you. We came in and it is clean and the staff welcoming. It was our first time so we took a minute to look at the menu. We ordered the open face carne asada supreme and 2 of the frybread tacos one with shredded beef and one with carne asada.  By the time we paid the food was on the counter for pickup and the dinning began. The food was excellent. The frybread did not get soggy and stayed crisp throughout. The salsa came in a squirt bottle which was perfect for squirting onto there crispy chips. The food was so much my daughter couldn't finish but that's ok since my husband was enjoying the food enough to finish hers off. I must say I was impressed and happy that yelp had not steered us wrong. We will be back.
