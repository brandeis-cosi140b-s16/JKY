Been going to Cafe Zamora's for years, grew up in the neighborhood and everyone knows this is the place to get that closest to your mama's homemade Mexican cooking!  I've read other reviews and you do not go to Cafe Zamora's for the chicken dishes, you go to Cafe Zamora's for the beef dishes--enchiladas--shredded beef chimichangas--and my ultra favorite--the RED CHILI BEEF BURRITO ENICHILALAS STYLE!  Love this place and will continue to love it.
