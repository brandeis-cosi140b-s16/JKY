I decided to try the Happy Hour on Friday afternoon. The staff was immediately friendly, attentive without being invasive and genuinely appeared to be enjoying their jobs and eachother. The atmosphere is relaxed but elegant and upper class. They have a daily happy hour 3-6 with an appetizer menu of items all for 4 dollars, discounts on some signature drinks, 6 dollar wines and 5 dollar mixed drinks, plus a deal on beer too. I ordered the machaca spring rolls and omg, they were divine! the sauce accompanying them was out of this world yummy and the garnish was lovely and tasty. I'm looking forward to going back and not breaking the bank at the same time.
