This is as close as you can get to Authentic Mexican Sonora food. The owner is from Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico (my father is also from there) and this place definitely compares to the taco stands in Hermosillo. 

It is clean and nice inside. They have an awesome condiment bar. There's variety of salsa's and pico de Gallo. They also have grilled jalape√±os (upon request on some orders and others it comes with it). The carne asada is delicious and the best. Although, the barbacoa is not far behind. The rice and beans are very good. The flour tortillas are better than the corn tortillas. 

The staff is very nice and helpful. The service is fast and reasonably priced. During lunch hours they have daily specials for only $5.95 (includes a beverage, rice & beans) and changes daily. It's definitely worth going!!!
