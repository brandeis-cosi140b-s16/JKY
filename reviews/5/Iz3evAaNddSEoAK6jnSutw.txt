I've heard great things about Javier's in Laguna Beach and was glad they open one in the Aira in Las Vegas.
It wasn't cheap , but most good things aren't .
Great shrimp Cerviche.
There house specialty crab and shrimp enchilada are amazing.
The carnitas are trended served  on the bone,
Good margarita's
They have some great salsa, the habanero was very hot ( duh) with great flavor.
Service was  good
I hope Javier's opens one close to my house.
