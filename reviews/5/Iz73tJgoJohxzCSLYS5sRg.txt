Looking for authentic latin food? Get yourself to Sabor Queretano. The location is odd; close to East Towne's Red Lobster in what looks like a neglected strip mall. (Check out the hispanic store next store, too.)

Having eaten there 3 times, I still crave their food  Each time I've tried different meals. They were all incredibly delicious. 

Large open space, with a kitchen in plain sight. Massive piles of plantains (platanos). Clean place. Service isn't too slow, but it's not fast. Bring the kids. TV with muscia latina is usually on, but not at deafening levels.

As other reviewers have mentioned the prices are higher than many places, but so are their portions. Each time I've gone home with leftovers. I am a huge fan of Sabor Queretano.
