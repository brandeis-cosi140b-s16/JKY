I've been going here since 2005 and it hasn't changed a bit! The staff is friendly, but seem kind of shy. The food is always great and for the price, can't beat that. So much better than Filberto's. And it's super clean. Thanks for such a great little Mexican joint! The only request I have is you should add Al Pastor to your menu :)
