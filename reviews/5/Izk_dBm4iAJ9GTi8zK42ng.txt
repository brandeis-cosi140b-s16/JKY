I'm from New Mexico and this place hits home for me. I'm a big fan of their breakfast if you can catch them on a Saturday mid morning.  They have really good chips and salsa which is homemade.  Sounds odd but Gil makes a really good green chili burger. I've tried mostly everything on their menu and recommend anything with their red chili smothered all over it. Scrumptious!  They have a cute patio and you can BYOB. If you like spicy..This is your place!
