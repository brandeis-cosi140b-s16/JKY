This small restaurant has the best service and food in the area! The Tostada taco salad is delicious with grilled chicken or shredded beef. The Carnitas combination plate is also an excellent choice. You can drive-thru or stop inside to get your order. I normally go inside since you can choose from a variety of salsas at their salsa bar.
I plan on trying out many of the other combination plates and burritos since everything on the menu looks great!
