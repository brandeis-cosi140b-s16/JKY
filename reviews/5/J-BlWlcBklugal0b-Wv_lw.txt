Yay Chipotle!  This one was close to my work and after one day of patiently waiting in line and being cut by some very rude people, someone behind the counter gave me the best tip ever! You can order online, give them a pick up time and they'll will have it ready... It was awesome.. Our lunch was always ready and we were in and out and had most of our lunch hour to enjoy it.
