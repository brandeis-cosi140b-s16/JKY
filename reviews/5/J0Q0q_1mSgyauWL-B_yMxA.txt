Hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant near Summerlin, or maybe even in Vegas.  I am usually pretty picky with my Mexican places since many places in Vegas seem to have either no flavor or are too greasy.  The service was absolutely fantastic, from the hostess to our server Omar, everyone was very courteous and helpful but not naggy or anything annoying.  It was great.  We were immediately seated and brought chips and salsa and our drink order were taken. We went with the pork and shrimp fajitas, and wow sooooo good. They light them up when it's wheeled out to you, super cool! The veggies, meat, and shrimp had so much flavor.  The tortillas were very fresh and warm.  All the sides: guac, cour cream, pico, beans, and rice were fresh and super tasty! I would definitely recommend this to any Mexican food lover or anyone who needs to be converted.  Definitely my new favorite place!
