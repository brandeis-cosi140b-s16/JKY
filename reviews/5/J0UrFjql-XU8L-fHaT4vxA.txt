This place never disappoints. We branched out, but stayed with the mini-ceviche tostadas (can't miss those) for apps. Can't remember what the GF had (some torta - which is unlike her) and I had the pork belly street tacos. In addition to the Valentina's sauce on the table, there was some other one made with chiltepin peppers. EXCELLENT and actually non-gringoized. 

I'll admit, I didn't finish the 3rd pork belly taco. It just wasn't crisp enough for me (the meat not the shell), but it was tender. The texture just wasn't suiting me at that moment in time. I think the contrast of the crispness and citrusy flavors of the ceviche was just too much for me to take in on that day. Sometimes you like black and white, other times, you want muted pastels, ya know what I mean? I'm pretty sure it wasn't their fault - so my song remains the same 5 stars. 

This place rocks. Staff is fantastic, food is good, and I was intro'ed to a new bottled hot sauce...which I don't remember the name of but theres a pic of it on GF's phone. I'll add it later.

P.s. As many ppl have noted, the tortas are a bit on the large side. They offer mini versions of most (if not all). That's the way to go if you order apps or just aren't into eating a pound of meat..
