We were in the neighborhood and took a chance & I now love this place to go for authentic Mexican food!  It's a great little family business. They have beef tongue tacos and homemade horchata that I haven't found in other Mexican restaurants!! The chorizo tacos were wonderful, too. The guacamole is fresh made to order. The server was friendly, helpful, and fast. Mixed drinks, wine, and beer are available. We met the owner Maria and her son Eric who were super nice. We will return to try more items on the menu...including the desserts.
