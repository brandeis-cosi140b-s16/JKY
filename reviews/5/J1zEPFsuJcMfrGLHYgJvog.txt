I don't know how a lot of the people on here could claim that Pedros is mediocre or less than. I guess to each their own. I have gone to Pedros 2 times so far. The first time I went I will admit I was a little hasty about eating there based soley on how the place looks. It isn't your everyday run of the mill chain mexican food restaurant. But once my food arrived it melted away the appearance of the restaurant. I had ordered the shredded beef chimichanga with the San Marcos on top with a side of rice. Let me tell you, it is AMAZING!!!! I have eaten a lot of mexican food and they by far have some of the best food in the valley. There was a guy who commented on how the salsa is "sweet" and "sweet salsa is no good in his book" Ok, the salsa is sweet, but not bad. The hot sauce is awesome, mix the 2 you can't go wrong. And what's really funny is how my boyfirend and I can never even finish a basket of their delicious chips because our food is always so quickly prepared that we didn't have the time to finish them (regretfully). The ladies who work there might not be starbucks friendly, but they do make sure you have everything you need and that you are taken care of. If you are looking for great food at a great price then Pedro's is your place to go. I don't know if I could eat mexican food anywhere else!
