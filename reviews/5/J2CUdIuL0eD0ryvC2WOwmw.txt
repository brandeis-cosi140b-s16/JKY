One of my favorite fast food restaurants around las vegas, regardless of it being a fast food. Its fresh and healthier then eating a Mickey D fry or burger. I usually just order the 2 piece meal. This restaurant beats KFC, Church Chicken and Popeye in my books. 

Service is prompt it being a take out and with there friendly smile. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to eat chicken or craving for chicken.
