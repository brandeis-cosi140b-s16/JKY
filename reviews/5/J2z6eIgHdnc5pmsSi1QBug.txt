I find some of these reviews quite funny, this is a very intimate authentic Mexican food restaurant. I've never had an issue with the staff. 

You have to be understanding when it comes to small businesses like this. When they have such amazing food and only the family is running it. It will take a little for them to help you. 

The food is made right where you can see it. Fresh as can be. Unlike macyos or Tia rosas. You have real authentic Mexican food. 

If you're expecting to get in and out quickly on a Sunday... You're mistaken. They're menudo is the best in AZ (which has been said by maaaaaaany). Sunday morning is when they make it, so don't expect to get quick seating and you're food right out. 

If you're impatient and can't appreciate real authentic Mexican food then go elsewhere. Because us locals don't mind enjoying some chips and salsa and waiting a little longer than normal for some good food.
