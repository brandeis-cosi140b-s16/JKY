This place is amazing! Not only is the food wonderful and the people friendly, THEY CATER FOR PARTIES! The price is very reasonable and they hook you up with a ton of food. We ordered food for our housewarming party for 30 people, we had enough for guests to have second helpings and take a plate to go! They also included toppings such and cilantro and onions and salsas! Did I mention Churros!!!? Yes we had those at our party as well.... A whole delicious cinnamon/sugar box of Churros!!!!
