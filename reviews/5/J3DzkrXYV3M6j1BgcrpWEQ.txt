Visiting Phoenix for the first time and we tried this place for lunch - from the outside we weren't so sure about heading in but boy are we glad we did!! 

The decor inside is very cool - when we sat down they brought out fresh tortilla chips and we went up to their salsa bar and tried our way through at least 6 salsas leaving many more we didn't even get to try!  My hubby got 4 different tacos to try and couldn't pick a fave he liked them all so much!  I got the veggie quesa, a twist on quesadilla made with a crispy corn shell - it was delicious yet huge I couldn't even get through half!  

I'd highly recommend checking this place out!
