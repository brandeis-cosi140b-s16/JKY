When we came here the place had just opened and was bare. However, Rachael was super friendly and very welcoming. She is the benchmark of what other server should be. The other wait staff were super attentive as well.

Rachel recommended that I try the apple cider lemonade for a drink and it did not disappoint. It was like drinking an apple pie. That's just fabulous. The chips and salsa were very good and Rachael offered us the habanero salsa if we wanted a really spicy salsa, which I did asked for. It wasn't that spicy, but it was good none-the-less. 

As an appetizer, my girlfriend and I got cerviche. It was just light and satisfying.
I had ordered the torta which was essentially a burger and it was tasty. My girlfriend order 3 tacos with different meat and each of them was packed with flavor.

I would definitely come back here for Mexican food if I was in Vegas.
