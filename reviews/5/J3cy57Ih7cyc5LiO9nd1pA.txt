I love me some Filiberto's, and this brand new location to the Laveen area is outstanding. I normally stop by on my way home from work late at night and the food is always hot and fresh. The workers at the drive thru are always friendly and knowledgeable. I appreciate that. 

I'm very excited to see this brand new building pop up in the parking lot of the old Mervyn's plaza. Many residents of Laveen wondered if that plaza would ever rebound after the recession...so glad it has!
