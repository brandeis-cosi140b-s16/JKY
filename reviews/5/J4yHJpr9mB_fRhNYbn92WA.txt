Food was surprisingly good and its in a great location at Village Square which has lots of great restaurants and shops!!!  Sunday brunch, had chorizo nachos, Mexican pancakes and breakfast sausage slider.  Everything was great!  Will be back to have same items and try other stuff since they have a large menu.
