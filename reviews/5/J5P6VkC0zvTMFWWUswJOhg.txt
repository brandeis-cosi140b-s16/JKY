Although Qdoba is just one of the many "Mexican Subways," it is in a class of its own. The freshness of the ingredients and the explosive flavors set it far apart from the rest. This particular location is clean and has professional employees.

Having tried just about everything on the menu, I have a few recommendations. Invariably, if you stand in a line at Qdoba, every customer in front of you will order a chicken burrito. Don't do that. Although the burritos are excellent, I would probably rank them last on my favorites list at Qdoba. Instead, try something different.

For meat, I highly recommend the barbecoa (shredded barbecued beef). It sits around simmering in its own juices and spices all day, which cause it to have explosive flavor in every bite.

For dishes, the little known secret and best item on the menu is the tortilla soup. If you're more hungry than soup, get the Mexican gumbo, which has all of the contents of a burrito topped off with the tortilla soup. It doesn't get any better than that. My backup favorite is the quesadilla. They are always crispy and good for dipping in Qdoba's several tasty flavors of salsa ("hot" is the best, but they are all great).

The portions can be quite large at Qdoba and it can be hard to decide on which meal to have on a particular visit. Therefore, a nice option is the craft two menu. This allows you to pick two Qdoba dishes, each at a smaller portion than when ordered alone. Hence, you can try two smaller dishes and not get totally stuffed when you eat everything.

Make sure to pick up a Qdoba rewards card at the register. They are free, work at all locations, come with a free chips and salsa at activation, and earn you one free meal for every 10 that you purchase.
