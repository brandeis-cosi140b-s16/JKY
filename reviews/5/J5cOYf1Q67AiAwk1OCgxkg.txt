Have driven by this place a few times and decided to stop in today. A nice little cafe with indoor and patio seating. Ordered the shredded chicken enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious!! All the staff are very nice and accommodating. The prices are a little high but the portions are a decent size. Left pleasantly full and will definitely be back in the near future.
