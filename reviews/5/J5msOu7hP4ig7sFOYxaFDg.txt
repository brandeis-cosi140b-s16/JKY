I've got two words for you:
BRISKET TACOS!! Oh sweet Jesus, they were just delicious! And the beans!!! JUST bomb.com!

Our first bartender was SO NICE!!! We got there right after they opened I think, so it was pretty slow so we had the bartender's full attention, I never had an empty glass in front of me, he kept our drinks flowing! Hung out for hours just chilling at the bar and they had no problem at all. Even after our first bartender was done with his shift he stayed around hanging with his coworkers and still refilled my sodas when he was just hanging out! INCREDIBLE!!! I would try this place again!
