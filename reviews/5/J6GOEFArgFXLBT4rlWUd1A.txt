I love this place. I come here with the co-workers at least once a week. From the outside it looks like a normal taco shop, the food however is anything but. The caldo de res is just stupid good and the albondigas is litterally the best I've ever had. It looks like the cook ran to a farmers market to buy the vegetables fresh each morning just for the soup. The other food is quite good and always made to order. Not your typical cheese covered run of the mill usual offerings. The salsa bar here is worth a visit alone. For what its worth there is usually 4 of us that go to lunch and not one talks nor offers another a taste of eachothers food. I f they expanded to my neighborhood in the SW I would probably have to start paying rent there.
