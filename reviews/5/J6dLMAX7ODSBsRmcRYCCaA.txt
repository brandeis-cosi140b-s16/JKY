Mixteca is my favorite fast food Mexican joint.  I usually go here for breakfast and the inside is really nice and it doesn't have an odor like most Filberto's or Rolbertos or Berthabertos, ha ha.  Anyway, I usually get the chorizo plate or chiquilitas plate or breakfast burrito.  The food is always so tasty and the chorizo is never runny, the beans are creamy  and the flour tortillas are pretty good too but not homemade.  The food always comes out in a ceramic dinner plate, not some paper plate and the chips and salsa are to die for.  The hot sauce has a hint of garlic and cilantro (my mouth is watering just describing it).  They have really cool melon and watermelon drinks that my kids love.  My wife always gets a egg, cheese, & pico burrito.  I have not been here yet for dinner but I am sure it is just as good as the breakfast, you can tell the owners put there heart in this place because it really shows.
