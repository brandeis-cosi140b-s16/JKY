Omg! Their food is soooooo good! Who knew authentic VEGAN mexican food could be so good! I had the Vegan Tomale and tried the corn and ploblano pepper taco... my boyfriend had the Vegan Nachos and the Vegan Tamale as well. Let me just say that if you get the tamale be prepared for a lot of really good food. We ordered a variety of things off their vegan menu because we had never been there and wanted to try it all. The vegetables were cooked perfectly and tasted incredible! We left there feeling so unbelievably full cause we couldn't stop eating! It was that good.  We will definitely be going back!
