Here is a great Mexican food joint that is not expensive, very affordable and the food is Fantastic. The atmosphere is very nice and cozy, TV's in the corners, music in the background. The Ladies waiting adn that work there are very sweet and nice and attend to everything.

The menudo here is the best i have tried along sides my moms, lol. Have not tasted menudo this good since i moved here from Cali. Many places in phoenix, either add too much oregano or make their menudo soup to thick. But ths place is awsome!!!

The wifey tried the shredded beef tacos and rice and beans, And wanted more. 

Have gone back often to eat their menudo and try differnt items, and were to my satisfaction. 

Great Food, Great Service, Great Job!!!!
