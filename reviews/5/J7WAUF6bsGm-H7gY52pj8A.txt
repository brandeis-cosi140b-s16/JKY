The food at Rita's is fantastic, the prices are very reasonable, the interior is handsomely designed, and the people who work there are always friendly.  My overall impression is that there is a deep commitment to excellence from the kitchen to the table. The shrimp wrapped in bacon is awesome! I drive in to Phoenix from out of town, have been there more than once, have brought guests, and look forward to the next time I visit.
