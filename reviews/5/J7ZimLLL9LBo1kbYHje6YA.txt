I'll make it short and sweet! The staff and food at chayo's were simply amazing! We decided to have our wedding dinner with them, they were so attentive, professional and accommodating. Aside from their great service their food was simply delicious! My entire family raved about what an amazing choice we had made in selecting the restaurant. If you are looking for amazing food, great environment and great staff check them out! You will not be disappointed!
