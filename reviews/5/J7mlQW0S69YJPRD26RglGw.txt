I feel weird writing such an awesome review for a fast-food joint but I love this location. I frequently order online or via the iPhone app. Today, I arrived 5-min early to pick up my order and they gave me a free large beverage while I waited. In the past, I arrived about 10-min late because I got stuck at work and they insisted on scrapping my order and making me a new one so that it would be fresh. AWESOME! Businesses don't do cool things like that when it is their fault, much less when it's the customer's fault. I'm hooked on Chipotle. If this location wants to round my bill up to the next nickel or whatever that controversy was - go right ahead!
