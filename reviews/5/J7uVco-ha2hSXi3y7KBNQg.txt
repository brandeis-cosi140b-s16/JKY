This place get super pack. And I can understand why. They have delicious tacos and the restaurant is clean. 

A bit pricey for a street taco sized taco, but it was worth it. Delicious tacos. Prices range from $2.15 - $2.45. 

They have all kinds of red meat... Asada, pastor, the spicy pork ones, beef head, lengua, and even sesos! Wow! They have more meat, but I don't remember their names at the moment. 

They do not have chicken. Keep that in mind. 

Their ordering process is a bit unusual though. There's three different lines to order from. Depending on the type of meat you want, you go to that particular line that is serving that meat. Ex: you want asada, line #1. Pastor, line #2, Sesos, line #3, etc. Then you go to the cashier on the other side of the restaurant with your food tray to pay. I'm just use to paying for
 my food when I order it or when I get my food, in the same spot.

Oh, and clean establishment. There are always staff walking around cleaning up the tables and wiping down the tables for the next party to sit down.
