Hubby and I took a friend here last Wednesday before heading out to a concert.  The first thing I noticed was how cool the interior looked - loved the clean lines and modern edge.  We took a seat at the back bar and ordered drinks.

Of course with our luck, happy hour was just winding down and the guys ordered beers.  I ordered a top shelf margarita that was absolute perfection when it arrived.  I left the boys in charge of ordering appetizers because, as long as its good, I'll eat just about anything.  The chips and salsa came and they were truly delicious.  Chips were hot with just the right amount of salt on them.  I was glad they put a whole basket in front of just me because I ate every single chip in it.  

We ordered a bunch of appetizers:  meat skewers and chicken skewers, chicken, pork and mahi street taco's, guacamole and the pork ribs.  I can tell you that each and every item we tried was just excellent.  That's tough to do especially with our crowd!  

I loved this place so much I told the manager that they needed to build one out by us in Desert Ridge.  I loved this place but Tempe is just too far a haul to go have food and margaritas.  There is no competition here for them - Sandbar food is not great, the other 2 places here are good but not awesome.  Please open one somewhere near desert ridge!!  

Until then, I will be missing those chips, salsa and awesome food!
