Fell in love with this place! Loved everything about it. The ONLY thing that I wasn't too happy about is that they do not sell any other alcoholic beverage other than beer. I hate beer but that's besides the point. Everyone else there though seemed to enjoy their Micheladas (the ones you drink to cure a hangover). It is the perfect place to go for sunday brunch... I had heard about this place and made it a point to visit the next time I was in Vegas. There are other locations in Vegas from the same chain of restaurants but THIS ONE is the one you have to try. If you're into Mexican food & music... you'll like this place. Haha we liked it so much we got there at 1 pm and didn't leave 'till 8 PM!! yup... 7 hrs! My friends & I love listening to Banda, Mariachi and Conjunto music... this place has all 3. Agarramos el conjunto por un buen rato! Buena parranda que nos metimos. While my friends all got tipsy (the like beer) I had to be the sober one, BUT I had an amazing time. The food was great too. The decor of the place is pretty cool. Cannot wait to go back. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!
