Best Robertos I've ever been to in Las Vegas. Very clean, cool retro look, nice staff who actually speaks and understands English very fluently. Other Robertos I've been too in Vegas was dirty, building looked rundown and old, and the people who worked their could barely even speak English. I am not being racist or want to be perceived as being a racist but I am just stating facts.

Anyways, the food is always great and on point at this location. I visit this Robertos about 3-4 times a week to grab breakfast or dinner. The bacon, eggs, and potatoes breakfast burritos are amazing and very filling. And they're all under $5 for 1/2 lb chunk burrito. 

For dinner you can't go wrong with the Carne Asda fries or anchors or the rolled toquitos. Your choice of beef or chicken. Condiments such as cucumbers, limes, and sauces are always fresh and the area is always clean unlike other Robertos in this town.

Some of the specials they have to offer is wet bean and cheese burrito Mondays for $3.99, Chicken burrito Tuesdays for $3.99 (Mon. & Tues. offers come with a drink and a side of beans and rice), and 99 cent taco Wednesdays.

I don't have any complaints.
