Love Chipotle!  Fresh, healthy, inexpensive!  I'm a Mexican food lover.  As much as I like to be served, Chipotle offers a great casual sit down environment but just without the server.  They gave you the gigantic amount of food which gives you the value you won't find it anywhere else.  My son loves to come here to hang out with his friends.  He can afford to pay from his allowance money and have a great time with his buddy.  My favorite order is burrito bowl with steak with EVERYTHING they have.  I love the rice, black beans, grilled veggie, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, lettuce.  Yes, that's everything.  I also like the chicken.  If I try to be healthier, I'll order chicken without the sour cream and guacamole for less cholesterol.  Otherwise, steak is the one for me.  

Their employees are very friendly and efficient.  Usually there's a line, but I can always get my food in 10 minutes.  Great service and good food!
