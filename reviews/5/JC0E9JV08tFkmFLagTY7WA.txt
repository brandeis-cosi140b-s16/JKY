Authentic Mexican food and great drink menu. Excellent spot to watch football. I cannot recommend this places enough to people looking for fresh, authentic, Mexican food. It seriously is amazing. My suggestion would be to sit at the bar in the sports/new bar area. The bartenders are very friendly, especially Alex. He makes a mean michelada 'rocky point' style! Great food, huge tvs, and great drink/beer selection. 

Personal recommendations to order: chips and guacamole, all the dif salsas, nachos, and cheese enchilada (red and green are both amazing)

Very pleased to have found baja joes. After moving back to the phx area from Tucson, az, I was starting to fear I wouldn't find an authentic Mexican restaurant. In my opinion, it's the best Mexican restaurant in the valley.
