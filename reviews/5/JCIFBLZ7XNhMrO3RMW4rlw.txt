As the website says, "Food With Integrity".  To boot, it's delicious! The meat is from responsibly-raised and -fed animals, as is the dairy. When possible, their veggies are bought locally.  

They have a great assembly line set up, so if you go to a Chipotle only to be met with what seems like a huge line, get in it -- give them a chance to wow you. The line moves quickly, and your food is done by the time you arrive at the register. My fave meal here is the steak burrito with jasmine rice, no beans, corn, pico, sour cream, and guacamole.  Mmm! 

This Chipotle is on the southeast corner of Washington and First Streets.  It opened the first week of December 2011, and with a line through the restaurant, out the door, down the sidewalk, past the Jimmy John's and Five Guys. Oh yeah -- it's that good.
