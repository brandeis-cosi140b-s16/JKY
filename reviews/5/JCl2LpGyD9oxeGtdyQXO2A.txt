I was extremely surprised at the number of poor reviews put on this place! The concept of a Chinese/Mexican fusion should involve the unique and bold flavor that is typical of the two cultures. The flavors here were authentic, creative, and well put together and exactly what a fusion of these two cultures should be. I will definitely be returning here and encourage true food lovers to explore this wonderful place as well
