Boy, do I love this place!  My husband and I went on Saturday night with another couple and we were blown away.   All the tacos were great but the scallop, carne asada, baja and short rib were our favorites.  I am still thinking about the Mexican Street Corn the day after.  Amazing.  You would never know that this restaurant has not even been open for a week.  Can't wait to come back.
