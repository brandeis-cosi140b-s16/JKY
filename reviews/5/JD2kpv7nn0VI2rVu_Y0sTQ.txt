Brand new, this TB opened last week and still has the clean. I think they chose the location well because the place has been packed every time I have driven by. Still sparkly and un-vandalized on the inside and the staff hasn't learned how to ignore customers or to let the sauces get unstocked. We'll see how they do in a year.
