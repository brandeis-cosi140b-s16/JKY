I have been going this market for the last five years and have had the privilege to see it develop into a bigger and better stop to get lunch mostly but some other random but useful products. Besides lunch they have (like most gas stations) toiletry items, snacks, alcohol/beer, and other small items, but unlike most gas stations, they have rent-able movies (not red box), cleaning items, Mexican candy, and, not to mention, bongs and spices. 

Over time they have also added some decorations that they didn't have five years ago. Instead of an old Pepsi menu board on a hung up plank of wood, there are 3 nice and new looking flat-screen t.v.s mounted up showing the menu and occasionally transitioning to a picture of one of the meals. They have re-done the dining area to a yellow walled, corona sponsored, Rocky Point restaurant looking eating area with orange tables. The outside has replaced door and window shading to a nice maroon color as opposed to the old, ripped, greenish ones. 

But, what makes Diamond Dot a "diamond in the rough," (as stated by yelp user, Larry B.) is it's lotus flower worthy, addictive food. I personally prefer their Mexican menu, but everything else is still outstanding. Their burritos are absolutely delicious and what makes it legendary, is their salsa sauce that it comes with. It has the perfect balance of sweet freshness and a spicy zing to it. If you dip your burrito in the sauce like I do, sadness ceases to exist, the sun/moon smiles down you, and the air becomes weightless with the relaxing scent of wine and roses for the remaining duration of your burrito. Okay, that might be an exaggeration but the point has been made. Diamond Dot Market has to be fit into your scheduled or, if nothing else, at least your bucket list.
