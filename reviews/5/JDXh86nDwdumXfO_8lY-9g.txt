I have been going here pretty much since I moved to CLT. I've never had a bad experience. The service is always very fast, seated right away, chips and salsa and servers ready for you whenever you are. Food comes out very quickly and is always delicious. It's a favorite dinner spot with friends. We love to share the pitcher of margaritas on the rocks and the cheese dip. Both are delicious, love the margaritas!! I've tried a bunch of the dinner items and have not been disappointed, every one has been tasty. And I have leftovers for lunch! Also LOVE the free soft serve!

One of my favorite spots. Great menu, great service and delicious food.
