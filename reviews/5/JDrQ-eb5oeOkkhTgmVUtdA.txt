I come here from time to time.  It's a great standby for some good Mexican.  Ultra affordable and has more character than going to Taco Bell.  The carne asada and the adobado could be served on a shoe and it'd be delectable.  24 hour place, therefore great for an early morning breakfast burrito.  And it's right next to a pink box donuts (though not 24 hour like their parent store) so everybody's got a chance for a great local two-fer.
