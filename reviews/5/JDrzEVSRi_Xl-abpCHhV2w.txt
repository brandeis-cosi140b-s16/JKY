I love this place! I have been here several times and have found the food to be consistently delicious. I am from New Mexico, so I have really high standards for Mexican food and this place meets (maybe exceeds) my expectations. The fry bread is fresh and delicious. The red chili has good flavor and a little bit of a kick to it. The chicken tacos are excellent (freshly made shells). The chips and salsa are unique (but good). The location is a bit hard to find (it is in a shopping complex with a grocery store) and the service is mediocre, but gets the job done. I will continue to come here for excellent Mexican food when I am in the area!
