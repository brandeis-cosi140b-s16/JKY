This is a family favorite for so many reasons. The food is awesome. I always like the two taco, pork plate and my husband loves the pork burrito, smothered in green sauce. You cant' go wrong with this place! And, they've been promoting their locations with BOGO offers. It can get very crowded at times, but I have found the line to move quickly.
