excellent tacos, but adobada and head tacos called my attention !!!
decent price at $2 dollars most tacos. plenty of meat.

only disappointment is that you have to order separately your tacos (eg. asada, adobada, chorizo, etc,and make line separately for different meats, thus first tacos ordered will get cold before you get all your order together,,,,,,, otherwise i'll be perfect !!! 

worth coming back ... BEST TACOS IN VEGAS  !!!!
