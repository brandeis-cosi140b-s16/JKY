This is my favorite mexican food in the valley.  That's high praise, I know.  And some of you read that and will say "How dare he!  I prefer _____."  That's great.  Good for you.  But for my money and my time (most of those other places you'll mention are a 25 minute drive from Chandler/Ahwatukee) this is the place.  I was very happy when they reopened.  

The green chili and the red sauce are top notch but I've yet to have anything on the menu I was disappointed with.  If you're in the neighboorhood swing by for some enchiliadas and a horchada and you'll go home happy, I promise.
