A quick bite restaurant with a focus on serving foods without antibiotics, GMO, or hormones is just what this family needs. I appreciate the direction of using local produce and organic foods. I feel this mission sends a positive message for my children socially, economically and nutritionally.
The dining environment was shiny and clean. The social environment was friendly and relaxed. A nice hum of cool jazz, blues or the like played in the background. 
Happy appetites. Happy bodies. Happy minds.
Feeling satisfied.

I wish Chipotle had drive thrus. Tropical Smoothie has one, how about you?

Note: Restaurant manager. Inform your commercial property owner to be on top of cleaning up the landscaping and building area outside. It's littered with cigarette butts and trash.
