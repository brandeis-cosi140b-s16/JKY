I love this place! I go there at least once a week to get my favorite, their chorizo special burrito. It's a breakfast item but you can order it any time, which is awesome! I also love their carne asada fries. Their prices are fair for the amount of food you get, and it's always fresh, plus their right by my house which is a big plus! All in all, this place is great if you are looking for quality Mexican fast food!
