By far one of my favorite taco places in town!

I love it so much that I come at least once a week for lunch! I either order your basic tacos (yum) or the gordita. 

The gordita, carne asada with everything is a huge meal. I am so stuffed when i finish it, but it is so worth it! 

The staff is very friendly and it is everything you would expect from a taco shop. It reminds me of my days in Mexico and eating street tacos :o)

They should start a taco/ gordita punch card, after 10 get one free!!!
