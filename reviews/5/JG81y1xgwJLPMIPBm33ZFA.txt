El Conquistador is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. My wife & I have been going here for 10 years and it is always consistently great. Owned by a husband & wife... Maria who is the chef & Mark who is always smiling and greeting customers. I'll never understand why this wonderful restaurant is never rated in the top 5 Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.
The Poblano soup is unique and I have never seen it anywhere else.
We travel to Mexico a lot & this restaurant is as authentic as it gets.
As far as we're concerned it's Numero Uno. Viva Maria & Mark.
