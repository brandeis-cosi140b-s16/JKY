If you are looking for the BEST Mexican food you have ever eaten, an awesome, fun, friendly atmosphere, I STRONGLY recommend 
LAS FUENTES Mexican Grill in Surprise AZ. 

And the Best is yet to come, with the new Happy Hour menu and an extraordinary Salsa bar upcoming. Believe me the service is hard to keep up with, the new Manager, Steven, constantly mingling, and truly enjoying his guests conversation throughout the grill. The entire staff is extremely attentive. 

I will continue to frequent LAS FUENTES due to the awesome food, fun, and friends I find beyond their doors. Thanks for a great place to hang out. &
