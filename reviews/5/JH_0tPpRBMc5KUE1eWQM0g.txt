This is our first time at a Rubio's and found out it is quite great!  Very refreshing I had the sea bass tacos and a cerveza, Ballast Point (awesome!), the crew was great and attentive.  The food tasted very fresh and seasoned perfect!  We found an awesome place for lunch!  Thanks Aubrey for making our first time a great time!
