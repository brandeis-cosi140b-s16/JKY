Always great food, drinks and service when we come here! OTH is one of our favor our restaurants to dine at. 

Tonight's visit was no different but I must apologize to our waitress, Jade. We were on the patio and there was a very rude couple amongst us. Everyone around us could tell and on our way out; I told them they shouldn't be so rude to their waitress. They tried making a scene as we exited and I just wanted Jade to know how sorry I am for putting her in that awkward position. She was great!
