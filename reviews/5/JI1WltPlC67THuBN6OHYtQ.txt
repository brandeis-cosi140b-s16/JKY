I've been coming here for years, and have never once been served bad food, or had bad service. My personal love is the Rolando's breakfast burrito, a log of deliciousness that can easily serve as two meals!
Everything on the menu is delicious, from the carne asada to the chorizo, but definitely get the breakfast burrito, you can thank me later.
