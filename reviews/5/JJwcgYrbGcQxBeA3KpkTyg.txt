Don't overlook this place for brunch.  

I made reservations for New year's day right when they opened at 11.  Reservations were not needed but I totally suggest them at any other occasion.  

The brunch menu is limited, but all items are awesome.  Bloody Mary's are just spicy enough while Margarita's are just sweet enough, but not overly sugary.  Waitstaff is attentive and hip... Usually don't get that combo but Verde does it just right.
