This is my first time at a Rubio's, it was delicious! The BF and I both ordered the fish taco special. The tacos came with a big piece of fish and lots of onion/cilantro, as well as guac and tomato salsa.

Something unique about this place is the salsa bar they have, it was fun trying the different kinds of salsa offered. They made the fish tacos even more enjoyable!
