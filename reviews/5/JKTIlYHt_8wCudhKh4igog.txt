I've been to this local Mexican grocer/restaurant a couple times with my family. If you're looking for some great Mexican food, don't hesitate to stop and check this place out!

On both visits, I had the Torta Chicken Sandwich and it is awesome!  It's a very large portion of food with jalape√±os, avocado, and a great salsa. This is one of my go to meals at Mexican restaurants when it's an available item on the menu. This one ranks right up there and I would highly recommend it. 

My daughter has gotten the quesadilla both times and it is good, but don't expect your typically quesadilla. This one seems deep fried, which is a bit different than she is used too, but still tastes good. 

My wife has gotten tacos and tamales, which are excellent as well.  Chips and Salsa are great!

I honestly can't say a bad thing about the place.  Don't expect a fancy restaurant as its not at all, in fact it's a restaurant in the same building as a grocery store, but you can expect a great traditional Mexican meal!

I can't wait until our next visit!
