These $2.5 tacos are honestly some of the best I've ever had. Lots of meat on freshly warmed corn tortillas. Pico de gallo and hot sauces to too them off. Watch out the light orange hot sauce is extremely spicy!!

I got the carne asada with onions and the carnitas. The carnitas did have a few bits of grissle, but it didn't bother me.
