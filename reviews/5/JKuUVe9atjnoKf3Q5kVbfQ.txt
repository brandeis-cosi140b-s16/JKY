They need to give Alejandra a raise. She's the best drive thru worker I've ever come across. She remembered exactly what we liked and wanted on our second visit. She has great memory and amazing people skills. 

I ordered a vegetable burrito and loved it. This is now my go to mexican spot. It tastes like senor taco only with a cheaper price tag. I only paid $5.75 and it was huge! I'm so full now and somehow I still want more of it because it tasted so good. The horchata was good but they put too much ice in it. Next time I come here I'll try to remember to tell them no ice. The green chilaquiles here are amazing.
