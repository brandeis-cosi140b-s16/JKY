This place is a great option for quick nice dinner or a casual night out.  I went to Taco Guild specifically based upon the Yelp reviews and my trip did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is pretty striking and the options are spot on.  The taco options were fascinating and tasty.  This is a solid option for an evening or a great lunch.
