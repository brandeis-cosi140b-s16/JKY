We needed some grub on the way to Tuscon, and although we originally planned to stop later in the drive, our stomachs cried louder than our heads. Needless to say we Yelped for a good place to eat. This came up as a top pick for the town. Please keep in mind I'm a) fussy about Mexican food, b) don't eat it if other choices are available, and c) rarely if ever eat refried beans. I ordered the Wednesday special, which was the carne asada with rice and beans. 
This place got 5 stars because I ate it voraciously, the beans were delicious (not salty at all), the carne asada and hortchata were legit, it was clean inside and out, and the cashier was both professional and friendly.  Did I mention it was a bargain?  A huge win for our stomachs, tastebuds and wallet.
