I'd like to make my deep love for El Burro known. I would write love letters to these incredible tacos if I wasn't fearful of spilling salsa on them. What a fantastic neighborhood find, thanks again to Yelp!
Lots of vegetarian choices and variations of those choices. The potato tacos are mouth watering, with flaky flour tortillas, fresh veggies, and chunks of potatoes cooked in some magical spice that makes me crave them nightly. The rolled potato tacos are a surprisingly huge portion of 4 taquito type goodies with loads of cheese and fresh pico. There are tons of different burrito options, I think 11 in all, many vegetarian or having veggie friendly possibilities. Oh, and some have french fries, which makes my inner fat kid squeal with delight and feel naughty at the same time. I adore that they have vegan chorizo and the breakfast burrito is definitely worth tasting, even though those potato tacos are difficult to pass up! 
El Burro has the best salsa I've ever tasted. I guess this is controversial since other reviewers seem to find it too thin or even runny. I don't care about chunks, apparently, just flavor. And this stuff has it! Perfect amount of kick to compliment those homemade chips. The guacamole is good, although they don't give you much of it on the side. They carry Mexican Coke (sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup) and other south of the border bottled beverages which only adds to the El Burro vibe and experience.
This is primarily a take out joint, although I suppose you could eat there if you wanted. There just isn't much seating, just a handful of stools at a couple counters. Order at the counter or call ahead. The staff is super friendly and knowledgable. And it's cheap! $2.95 per taco, $5-$6 for rolled tacos, $6.95 for burritos, $2.95 for chips and a huge container of salsa. 
I'm so delighted to have El Burro as my new neighbor. Definitely crave-worthy food has come to Federal Street, and I could not be happier!
