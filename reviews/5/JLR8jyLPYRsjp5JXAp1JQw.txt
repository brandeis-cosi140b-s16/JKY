Nice mix of traditional and unusual items on the menu. We opted for something a little different - my husband had the beef empanadas and I had a chipotle pasta. Both were great!  Good flavor and plenty to take home for lunch tomorrow!  Restaurant interior is cute  too! Salsa has a kick to it - which I like !  My suggestion - Come and check out this great neighborhood restaurant.
