My boyfriend and I have been wanting to check out a  Two Hippies joint for quite some time, but it's usually after we just ate somewhere else. Today, we were out running errands and got hungry so decided to come here. I'm glad we did!

I had the pesto-mayo/feta/etc hot dog. It was delicious, and they put two dogs in a bun, so it's a ton of food. I've been jonesing for a good hot dog ever since Maui Dog closed, and this will probably be a good replacement for it! They throw in a little bag of chips too, I got regular Sun Chips, but my boyfriend stole them from me.

I also had a frozen lemonade, with passionfruit. First taste and it reminded me of another thing I miss dearly, Fruitopia!

My boyfriend had just a plain hot dog. He got ketchup and mustard for it too. He enjoyed it, but I think he secretly liked my dog better. He got FunYuns as his chip choice, but regretted it so I ended up eating them.

All in all, $10 spent on a good amount of food.

You can BYOB there too, which is awesome. I think next time we go we'll be bringing some kind of drank. :)
