Oh man! I normally love mission style burritos with a ton of different things in them but this place makes me love one ingredient burritos. You cannot lose with their green chili burrito. I prefer getting the burrito enchilada style because the sauce is absolutely perfect and it is covered with cheese. (who doesn't like cheese?)

Its a no frills place with a simple menu and everything is great.

Tacos are not served every day but if you happen to be there when they are being sold they are worth trying. 

If you go to phoenix and want awesome take-out mexican food; this is the spot.
