With fast food, I only review it based on the service. 

Everyone knows Taco Bell is delicious and you're lying if you say you don't think that.

Glad we cleared that up. 

This Taco Bell is par for the course in regards to food. However, they shine in regards to customer service. Below is a dialogue of typical fast food businesses in a drive-thru setting:

Me: [pulls up to order] Hi!
Fast Food Restaurant: Hi, what would you like?

And now this Taco Bell:

Me: [pulls up to order} Hi!
Taco Bell: Hi! How is your day going?

This three extra seconds they spend is so freakin' polite, I can't even. If you're craving a Mexican pizza, go to this location where they charm the heck outta ya.
