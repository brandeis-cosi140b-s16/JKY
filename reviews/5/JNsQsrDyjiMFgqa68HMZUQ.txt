This place is hands down my favorite place to get Mexican food in LV... hell probably anywhere.  All the food is great quality and you really cant go wrong with anything on the menu (and yes I've tried everything at least once).  The most popular item is easily to adobada tacos which are heavenly and perfect when you're not trying to stuff yourself.  This place is also really cool because anything you see on the menu you can put on top of fries (like carne asada fries style!).  I always find myself coming back to this place and its always a go to when friends come to visit!

Favorite items: Adobada Tacos (w pineapple), Buche Tacos, Tripe Tacos
