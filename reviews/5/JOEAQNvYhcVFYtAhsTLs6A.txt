I live about 3 minutes from Adrian's, and finally gave it a try today! I got a Machaca Burrito, and it was super great!  The place looks like a total dumpster fire from the outside, but inside, while super aged, and worn out, is clean, and cute.  I did try the Horchata, which was nothing special, but the burrito was incredible, and I can't wait to head back, and try other stuff :)
