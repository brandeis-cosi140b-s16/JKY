Korean and Mexican WHATTTT??? Wow there is something to be said about Fusion Food. We stopped at this place when a friend jumped on Yelp and saw the fab reviews.  It is in a strip mall with tight parking but so worth the extra effort and time.  So inexpensive especially in a town where I am always shocked at the cost of Mexican Food. I had the fusion tacos and they were delish!

Love finding little gems like this.  It's a place worth driving to and checking out. You will not be disappointed. If you are picky on ambiance take it go.

Geez this review is making me want to take a trip back to KoMex as we speak : )

Did I mention just saw they opened another location on Flamingo/Buffalo woot woot!
