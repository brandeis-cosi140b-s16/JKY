Ate at the bar as seating was a long wait and a group left at the bar and offered their empty seats to us. I started with the house margarita which was nothing special it had prickly pear in it if i can remember correctly. I had the blood orange salmon which was superb!!!! It can be hard to find a good salmon dish around here and this dish was perfect. Salmon was cooked perfectly and the blood orange sauce wasnt too sweet and there was the right amount of it served ontop. The carrots were very good that came with it and so were the rice and beans. Would come back here again to try anything else on the menu!!
