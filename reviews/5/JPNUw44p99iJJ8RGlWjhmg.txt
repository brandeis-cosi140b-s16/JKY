One of our favorite places to eat.  We started eating at Cafe Rio when we lived in Utah.  Recently moved to Vegas and there is a Cafe Rio close to our house.  My son loves their pork barbocoa burrito.  They have a different special everyday.  My favorite daily special is their coconut shrimp tacos.  They are the best.  We always get chips and queso with our orders.  The food is always fresh and hot.  Their salads are to die for but be ready for a big feast.  I can never eat a whole salad.  The Tomatillo dressing which is their house dressing is out of this world.   I could not say enough great things about Caf√© Rio.  They also have a frequent dinner card you get stamped when you purchase a meal.  After you have ten stamps you get a free meal.   WE LOVE CAFE RIO...
