I don't know if there is a better Taco / Burrito spot in Scottsdale.  This town is made up of 95% chain / franchised restaurants and the ones that are hole in the wall mom / pop shops are too.... well, Americanized.

I can't speak for Authentic Mexican food because I haven't been to Mexico, closest I've been was in California and this restaurant has come close to the burritos I would get from there.

Service is nice and friendly, food always comes out quick and well prepared.  I'm not expecting something that looks like Chipotle or Taco Bell, so I don't mind the mess inside of the burrito.  The taste is great, nothing fancy or similar to what is served around here.

The surroundings of Los Favoritos is a clean and friendly lot.  They reside in a friendly neighborhood amongst other good businesses.  The experience is always a good one as I've been here four times already, all at different hours and they have always been consistent.
