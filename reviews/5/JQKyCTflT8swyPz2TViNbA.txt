Exquisito! The real deal. A real chef. A quality, unforgettable meal. 

The food at Yayo is fresh, beautiful and expertly seasoned. The flavors are unexpected and over the top delicious. The atmosphere is great fun right down to the music they play and even the beer choices are awesome. 

This place is a foodies paradise and should be on every food tour of Las Vegas. It is now on mine for any visitors! 

Yummmmmmmm!  Order the 4 taco combo so you can try a variety from the menu because it is all so good it's impossible to narrow it down to just one dish!
