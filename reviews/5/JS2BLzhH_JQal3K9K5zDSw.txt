This place is one of my favorites for tacos. I always get the carne asada tacos. The topping is amazing.. guac and shredded lettuce.. yum! I always add on a bean and cheese burrito. I tried their salsa for the first time yesterday and it is delicious as well. They also have that really cool Coke machine for the kids- and me! I'm soo happy they opened near my house and I don't have to trek up to 7th street for America's!
