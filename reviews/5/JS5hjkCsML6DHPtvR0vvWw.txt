After many years of trying to find a place that cooks in a decent Northern Chihuahua style. Thankfully a friend told me about Burritos Juarez. Colitas de Pavo, hot dogs, tortillas and Chico's style tacos all make this place the #1 destination for anyone from El Paso, TX or Cd. Juarez. All of the other dishes are as good as any other Mexican joint in tow
