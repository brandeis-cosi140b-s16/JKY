Qdoba does work! Love the new menu and the queso is out of this world. The chicken queso burrito is the busness. Dont get that smothered nonsense, get the naked burrito And get yourxelf some chips. Best nachos youve ever had and you wont get soggy chips. Its quick, its like 8 bucks but you dont havw to tip and its alot of food. The whole place is simple quick and awesome.
