Had a really good time here yesterday.  Got there early and Jennifer waited on me. Then my friends came in and she took care of us all and was AWESOME fun and sweet.  The San Tan brew was ice cold and the broiled fish tacos were yum. Fun atmosphere. The watermelon margarita was ridiculously good. Will be back.
