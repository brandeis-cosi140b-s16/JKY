I look for a place like this near every airport I visit.  There is bound to be something good and cheap around the corner, apparently pilots are good customers.  Excellent basic tex-mex and really good carnitas too.  I like to get the chile verde with the pork carnitas.  Now my go to Mexican place in Charlotte.
