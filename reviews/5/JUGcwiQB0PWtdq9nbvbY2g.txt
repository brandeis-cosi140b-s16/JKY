How refreshing to enjoy excellent Mexican cuisine without GMO's!!!!! Fresh chips with 3 Salsa's - Habanero is hot but so tasty. Just take it easy and is great for a added bite to your dish. The Chicken Lettuce wraps were  so refreshing with the perfect combination of flavors accentuated by a bit of the habanero salsa. Clarence raved about his seafood enchiladas as demonstrated by a truly empty plate. 

OMG- The flan just rocked my palate so I had to do a quick edit! Save room for this magnificent dessert!!!!! 

Get off the strip and enjoy this great Mexican restaurant. Don't be deterred by the location as it is nice, clean and we had awesome service!
