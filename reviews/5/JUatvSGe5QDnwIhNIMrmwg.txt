This is our FAVORITE Mexican restaurant.  We moved here from Southern California 16 years ago and searched  all over the Charlotte area until we discovered this place.  Have been there ever since they opened. Their food is FRESH and DELICIOUS.  Their GREAT service comes and goes (haha).  Lately, it's been great again.  We celebrate every big family event there.  My only complaint -- they recently ditched their AMAZING salsa for tomato sauce :-/   Other than that, Tacos and Tequila remains our FAVORITE.  My husband and I are going there for a date tonight!  I can almost guarantee you will not be disappointed. :-)
