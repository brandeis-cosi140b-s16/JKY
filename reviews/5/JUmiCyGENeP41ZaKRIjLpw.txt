This place is organized chaos. The tacos are some of the best in Vegas and that's all you should care about. 

All of the tacos are great but my favorite is the adobada tacos, which is 'spicy', not actually spicy, marinated pork. And consider yourself lucky if you get a slice of pineapple off the top of the grease spindle, the sweetness really helps the flavors pop. 

Since this place can be overwhelming at first my advice is to find the guy that's slicing the pork off the grease spindle and load up on adobada tacos. MAS MAS MAS!
