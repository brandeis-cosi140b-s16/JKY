My husband and I fell in love with Rubio's!  The mango habanero taco is sweet and not too spicy- it is a gem!  My husband favors the beer-battered fish burrito.  I have to say it is mighty delicious but a little more caloric then my fav grilled fish tacos. Also good, the regal springs tilapia taco is creamy, crunchy, and flavorful.  The new chimichurri is intensely flavorful with its many herbs and spices.  It is good but not for every palate.  We have visited locations all around the valley and they are all consistently good.

Make sure you try the salsas at the salsa bar.  We eat tons of the green salsa as well as the traditional red salsa.  Put an extra squeeze of lime on the chips and tacos and you can sit back, relax, and pretend you are on the Pacific coast enjoying a fresh meal.
