This is a really great concept and the food is great. Anytime we are in Chandler we stop here. We love all the options and things you can add to your plate at no extra charge. The staff is nice and food is always great. We wish there was a location in Tucson. I had the tacos and was able to do 2 chicken and 1stake and both meats were delicious. We Will be back for sure.
