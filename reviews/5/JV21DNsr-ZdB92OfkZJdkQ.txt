This place has ruined me for all burritos!  My friends and I have been going almost every Friday for the last several years and I crave it more than that.  The steak, potato, and cheese with red sauce is my go-to but they have a burrito for everyone!

Also, they made the news [bit.ly/1F4YPow] when the owner stuck to his guns and refused to be treated poorly by a foul-mouthed former customer (by mutual agreement).
