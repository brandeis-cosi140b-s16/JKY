So. Good. Seriously. So good.

This new location is dangerously close to my bf's house and it has become a staple in our diet. I mean, where else can we get delicious fusion food we both enjoy that fills us both up for $15? It's ridiculous.

My favorites are the chicken fusion tostada and the fusion pork belly tacos. That crunch they develop on the rice tostada is just delicious and provides a much needed textural component to that dish. And the pork belly tacos are just yummy goodness. I mean, it's pork belly.

My only complaint is my breath seriously smells like onion for a whole day after eating here cause of the asian slaw. Good thing the bf and I both eat here so we both have onion breath!

But this location is much more convenient for me than the other, and it's significantly larger with more seating area as well. I have been and will continue to be a Komex fan.
