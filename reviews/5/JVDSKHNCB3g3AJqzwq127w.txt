The first thing we did when we came to Pittsburgh was look for a good Mexican place. We're not talking about texmex, but California burritos, carne asada fries, etc.. and el burro is the place. Not only do we come here to get our SoCal Mexican food fix, but we've ordered 80 tacos for a party before and they did a great job with them. Delicious!
