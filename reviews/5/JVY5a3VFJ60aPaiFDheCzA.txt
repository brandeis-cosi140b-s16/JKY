Just so happened to be in the 'hood on Sunday afternoon, dropping my  oldest daughter off at a friend's house. 

Well, well, well, there's Poliberto's, and I have my partner in crime with me, my baby, closer to 11 now than 10 !  Here's my chance- I rarely order fries for myself unless I have "someone" to share them with.  Let's pull on in, shall we, for, ummm... dinner ruining snack?  Early dinner?  You decide, but we're gettin' some Carne Asada fries today!

O.M.G.

And my friends, I have moved my rating up to a 5.

My daughter opened them in the car.  We picked at them a little.  We liked.  

At the base of this massive mound of food are fries, cooked 'til crunchy.  They are seasoned well.  They are topped with a big ol' pile of cheese and massive quantities of carne asada.  Adding to the party, they are doused with sour cream and guacamole.  

She found the forks.  We picked at them some more.  We joked about not having any when we got home.  We talked about going back for another container.

I'd say we killed about 1/3 of these evil morsels by the time we got home.
