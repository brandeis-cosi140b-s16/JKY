Wow.

Found this restaurant here on Yelp, and figured I would give it a try.  I was not disappointed!  

Appetizer - Avocado fries.  These were crispy and perfectly cooked, although I would have liked a few more of them!

Dinner - Tacos of course!  I had the beef, jerk chicken, and chorizo verde tacos.  All were very well seasoned and cooked nicely.  Tacos are on soft corn tortilllas, and are small enough to finish off in about 4 bites.  I like that the main ingredient is the meat, not large amounts of lettuce and pico like you see in many places.  No cheese either, which was not missed.  Fresh cilantro, mangoes, and onions kept each of my tacos bright and really tasty!

Dessert - I wasn't going to have any, but my waitress talked me into the truffles, which were amazing.  Chocolate truffle with whipped cream in a phyllo cup with a piece of dried kiwi to garnish.  Small, beautiful, with a surprise chili inside for a bit of kick to wrap up the meal.  Very nice!

Only con:  no alcohol (BYOB only), and I would have enjoyed a nice margarita with such a tasty meal.
