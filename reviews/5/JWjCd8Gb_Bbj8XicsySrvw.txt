Purposely logged into Yelp after about a year of not using it just to say how amazing my experience here was! I accidentally left some jewelry on my table that was of value to me. Harry, the manager here, went above and beyond to locate what I had lost and get it back to me. I could not be more appreciate of how on top of this he was, and how quick he was to call me back! That sort of service is hard to come by, and I am so thankful to him! Someone, give this man a large Christmas bonus. 

Not to mention, the meal was amazing, as it always is. Can't ever go wrong eating here, and after this amazing experience, I will always select this Fox restaurant over any other one!
