I am a totally picky Mexican food eater, and Anaya's was amazing. My mom and I stopped in for lunch today and we were sat immediately and served our drinks and chips and salsa. The salsa was too DIE for. We chose our meals off the lunch menu which was very reasonably priced. I had the arroz con pollo which had tons of fresh veggies and the sauce was great. My mom had the pollo fundido and it was excellent as well. Over all the atmosphere and the service was excellent while still offering great prices. We will definitely be back. My only down point was I don't believe the tortillas were homemade, other than that is was wonderful! Glad to have a great alternative to Manuel's and Don Rubens in the neighborhood.
