This Chipotle is always amazing. As a whole Chipotle is great but this particular store is always awesome. For about $8 a burrito it can be a bit expensive, but it's completely worth the money. The burrito is just about as big as burritos get. I guess it weighs about 3 pounds. Service is always quick. From walking in the door to walking out takes less than 5 minutes. Steak is always cooked just right and very tender. I love this place and will probably go there again tonight lol.
