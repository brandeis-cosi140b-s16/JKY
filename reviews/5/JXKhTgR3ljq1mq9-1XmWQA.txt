New in town from San Diego, I've struggled to find "hole in the wall" mexican places in Phoenix...or at least in Scottsdale where I live.  Luckily I found El Napalito near my work.   This place was great, very authentic Mexican.  The 99 cent "chili rojo" beef taco I got was small, like the "street tacos" you get in Mexico, but very very good (and only 99 cents).  Three of these on an elaborately decorated plate in a Scottsdale restaurant would be 13 - 16 bucks.  And the al pastor burrito was very good.  The burrito was also authentic mexican...on the small side, no frills, just meat and sauce, but only $3.99 and it came with rice and beans on the side.  The food alone would probably deserve a four star rating (the taco was better than the burrito), but considering I sat down, was given free chips and salsa, had a taco and burrito with rice and beans for a total of $5.44 (with tax), five stars it is.
