My favorite guilty pleasure. 

Order me the #9 and I've died and gone to heaven. Twice. (Once for each taco...) 

Seriously yummy. Quick. Affordable. Clean. They do take credit cards...

And I haven't even mentioned their guacamole. Or their tortillas that some people drive from Paradise Valley and Scottsdale to get (people like this like to talk to you during their brief wait to get their order...).

The only downside to Carolina's is they are so CRAZY BUSY that getting a parking place or a table is sometimes a challenge (even though they offer plenty of both). Don't let this discourage you, though. Go a little early for the lunch/dinner rushes or take a bit of patience with you...you won't need much...they'll get you in and out with plenty of time to spare.
