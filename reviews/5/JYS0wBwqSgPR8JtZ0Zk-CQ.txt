Staff is always friendly and this location is very clean. They have a fully stocked salsa bar and chips come with most of your purchases. I always get the same thing, the Baja chicken burrito. I'm never disappointed and the wait is always short. Perfect for a quick lunch break, and definitely a healthier option than all the grease soaked food locations that surround the area.
