I'm not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants - but Cantina Laredo consistently delivers on food and service.  They have an updated menu with some new items as well as some old favorites like the carne asada.   They also have a menu just for lunch with some lower priced options and a kids menu with both mexican and american food choices.   It will please even the picky eaters!
