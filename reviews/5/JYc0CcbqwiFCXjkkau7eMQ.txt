Yummy, yummy, yummy! This place is great. I love the pork. Its good in salads, enchiladas, tacos, burritos, whatever you want to put it in. Plus they have whole wheat tortillas for those of us who like them. I admit I wasn't impressed on my first visit because they do rush you through and its hard to make those split second decisions when you are just trying to figure out what is going on but after trying it a couple more times I was hooked. I was completely addicted to the place while I was pregnant. Just speak up and tell them what you want and how you want it and they will make it for you.
