This place is a find.  A gem tucked away in a strip mall in NE Mesa.  If you are in the mood for some good mexican food at good prices, come on down.  My husband and I each had different burritos and both were excellent, with great salsas too.  The flour tortillas were so fresh and like someone else mentioned, the food wasn't greasy.  This is quality food in a very casual atmosphere.  If you are in a hurry, I noticed that they have drive through too.  Definitely worth a try, especially if you are in the neighborhood.
