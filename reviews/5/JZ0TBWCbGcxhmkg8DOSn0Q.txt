Another location, another ode to Chipotle

Burrito, burrito bowl, quesadilla, or taco
Barbacoa, steak, carnitas, chicken, or veggie
Black beans or pinto beans
Spicy, corn, medium, pico de gallo, or a mixture
Something for the whole family.
 
Instead of yellowed Spanish rice
Actual white Mexican-style rice with a hint of cilantro and lime
And. . .
Brown rice for the health conscious
Something for everyone.

How come it's soooooo good!?

Tin foil, talkative cups, and gregarious wrappers
What's up with the narcissistic pictures?
Lots of metal and wood
You know when you walk into a Chipotle

There is always a Chipotle near by, but. . .

Why aren't there more Chipotles!?
