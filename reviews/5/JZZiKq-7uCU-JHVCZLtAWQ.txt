This place is right down the street from my work,  what a gem. I went with a coworker on our lunch break at 2 pm today left at 2:10pm. I ordered the beef burrito and it was probably one of the best I ever had.  Great portion Great price I spent $4 and some change and am stuffed. Great job I will be back at least once a week here a cheat meal is OK here and there.
