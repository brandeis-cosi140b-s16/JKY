One of Pittsburgh's newest restaurants Täkō offers diners a dizzying array of tacos, margaritas and cocktails. Start with the chips and salsa along with a customized guac. If you've never had goat cheese and bacon guacamole you need to. The namesake taco with octopus is great but so are the Al Pastor with pineapple along with the chorizo. We ordered 5 different tacos and all were awesome. The cocktail and margarita menu is also comprehensive and creative. If mixed drinks aren't your thing you can grab a can of Tecate. 

There is a live DJ and that may be the only drawback because it is loud as hell. That aside the atmosphere is like nothing else in Pittsburgh.
