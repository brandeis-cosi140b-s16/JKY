Excellent place for food, entertainment, and big hearts. They hosted the "Rock for Williams Syndrome" fundraiser event on April 26, 2014 to raise awareness for Williams Syndrome which my son was diagnosed with as an infant. He is now 15 and when we walked in we were welcomed with open arms by the staff and the other patrons. 

My son was catered to by the wonderful waitstaff and they even danced with him, the bands that donated there time were friendly, and the food was excellent! My son and I had so much fun. What an experience. He was even interviewed for the newspaper.

I would definitely make the 1 hour drive again because it so worth it!! I recommend this place for sure along with the pizza and the bacon wrapped shrimp jalapeno poppers. Reasonably priced and yummy!
