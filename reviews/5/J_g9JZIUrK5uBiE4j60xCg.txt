I came here for my birthday a few days ago and I have to say that I really do enjoy the food and ambience of the restaurant.  Our meal began with a bowl of flour tortilla chips (fried) that were simply tasty and memorable.  The salsa was a green (tomatillo) and a slightly hotter red salsa.  The salsa and chips cannot be beat!

I ordered a Hatch chilli and chicken combo that was true New Mexican in taste.  The one thing that I truly love about the food is that the sour cream is on the side, not all over.   I have a problem with dairy and sour cream can easily ruin my meal.

The server (part owner) was attentive and knowledgeable.  My son decided that he wanted to play with a small armor suit in the background (sans the knight).  The mask fell apart, but the restaurant and management were supportive and light hearted about it.  He had a smiley face pancake and fries, quite the meal for a four year.  My wife had the fajitas.  It was served with the hot peppers on the side, not to overwhelm someone who does not cherish the finer qualities of chiles.
The restaurant is small and has a romantic/quaint setting.  The price for a couple dining (no alcohol) is about $30.00 per couple (before tip).
My only suggestion - serve some desert!

The ambience plus food for $30.00 per couple is a well deserved treat, just do not touch the shining armor in back!
