I was in Phoenix for a few days and stayed at The Clarendon. This little restaurant is in the hotel and I ended up eating here a few times during my stay. The hotel is very trendy, modern, kind of has the Old Palm Springs trendy look. I love it. Anyway, this little restaurant has the best of everything. My favorite was the tacos de carne asada. The meat is really tasty and has a great sweet taste. I also had the shrimp and halibut tacos all really yummy. If you go for happy hour, they are each about a $1.75. Great Deal. Okay but my FAVORITE was the Chilaquiles with egg. OMG this was SOOO good. It was a stack of crispy corn tortillas with eggs and a sauce that was to die for. Now on a different day, I had the chorizo and egg plate. This was not my favorite. The chorizo didn't have any egg so it was just too strong for my liking. I didn't end up eating it. I had a friend visit me for breakfast one day and he had the chorizo torta, that looked very good. One more thing, get the OJ. It is fresh squeezed. Ceviche was great, they'll give you a whole bowl of homemade chips with your order. Lastly the bar that is adjacent to the restaurant, is very lively with a bunch of beautiful people who are artsy, clever and very hip. Have the Sangria. This is about one of the only few places I think that can make a good original Sangria. Also rooftop bar is great too.

Can't wait to visit again.
