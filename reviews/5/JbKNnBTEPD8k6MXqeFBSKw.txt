The food is absolutely amazing! The parent restaurant (Komex Express) is just as good if not better. I was doing some research on the previous yelp reviews posted and one customer feels that this is a let down compared to the other location. I do not agree with that comment since the original chef from Komex express works at this location, and all of the meats are marinated on site and delivered to the Decatur location daily to keep the flavors consistent. So how could the two restaurants possibly not compare?! This continues to be my favorite weekly dinner spot and I'm happy to see that the new location is a success. My compliments to the owners for another success!
