It's been in business forever for a reason, great Mexican food. This is my favorite place in the valley to eat Mexican food period. Though you might not get the best service sometimes it doesn't matter because the food is freaking fantastic(Yes it's that good). I'll be going here for the rest of my life, because they just do it right.
