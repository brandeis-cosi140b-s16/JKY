What to add when Yelpers have already faithfully posted 500 reviews? I scanned through the mass of comments about Paradise Valley Burger Company and I have a half dozen observations to share. 

First, the counter staff is amazingly helpful and friendly, ready to explain their offerings at the slightest hint of uncertainty. You should have no fear about coming here for the first time. 

Second, the burgers are just the right size. Two beef patties, but not a massive weight gainer. Not a walk away hungry burger either. Just right. 

Third, all those reviewers who rave about the Brulee burger, the burgers of the week, the French toast fries, the sweet potato tots... Everything they say is true. 

Fourth, the pricing is not what you'd call cheap, but it's very reasonable, with a basic PV Burger coming in at $5.25 and more elaborate choices listed at $7 or $8. No sides are included, but I'd rather order just what I want and share anyway. 

Fifth, it is a small neighborhood restaurant that just happens to be  a foodie paradise. You would never find it without Yelp's help. The dining room is small, although not quite as tiny as the storefront would indicate. Simple, clean and comfy. Perfect.

Sixth, kids are welcome. Space is sometimes in short supply, but there is still plenty of room for the kids. A $5 kids menu features, among other things, small versions of basic burgers (one patty instead of two) complete with a side of fries. Oddly, the menu says these meals are only for kids age seven and under?!? I assume they don't enforce that age limit.

My suggestion would be that you drop your anti-DDD bias and reward yourself by giving the Paradise Valley Burger Company a try.
