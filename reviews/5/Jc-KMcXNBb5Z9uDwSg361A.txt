MMMMM!!! Love this place! The Salsa bar is awesome. They have updated it since the last time we went so they now have a full bar! YAY!  The prices are great and you get sooo much food. My boyfriend and I was always have left-overs that heat up wonderfully in the toaster oven . There is not a lot of seating but that's down town dining for ya.
