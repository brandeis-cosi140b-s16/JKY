These people understand customer service. Food was delicious and fresh. Portions were large and tasty. We created a combination platter with street tacos & enchiladas. Don't let the location fool you, this place is a hidden gem and a local favorite! Chips & salsa were fresh and very good. You won't be disappointed.
