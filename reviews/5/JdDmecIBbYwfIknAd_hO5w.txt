This is all you need to know about the mission:

1. Make a reservation. If not, you probably won't be seated for a while. This place is popular!

2. BEST GUAC EVER. Get it. You won't be disappointed. 

3. Delicious take on Mexican food. It's a refreshing change from the norm. 

4. The pork shoulder taco's for 2 are AMAZING. Get them. And at only $32.... not pricey at all (especially for two people)! The salmon is excellent as well. 

5. The side dish of corn is delectable. Get that too. 

6. Go for your birthday or anniversary and get their take on bread pudding, free. We're going tonight for a birthday and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the pumpkin bread pudding, YUM!

7. Service is excellent. Servers are knowledgable. Great decor. Romantic.
