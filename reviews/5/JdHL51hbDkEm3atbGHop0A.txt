Best Taco in Town.  Beware they only take cash.  

Most of my reviews are pretty harsh.  I grew up in Chicago and we are the fattest city for a reason.  This place was amazing.  The menu is simple only about 10-15 items, but you do not need anything more.

I ordered the steak tostadas.  They fry up their own tostadas rather than use premade large versions of tortilla chips.  The steak was hot and fresh.  They added cilantro to all of their toppings.  It is the small things that impress me.  My husband got the steak tacos and those were equally delicious!!!  Each was served with rice and beans for only $7.99!! WHAT?!

There food is simply delicious.  The restaurant is far off to the corner of a parking lot, but take a chance on it.  Please, I do not want it to close down.  When we paid our check it came out to $21 for two people (pop and dinner).  That is ridiculously affordable.  She did not have enough change so she was going to waive off her tip and the extra two dollars.  Luckily I had a few singles.

They are nice people with good food and their prices can not be beat.
