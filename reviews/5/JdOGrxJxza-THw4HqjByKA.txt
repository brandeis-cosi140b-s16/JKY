I mean come on: Rubio's, Fish Tacos, Casino and drinks.  What more do you want??  

Even for a "food court" Rubio's the service is always great and the food is outstanding.  If anyone ever thinks it takes to long, please remember they are making it to order back there.

I have always loved Rubio's but this location is great because there is so much more to do and see.
