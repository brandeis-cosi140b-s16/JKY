Looking for a healthier alternative, we stopped at Rubio's. My daughter and I had salads- the chipotle orange. I had blackened tilapia, which was fantastic and she had grilled chicken, also very good.  My boyfriend got the chicken burrito. He said he thought it was better than Chipotle's.

The service was average. This is a fast food type atmosphere,  but they do bring the food to your table.

The salads were under 500 calories and filling. We will definitely return and I would recommend it to anyone, especially if you are looking for a lighter menu that's a little different than all the rest.
