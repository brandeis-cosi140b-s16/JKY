I loved this place!  We ordered delicious chips with homemade guac - excellent and from real avocados.  We then asked for a side of Carnita to put on top and they said "no problem".  The Carnita (pork) was absolutely awesome.  We so enjoyed our cold brews while waiting for our plane.  Beth was our bartender and was super cool and even changed the channel to the Apple Cup.  Only bad news was Cougs lost (out QB was out on injury).  I would for sure go back.  I loved their chips - they were not the icky commercial kind - tasted homemade.  Thank you for great service and yummay fixins!!!
