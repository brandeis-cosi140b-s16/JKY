Ambiance is great, prickly pear ice cream is good! The bathrooms in the saloon have like 3ft tall doors, so other women can definitely see inside. I had my mom stand in front of mine and I did for her, kinda weird. There's a small museum, like I mean a closet, with the history of Tortilla Flats, it's neat. We came here from phoenix and this was our turn around point.
