I'm always lookin' for thing's to eat that i can't get where i'm from. Yayo taco has become one of my must-go-to places when I'm in vegas. You gotta appreciate the artistry that goes into fusion food; finding the right textures and the right flavors to meld with the 'taco' blue print.

the menu is vast, touching all corners of the world, from japanese to italian inspired tacos. the beer menu is also vast which is a pleasant surprise. it's intimidating at first  but i always go with the people that work there to help. 

If/ when you go, I hope Jonathan is working. He won't just tell you what's popular, he's knowledgeable about both the food and beer menu, and he helped make my experience at yayo taco amazing!
