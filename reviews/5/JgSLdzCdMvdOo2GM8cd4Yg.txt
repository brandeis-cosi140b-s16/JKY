Maybe because we are Asian and we love Mexican food, this place was perfection for us! We had a party of 14 (including 8 children, ages 3-12) with a show to catch in one hour, and everyone was very attentive from the hostess to our waiter, and we even knocked down two glasses of water during our meal. Just down right excellent service. And the food...!! Amazing! Hand made noodles with a twist of Mexican and Chinese  flavors incorporated into the dishes... just wow.
