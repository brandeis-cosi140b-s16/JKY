My family and I had a great time at G's for dinner last week.  It was our first time visiting the restaurant so I was hesitant because it doesn't look like much from the outside but decided to give it a try because of the good reviews it received on Yelp.  The food was good and the people that run the restaurant were so nice and helpful, you can tell they really care about their customers.  We asked for a couple of things after we had already paid for our food and they didn't charge us.  We left a nice tip because you could tell they just want their customers to be happy. 

We'll definitely be visiting again soon!
