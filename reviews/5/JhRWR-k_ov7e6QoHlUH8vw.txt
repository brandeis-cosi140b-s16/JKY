Once again I ate at La fondas and the food was amazing! The chips came to the table nice fresh and hot!! The street tacos are one of my favorite things to eat but I had the chicken fajitas for something different and they were fantastic! It's always clean and friendly when I go in. Actually took some food home for my family I'm going to go was also very good!! I will be returning to LA fondas again real soon!!
