This place is super duper diddly aweeeesssome.

I work right across the street from this place and always order the cheese enchilada. 
Omg they are so good. The restaurant is very clean and organized if you go from like 1pm after they have the restaurant closed down, but you can still order from the bar.

The bar is pretty cool too. The bartender is a looker. I like to sneak over on my lunch breaks and have a few. Even if you just order drinks they will give you tortillas and salsa which is really good.

Prices at this place are decent. The staff is really friendly. 
Try the cheese enchiladas...
