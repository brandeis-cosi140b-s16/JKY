Oh My Land.... the tacos here are phenomenal. Loved the shrimp taco, the fish taco, and the carne asada taco. The guacamole is amazing as well. Service is very attentive and they were REALLY busy when we visited. The beer selection is small but good, and the place has a wonderfully friendly vibe. We loved it!!
