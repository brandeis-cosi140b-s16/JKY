Absolutely love the tacos. I had the lamb and a shrimp taco using lettuce as the shell. Out of this world. I had a cup of pasole on the side...changed my life. And then to wash it down with two socializers. Amazing. I had heard bad reviews about this spot until i tried it. No clue what people are talking about. This place is awesome.  The server was on point totally made sure we were taken care of. My only critique was noise in the restaurant. We went on a Sunday night which i think is a dj night. It was way too loud to be inside let alone be able to enjoy their food and the music wasnt fitting the chill vibe of the building. We sat on patio and had a great time. I will definitely return.
