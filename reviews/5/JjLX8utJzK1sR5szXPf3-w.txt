I am not an expert on Mexican good but I know what tastes good. The food here is delicious. I have been here twice and both times were great. Sunday afternoon they had a mariachi band which was awesome and also they had the lunch menu which is a great value, too.
The service is good as they come and refill your drinks and chips without being asked.
