Fresh ingredients,  friendly people,  good food,  and cheap.  Sounds like 5 stars to me.  The place is small mom pop restaurant.  Come in, order, kinda like Chipotle,  as others have mentioned,  your food is made to order and fresh.  I had the red sauce shredded chicken,  asada and barbacoa tacos.  All good,  but I did like the barbacoa the best.  The only agua fresca is horchata,  I had a Jarritos.  Churros are made fresh as well,  sweet!
