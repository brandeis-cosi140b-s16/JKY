-Great waiters, quick service. 
-Prices for being "in vegas" are SUPER reasonable!
-Atmosphere -fun lights, you can hear the hustle and bustle 
-Never super busy!

The beans are not my favorite from a Mexican Restaurant, but I'll get over it because the combo's are priced GREAT and I love the Chicken Tamales! YUMMMMM.
Husband had a shredded beef burrito and he said the beef was great! 

 If you are craving mexican, like we always are, this is a GREAT stop!
