I love the food at Rubio's in general. This location in particular is always good, staff is always friendly and welcoming. I've never had good that didn't seem fresh and great.  I recently had a picky eater to order for and they so nicely offered to put the spicy ingredients and sauce on the side! I'll keep coming.
