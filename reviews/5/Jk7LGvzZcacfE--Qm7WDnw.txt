Second visit for dinner tonight.
Ordered the shrimp & octopus cocktail for an appetizer.  It was pretty good, but a bit bland in our opinion.
For our entree, we took Erik S.'s advice, and ordered the Molcajeta Nayarita, and my goodness, was he right!  (Thanks Erik!!) I wish you could have seen hubby's face when they set the dish down in front of us!  Awe.
Crab legs, mussels, octopus, shrimp (head on whole, and shelled), scallops, and a very nicely spicy sauce.  Divine, absolutely divine.
Their Horchata is the bomb, and the perfect drink to quench the fire.
I highly recommend trying this dish.  You will not be disappointed!  By the way, this is enough food for four!  We ate until stuffed, and still took home leftovers.  
Today is apparently Mother's Day in Mexico, and they gave all the women a free slice of cake in celebration of it.  (We were so full, we took it home) 
The staff has been very friendly, and attentive, on both of our visits.
