All I ever eat here is their chicken fajitas. I love them so much that I can't bring myself  to order anything else. They come with fresh, homemade tortillas, creamy beans, flavorful rice, guacomole, and sour cream. This is one meal that you can share with another person and both of you get full. Their chips and salsa are some of the best as well. The service varies. I've had ok service and I've had excellent. I've eaten here probably about 40 times and only have had bad service maybe 3 times. Food is ALWAYS excellent. The manager there is happy to fix anything and check up on all customers periodically.
