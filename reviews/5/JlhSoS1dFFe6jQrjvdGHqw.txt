Summerlin locals... this restaurant single-handedly created a reason to come to Village Square instead of returning to Boca Park or Tivoli Village week after week. Don't be fooled by the humble exterior, this place is huge inside! The bar manager Venny will make you feel right at home as soon as you walk in. 

Bar:
A nice sized bar area with about a dozen stools + casual table seating.
Great Sangria, a good selection of Draft beer & some great happy hour prices
$2-3 Beers, $3 Wells, $5 Sangria or Mexican Bulldogs (+/- $1)

Food:
-House made guacamole was perfect & as fresh as it gets.
-I suggest grabbing a 3 taco plate and trying out a few kinds ($13)
-Carne Asada tacos were the best I've ever had.
-The pulled chicken was good but a little overshadowed by how awesome the Carnitas and Carne Asada were.
-$2 Street Tacos during happy hour.... enough said

Atmosphere:
Chinita's had a great balance of class/style while still retaining a light atmosphere. This place doubles as a great date spot or a place to unwind after a long day. The night I was there they had live music by Toto Zara which was a nice touch.

This place will no doubt become a regular destination for the happy-hour / dinner seekers in the area. Locals need to get in there before the HYPE sets in. derp
