I travel a lot and this may be the best Mexican Food in the country.  Anytime I am in Charlotte I make sure to eat here at least once.  Very traditional look and feel to this place.  Staff is very friendly and recognize me even when it has been a year between visits.  Seems like about every 20 minutes you hear them joyuously singing happy birthday to a customer who is wearing a large sombrero and blushing.  Really feels like the people who work here love their jobs and the customers they serve. 

The Tacos Al Carbon is such a perfect dish, made the right way with skirt steak cooked to perfection and queso fresco cheese crumbles, combined with pico de gallo unlike any other I have had.  All this carefully wrapped in corn tortillas that melt as soon as you get them in your mouth.

The chips and salsa are good......... the guacamole that they make at your table fresh is outstanding and it is fun to watch them make it.  They even let you tell them how much jalapeno to put in depending on how hot you like it.  Queso dip is very tastey as well.  

Food seems to always be out promptly even when I have brought large groups.  I love everything about Azteca except I wish they had one in AZ.
