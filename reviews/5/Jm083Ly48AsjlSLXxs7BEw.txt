Wow! I can't understand why this restaurant does not have 5 stars! The staff was all friendly and kind. The food was warm, flavorful and perfect. The horchata was the perfect sweetness and they will make guacamole right at your table! We had drinks, salsa and fresh guacamole within 3 minutes of sitting down. 

The take away, come and enjoy this food. You will not regret it.
