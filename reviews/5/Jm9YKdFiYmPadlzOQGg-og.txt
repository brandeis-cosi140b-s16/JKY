Javier's is my favorite spot to get my Mexican cuisine on. It's just on another level when it comes to their staff and management. They are friendly and outgoing. That right there is a great start to your dinning experience. The food here is phenomenal, and priced accurately. The portions are great and can't complain. There are a bunch of great options for food choice and you can not go wrong with anything you choose. I highly recommend this place if you are craving some great Mexican food.
