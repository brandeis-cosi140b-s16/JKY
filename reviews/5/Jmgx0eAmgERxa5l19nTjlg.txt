I've felt like a fish out of water for the past year after having moved to Madison from Southern California...true Mexican food was nowhere to be found. But today we found El Pastor and felt like we were home again! Forget Tacos Guadalajara and keep driving south for the best Mexican in Madison. Their torta de bistec put a huge smile on my face. Affordable with friendly service. We'll be back!
