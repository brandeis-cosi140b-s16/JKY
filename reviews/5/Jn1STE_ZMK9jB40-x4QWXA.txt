Okay, so I'm just a Bostonian who has basically been totally awed by Arizona in general, but seriously this place was totally amazing.

Not only did they give us salsa and chips (both delicious) to start our meal, but also a small serving of cerviche which was fantastic. And the meals were SO BIG. We were just two people, and after we both ordered a meal and a margharita, the waiter asked us, "is that all?" and we were worried we hadn't ordered enough but it turned out we ordered too much. And oh my gosh it was so good.

The server recommended shrimp in green sauce, and we also go the octopus. Amazing! As a side note, the beer serving was also huge. The atmosphere was perfect, there was copious parking, the restaurant was maybe a 7 minute drive from our car rental. Everything was for the win!

They do close early (at least when we were there) so keep that in mind. But oh my gosh, thank you for your incredible Mexican food!
