If "awesome hole in the wall Mexican joint" was a dictionary term, you'd see a picture of this restaurant in Webster's.

I was first here around a year ago and ordered a fairly safe carne asada torta. I think it was under $5 then, and it's still under $5 now. We had a fairly large group and kinda overwhelmed the small kitchen, so we had to take our entrees to go after eating some chips and salsa while still in the restaurant. The torta was really awesome, although I was disappointed that I had to eat it in a hurry.

Today, I made my own taco sampler with one each of the buche, cabeza, adobada, and carne asada tacos.  $1.40 is a tough price to match, but what's even more important is how great they all tasted!

I started with the buche, which purports to be from a pig's esophagus but ate a lot like some roast pork I've had with great crisped up skin. The crunchiness was different from what I've had before. Next up was carne asada, which was probably my favorite because it was just so packed with savoriness. The adobada was almost as good and carried plenty of sweetness, and it didn't suffer from overcooked meat syndrome even though I had walked into an empty restaurant. Finally, the cabeza was definitely good and wasn't even completely fatty. There was also some solid yet still soft head meat.

For all you people who are currently nuts about tacos over on Tropicana, head on to this strip mall near Sunset and Sandhill and park right next to Port of Subs, and make sure to give yourself enough time. You'll love this place.
