I love that a fast food Mexican restaurant that has great prices and food to match is here in Maricopa!  I ordered their 5 rolled tacos supreme and I couldn't believe how great it was for only $7!  I will definitely come back again.  My husband had the beef fajitas and he loved it plus you get a large amount of food, well worth it!
