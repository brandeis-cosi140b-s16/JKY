I work down the road from this Taco Bell and have been here MANY times over the last few years.  Why many times?.....better than 99% of other Taco Bell locations I've been too. Service is almost always quick and friendly, the restaurant is kept clean, the food is good and it's cheap.  On a few occasions when they've been super busy the food was slow coming out but it wasn't due to the staff not working their tails off.....you can clearly see them working a few feet from the counter.  Would recommend checking this location out if you haven't already....bet you'll agree it's a cut above most other Bell's you've been to.
