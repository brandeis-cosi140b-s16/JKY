So delicious. I had the Shrimp Club and my buddy got the Hodad. The fries here are the BEST that I personally have EVER eaten. The seasoning blend is just spectacular and well balanced!  I watched the Triple D episode on Friday and had to visit. I drove from Gilbert to enjoy and people, I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  I will be frequently coming up to try something new each time. Then owner and staff are super polite and took time out of his day to discuss his recent rise to fame with me. THAT'S SOLID!!!  You will not be let down!!
