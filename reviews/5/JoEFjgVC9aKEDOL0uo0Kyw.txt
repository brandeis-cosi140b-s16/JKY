It's refreshing when a place lives up to it's reputation and Casa Ramos is one of those places.  I found it via Yelp and I ended up visiting it twice during my short stay in Mesa.  

I am vegetarian so on my first visit I had the Veggie Burrito lunch plate and it was delicious.  The mushrooms were excellent.  On my second visit I went with the Veggie Fajitas and, again, it was fantastic.  The sauce was perfect and the tortillas were fresh and really tasty.
