I have been coming here since freshman year at foothill high school (2008) and always been impressed . Only place I've found that will add French fries inside a burrito / quesadilla . I recommend the bean and cheese , or anything carne Asada . 

Shoutout to the woman who is always working the front , she now knows my order as the usual . Once accused her of forgetting a burrito in my takeout order but it was actually in my car . It slipped out of the bag . Sorry about that ! 

Definitely better than Robertos , and cheaper than eating out at a "sit down style " restaurant . 

Recommend them to the highest .
