One of my few complaints about Anthem is that there seems to be few locally-owned businesses here. Lucky me Roberto's came charging up 17.

This is the same restaurant that was featured on DD&D a while back, located in the Shell station 7th Av. and Union Hills. Quick spot to pick up some good food on the way home from work. Just finished off the California Burrito and the new location is just as good as the old one. The handful of times I've made it to the old location, I've had the chile rellenos, and those are great, too. This one also has outdoor seating, too.
