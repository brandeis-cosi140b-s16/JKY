Funny, I checked on some places to eat after my daughter's soccer game and was looking for a very affordable place to eat, you know, the number/s of dollar sign/s beside the rating, and saw just a dollar sign.
So, we all found Braddah.... walked in, and the first word on my review, "Funny"? well, Funny, because the first thing my daughter said was, "papi, this looks like a Hawaiian version of Chipotle's." But......it was a ton better..... the taste, texture, the servings, it was ALL TOO GOOD!!!!
Take the whole family...... affordable and delicioso!!!!
