Chips and salsa are great. I can't believe I'm now reviewing chips and salsa. Lunch was fish tacos and are very good, similar to others serving 3 small round tacos these days. It comes with good white 'something in it' rice and black beans. Service always good. Sat at the outside bar at Biltmore on a perfect day. Could be worse.
