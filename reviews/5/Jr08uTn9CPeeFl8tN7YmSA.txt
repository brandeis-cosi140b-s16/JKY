I have eaten at the Matador since the 80s and the food has been consistently good.  I like the large downtown location - it's convenient and there's room to meet up with all of your friends before or after an event.  The full service bar is great - really old-fashioned with lots of wood.   Love the salsa (both kinds!) and the service has always been acceptable - sometimes a bit slow when they are busy, but if you have a deadline, they are happy to hurry your order along.  Great food, friendly service, and a convenient location - what more can you ask?  I even had the Matador cater my daughter's bridal shower - awesome!
