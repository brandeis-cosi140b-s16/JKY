The Baja Tacos are definitely amazing; but what puts this place head and shoulders above all the Mexican joints in the area is the Carne Asada! 

I'm telling you-- you've never had REAL steak at an affordable (prices are great, too!) Mexican place before! My first time I had the tacos-- and they were surprisingly good, but my next time I had a burrito and the first thing I tasted was a mouth full of REAL marinated steak! And super tender, too.

I'm soooo happy I found this place, as I judge most Mexican eateries by their burritos and carne asada-- and this place is absolutely the best!!
