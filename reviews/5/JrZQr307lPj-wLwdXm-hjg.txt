Tried the Carne asada, pollo and birria tacos. All 3 were fantastic. But I favor the birria more since I love lamb meat. Nice salad bar. Quick service although wait times can be long depending on the time you are in, but quality is top notch as always. 
Friendly staff. I'm giving 5 stars for this wonderful experience.
