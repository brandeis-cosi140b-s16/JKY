This place is hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. 5/5 service 5/5 food. First off, unlimited chips, salsa and bean dip. And this is a seriously good bean dip- like back in the day bean dip at the Frontier (cheesy and bean-y). Nomz. 
Next up, I ALWAYS get the shrimp tacos. Like every. single. time. That's how good they are. The brunch on Saturdays and Sundays is also an amazing deal. A meal, a bloody and the chips and salsa for $13? Deal. See you there guys.
