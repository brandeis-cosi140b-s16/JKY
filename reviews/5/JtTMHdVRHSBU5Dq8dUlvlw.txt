Best frozen margarita and under $6, please and thank you! We just stopped in for the drinks after a long day riding the light rail, walking around downtown, climbing A mountain, and renting peddle boats on tempe town lake. These drinks were a treat for the day we had out in the sun. I'll have to try the food next time!
