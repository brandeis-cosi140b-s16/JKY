What can I say about this place that hasn't all ready been said. I went to this because of yelp, usually I make a list of the top places in Vegas to go eat at, but I usually get side tracked you never know what's going to happen over there so one day at midnight me and my wife went after a show I was thinking I need to budget after hitting up the fine dining spots so we went here all I have to say is that we showed up at midnight and the next day we where back at 9 am for round two the tacos are Bomb. The tacos al pastor are authentic, I don't care how much you think you know by going to places around the world and having the best tacos this place is good and original. This place started in Tijuana and moved to San Diego and is booming in Vegas. I live in the high desert and think about taking of to Vegas just grab some tacos all the time. If your going to Vegas on a budget don't go but if you end up going hit this place up. Don't forget to ask for some grilled onions and chiles and burnt tostada all that is complimentary.
