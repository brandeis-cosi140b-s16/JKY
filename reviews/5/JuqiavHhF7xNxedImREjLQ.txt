I don't know if this place is related to the other Michoacan restaurants in town, but if it is, all the others have a very high act to follow. I've been to the one off of Twain on the west side, but this one is even better (and that's saying a lot!).

The staff, to begin with... SUPER FRIENDLY. Our server explained everything on the menu we had questions about and did it with a smile even though it was super busy and noisy on that particular night. Other people who weren't serving our table even stopped to make sure we were okay.

I ordered the chimichanga de camarones (shrimp chimi) and oh my Jesucristo -- que bueno! Flavorful, zesty, and DEFINITELY filling. It is not for the timid eater. You know who I'm talking about... "I'll have a quarter of a salad and some water -- oh no, wait, I'm full just talking about it."

I'll be back to try more tasty items for sure. Y la próxima vez, ¡margaritas definitivamente estar involucrados! (And next time, margaritas will definitely be involved!)
