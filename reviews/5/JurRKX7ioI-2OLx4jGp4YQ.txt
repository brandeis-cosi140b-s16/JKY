YUM! We actually like Algobertos better than the Robertos in the area. Algobertos is a favorite of ours! Carne Asada nachos, Bean and Cheese Burritos, Rolled Tacos and Super Burritos are among our favorites when we go. 
The staff is always friendly and the owners are usually there too always smiling! We can't wait to check out the one they opened in Searchlight!
