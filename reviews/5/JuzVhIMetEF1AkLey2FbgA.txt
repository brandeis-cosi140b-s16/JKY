The best breakfast burrito I've ever had. My mouth is still tingling with delight and heat as I type this. Really just happened to be waiting for my flight and did not quite want a breakfast I could get back at home.... aka a Wendys breakfast.

The Blue Burrito Grill was right across the way.

I had their "works" breakfast burrito which features freshly seared chorizo, scrambled eggs, and potatoes. It came with a small plastic container of hot sauce which went perfectly with the burrito.

This is a quick stop and run type place without any seating. They do have a bar height table to stand at and stuff your face.
