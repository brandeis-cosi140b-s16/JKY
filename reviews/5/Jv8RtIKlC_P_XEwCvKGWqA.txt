Now I know why they call this place a hole in the wall....it literally has a HOLE in the WALL.  Exposed drywall, sweat dripping off the AC unit onto your face while you wait in line to order -- exactly what you'd expect from the best burrito stop in town.  Order a dozen tortillas to go...you won't be disappointed -- they melt in your mouth!
