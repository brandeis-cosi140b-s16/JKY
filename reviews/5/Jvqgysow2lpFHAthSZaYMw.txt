What do you get when your Korean BBQ makes sweet love to a burrito? KoMex Fusion Express. This place is 5 stars hands down. 

We were in the neighborhood and we've yet to experience the wonders of Korean-Mexican fusion so we stopped in. Our expectations were high and this place did not let us down. When we sat down, we were given chips with delicious guacamole and salsa. While the chips were made from flour tortillas, I preferred it because they were light and crispy. We asked for water and they gave us (free) Kirkland water bottles! YES! I am a water connoisseur and this place is handing out perfectly purified bottled water to accompany our meal. 

I ordered the bulgogi burrito while my husband had a  bulgogi and pork taco. When my burrito came out, my jaw dropped. You know how Chipotle isn't known for amazing food, but rather the size of their mediocre burritos? This place would blow Chipotle's baby burritos away, and it was only $4.50!!! The bulgogi was marinated deliciously and was accompanied by pico, rice, lettuce, and kimchi. Honestly, when I eat KBBQ, I usually don't even get bulgogi because I'd rather eat Galbi, but this bulgogi in my burrito was amazingly tender and flavorful. 5 star worthy right there.

Then the super nice owner/waitress brings out the oranges that you'd get at a sushi joint with some fortune cookies and a lollipop for my daughter. Our total: $7.57. I am SO impressed with this place and will tell everybody I know to support them so that they can expand to somewhere closer to my house. Until then, I will happily make the drive.
