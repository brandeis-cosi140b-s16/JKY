This place rocks.  I wish we had something half as good in Charlotte.  We first walked through the grocery and vendor area and were shocked at the selection, amount, price, and freshness of everything we saw.  We ate lunch at the attached restaurant...the best carne asada I have had.  Its been about a year and I still miss it.
