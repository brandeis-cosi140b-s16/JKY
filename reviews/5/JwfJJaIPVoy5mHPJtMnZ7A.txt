I woke up on a Sunday morning (well, it was noon), kinda drunk from the previous night's rage-a-thon. Roomie already started his brunch with a couple beers...on an empty stomach. We both decided to hit up this place as it was featured on Las Vegas Weekly (yup, shameless plug). 

They have street tacos or mini tacos for less than $2. I got greedy and decided to get five...carnitas, asada, lengua, tripas and carnitas de cueritos. First of all, this was my first time eating tripas (intestines and all that junk). OMG the first bite was amazing, but the second bite, I gagged cause I noticed it was all the weird stomach lining. Too intense for me. All the others I ordered: amazeballs. But the total winner was teh carnitas de cueritos. OMG. You must order that!!!

Also, if you do a dine in you will receive free chips and salsa. This place would be so much better if they didn't close at 10 p.m.
