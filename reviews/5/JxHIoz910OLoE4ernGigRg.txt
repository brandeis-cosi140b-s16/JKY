My favorite Mexican drive thru! 

Update! The super soft taco is my new favorite. Amazing! Two corn tortillas overrated with carne asada, Pico de Gallo, and pinto beans. Delicious! 

I am in love with the small corn quesadilla with carne asada. They are absolutely delicious. I smother them in green sauce and I'm one happy camper! 
I've tried the tostada... It wasn't as good. The shell got really soggy, maybe I need to eat that first next time. 
I also once accidentally ended up with the flour queasadilla (I think it was there accident, not mine but who's counting) instead of my beloved corn queasadilla. It was good, but I'm sure I'll never swap them out. And going forward Im very careful to expressly make sure they know what kind I want. It's Yummy!
