This place might look like a hole in the wall joint from the outside but I promise you they have delicious Mexican food at a awesome price, so if you don't have time for a restaurant but want authentic Mexican food at affordable prices, then this place will satisfy your tummy.                                                                                                  My favorite is there carna asada,either in a burrito with there awesome beans or stuffed in there corn tortilla tacos with there signature red sauce.....p.s there also have an incredible green sauce that you have to ask for.
