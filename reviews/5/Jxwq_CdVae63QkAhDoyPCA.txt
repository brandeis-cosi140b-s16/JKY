I ate at several Mexican restaurants around here and this was hands down the best.  The guacamole was fresh and had little chucks of avocado which I love.  The salsa was full of flavor with a hint of hot afterwards .  I had a pork burrito that had amazing flavor and a beef taco that again was perfect.  My wife had a chili relleno that was excellent and our friends also loved their dishes.  The patio is nice this time of the year. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for REAL Mexican food not a tex-mex or American Mexican place.  You will not be disappointed if you like authentic Mexican food.
