I tried this place in San Diego and they have it in VEGAS! After partying it up at XS, stopped by here to pick up some Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, carne asada fries, & a large horchata, hustled into the hotel room and started devouring these foodgasmic tacos. (Just sprinkle in some lime juice & hot sauce... tastes best mixed in with their green sauce). They use fresh potatoes for their carne asada fries and their meat is so tender & smoky.... OMG best thing ever especially when you need some hangover food haha.
