Great Mexican in McFarland?  GET OUT OF TOWN!  No, stay, because this place is great.  In a weird little corner of one of those strip malls on Route 51, Los Jarochos caught our eye with a banner draped over a car in the parking lot.  The owner is very nice and helpful.  Great menu varies from the gringo friendly to those looking for real Mexican food.  I loved my empanadas -- crispy and delicious.  Give this family owned business some love and have a try.
