soooo love me some Eribertos. We used to frequent here for the best breakfast burritos around before we moved to South Mountain.. When we decided to move back up here, we just by chance bought a house right across the street! They're open 24 hours, and have a drive through (although it's hard to find, you have to drive behind the dry cleaners to find it) The Carne Asada is awesome, the Carne Asada Fries are teh ULTIMATE drunk food and I finally tried their menudo last weekend and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Great quick service, super fresh great food and super cheap makes it a triple threat...and the 24 hour plus drive through doesn't hurt the cause..
