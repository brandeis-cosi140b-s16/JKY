This review is for the taco stand outside of the store. EAT. THERE. ASAP. My bf and I were in town for the weekend and were exploring The Strip. We originally planned on eating at Deluca's since we'd read that it was the best brunch spot in Pittsburgh. After seeing the line snaking around the block, I flippantly said, "I'd be fine eating some of those street tacos," and my bf quickly jumped at the opportunity to not have to wait in line for over an hour. Boy oh boy were we happy we changed our plans. We each had one carnitas (pork) taco and one chicken taco. They were succulent and amazing. I loved how the tacos had more toppings than the usual street tacos--cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. I especially enjoyed the tomatillo salsa as well. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Reyna's will be my first stop.
