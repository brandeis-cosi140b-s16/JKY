A family owned, neighborhood restaurant with the tastiest Mexican food. My wife has a gluten allergy and Rosavio makes anything for her.  In fact, he will make whatever you want. The menu is primarily seafood oriented (ceviche is awesome) but we order whatever we are in the mood for. The rice is unbelievable, apparently a family recipe made by his wife. Chips and salsa made there are yummy. All of the food is super flavorful. We visit them once a week.
