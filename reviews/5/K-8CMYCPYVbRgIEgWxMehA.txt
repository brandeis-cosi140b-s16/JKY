I'm writing my review while stuffing my face with an ENORMOUS platter of nachos.   My battery is almost dead but I had to check in and tell you YUM. I'm a long time fan if this place and was heartbroken when it closed.   Ecstatic when a new owner took it over and they reopened. BETTER THAT EVER!  I had a taste of the spicy chicken and FELL IN LOVE.  For dinner I ordered the spicy chicken quesadilla's.   I'm so thankful for to go boxes. EAT HERE!
