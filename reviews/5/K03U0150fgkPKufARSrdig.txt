Love this place. As a vegetarian I order a very specific order, and really hate when places accidentally put meat in my order or mess it up. At Taco Bell, that has only happened once, and I have gone there to eat nearly every day since I started school in early August. 

The food is always really good. I know a lot of people get on Taco Bell's food, but I love it and this is probably the Taco Bell I've seen that does it the best, and I've been to my fair share. 

The employees are always really nice and talkative. When you are there late at night/early in the morning, you see that they have to deal with a lot of belligerent, often drunk, people. As a former fast food worker, specifically one who worked late into the night, I respect them for that. They handle and de-fuse situations correctly. 

Speaking of coming there at crazy hours, one of my favorite things about Taco Bell is the absolute craziness that ensues in there. It's like some kind of convention center; it is amazing how many college students can amass in one taco joint at 2 in the morning. It's probably not the greatest thing to work through, but it makes going to a fast food place an event rather than an endeavor to relieve hunger, and that's pretty cool.
