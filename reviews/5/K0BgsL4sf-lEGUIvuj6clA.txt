I love coming here on Sunday's or Monday's. The crowd is pretty relaxed, and it's a good place to go catch up with friends and relax. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu (my personal favorite is Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla). Highly suggest the Big Azz Margarita, but if tequila isn't your thing, try the sangria.
