My search for the best Mexican food in Las Vegas is over!  Friends introduced us to Leticia's last Saturday and we will be forever grateful to them.  The menu is amazing with a nice balance of traditional and contemporary dishes.  The chips are fresh and very tasty and they are accompanied by a couple of different salsas and a warm bean dip giving everyone something to enjoy.  The house Magurita was reasonably priced and enjoyable to taste.  For my entre' I ordered the beef enchiladas and I thoroughly enjoyed them!  If you order a combo, be sure to ask for the white rice instead of the traditional Mexican rice with tomato sauce.  I have never had anything like it in my life.  It is delicious! Our server was attentive and made sure we were happy throughout our dining experience.  I plan on visiting often.  Leticia's is a treasure!!
