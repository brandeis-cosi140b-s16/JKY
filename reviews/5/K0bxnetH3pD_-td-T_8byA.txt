After a long, tough, tiresome, frustrating day of air travel, we had a forced layover in Phoenix. The layover hotel didnt have a full service restaurant. The front desk rep recommended we go to Mill Street, which is 2 miles away and full of restaurants, shops, etc.

We wanted something not too divvy and bar like (the university is nearby, so there are many of these places), and not upscale. We decidedjjjkl to eat at Z Tejas, right off of Mill Street. Beautiful looking place, fun, inviting. Z Tejas has outdoor patio seating, complete with heat lamps. We decided to sit inside. Upon entering the crescent main doorway you encounter a huge bar, cathedral ceilings, fun music, cool mod lighting, lively, beautiful inviting mexican decor (not overly done) and plenty of seating. 

Bartender was totally cool and friendly. I had a Chipoltle Margarita (for those of you who like it spicy. Literally! complete with a red hot pepper as the garnish.). After I drank 1/2 of it, I asked the bartender if he could 'tone it down' a bit, which he did gladly, and shook me up another full (milder) drink. Impressive.

Seating was quick. Our waiter, Jay, was attentive, a bit snarky but knowledgeable and edgy. We liked him. We didn't want to order full meals, and were more interested in just drinks and a few appetizers. He recommended the Street Tacos and Chile Verde, which we now HIGHLY recommend! The food was beyond good. So flavorful, and seriously enough for 2 people to share (we started with their famous homemade cornbread, that came in a black skillet, the size of a small dessert plate. More than enough!)  GREAT place to dine!
