Phenomenal lunch! Went in with a restaurant.com certificate and prices weren't bad. Had: chile verde which was  tangy and had just the right amount of spice, queso and guacamole appetizers, California chicken enchiladas, steak tacos, and chicken quesadillas.  All were great and the service was the best we've had in a long time. Only bad part of the meal is that I'm stuffed! :)
