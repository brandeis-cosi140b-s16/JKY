I had written a review on this Restaurant, but for some reason it got deleted. I just want to say that they have genuine Mexican Food here!! Very fun and exciting environment. We decided to come here for a friends birthday party dinner. We were a party of 15 people, and I must say service was exceptional for a party of 15. I never had to ask for a refill because our server was very attentive. The food was delicious! Great portions for the price!
I recommend this Las Tarascas for all of my Mexican Food Lovers!
