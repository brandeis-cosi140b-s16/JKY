Fresh, melt in your mouth, tortillas are just the beginning of your culinary experience when you visit Verde.  Their Green Chile Pork is Full of rich Mexican flavors with every bite.  The staff was very willing to accommodate the pallet of each person in our party, which is a definite plus.  I highly recommend that you take the time to enjoy a meal at this fun establishment!!
