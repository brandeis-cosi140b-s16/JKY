Another Chipotle

Another place to fall back on when your original plans fall through (the wait was too long across the parking lot).
Another location in the strategic grid of quick bites that always satisfy the whole family.
Another chance to have a burrito with barbacoa, brown rice, pinto beans, corn and hot salsa, sour cream, and that's it.
Another chance for my wife to decide between a burrito or a veggie bowl.
Another change for my daughter to have three kids quesadillas.  Maybe she needs an adult meal.
Another chance to read about the most recent locally bought, sustainable purchasing plan off of a cup.
Another change to try and figure out what the black and white pictures mean, and to interpret the message behind the wood and metal sculptures.
Another opportunity to have a great meal.
