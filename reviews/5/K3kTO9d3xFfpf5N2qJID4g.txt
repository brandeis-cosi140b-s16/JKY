My favorite place to grab Mexican food.  Green chili is a little too mild but still my favorite chili in burros. The best green chili is at the Burger House in Miami, AZ.  Both restaurants, from what I hear have 'shared' recipes with some minor liberties. 
Tacos more often than not, are over cooked/burned shells, but still better than the competition.
Architecturally outdated interior but I think it's intentional.  Doesn't matter since I only order 'to go' here.
In the mafia, they call it 'made men',,,since they are family owned and operated, the younger staff are an entitled bunch, so don't expect to get personable service.
