I LOVE Mexican food, and am a true Mexican food snob.  Chevos only gets 4/5, due to inconsistency.

I have tried the carne asada fries.  Dayuum.  That's a LOT of food. Very tasty.

Bean and Cheese burritos are awesome, too. You would be surprised. You would think places like Filibertos would know how to make one. But the beans in their burritos have no flavor. Chevos are seasoned nicely.

I am all about chips and salsa. First trip, I ate in. The chips were very light, super crispy, and tasted like they just came out of the oil.  PERFECT!.  Every trip since then, the chips have been a HUGE let down. taste like typical imitation "in house" chips.

Overall, a very very good substitute for Filibertos ( which is over rated...and the one in awahtukee is horrible)

Edit- Had the carne asada fries again.  Holy smokes.
Also tried the carnitas burrito. EXCELLENT!!  It was actual carnitas..not just a dry pork chop cut up into cubes ( Filibertos down the street)

Edit #2 - I have updated to 5 stars! So yesterday, I ordered the Carne Asada fries..AGAIN..except this time I asked to have Carnitas on it instead.  YUMMM!!!!!
Papa's Carnitas are soooo good~!!!  I have also since tried the ground beef burrito. Also DELISH!!!!
