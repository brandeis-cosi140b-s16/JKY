Absolutely delicious! Been a Vegas local for 10 years and had never heard of this place until I came here for lunch with some coworkers.  Service was great and food was fabulous.  Guacamole was fresh and chips had great flavor.  Salsa they brought out was mediocre...definitely not made in house.  I ordered the chimichurri steak salad.  Steak was cooked perfectly and everything had amazing flavor, just a tad heavy in the raw onions however.
