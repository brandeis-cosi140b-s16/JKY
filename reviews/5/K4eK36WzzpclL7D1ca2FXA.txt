Quick, cheap, and tasty burros (aka burritos)

I had a red machacha (shredded beef) burro to go. Which is machacha with red chile, beans, and cheese. I like the simplicity of the burrito and ate it entirely. The chile marinade is has a great taste so you don't need to add any salsa or anything else. Beef was tender. Be sure to use a plate as stewed juices comes out as you bite. And its wrapped in paper - could be cleaner with foil.
