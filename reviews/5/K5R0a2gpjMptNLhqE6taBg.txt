Have never written a review but have to say that in just one visit we're already declaring it the most authentic, fresh, made from scratch, satisfying meal we've experienced among all the best Mexican food places we frequent. So we had to share a review with you. We also met owner Gustavo and family and saw the passion for what they're doing. Cool.

So listen up. If you live in Arcadia, PV, Central Scottsdale or north Tempe, go there soon and support the kind of food we had, which included a savory, lean Pibil, a crunchy/tangy Tinga Chicken Torta w Caesar and...the best shrimp tacos of all time. Oh and Beans that stayed hot and Rice that could only come from a homemade recipe. And did I mention the full bar and 7a weekend morning opening?
