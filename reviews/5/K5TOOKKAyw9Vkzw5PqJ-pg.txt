Came here with me and my 2 friends we instantly were seated. Sat down the food runner brought us chips, beans & salsa the beans were good the salsa good but a little bit to spicey for me. On yelp if you check in you get a free margarita it was delicious.  I ordered the 2 shredded beef tacos (comes with rice and beans) everything was delightful!  Also a mixed coctel the shrimp, ocotopus and oysters yum! The preparada and the coronarita perfect!  My friends scarfed down there food so overall wonderful Mexican food with good prices we never had to asl for anything.  Our waiter was on it!
