OK, so this place is my all time favorite taco place EVER! The food is amazing. Once you actually get it. The ONLY downfall is the HUGE ASS LONG LINE! There's one person cutting and serving the meats. Completely inefficient. It literally takes an hour to get your food if it's busy. Which I have never been there when it's not. The mulas are to die for though! The carne asada, cabeza, and lengue tacos are good, but the buche is amazing! So having to stand in line is definitely worth it, but aggravating none the less. And I'll definitely be back. Usually once a week. Yes, it's THAT good! Just wish it wasn't so aggravating standing in line forever and trying to get a table.
