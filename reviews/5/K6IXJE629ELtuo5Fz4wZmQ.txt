We live up in the valley and for the past four years we venture over to Evas for my daddy's birthday celebration after he sky dives. 
The food is AMAZING!!! The SERVICE on Nov. 29th, for our large party of 18, was EXCEPTIONAL! 
I cant understand anyone giving lower than 5 stars.  We've just never been disappointed. (must be the competition)
My dad did leave his hearing aid down there.  I called and got Mariah on the phone.  She was wonderful.  They ended up finding it the next day.  We are SO APPRECIATIVE to her for letting us know it had been found.  Thank you and honestly, we just need to come down there and enjoy your food more than once a year.
