This place is great. We've been to plenty of places for tortas but this place is amazing.

Their portions aren't as big as other locations but the food is delicious. The Cubana with extra carne asada is to die for. The little sauce that they give with the food is simply amazing. They also have bread such as empanadas which are great as well. 

Def recommend if you are looking for good food.
