We love coming here!!  We sit on the patio which is quiet and peaceful. Happy hour is 2-5 and margaritas are 2 for 1, even on the patio. 

The service is great. Everyone is really friendly and attentive. 

Food is good and I love the bean dip they serve with salsa and chips when you sit down.  The nachos are amazing. They are multilayered and covered with toppings. Everything we have had has been great. 

No complaints from me, which is rare ;)
