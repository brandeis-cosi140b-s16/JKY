Love this place, every time I go to Vegas I make a point of stopping here to eat. Best guacamole I've ever had. Burritos and quesadillas are also so delicious and these new potato and jalape√±o balls. Plus you can't beat the price and the staff are super friendly. Definitely recommend going here if you're on Fremont Street!
