This place replaced another Mexican Food spot a few weeks ago now and I'm very glad it did.  The place is similar to a Cafe Rio or Chipotle model of ordering. You first pick your dish then follow it down the line to customize it as you wish.  There's three things that stood out to me the couple times I've been here.  The first was the very energetic and quick footed staff. They are all smiling and seem to be happy to see the customers lining up and making them run up and down the line.  The second is the time factor, I like most people that will visit this place on a weekday for lunch work or spend a lot of time downtown.  So I need to be in and out pretty fast to be able to enjoy my meal and get back to work or finish any other errand before my lunch hour is up.  Since they hustle and  move and also have a menu that for the most part is pretty standard it allows me to get in and out in under 6 or 7 minutes even when the line has been 3 or 4 customers deep.  The 3rd and final is of coarse THE FOOD.  I've been here 4 times and haven't tried the entire menu but so far the chicken and steak have been satisfying and left me wanting more!  Give it a try!
