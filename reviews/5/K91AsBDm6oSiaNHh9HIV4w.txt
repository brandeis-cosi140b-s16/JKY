I've been searching the valley for three years now to find some amazing mexican that tastes like home.  After Bisteces turned Cuban, I was certain Fiesta Burrito in South Scottsdale was the best the valley could do (still go there).  I was wrong.  This place is an old Taco Bell (+ 3pts right there), they take cash only, and you won't even need a lot of it!  The tacos are huge, the cheese is not cheddar, the green sauce is perfect, the carne asade doesn't have any suspicious chunks, and their beans are even amazing!  It's a hidden gem that hits the spot every time; if you're from California, you'll definitely appreciate it.
