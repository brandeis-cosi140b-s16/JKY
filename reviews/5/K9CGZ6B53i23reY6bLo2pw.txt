I first went to Pepe's when my buddies from the dorms at ASU would hit up a different Mexican place every Friday night. We tried to pick ones on various 'best of Phoenix' lists, and that's how we ended up at Pepe's.

Pepe's is in kind of an out-of-the-way part of central Phoenix. But if you're anywhere close, it's well worth the stop.

The chicken mole enchiladas I got were smothered in the best mole sauce I've ever had, and my wife's carnitas in green chile sauce were equally amazing. The refried beans were good enough to finish, a rarity for any Mexican restaurant.

Adding to the great experience, the service was upbeat and friendly--our server was as excited about the menu items as he was about the Suns' winning streak--and a hearty dinner for two rang up just over $20.
