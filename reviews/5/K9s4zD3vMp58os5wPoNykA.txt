Excellent food, although I didn't get a Mexican dish. I got the salmon which was delicious. Service was excellent! It was a bit noisy, but that is typical for restaurants on the strip in the evening. Also, very pricey! I actually wanted a cheese quesadilla, but it was 16 bucks! Got the salmon meal for a few bucks more.
