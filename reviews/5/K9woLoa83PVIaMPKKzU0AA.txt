This place is the bomb!  Anyone who says the food isn't great doesn't know Mexican food!  My husband is from Mexico and his mom cooks food to die for.  He says that this is the first restaurant to give her competition (and on a couple items it wins!!! Like the chili rellenos) I like it because its clean and nice.  All of the staff is awesome too!  We live in LA, a mexican food mecca, and we can't wait to go back to Vegas and go to El Patron for their fabulous, muy sabroso food!  My mouth is watering just thinking of it!!
