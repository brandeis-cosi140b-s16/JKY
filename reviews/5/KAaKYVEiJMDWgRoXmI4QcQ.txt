Rubio's is a real simple & straight to the point cantina style Mexican food restaurant. I've been a hand full of times & I haven't deviated from my house favorite the Atlantic salmon burrito. It's super fresh I wish is was bigger (because I'm fat and I could eat 2) sea food isn't always something you think of at a quasi fast food joint but the food quality is good. The salsa selection has a nice variance. My favorite is the roasted chipotle! 
Nice place to come during lunch breaks.
