It was recommended to us by a promoter of the music at the Watermelon Festival (thank you Warren!!!). We had 7 people and it was right at lunch time and they still got us in very quickly. Service was a bit slow but to be expected right smack in the middle of the festival. Tamales? AMAZING    and I'm not a fan of tamales unless they're homemade. Bartender was a hoot (Lulu you're the best) as was the waitress. Will definitely be back as often as we can, being as we have a 3 hour drive to get there.
