Macayo's is a lifetime favorite of mine. The quality of the food can overcome even the worst of a restaurant experience (which is usually beyond the control of any waitress or manager). Depot Cantina's environment sets it apart from other locations because of their pumping music and colorful decor. Don't expect an intimate dinner; this is the place for friends and family to celebrate and enjoy GREAT chips, salsa, and Mexican fare. Tip: Order anything that comes with Baja sauce. It's the best.
