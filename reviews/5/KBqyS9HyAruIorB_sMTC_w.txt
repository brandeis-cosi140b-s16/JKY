Ok, One reason I go here is for me wanting to eat other than steak for dinner sometimes Andale's food is a great place to always try something different that is always really good no matter what I chose. One of the best places to eat Spanish food is at this restaurant. It's definitely one of the best. This place I recommend to anyone who lives in Henderson NV to try out Andale's Restaurant which serves very good choices Of tasty foods From Mexico and El Salvador. The people there are really nice.  Just thinking about it makes me hungry. I for one , really like Spanish food. So this place gets 5 stars
