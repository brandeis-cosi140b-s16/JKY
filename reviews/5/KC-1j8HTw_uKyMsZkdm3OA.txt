Every time I'm in the area for some training I always make sure to hit this spot. They have excellent prices on their lunch specials, and I always make sure to get the shredded beef taco and enchilada lunch special.  The food portion is very generous and they don't skimp out on the cheese!  Parking can be a little tough but it's well worth it for this little hole in the wall!  *Beware they won't split your check for you at the table, but when you get up to pay your tab with the cashier, they'll be more than happy to assist you.
