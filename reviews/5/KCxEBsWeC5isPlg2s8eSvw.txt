Alright, this place has been working it's way into my heart all summer. Finally, I have to admit this is my favorite Mexican spot in all of Las Vegas. 

I drool over the steak thats marinated in salsa, the beans and salsa they bring to every table, the margaritas oh boy I'm getting brain freeze just thinking about it...I never had bad service or even a bad thing off the menu. This place is amazeballs.

I am so happy I have found you, Viva! :) BESOS
