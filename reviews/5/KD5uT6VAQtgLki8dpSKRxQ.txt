I had superior service from Erica tonight, and my cheese enchiladas with the tomatillo sauce were how I remembered them from years ago when I would come to RM.  The same great salsa recipe and chips will have you coming back to try things like the pipian chicken----at least that's how it worked for me over the years.  I just moved nearby, so RM is sure to become a regular stop for me again...
