This is the BEST mexican in Charlotte. We have tried a few. More than a few. And this is hands down the best. It is a little dive-y but thats what makes it great. Ask for Carolina. She's the most amazing, sweetest waitress. And get the salsa verde (it's free! just ask!) - its an avocado based salsa that will blow your mind.
