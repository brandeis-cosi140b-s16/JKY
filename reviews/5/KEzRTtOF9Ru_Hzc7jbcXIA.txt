I've been eating at the LA Frontera truck since 1997. Back then, it was parked a block North of its current location. I fell in love w the carne asada tacos and Ive eaten there regularly ever since. No..its not sketchy like other reviewers say...just regular people. It helps if you speak Spanish but there's always an English speaking worker on site if you need help ordering. Love this place
