This place is AMAZING! the food came out incredibly fast and was delicious! Portions were HUGE and the entire staff was friendly and outgoing. There was even one guy who just walked around making sure people didn't need anything and enjoyed the food that they ordered. The free chips and salsa come with three different salsas and they were all pretty great. If you are in Zion, don't leave without eating here!
