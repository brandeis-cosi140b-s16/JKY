Went in today for lunch for the first time and was helped at the counter by the owner. Great guy that ran me through the menu, all the specials and even caught I am in the military and offered me a free drink. I went with his recommendation of a chicken burrito with guac and pico which was fantastic. Horchata was very good as were the beans and rice.

Highly recommend for great food, great service and very military friendly. Place was packed and had a lot of regulars that knew the owner and the owner knew them.
