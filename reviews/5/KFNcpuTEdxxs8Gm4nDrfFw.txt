Ugh, why did I wait 15 years to go here? First I had to avoid eating the chips and salsa, which were good, but not why I came here. I had the Del Rey -- ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce and a "smear" of refried beans. Unbelievably tasty, just a little bit of heat. A wonderful brioche-type bun. Phenomenal taste and a helluva value at $9.99, especially since I could only eat half in one sitting. LEFTOVERS!!!
