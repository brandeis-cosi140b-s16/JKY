I love this place! I eat there at night, for lunch, when i'm too lazy to cook, when i have a group of friends who don't have much money to spend on food, and for any occassion that someone in my group is craving mexican food!  Roberto's is the best at night when you're drunk or really tired of course but then, what food isn't better when you're drunk? lol I am addicted to their chicken chimichanga combination plate with an horchata.  Their rolled tacos are good too. Btw, what the other review said about horchata being good after drinking or for a hang-over is true.  It's soothing for your stomache.

I like Roberto's better than any nice mexican restaurant I've been to... maybe with the exception of a few in mexico. lol
