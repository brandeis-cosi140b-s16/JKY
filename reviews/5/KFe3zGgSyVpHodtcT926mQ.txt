I really like this place. Clean and friendly service.  No small tacos here! They use full size tortillas. I had chicken tacos and they were really good. The meat was juicy and nicely seasoned. They keep it simple too, onions, tomatoes and cilantro. They also have a salsa bar. Their roasted veggie salsa is rad. I'd definitely come back.
