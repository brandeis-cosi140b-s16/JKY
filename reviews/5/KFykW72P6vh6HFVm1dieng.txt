I love this spot! My favorite place for Mexican food in town. It's at the Hard Rock, so that's a plus right there. You gotta love seeing C-list celebs stumbling around town, and Pink Taco has them from time to time.

Great spot for Happy Hour. I always suck down a few margaritas or beers and usually go for the chicken nachos. A big plate of sloppy nachos piled with toppings. And my favorite part of the nachos..... the liquid cheese. Gotta love the liquid cheese. Some other favorites are the shrimp tacos and the burrito mojado. Good stuff!
