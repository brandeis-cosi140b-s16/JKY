We came on a Saturday at 10 for their all you can eat tappas brunch. Now all I can think about is going back! We had a reservation and were seated a few minutes after they opened. Our server was one of the best servers I have ever had somewhere. While we were looking at the brunch menu, she suggested she could just get us started by ordering a few items while we decided specific items we wanted. A few minutes later our came the items she selected and ever dish was better than the last. When we ordered more, she got thm out timely and even brought some on her own. When we said we were full, she told us to sit a few minutes so we could make room for more! We never felt rushed or like we ordered to much which is the case so many times when it is all you can eat. 

All the food was amazing. The most memorable was the has with fried egg. The meat was so flavorful I could have eaten this alone and given the restaurant 5 stars. I also loved the shrimp and grits, french toast, and pork belly with waffle. They kept our drinks full and took away plates that were empty quickly. This will be a regular stop on every Vegas trip from now on. I can't wait to try "regular' menu items because if you can get that many dishes right, then the other stuff has to be good!
