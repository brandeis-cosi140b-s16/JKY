Yet another eatery I've put off trying for way too long! With a name that doesn't dissapoint this gourmet taco shop is appealing on the outside, and warm and welcoming on the inside. Seating is tight and scarce, so arrive early and be prepared to make new friends. My favorite part about this place aside from the food, is the salsa bar... who knew that many salsas even existed? I ordered the El Gaucho burro, packed full of marinated steak, then topped with avocado, cucumber, and chimichurri sauce which gave the burrito a crisp flavor. I then proceeded to drench it in chipotle salsa from the salsa bar! The horchata here is to die for, made fresh and topped with walnuts and sliced fruit! For the price, you'll be hardpressed to find an authentic Mexican meal this good anywhere else!
