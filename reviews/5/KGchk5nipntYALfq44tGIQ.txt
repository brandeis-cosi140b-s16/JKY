Absolutely amazing! Chips and salsa are amazing! I had a wet burrito with shredded chicken and I have had many of these in my life by far one of the best! Didn't realize what treasure was so close to our house! Boyfriend had the grilled chicken chimichanga he loved it! He's planning on going back tomorrow to try the Hawaiian menu they have. Really amazing restaurant!
