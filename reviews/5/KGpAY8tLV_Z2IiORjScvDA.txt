If you are in Mesa, Arizona (first, slow down, they have those &*^%^& cameras that take your picture as you speed through town) and you are in the mood for Mexican, this is the place to go.  I had the chicken Mole and it was wonderful.   It was think and full of flavor.  The chips/salsa was great too.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.   The margaritas were good too.   I highly recommend this place.   Just avoid the speed traps on the way to it.   Personally, I try to avoid Arizona altogether.   However, when I cannot, and I'm around Mesa, I love this place.
