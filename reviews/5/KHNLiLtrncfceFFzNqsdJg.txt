We've been coming here since it was Guadalajara. Granted, the food here isn't going to change the world. My husband and I are vegetarian, and we pretty much order the same thing - the Spinach Enchiladas - and they are always tasty. What sets this apart for us is the service. The wait staff nearly always recognizes us, as does the hostess who is usually there. One of our waiters even remembered our order after we hadn't been there for a couple of months (travelling over the summer). That kind of friendly atmosphere is a rare find, especially in a busy casino restaurant, and that goes a long way with me!
