I posted a comment before but it is not here. Interesting... I wanted to share how much I like store. I had never been to ATS before this visit. I order the chicken burrito regularly. It is always so fresh and tasty. Literally my favorite item on the menu. The guacamole and beans are GREAT! I mix them together for a special dip! It is great for my chips and burrito! The staff is GREAT!! The night manager, Robert, is so friendly! He always greets me when I arrive with a smile. I hold customer service in high regard and this place ha got it! Thank you for the food and service ATS!  By the way, not as big of a fan of the smaller version. Not enough space in my opinion. This one had plenty! Very much liked that!
