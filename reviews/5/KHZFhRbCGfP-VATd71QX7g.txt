Thank you Man Vs. Food for introducing us to this place. This was our first dinner stop on our little vacation in Phoenix. Be forewarned this place does not have any curbside appeal, and we actually ran into some shady people on the way in. But the appeal is in those huge tortas. We opted for the original Del Rey torta and an amazing Aguas Frescas and Pina Colada. The drinks are HUGE! The tortas are even bigger. The only down side is their Ruffle-like side of chips they serve. I mean can't we at least get some tortilla chips or something. Throw us a bone here.

Other than those horrible chips, everything else is amazing. The flavor of meat in the torta is unbelievable. And make sure to order an Aguas Frescas. So refreshing and so ginormous. Try this place if your are in AZ. It is a must!
