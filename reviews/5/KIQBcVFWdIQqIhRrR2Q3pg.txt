Phenomenal! The Vegas location is just as good as the San Diego location, and the guy who took my order was terrific (so nice and happy that I knew about the SD location)! The adobada sopes are superbly delicious! The spices and sauces they use for their meat are different from every other Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to. It's pure deliciousness in each bite! Also, eating here won't hurt your wallet at all!

That all being said, there is one thing I can't stand about Tacos El Gordo...and that's that there isn't one in Phoenix!! I woud be the first to jump on that ship if it ever set sail! 

Go eat here, people!!!

To quote Tracy Jordan from 30 Rock...

I want to take Tacos El Gordo behind the middle school and get it pregnant.
