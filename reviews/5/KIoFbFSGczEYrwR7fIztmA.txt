Food is amazing here. I ran into this place by accident and figured what the hell let's give it a shot! I was not sorry!! We get greeted by who I think was the owner and get seating almost immediately. Super nice servers took our order and has chips salsa beans and guacamole within a minute! Food was fresh and tasted amazing!! If yoy come Saturday or Sunday come early and try their menudo!!! Outside of my mother's menudo this is the best I've ever had!! Over all great place! Definitely my new place to come when I'm in Vegas.
