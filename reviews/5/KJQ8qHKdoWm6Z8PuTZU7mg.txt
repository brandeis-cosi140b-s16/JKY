My husband and I stopped in here the other day because we wanted some real Mexican food (we work in a Tex-Mex chain mexican restaurant) and we were pleasantly surprised! The food was amazing! I had the shrimp enchiladas and they were to die for! Big portions too! Small building but we had quick service and were very happy when we left. We will be returning!
