I've eaten here a lot over the years and it's always tasty. Fajitas are enough for lunch the next day and I enjoy trying the different kinds of margaritas. They also have a nice selection of salsas for the tortillas, so it's good when you're with others and everybody like something different. I used a free Yelp coupon here for dessert and had no problem. Just wish they were open for lunch, but I'm sure it's all about the foot traffic.
