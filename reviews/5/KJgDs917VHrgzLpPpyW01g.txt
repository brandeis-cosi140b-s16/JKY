Had breakfast here this morning and was a little worried since I loved Gallo Blanco and their migas dish. BUT...it was FANTASTIC!! THE breakfast burrito was excellent, eggs were creamy and it was the perfect size came with a side of avocado and a thick slice of watermelon. Fresh squeezed OJ was so sweet and delicious. Luz cold brew coffee made for really  a GREAT breakfast. My server Fuego was super cool and friendly. Highly recommend!!
