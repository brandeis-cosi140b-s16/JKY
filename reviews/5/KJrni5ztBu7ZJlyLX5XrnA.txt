I think this place is great, especially since the new owners took over.

Maria and Albino are almost always around to greet you and they're warm and friendly.

Good drink (GREAT MARGARITAS!) and very good traditional food. Big portions too for those of us getting tired a restaurants that treat Mexican food like it's nouvelle cuisine.

Great place.

Thanks guys.
