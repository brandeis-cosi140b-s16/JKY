I usually only read these things and don't post. However, this place is a little hole-in-the-wall delight! It's easy to look at this place and keep driving, however it truly is traditional Mexican food. The wife and I usually stop here 2-3 time a week and pick-up some machaca burritos, which never disappoint. This place definitely deserves more attention. The only problem I have is that the cashier is always someone new. Considering I have been coming here at least twice a week for the past 4-5 months makes this odd, especially because the girl behind the counter typically doesn't have a very good idea how to work the register (can never find the correct items). I also wish they had a tad bit more customer service skills. Although we come here for the great food so I suppose this is much of a deterrent, now is it?
