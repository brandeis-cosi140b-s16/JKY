Caminero replaced my favorite taco shop Bisteces a few years back, they changed the meat in the burrito and it wasn't quite as good, Bisteces probably had my favorite burrito and salsa ever.

Food - 4/5
Quality burrito, I get carne asada with avacado, cheese and sour cream and load up on the Tomatillo salsa which you can (and recommend you do) buy by the pint. You can tell when they get fresh made tortillas, the burritos are especially good on those days.

Service - 4/5
They get busy but the guys here are quick, helpful and polite.

Atmosphere - 3/5
If you eat at the restaurant it can get cramped I usually just grab a burrito and soda to go.

Price - 5/5
Cant beat a quality burrito for around $5.

Overall - Quick and delicious I'd recommend it to anyone.
