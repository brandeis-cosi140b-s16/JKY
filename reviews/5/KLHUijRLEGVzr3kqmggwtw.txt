I remember passing this place one day, and wondering 'what the heck is Mexican sushi?' I'm a huge sushi fanatic, so I was curious. It's different from the traditional sushi I am used to, but I love it.I always get the same roll and it's the kissi roll. It's like shimp tempura, but everything is fried and there's cream cheese in it. It's very good, and super fulfilling. And so cheap because you get huge pieces.

As the Mexico food, ahhhhhh. I love it, too. You start with complimentary chips and salsa, while waiting for your food to come. I usually order the same thing when I come here (I've been here numerous times), the carne asada fries. Hands down best ones I've tried. My boyfriend usually get the tacos, and the tortillas are hand-made so you know those are good. :) Their horchata is also tasty :)

Their customer service is good, too. We've gotten great service and sometimes they give us discounts and free stuff, too :)
