This review is LONG overdue. My friends and I went to Scottsdale in mid December and came across wadaa tacos. The owner told us it was their opening night at that location. We ordered a buncha carne asada tacos and they were incredibly delicious! So delicious that we went back the next night for more. They had very fresh toppings too. The guys that work there really know how to make authentic tacos and are very nice. I would go back every time I make a trip to Scottsdale
