OMG!!! Fantastic way to do a brunch!!! Sit at the bar and watch the awesome food being delivered to you. 
There was definitely a fun buzz about the place. And Jaclyn was a total blast. Even though she is 49ers fan, yuk!!! Go Hawks!!! Seriously place is great and the food is a 10+
My favorite was the steak and egg and my wife loved the pb and J biscuit. 10 out of 10, try it!!!!
