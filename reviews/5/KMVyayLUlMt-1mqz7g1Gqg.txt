Always excellent!  I travel for business frequently in this area, and I always make at least one (or two!) stops here.  The staff is exceptionally friendly, food is fresh and delicious, and Kevin will make you an amazing margarita fresca while you wait.  Recommend the table side guacamole and the sopa de Cameron-- the house special chicken and rice is also delicious (and big!).

Highly recommended.  A++
