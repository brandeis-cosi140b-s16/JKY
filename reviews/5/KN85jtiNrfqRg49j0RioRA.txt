Im not easily impressed .... BUT!!!! wow!!! this place surprised me !!! Amazing!
Friend told me about this place n just went because I was in the area and hungry ... But what an delicious surprise it was!!! Really felt like I took a flavor trip to Mexico ! The flavors are alive and kicking! The tacos are fantastic , yes , but the salsa verde is to die for and even the beans ... Tasted amazing!!! The guy behind the counter was really passionate and friendly ! We're hooked ! Can't wait to go back for more ! Not just another taco place in vegas ! It seems to me like this could potentially be THE taco place in vegas !
