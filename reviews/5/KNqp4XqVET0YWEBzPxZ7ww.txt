Found this place by accident while looking for somewhere to eat after The Color Run. The shopping mall where it's located has much to be desired but we were willing to brave it in exchange for authenticity. We were afraid they wouldn't allow us in because we were covered in color but were glad they let us stay and wash up a bit. 
At first we were not impressed when they brought us our complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were thick and hard and the salsa was very watery. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and my husband ordered the carne asada burrito. We shared 2 cheese pupusas. The enchilada was the best I ever had! The shrimp were abundant and so flavorful. The rice and beans were perfect! I barely had room to eat the pupusa but it was delicious, too. My husband said his meal was also surprisingly good. And the best part was that it cost just over $20 WITH tip!
We will definitely be going back frequently for some good, authentic Mexican/Salvadorean food,
