We love this place. All the food has great flavor, but my personal favorite is one pork enchilada with green sauce and a short rib enchilada with red sauce with lots of pickled onions and cabbage slaw on top. We have two young children and it is their favorite place. They get to watch their food being prepared, don't have to wait for the food, and all of the staff are super friendly and helpful. We like it enough that we have brought out of town guests too.
