you have GOT to try this place!!   hands down the best mango salsa of your LIFE!!   i always get the tropical pork tacos, flour tortilla, with mango salsa, lettuce, cilantro, and baja sauce.  seriously, a fiesta in your mouth.   chips and salsa come on the side, but they aren't that great and often way to salty.   regardless, i still eat here about 1-2 times a week!!   They are a bit pricey but it's definitely worth it.  as a med student at Midwestern University up the street, it's the place to go for lunch, and they give a student discount (just what i'm looking for!!).   I'm not a huge fan of their burritos, but they are about as big as your head and super filling.  my complaint is that they are watery and often fall apart, but the taste is phenomenal!  I've tried all of the meats on selection there and the pork is by far the best!   however, all of them are good and taste extremely fresh and succulent.   seriously eat here and you won't regret it, it's unique and unlike any other burrito shop you'll find in west valley/glendale.
