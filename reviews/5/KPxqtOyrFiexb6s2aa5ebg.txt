Food was fantastic! We were there on Taco Tuesday and the tacos and sides were $2.00 each. Our group tried mahi mahi, pork, chicken, & shredded beef tacos. All were excellent! The beef torta was also great. One of the best we've had. The sides were also very yummy! Beans & rice had a lot of flavor. They offer a side called smashed potatoes. They were really good and very filling!
Our waitress was very attentive and the ambiance was really fun. Loved how the place was decorated. And the restrooms were very clean.
