BYOB!! Okay let me put it down plain and simple Yelpers! Flame broiled and smoke meats makes this place authentic street style tacos like you would taste in Los Angeles. Yeah the beans and rice are 50% but please understand that beans and rice are nothing more than fillers in Mexican food. This place is all about tacos but it serves a wonderful full flare of dinner plates like Chili Rellenos,Pollo Adobado,Fajitas,Mojarra Frits! This place has the pork,chicken & beef grilled marinated and pulled and It tries to cover all bases and does a good job! Eddie the cook was friendly and funny and hopes the neighbors don't complain because he smokes the meat out back. BYOB! That's  right you can bring your own beer and if you forget you have Valley fair liquors next-door!
