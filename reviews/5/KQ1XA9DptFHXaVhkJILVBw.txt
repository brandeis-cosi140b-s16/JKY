Been a regular for some time but just realized I've never actually given a review.  Carlito's is a local favorite of mine and for whatever reason, my co-workers disagree.  I personally think anybody who doesn't appreciate this place is just so confused by commercialized "Mexican food" that they lack an ability to appreciate something new and moreover, authentic.  I've spent a lot of time in New Mexico and have never been able to find an establishment outside of the Land of Enchantment offering fare equally fresh & unique.  Low & behold, Carlito's is here to save the day!  I no longer have to drive 8 hours to find a place that knows what "Christmas tree" really means.  I no longer have to get on a plane to find an Indian Taco or Tortilla Burger.  I can get my fix on Route 66 right here in Vegas!  If you're expecting Taco Bell "Mexican food" go home.   But if you want something fresh and high quality, give Carlito's a try.  Best "NEW Mexican Food" outside of New Mexico!
