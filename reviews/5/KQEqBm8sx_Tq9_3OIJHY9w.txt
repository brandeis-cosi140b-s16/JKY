If you are looking for Authentic Mexican Food this is your place.

Don't judge this place from the exterior view, once you get inside it is well lit, well air conditioned and great space. 

The service was great, quick, efficient and genuine.  

The salsa and pico were amazing, the best in town.  I had the chicken chimi with red sauce and rice and beans.  It was perfect! Couldn't beat it! perfect flavors and perfect spice.  

Great value for priced paid as well.  They have great lunch special and better happy hour specials.

I will be back!
