Experience:  Still looking for a great Mexican restaurant and saw this had stellar reviews on YELP, and invited friends to come try lunch with me.  

Facility: Do NOT be scared by the outside of this place. You step inside and feel very comfortable. It has about 12 tables and chairs, and the murals almost give it a Mexican Riviera feel.  

Service:  I was greeted by Berto. He was very friendly and super helpful. He told me how it was a family business and his mother did all the cooking. He pointed out his cousin too. It started to get busy, but he managed the crowd well as the only server. He did seem to get a little caught up chatting at a young gal's table a few times.  ;)

Food: when you check in, you get a few Horchata, which is a cinnamon sweet rice drink...it was very good, but a tad sweet for me. 
Since there were 6 of us, Berto suggested the giant mixed platter for 4. He said to substitute with a few appetizers, which we chose Shrimp Empanadas, and Ceviche at his suggestion. 
The ceviche was a huge portion and was very delicious. The shrimp empanadas were good, but I filled up on one. Should have saved more room for the seafood platter.  
The platter was amazing. There was plenty for 4 people...could have fed 6!  I liked everything I tasted on it. It had several kinds of shrimp, clams, crab legs, scallops, imitation crab, and fish. I think the fried fish was my favorite, but all of it was amazing!!!!!!
Also, I have to give a shout out to the homemade corn tortillas, the tasty tortilla chips, the salsa, and the best was the green sauce on the side. We asked for a 5 out of 10 and it was nice and spicy, and had a great citrus flavor. I loved this sauce!!!

Overall:  now, this is my favorite Mexican place in Las Vegas. I will definitely be back. 
Thanks for everything Berto!!!!
