This is one of my favorite healthy mexican restaurants.  I love it as much as Chipotle.  

I try to eat healthy, and Cafe Rumba's tropical salad is one of the healthiest and yet delicious items on the menu.  

They do get busy during lunch due to folks from the university and Honeywell, and sometimes in the evenings there can be long lines as well.  

I try to go there to eat once per week, since the food is so healthy and delicious, and of course affordable.
