One of the Valley's best taco and burrito shop. Not only are they all over the Valley but they are open late!

My favorites are the carnitas burrito and the beef tacos!  I hear they have other tasty eats on the menu although I've honestly never tried anything else. I'm too satisfied with my dual favorites thus far. 

The salsa bar is great and the pickled veggies rock!  Go hungry!

I find that they have 'gringo' friendly service.
