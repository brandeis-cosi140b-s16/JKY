I visited here on the recommendation of the guys at my pool supply store that I frequent.  And I am truly glad I did.  Of course, now I wish there was a Bueno Burger on my side of town!

I am not sure exactly what I was expecting when I walked in and I will admit to being a little biased and influenced against restaurants that have spanish in their title because in my head I end up comparing them to "Humbertos" or "Filibertos" or one of the thousands of mom & pop taco shops that are all over the valley.  Bueno Burger is NOTHING like them.  Bueno Burger is quite simply a clean, modern and classy take on burgers with a mexican edge.  Damn tasty!  I got a Bueno Burger and ordered "Bueno" style and it was loaded with homemade guacamole, onions, and just delicious all the way around. 

I am making it a point to bring my family sometime so they can try it too.  Even the french fries were winners!  Golden brown, crispy...delicious.  

Prices were very reasonable for a good, tasty burger.  Not greasy, cooked perfect, just a classic case for giving them five stars.  In fact when they brought it out to my table, I remember thinking this is how the burgers look in the other restaurants PICTURES.  But this one actually looked awesome for real!  I took a picture in fact and will be uploading it.

Bueno Burger - thanks for tasty food and keep up the quality!!  And hey, how about opening in Surprise, AZ?
