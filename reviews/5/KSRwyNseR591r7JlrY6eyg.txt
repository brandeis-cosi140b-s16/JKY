Come get some of this Mexican goodness! I just finished my taco and peppers and I already can't wait to eat more. 

Note to you anal, debit card carrying people. CASH ONLY. That's how we do here in Little Mexico.

Small tacos are $1.50. Grownup size tacos are $2.50. He also cooks chimichangas, taquitos and fish tacos which are not on the menu. My boss said the fish taco was lightly battered and seasoned to perfection. She even liked it better than a taco shop that rhymes with Poopios. I had the large Carne Asada Taco which was fresh and delicious and had no grizzle and included large slices of avocado. 

The star for me is the hot sauces and the grilled peppers. I tried both sauces: RED which had a smoky hint to it and also the GREEN which tasted clean and not metallic like some do. Now to the effin peppers. He seasoned them with Lemon Pepper and I didn't pay attention to what else and then grills them. They are huge, warm, sweet and full of heat and flavor. I just want to order ten of those bad boys!  What I did was take the guts out of my taco and stuffed them in the peppers. Buh damn!

Did I mention he has his liquor license and clean, little tables set outside and a boom box? Yeah, I think I am changing my name to Hi-me and growing a stache like a true Ranchero in honor of Chuy, Three Amigos and Machete.
