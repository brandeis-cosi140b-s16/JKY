One of my favorite places for happy hour in old town! 

My boyfriend and I come all the time. Their cornbread is to die for. Seriously it's the best corn bread in all the land (or at least this side of the Mississippi). 

We always split the Tejas Trio and a side southwestern Caesar salad. Service is always great and we love to sit on the patio. We tend to usually have the same server as well who recognizes us every time which is another plus. 

Also, their strawberry mojito deserves 5 stars on it's own. Sadly, it's not part of their happy hour menu but still freaking delicious!
