I loved this place. I got a burrito with shredded beef, and it was delicious. The beef was juicy and flavorful, and the salsa was spicy and mouth-watering. The rice was pretty good, it was not dry at all (one of my pet peeves). The chips were just okay, but the salsa was good enough to make up for it.
I loved how cheap the margaritas were, too- and they were really good margaritas! My husband and I loved this place, if we lived closer, it could be a dangerous thing!
