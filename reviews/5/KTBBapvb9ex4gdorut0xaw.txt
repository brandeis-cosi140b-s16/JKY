My family and I moved from San Jose CA last summer and was looking for a good authentic Mexican joint. We tried so many places and none were authentic; all Americanized. We were so happy when Gordo's opened. Went there Grand Opening and since then we go every weekend and sometimes during the week for dinner. Frank (owner) treats us like family; well they actually all treat us like family. This is what you call REAL Mexican food!!!!!
