First of all you know its legit Mexican food if they bring you hot chips and salsa before you order ..mmmmm... Menu is very simple and great pricing... MONDAY 50% off for locals... Yes!! The margaritas are amazing unlike most places... the tequila hits ya like a brick wall! In a good way! Food was amazing! Presented well and very clean! Although the location is a bit of a downer.... (Beside a strip club).... New Monday spot !
