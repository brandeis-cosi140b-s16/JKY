Loved the specials and service! My husband and I decided to stop in for a quick bite and some margaritas yesterday for happy hour and the specials were outstanding! My margarita was $3 and the nachos we shared were HUGE and only $7! Our waitress was Amy and she went out of her way to explain the specials and what the restaurant was all about since this was our first visit. She compared the restaurant to Rocky Point in Mexico, and surely the atmosphere resembled it. It was refreshing to receive quality service, enjoy fresh food, and not pay a penny over $20 at the same time! Will return soon!!
