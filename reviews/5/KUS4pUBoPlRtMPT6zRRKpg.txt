Carne asada is OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. We live about 20 min from Asadero Torro which, for most people in Phoenix, is way too far to drive for a hole in the wall restaurant, but it's totally worth it!

Atmosphere is the only thing that keeps this place from being 5 stars for me. (Plastic tables and chairs, plastic trays and cups for food and drinks.) 

UPDATE: I visited Asadero Toro today to enjoy my new favorite menu item - the mini carne asada quesadillas. ::drool:: I was impressed to see that it's in what appears to be the end-stages of a great remodel! The plastic tables and chairs have been replaced with "real" dining furniture! It feels very upgraded and the atmosphere is miles ahead of what it used to be. I've changed my rating to 5 stars!
