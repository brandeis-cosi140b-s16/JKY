Chipotle. Fast. Healthy, or not (depending on what you're in the mood for). I love the consistency of service and quality across locations. I grew up in Colorado and have enjoyed many meals at the original location by the University of Denver. No matter what location visit, you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients. 

I was always a chicken burrito with extra rice, black beans, corn salsa, lettuce and cheese kind of gal. Most recently I've fallen in love with the salad. Romaine lettuce with all the burrito toppings you prefer. 

My latest creation is chicken, fajita veggies, pico de gallo, corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese, hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side. I take this creation home, put it in a big bowl, toss everything together and devour. The marinade from the chicken and the juices from the salsa and veggies create an awesome dressing. I dip my fork in the side of salsa and vinegarette before each bite, providing just the right amount of tang and spice. 

The combinations are endless. I dream of Chipotle.
