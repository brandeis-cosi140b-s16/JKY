Frank and Fina's is the best!  My favorites are: Shrimp Diablo, Chicken Chimichangas, Tacos Panuchas and the Fish Tacos.  My children love the Soups, Taquitos, Nachos (salsa on the side) and Quesadillas.  Although, it appears that the side portions are premeasured in the little bowl shaped shells for the beans and the round rice mound, the servings are quite generous and very filling!  The staff is very friendly and the service is fast and professional. I always get the feel that "Mi Casa es Su Casa" at Frank and Fina's.
