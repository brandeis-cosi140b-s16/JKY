No fault of the restaurant more than bad parents, but there was a screaming brat which wasn't controlled and that made for a loud experience. 

For a veggie burrito, had great flavor and decent size for the price.  Would go again to try something else. Eagerly awaiting more on the menu as the place grows in popularity.
