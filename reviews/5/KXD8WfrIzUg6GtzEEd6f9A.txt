Sunday afternoon late lunch...tried a couple fo the new taco offerings from the newly redesigned menu.  I had the pick 2 taco for $7.99 plate with Achiote Chicken (it had grilled pineapple and a delicious dipping sauce) and the Southwest Chicken which was okay, not a whole lot of flavor.  He had a enchilada platter and was pleased with it.

The Achiote Chicken will be a repeat choice and the salsa and chips are my fav of the chain restaurants.  Great service, quiet afternoon crowd and a overall enjoyable experience for right at $20 for 2.
