OMG... I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Taquitos Jalisco yet.  Talk about oversight... 

Taquitos Jalisco is the BEST place to get taquitos... in the world.  I say that from a position of authority.  I've tried taquitos far and wide... all around the world.  The perfection of Taquitos Jalisco has yet to be matched.  They are crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and smothered in sour cream and guac... just the way they should be.  The plate also has the BEST rice and beans (ok, the rice is good but the beans are the best) and a small side salad... you know, so you get your greens in. haha  Eat the salad, it's good for you. 

Aside from the excellent taquitos, they also have great shrimp dishes.  And the staff there is always friendly.  The only thing I'll say is they get really busy sometimes so plan ahead. 

Tip - If you're ordering the taquitos, make sure they don't give you the combo #1 which is tacos.  You'll be so sad.  happened to me once and I've had to correct them during the ordering process several times since. Seems taco and taquito is interchangable in Spanish so they automatically default to tacos.  

THIS IS THE BEST TAQUITO ever... and their refried beans are superior, too!

Man... now I'm hungry.

Definitely see you there.
