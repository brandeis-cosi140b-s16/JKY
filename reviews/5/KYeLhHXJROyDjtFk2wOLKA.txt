Brunch. Do it. It is tapas style so you get to choose a few different plates or share them family style. It is all you can eat for $35 with $8 bottomless mimosas (inquire for a "locals" discount).  There are about 20 different things to choose from. Sweet, savory, vegetarian and carnivorous. Everyone in your party will be pleased. If Vegas is having great weather, the outdoor patio is at pool level with umbrellas if needed. This place is a brunch gem!
