Ladies, fella's......this is a "GO"!  I absolutely love this place.  I've tried many items on the menu and everything has been excellent.  No matter if you go inside or use the drive thru, your food is always out fast hot and delicious.  I go 5 miles out of my way to hit this place up, that's how good it is.  The ONLY thing that I would ask that they change is to start using skinny fries in their Carne Asada Fries meal, instead of the crinkle cut.
