We tried this little place on Sunday and it was off the hook...fabulous. Ribeye street tacos and a carne asada torta. They brought around samples of their lentil soup while we were waiting for our food and little samples of their fresh fruit popsicles at the end of our meal. Both of them were delicious.  Great addition to this part of the neighborhood at Central and Dunlap. We will be back to this place often to try other menu items and also their sweet corn.
