When I was still living in Arizona, I visited this place regularly. Their tortillas are amazing and their salsa is to die for. If you like Americanized Mexican food and you are a salsa fan, absolutely go here. I now have to go to great lengths to transport their salsa to Ohio.

I particularly enjoy their bean burritos. My boyfriend wants to marry their Borracho Burrito (beware of the resulting farts, though).
