I went here on Friday afternoon with my friends after just landing in AZ from NY. We sat outside and braved the Arizona heat. Our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. A total plus was that it happened to be happy hour! $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. What's strange is that a pint of beer is $6 but $5 for a pitcher during happy hour, so I clearly had to go for the pitcher. I ordered the crispy fish tacos. The breading was delicious but I wasn't too keen on the fish used inside. Overall a great experience and I definitely recommend this place.
