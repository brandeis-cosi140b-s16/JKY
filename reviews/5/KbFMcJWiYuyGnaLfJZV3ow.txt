I have been going to this place for a couple years and I cannot get enough of it!  I usually get the steak, potato, and cheese burrito it is the perfect amount of saltiness and flavor then add the green sauce!  The chicken tacos are another favorite...they're spicy but not a its so hot I cannot eat it spicy; it is more of a flavorful spicy.  I really wish they would jar up some of that green sauce and sell it.  I would eat my own arm in it (maybe I am exaggerating a little).  
Now as far a service...they're not there to wait on you.  You order it they call it out and you get it.  I have been back over and over and will continue to do so!!! 

P.S. They only accept cash now.
