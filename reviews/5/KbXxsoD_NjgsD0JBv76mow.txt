Out of 4 times had a Excellent experience 3 times. The other time was Still GOOD but not excellent.

Tasty Food. Unique selection of 3 hot  sauces.

I like the "crunchy taco" -"guero" style seasoned ground beef & mashed potato, crunchy shell w/lettuce, pico, sour cream, hot sauce, cheddar cheese



Cheap but not Free. Like $2.50 - $4 per taco. 
1.99 for chips and salsa

Advice: Go with the pitcher of Margarita not by the glass, or beer.
