Love Sandbar, I feel welcomed every time I come. Jenn makes a great sweet tart in fact the sweet tarts here are always blue, some
other places change their color from blue to a weird green color, but here it looks appealing

Management is always nice to and are great people to say hi too.  Anthony always makes this a happy place to be and Richard help makes it even better each time.

Dancing is always fun too, and oh drinking out side in the sand neat.
