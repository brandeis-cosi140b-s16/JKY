I've been enjoying meals at Pepe's Taco Villa since they opened in 1983, the food is great.

What I really want you to know is Pepe's is open on Tuesday's although Yelp does not show that.

Also Tuesdays is Taco Tuesday's with $1.00 Tacos Ground or Shredded Beef Dorados.

Stop in any time and enjoy a great meal.
