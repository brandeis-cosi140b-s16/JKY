It is nice to see a new place up here in this location.  Mexican food is definitely my favorite and this food ROCKS!!  My first time in I enjoyed the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi was fantastic!  It is served with an amazing aioli, slaw, and the rice and beans.  If you like street tacos or a la carte they have those tacos too! The second time I had the shrimp ceviche & steak fajitas. The ceviche was great.  Fresh and plenty for a little meal but, holy cow those fajitas are gwwooooood!!  Served with fresh veggies and fresh tortillas.  
The decor for the restaurant is great.  A modern theme for a restaurant it has high ceilings with nice tables and booths.  The restrooms are also nice and adds to the quality of the building. I will be back because they have happy hour until 7pm!
 Great place to visit!
