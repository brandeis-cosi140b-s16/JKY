It's a new spot an it's so effin' great! Came here last night and had their tacos. It was so good that I had to order a burrito. Then the next morning I just had to go back and order some more before I left The Strip. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and a whole burrito again! Def give it a shot and help support this new business or just give them your opinions here on Yelp! Another good thing is they cut the meat right in front of you when you order it. B-E-A-U-tiful!
