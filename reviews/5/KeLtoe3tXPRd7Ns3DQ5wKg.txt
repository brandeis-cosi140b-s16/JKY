There are Mexican Restaurants and then there's La Unica. Hands down best Mexican Restaurant in NC and VA ( and we have tried MANY Mexican restaurants between here and VA).  They cater to food allergies better than most. It is almost always packed but wait times are short. Can't say enough good things about La Unica!
