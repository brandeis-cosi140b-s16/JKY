This place is open 24 hour.  The food and service is good.  They have a small salsa bar that includes green and red hot sauce, cucumbers, green onion and a carrot mix.  They will provide you with a water cup that you can fill up at the soda machine.  They have $1 hard shell Chicken Taco's on Wednesday.  You can also call in your order if you are in a hurry. I recommend the Chicken Burrito.  The parking lot is busy, but I can always get a close spot.
