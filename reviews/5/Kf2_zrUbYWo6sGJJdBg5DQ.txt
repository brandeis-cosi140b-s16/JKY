OMG best street tacos in Vegas ever.  They are just like the ones in LA, but better.  

Only got the tacos there but they were amazing.  
Adobado: Had right amount of spice and the creamy sauce complimented the meat.  
Carne Asada: Juicy steak comes with guac and pico
Lengua: Wow...so juicy and tender
Tripa: OMG...deep fried intestines...Greatness in my mouth..lol
Buche: (stomach) it was ok...i just had to try it.
Cabeza: (head)..wasnt bad..had to try it also
Sesos: (brain)...had to try this as well...it wasnt bad...but the texture was weird.

The place was busy when we got there, but the line went by quick. There are a few tables in the inside and a bunch on the outside.

Oh almost forgot free refills on drinks, so of course got Orange Bang!!!
