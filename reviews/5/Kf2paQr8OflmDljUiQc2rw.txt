At at New Mexican grill tonight I had the green chili pork burrito and the beef chimi. They were both really good the staff was very pleasant and let me try the sauces before I ordered my food. The only thing I did not care for was I like spicy food but all of it was really spicy I think it could be toned down just a touch. All in all great place with great green chili!
