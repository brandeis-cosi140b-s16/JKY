A little off the beaten path, but worth seeking out.. Great stop for a bite for hungry people on their way to the airport! 

Really enjoyed the Chiliquiles, which is cheese and egg smothered chips with diced chicken. Also had a fantastic shrimp taco that was special off the menu and had a good spiced cream sauce. 

Loved the day of the dead decor too!
