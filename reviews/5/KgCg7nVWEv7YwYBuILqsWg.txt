We went here with an awesome Groupon and our taste buds were rewarded.  The location is nice, they have plenty of seating and the staff is super-attentive.  I loved this place so much I went two weekends in a row.

The food highlights:  

Once you are seated they bring you an awesome bowl of chips, not only corn chips but flour tortilla chips too.  I've never had them before and they practically melt in your mouth.  Their hot salsa is unlike any other I have tried, and it is AMAZING!  It's not thin like most hot salsa and was a  wonderful orange color with spices mixed in.  I made sure to take home the leftovers because it was so good.  I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to go back the next weekend.  

We ordered the Skillet Cheese appetizer.  A little cast iron skillet filled with delicious white cheese, cut up peppers and chorizo sausage, long with 3 flour tortillas.  This was SOOOO good.  It went very well with the chips too.  A little spicy if you included cheese, peppers and sausage in one bite, not so much with just the cheese.  

I had a three item combo, crunchy beef taco, cheese enchilada and bean & cheese tostada.  All of the items were like most of the Mexican restaurants in town and were very good.  

This restaurant has some very unique items on the menu and we will be back again.  I can't wait for my next food adventure!
