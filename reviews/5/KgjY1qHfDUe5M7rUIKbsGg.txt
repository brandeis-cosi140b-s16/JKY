If u looking for TACOS in Las Vegas ??? This place Chicago Style Taco Shop has the BEST!!! I tried a couple tacos and my favorite were tripas and cecina were BOOM i love it, highly recommended. The salsas are really good each one has it own taste even the mild green sauce has a great fresh flavor The customer  service is great, The owner and employees are very friendly, i will definitely come back for more, maybe Windy City Fries next time, come and try it i guarantee you'll love it!!!!
