Absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to awesome "hole in the wall" Mexican food. From the outside you wouldn't be tempted to go in, but I heard some very good recommendations, including the fact that a national tv show went there and gave it high praise. Trying it out however, I was BLOWN AWAY. First thing I noticed walking in is that the place was packed. All the booths were filled, and a fairly long line led up to the register. The next thing I noticed was the nice ambiance. Real latin music and a VERY NICE mural on the right side of the restaurant gave the place a nice feel. Check out the mural if you go in, IMHO it is something special (I was surprised that noone who worked there could tell me the name of the artist-I would like to see more of his work). Then there was the food. IMHO, every thing was both high quality-and authentic (no caucasian [I am caucasian] wimp down). Excellent beans and rice, and wonderful main dishes. I particularly liked the chilaquiles for breakfast, and want to try some of their other breakfast fare, which I believe will be amazing. I true Mexican (no caucasian wimp down) food lover, I will be back to this place many times and give it my highest recommendation.
