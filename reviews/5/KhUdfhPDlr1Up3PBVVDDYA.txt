The food and service are excellent!  I usually come here with a coworker, and we receive a friendly greeting right when we walk through the door.  I have only been here for lunch. 

I like to order one of the daily specials because it comes with soup, beans, rice, and the entree.  The specials are reasonably priced, whereas the other menu items are a bit pricier, but well worth it.
