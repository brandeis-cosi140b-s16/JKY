My family and I were traveling from New Mexico to Yuma AZ and so I went online to find a restaurant where we can sit and eat. Penascos came up so I immediately yelp it and saw the reviews. I thought well it worth a shot, and I'll be the judge based on my own experience. We were greeted and seated immediately. Our server came over with chips and salsa, we order our food and within minutes our food had arrived. I order the Sonoran Chicken Flautas and they were good!!!! The rice reminded me of my grandmother rice. The flautas were crispy not to hard nor was it to soft but delicious. I also order a side of Guacamole and it was fresh, Our Server always checked up on us which is a plus for me!  We all left out plates empty and our tummy's full . The restaurants it self is beautiful. The restroom was clean and they had pictures of Puerto Penasco throughout the restaurant. What I really liked about this place is that it a family owned,  I would definitely drive from Yuma AZ for some good Mexican food and great customer service!!!!
