My son and I were in search of a quick Mexican lunch and El Ranchero was recommended by a friend. This little store front is nothing fancy, but it was clean, the service was pleasant and the food was delicious. I had a shrimp taco and a fish taco. My son had enchiladas and a chicken taco. We asked that they hold the onions and they did. This allowed us to taste the food and not just onions as so often happens when cooking with onions.

I'm looking forward to introducing the rest of the family to El Ranchero!
