Famished from an afternoon of shopping, we took a turn into this lot on Decatur, and headed for the deli. To our surprise, there were three fast casual choices in this restaurant row. Since all the menus were posted in the windows, we surveyed our options. We decided on trying something new and patronized Phat Phranks. 
Although the name sounds like a hot dog stand to me, it's actually Mexican food. 
The restaurant has a strange hodge podge of decor. It's Asian/musical? But spotless, clean and cute nonetheless. 
The man at the counter could not have been more welcoming and polite. I assume this was Phrank, as he was featured in pictures on the wall. He asked if we had been before an then walked us through the menu. 
After a tantalizing description, we both settled on a carnitas and Carne asada torta. The sandwiches were awesome!!
Soft bread griddled crisp and filled with flavorful, tender meat, crisp, fresh shredded cabbage, cilantro, and onion.  The bread was smeared with a refreshing white creamy sauce.  Phrank had explained they use the same stuff on their fish tacos.  The sandwiches are served with lime wedges and 4 types of fresh salsa.  All had great flavor.  We decided we preferred the carne asada slightly more than the carnitas but loved both.
The menu included lots of choices for tacos, burritos, tortas, nachos, salad, flautas and so on.  We wereso happy when we left and spent $16 for lunch for two with two drinks.  
Phrank even stopped by our table 3 times to check on our level of happiness.  He offered more salsa, and refilled our drinks!  
Bottom line - the food rocks! The service will blow your expectations out of the water! I can't wait to go back!
