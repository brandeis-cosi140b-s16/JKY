This place us absolutely amazing.. The tamales are spot on authentic and delicious.. The cheese tamales were my favorite. The masa was thin and moist and seasoned well,and was stuffed with lots of cheese and chiles, as well were the pork.. Most tamale places are the opposite, all masa and no stuff inside!! Well worth the price! Thank god we have a place in town & in the east side that sells quality delicious tamales.. Thumbs up to pattys.. See you at xmas!!!
