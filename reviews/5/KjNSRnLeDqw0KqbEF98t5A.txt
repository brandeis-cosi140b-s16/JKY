I've been to Cien Agaves many times after work - always with excellent service. Usually I sit at the bar, but I recently had the pleasure of being served by Mimi when out with some friends. Mimi was especially courteous, checking up on us many times to make sure we were all set. She had a great sense of humor, too. 5 Stars for Mimi!!

The happy hour deals are decent. Personally, I think it should be extended to more than just the house margarita.

As a tip, the avocado margartia is to die for! It sounds weird, but it's creamy and delicious. I think it milds the flavor of the margarita a bit, which is nice.
