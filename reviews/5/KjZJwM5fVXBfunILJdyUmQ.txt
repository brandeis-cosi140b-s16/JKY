Followed the advice of Guy Fierri and stopped in to try before the Cleveland Indians took care of business at Chase Field. I had the shrimp tacos, hubby had fish tacos and kids had Carne quesadillas. Everything was fresh and yummy. Everyone is full and happy! Thank you for everything! Drove 5 hours from Vegas, we'll definitely be back!
