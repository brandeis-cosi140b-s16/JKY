I've been going here on an every other week basis for my work lunches, and I've got to say that it's great for everything that you'd expect from Chipotle's higher-end style and quality of fast food. The burritos are stuffed nicely and the staff was great to me.

The only downside is that it gets really busy if you go during usual lunch and dinner peak times, so I end up not always having enough time to eat during the time allotted for my lunch. I can't always blame the restaurant for that though.

In the end, if you're looking for some burritos or tacos quickly and made with good quality, this Chipotle should suit your needs.
