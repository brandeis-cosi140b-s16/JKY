Hole-in-the-wall. What does that mean? It means good!!! You don't come here because you want to look at pretty walls, sit at refinished wood tables, and smile at the ambiance. 

You go out to eat to hmmmmmm, "eat." I've only had the burritos here and they are GOOD! The pork is excellent, tender, juicy, and well-seasoned. The green chili sauce is a MUST!!! The burritos are HUGE and will be more than enough for the day. 

But, this is why we go to hole-in-the-wall places! We go to get large quantities of food, that tastes great, and we don't care about decor!!! 

If you don't enjoy it . . . let me help you, it's not you, it's your tastebuds . . . :)
