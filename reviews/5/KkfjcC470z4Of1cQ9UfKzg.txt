Hands down best Mexican food I've had in Arizona! (my fianc√© agrees and he's from New Mexico...the closest competition is in New Mexico:)). We've taken many family members of his and mine and no one has been disappointed. The salsa and chips are amazing and the service is always top notch. Go on a Sunday when all the daily specials are available for the 'special' rate. Servings are delicious and huge...we like to order a couple of margaritas and share an entree'.
