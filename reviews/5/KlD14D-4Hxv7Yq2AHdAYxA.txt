I swear to God I would give this place seven stars if it were possible. Maybe 8. This is a staple for friends from out of town that I preface with "Oh you think you have good Mexican food in (blank). You've been lied to. Welcome to El Molino."

El Molino purists (usually native Phoenicians and Mexican food addicts, like myself) will go at lengths to remind you that the Scottsdale location now is not its flagship and that El Molino is actually one of the oldest mexican food spots in town. It was originally at 22nd St. and Washington, just east of downtown. 

The new location is unassumingly hidden behind a Pizza Hut Express on the corner of Scottsdale and Osborn, but don't be fooled. This place is no fly by night.

Everything here is good, but I especially recommend anything that has the chile beef (the green is a little spicier than the red, but neither is overbearing). Paricularly, and this is my go-to, get the Nana Rosa Special. They make all the tortillas in house and you can taste the freshness in authenticity at its best with this one. You won't be disappointed.
