I went late on a Saturday night and they were out of two items that added heat and flavor to the burrito (the corn salsa and the spicy salsa). These are two things that I look forward to adding to my burrito every time. I was upset; however the 3 employees were extremely helpful and nice.  The guy in the kitchen made hot salsa while I waited and was able to get hot salsa.  The other 2 ladies were apologetic and provided superior customer service while I waited.  I walked in happy, got upset and walked out happy (not easy to do in a 10 minute visit)...The place is neat and clean and there ingredients are always fresh... I have been  multiple times and this was the first time they were out of something I put on my burrito!
