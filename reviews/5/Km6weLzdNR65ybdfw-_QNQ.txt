I'm a super fan of authentic Mexican tacos, and some people might consider this place "Americanized." I really enjoyed my meal here, and was pleasantly surprised by the presentation, the quality of food, and everything that came along with it including the service and decor. Thank you Groupon for bringing me to this place, because I seriously gave up on finding decent Mexican food in vegas. 

The guacamole was probably one of top 2 best guacs of my life. It was fresh and flavorful. 

I love their chips. It has a great texture, and it's my favorite kind of chip. I don't know if it makes sense, but I hate it when I can smell old oil or taste it in my chips when they haven't changed it in a while. Not here. 

Baja fish (beer battered Mahi Mahi) tacos- 3 star. 
Shrimp tacos - 4 star. 
Carne Asada tacos- 4 star. 
Beef barbacoa- 2 star. 
Guacamole - 5 star.
Corn salad- 4 star.
Refried Beans with Chorizo - 1 star.  BEANS and CHORIZO! Doesn't that sound amazing?  I was sold by the description but it had a lot of chili powder or some spice in it that was overpowering. I couldn't really appreciate the flavor at all. 
Service- 5 star. They were on point most of the time. I did have to ask for some refills on my soda, but, it's all good. 
Ambiance- 5 star. 

I'm a bit confused as to how I'm giving this 5 star after seeing my average up above of each item. I think I was thoroughly impressed with the guac, chips, ambiance, and service. I also loved their flour tortilla (made to order) that they use for the tacos. Presentation of the tacos reminded me of China Poblano (at the Cosmopolitan) so it has this "fancy" feel to it without having to pay $4.50 for a taco. 

I think the Groupon deal made this place worthwhile too, considering that we paid almost half of what the dinner was worth. I will definitely be back to try other tacos on the menu next time!
