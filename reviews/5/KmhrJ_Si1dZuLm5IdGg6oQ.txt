We really enjoyed our meal at this authentic taqueria! We are from CA, and so we know good Mexican food. The food was delicious, and the staff and owners were very friendly and attentive; they even gave us an amazingly delicious complementary dessert after talking with us about their business for several minutes. There is something for everyone at their restaurant--even for those in your party who do not want to eat traditional Mexican cuisine, i.e. salads and hamburgers. Now, their food isn't Americanized or tex-mex (which is a great thing) so don't expect that and if you've never had authentic Mexican food, keep an open mind--you won't be sorry.
