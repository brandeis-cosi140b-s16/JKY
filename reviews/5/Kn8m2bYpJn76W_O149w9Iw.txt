MMMM!  After reading about this place for months my hubby and I discovered a tasty treasure in TA!   We entered a spotless restaurant engulfed in wonderful smells.  The previously described owner was easily recognizable, greeted us warmly, and shared a bit of history of the restaurant's inception- and acknowledged his partner Pablo furiously cooking away in the kitchen.  We ordered the Fish Tacos ( crunchy and fresh), Tacos al Pastor (so full of flavor that my taste buds had a meltdown), Carne Asada Quesadilla (comfort food galore with just the right mix of meat and cheese between two succulent tortillas), and the scrumptious Churros (oozing with a creamy center and laced with caramel).  $15 for all this bliss!  We don't live in the area, but this gem will certainly be a food destination for us on a regular basis.
