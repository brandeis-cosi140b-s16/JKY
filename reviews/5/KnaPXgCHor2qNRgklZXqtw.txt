we went to this place with a group of 8 people. the restaurant was VERY busy but we got in promptly. we had the $.99 margaritas which were fine. my wife and I split the chicken fajitas which were excellent. I'm not sure how one person could possibly eat them all.  the flour tortillas are made on site and are amazing. service was prompt and pleasant. prices are very reasonable.  a great find!!,
