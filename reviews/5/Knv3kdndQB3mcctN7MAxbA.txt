Sean V and Ashton helped us today and they were great!  Sean totally understood our food allergies and was clearly well trained on how to handle them. He has a great attitude which made the experience so nice for us. Ashton was super friendly and sweet.  And, of course, the food was great as usual. You have done it again, Chiptole!!! Thank you!!
