Really enjoyed this place and it will definitely be in my regular rotation of small locally owned restaurants in downtown Phoenix.  The owner Brian is friendly and takes great pride in the quality of his cuisine which reflects his southern New Mexico roots.  I am excited to find a restaurant that has made from scratch red and green chile sauce using New Mexico chiles...the distinctive flavors are wonderful.  The green chile sauce was smooth and slightly sweet while the red sauce has a hearty kick ... I sampled both and like them both.  Tamales are generously proportioned with good flavor..basic red pork and green chile varieties on hand and these classics are done well. Good to see they offer takeout tamales by the 1/2 dozen.   

I was happy to see flat enchiladas on the specials menu...a  New Mexico specialty menu item that is hard to find on menus around here.  Delicious and generously sauced to perfection. 

Convenient parking lot right next to the restaurant on the west side.  The seating area seemed clean and bright, it is probably bustling at lunchtime. 

Great job Brian, I will see you again soon.
