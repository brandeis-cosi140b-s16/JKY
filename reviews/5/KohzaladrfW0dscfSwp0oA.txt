This is consistently one of my favorite Mexican places in Charlotte.  The quality of the food is excellent. I love many of their shrimp dishes and the ir Chicken with mole is the best I have had in the Charlotte area.  Burritos and enchiladas are awesome as well. We've had several birthday celebrations here and they have several yummy desserts as well!   Service is usually good, but they do get really busy at times.  I like the fact that the owners have incorporated other Latin American & South American cuisine into their menu so its not just the same old standard Mexican fare...
