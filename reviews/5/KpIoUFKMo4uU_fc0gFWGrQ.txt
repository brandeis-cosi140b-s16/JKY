I love this place. I'm in the MBA program at ASU and we occassionaly have happy hours here. Everything on the menu is good--I usually get street tacos and the brown bag churros which are AMAZING! I've brought my dog to the patio a few times and it worked out well. Good bloody mary's too :) They staff was very accomodating and pleasant.
