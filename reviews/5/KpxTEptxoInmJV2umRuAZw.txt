$1 burritos on wednesdays. It's the spot to go that day. The burritos are huge and for only one buck? You really cant go wrong. They have other cool deals throughout the week but that's my favorite. Good food at really great prices! If you're in the mood for mexican this spot is way better and more authenic than taco bell! Worth a try. Get the green hot sauce. Their red sauce is no good. They have a drive thru and are open late!
