At leticias with the family. Celebrating my husbands birthday. This place is amazing so far....We are hooked- haven't even gotten our dinner- and the salsa beans and chips are to die for! Not to be to mention the fabulous people. Great service- friendly environment. Authentic and worth every penny. 
This is a must go to restaurant !!
