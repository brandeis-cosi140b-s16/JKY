Definitely one of my favorite places! Small local Mexican restaurant with bold flavors. The staff are always friendly and the restaurant is very clean. As you walk in, you can see the kitchen where the food is being prepared. You can see how 

They probably have the best shredded beef chimichanga with their homemade salsa and guacamole. I'm torn between that and the chile relleno. Both are delicious and authentic. This is a local favorite and I will keep coming back.
