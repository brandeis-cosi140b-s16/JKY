Very surprised how good this place is, menudo and birria severed everyday instead of just Sundays like most restaurants, the birria was excellent . They also sell beer and make micheladas! Food prices and cheap might be a little more expensive than Roberto's tacos but well worth it . I will be coming back! :)
