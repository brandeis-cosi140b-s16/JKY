I found this place in May 2013. Since then I have been to that place more than ten times. It's a whole different experience of Mexican food!!
I never really liked oysters until I tried their Vuelve a la vida oysters. They're a bit pricy but I have come back to this restaurant mainly for them.
Their tostadas are great too.  I tried the shrimp and octopus one and it was great.
I also tried a creamy shrimp dish, forgot the name of it, and it was awesome!
I have also tried a deep friend whole fish and it was great.

Oh and their complimentary ceviche is to die for!!! Finally, you gotta order a michelada, it's a great drink!

The waitresses are really nice. Most of them don't speak English but that makes it even more fun for me to try and practice what I learned from rosetta stone lol. 

I totally recommend this place.
