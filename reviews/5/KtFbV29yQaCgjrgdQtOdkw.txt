I absolutely love this place. I've been here a couple times and each time the food was amazing!

I went in with a large group and normally servers are thrown off a bit but each time the server was very quick and accurate in taking our orders and to make things faster, even bought over another server to take orders at the opposite end of the table!

I ordered the shrimp tacos (wrapped in lettuce) and they were great! The server did tell me that they were spicy but they weren't as spicy as some complained. Our group shared the trio of salsa and guac and it was so good that I had to control myself so I wouldn't ruin my appetite! The vegetarian tacos were pretty good as well!

The other time I went, I indulged in a little more. I ordered the taquitos, elote,and lobster tacos and all were great choices!!!
