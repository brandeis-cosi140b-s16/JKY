Blink and you'll miss this spot, tucked next to a gas station just before the northeast corner of 19th Avenue and Glendale, which has become our go-to for good tacos in the Valley.  The exterior might look a bit intimidating, and the interior doesn't leave much to be said for atmosphere, but all you need are their extremely well-priced tacos to feel like this place could be your second home.  Carne asada is some of the best in the valley, fish tacos are phenomenal, and pastor and lengua were not disappointing.  The tortillas are the perfect weight and texture with just enough corn flavor.  We also tried the molote, a masa fritter with potato and chorizo, which was a crispy nugget of Mexican comfort food reminiscent of mashed potatoes if mashed potatoes got a stylish makeover that involved spice, black beans, and queso fresco wrapped in fried, corn-y goodness.  Service might be lacking, but for less than $15 to feed a hungry couple, you really can't complain.
