one of my favorites in town by far! great warm atmosphere and some of the best latin-esque, delicious food!  

both times i vied for their fish dishes, waiting to be disappointed since we're in the heart of the midwest but both the salmon and tilapia dishes were super tasty and left my comfortably full. i had to take some home!

definately go there for nice date or just a splurge!
