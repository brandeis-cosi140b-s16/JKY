Love this place! I always just get the tacos. They also have carne asada fries, but just get tacos. They also have pretty good horchata, jamaica and tamarindo. I like to ask for cheese on my taco, but it comes automatically with salsa, onions and cilantro. Also, they don't charge extra for guacamole!
