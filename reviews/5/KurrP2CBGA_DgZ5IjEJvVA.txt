A hole in the wall? Literally. 
The most authentic tasting Mexican food I've had? Yes.
Alcohol? Nope.
Walk-up ordering board? Yup.
I love small family run restaurants for this exact reason. You find the gem and you support it. 
The food is wonderful. Punch full of flavours. 
This is also the first (of 5 I've been to in 2 weeks here in AZ) that serves you chips and salsa where the chips are actually freshly made and served hot! 
The customer service was genuine and so very friendly. 
The food? Exactly what I was missing. I've been looking for that genuine taste, and I finally found it. 
Every bite delivered.
