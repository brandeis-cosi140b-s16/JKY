Best chips and guacamole (huge portion)! Came here for date night with the hubs. After all the chips, guac and salsa, we decided to share the green pork flautas and gaucho steak. Delicious! Sat outside on their nice patio. Nice ambience despite the street noise. For the the quality food and price, we'll definitely come back.
