Great service, great guacamole and cool vibe/atmosphere. Moderate priced (not the cheapest place to eat) - But def. delicious food, awesome service (they can't do enough for you) - and a wonderful place  to lunch. We enjoyed it very much!  We asked for a few menu items to be done "our" way -- and they surpassed our expectations.  Made exactly to order - if not better than expected.  Def. a downtown destination.
