Had dinner here last night and was very impressed.  First the food: had the green chili beef burrito and was very impressed.  Next time looking forward to trying the chili relleno.  Next the service: very attentive staff, not only our waitress but the entire service team checked in on us throughout our meal.  Very courteous.  Finally, the atmosphere: this is a very unique setting with indoor seating, patio seating, and a pond the restaurant is built around where the kids can feed the ducks and swans.  Very well laid out and thoroughly enjoyable.  Can't wait to get back for more!
