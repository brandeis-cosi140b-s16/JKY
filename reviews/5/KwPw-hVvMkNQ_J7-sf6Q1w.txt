I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of "reviewers" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry, they don't have shrimp burritos.  Sorry, this isn't a sit down resturant.  Its a take out place.  This doesn't take away from the fact that this place makes the best burritos I've ever had.  It is all fresh ingrediants.  It is a fantastic place for lunch.  

BTW have a brain when you write a review on here.
