Met a group of people here and the ambiance was awesome, the food was awesome, the service was awesome.. And yes I guess the word of the day is Awesome, but, I would much rather write this type of review than have gone to a place where I was writing an unpleasant one. It is a little bit pricey, BUT, you are getting nothing but the freshest of ingredients and best flavor. So with all that being considered it is fairly priced. I do not drink alcohol much, so not much of a judge there, but the Chocolate Cake with the scoop of Ice Cream was very very good. Took care of that Chocolate Craving. Well stop reading my review and get down there to try it yourself!
