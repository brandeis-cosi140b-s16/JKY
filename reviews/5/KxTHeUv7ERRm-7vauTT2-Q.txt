Woah!  Let me TELL you that THIS is THE place to eat!!  I had some of the most amazing and unique soft-shelled tacos ever!!  The short rib taco was my favorite.  Very sweet and meaty!!  Let me tell you how much I hated the parking though!!  There is no parking area for the restaurant since it is a corner building. There is free valet, but we weren't interested.  So, we tried parking in the Harris Teeter parking lot in from of the CLOSED businesses who obviously do not need the parking spaces.  We were met by an ancient security guard who was actively chasing people down harassing them about not parking there if they were patrons of the new restaurant.  This man literally would yell across the parking lot at people and chastise them about why they were parking there.   NOT cool for business in the Dilworth area, and if I had a closed business there, I would want people to park there for a free advertising opportunity!  This would allow customers of the restaurant to see businesses they may not otherwise know were there!!  Anyway, the cocktails at the restaurant were beyond amazing.  The atmosphere was dark and had drop lighting using old fashioned bulbs that gave the place an awesome ambiance.  The waitstaff were very new, and needed to look at notes when they were asked questions, but they are new and so I don't blame them. I'd rather them know rather than guess!!   

Plenty of TVs to watch, but the music will drown any sound out!  Fantastic experience and I plan on coming back MANY, many times!!

Also, this place had no desserts. So you will have to fill your sweet tooth some place else.
