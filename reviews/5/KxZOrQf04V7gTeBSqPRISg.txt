The ambience is fantastic! Great music playing in the background, happy smiling employees waiting to build a great burrito, bowl, salad, or tacos. My favorite is a chicken bowl with white rice, pinto beans, fajita veggies, and corn salsa with a side of guacamole. The rice is perfectly cooked and the chicken is simply amazing! Great char and flavor. Their busiest times are from 12-1 and from 6-7, but they serve about 3 customers every minute so the wait is not that long at all. Worth the wait!
