The best Mexican food in Las Vegas hands down. In addition to the best food, the staff is very friendly, professional and always have a smile when serving you. My wife and I eat there as often as we can and we always leave there full and very satisfied. Oh ya, love the live music, this restaurant is awesome. You guys keep up the good work and my wife and I and our family and friends will continue to eat there. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
