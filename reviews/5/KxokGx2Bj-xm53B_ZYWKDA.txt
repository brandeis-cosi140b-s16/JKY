I was having a terrible day.. I decided to go to rubio's for the first time, i walked in saw the menu and almost walked right back out because i was looking for the dollar menu section... so glad i didn't.  Rubio's has the best mexican food i have ever had outside of california, and even then it would give some of those restaurants a run for their money.  you can taste the freshness, the quality, and the time they put into their recipes.  i had a big burrito, and the manager gave me a gourmet taco on the house... the taco was the best taco i have ever had, and the burrito was up there too.  so the food is worth the money, also, i ate a pound of food, but i dont feel like i ate a pound of food, most places i go eat at i need to take a nap after the meal, i actually feel better after rubios than i did before i went in.  

customer service was amazing also, got my food before i was even done getting the salsa for it, and it wasnt cold like you would normally expect your food to be when it arrives that fast.

I will be eating at rubios often from now on, i recommend everyone do the same
