As far as Taco Bell go, this place is pretty great (you could say it is .....  SUPREME! Ha).   

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and smiley, they speak English I can understand, and the drive thru is always open. What more do you need? Of the 5 or so times that I have been here I don't think they've ever messed up my order at all -- which is pretty great considering it is a Taco Bell!
