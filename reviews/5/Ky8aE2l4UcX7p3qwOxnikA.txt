My wife and I just had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Casa Ramos 1 week ago today and they were awesome. We picked Casa Ramos because it is by far the best Mexican Food in the country. Seriously. The restaurant is a very clean and modern, sit down, family style, we even go for special occasions type of place. We first found them on our way to showlow, we stopped at their restaurant in heber. We were blown away by it. We loved food as well as the service, atmosphere, and Margaritas. They had a sign inside that said "visit our mesa location". We saw that it was just a few miles from our house and we now only go one place for Mexican food. And so began our love story with Casa Ramos.

So of course, when we were planning our wedding rehearsal dinner, I came to the manager Kenny and told him we had 50 people(which ended up being 55). I told him our needs and they made a special menu just for us. They have a room for partying and fit all of us comfortably. The price was very affordable, especially when feeding 55 people. The food was delicious as always. They have a bar that connects to the party room so our out of town friends and family were all delighted. They really loved it. They can put down some drinks too, they had those bartenders working hard. Shout out to Juan and the other employees for there awesome service, perfect margaritas and mixed drinks. Juan even gave my wife and I any Margarita we wanted on the house as I wedding gift. Thank you all so much. You guys rocked it! See you again real soon.
