Ellie's is a little Mom and Pop place on the SW corner of Gilbert & Queen Creek.  Ellie is a Native American and her husband is Mexican so, together they have Native Mexican.  

They specialize in Indian Frybread and offer catering.

When you go to Ellie's, it's for the food and not the ambience.  It's set up reminds me of a Subway shop, but who cares?!  So it might not be a place to bring your fiance's parents when you meet them the first time...

There's a little cart with fresh, warm tortillas and a fresh salsa bar so you can have a little something while you wait for your made to order meal.  I remember the first time I went there and Ellie gave me tortillas HOT out of the fryer.  Incredible!  There are 6 different salsas to choose from and they are all fresh.

I can't get away from ordering the Steak and Green Chile burrito, but one day- I'll venture to something else- like maybe Steak and Green Chile on a frybread?  :)

Go check this little place out!  I would cry if they fold and I just can't eat all 3 meals a day there, even if it is inexpensive and they are open for breakfast.
