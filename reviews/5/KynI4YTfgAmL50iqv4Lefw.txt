I have trouble admitting it, but Torticas is probably my favorite place to eat in all of Champaign. What I enjoy most there is the bang for your buck. Never before have I gotten so much food for so little. Not to mention, the food is amazing. Now granted, I have a very, very favorable disposition to Mexican food. But there's just something so wonderful about getting a massive burrito covered in queso in a flimsy to go box, accompanied with a small, greasy brown bag of complimentary chips and salsa (delivery). 

Overall, 5/5. This place is a hidden gem in my opinion.
