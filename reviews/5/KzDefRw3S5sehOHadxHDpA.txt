I love the chicken enchiladas verde

LOVE

I thought I'd hate this place.  I wanted to hate this place.  But I've only ever ordered this dish, and i LOVE this dish.  

I wish I lived closer to it actually.

I love it that much.

So if you love shredded chicken enchiladas swimming in tomatillo/sour cream/queso fresco, try this place!
