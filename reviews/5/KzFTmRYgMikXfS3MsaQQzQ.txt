Very happy with this place.  Our server Diena was really good. 

We had a party of ten. Six kids four adults all with different orders.  Our server got it perfect.  

The food was really good. Value was much better than then expected.  

I didn't care for the choice of music in the background or the gaming at its he bar.  

Restaurant was very clean.  

We will visit again next year when we are in town.   I do recommend this place.
