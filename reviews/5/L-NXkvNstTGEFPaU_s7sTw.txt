I've been enjoying this place for well over 10 years now, and it's worth the trip to the NE side of the valley for fantastic food, great prices, and family friendly service from the same people who've been serving me and my family for years...we've watched the place grow from a tiny two tables with a kitchen to expanding with the bakery next door and more tables...the personal touch of being able to ask if they have a special of the day that isn't on the menu is always a treat and good for a smile from the gentle giant who always serves us...ask about less Americanized dishes if you're brave enough for authentic, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by what they can and will make for you!!  The warm crisp tortillas rather than chips and salsa are a treat, and you get WAY more than you'd expect for portions...I've eaten at many "Mexican Restaurant" establishments in Vegas, and this one is the one I keep going back to and take family/guests to as well...
