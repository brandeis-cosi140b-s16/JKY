WOW. Madison's new king of tacos!

I was pretty upset about the closing of La Guanajuatence and kept wondering if any restaurant could ever take its place. Well, good news--we went to Taqueria Sabor Querento and I have to say--the food is FANTASTIC.

Sure, there's no salsa bar, but this place just has incredible tacos and Mexican food in general. Tacos will run you $2.50 each, but the meat servings are enormous. Pastor here? Excellent. I also got a carnitas sopes--which was too big for $3.50. Coupled with the taco, I couldn't finish it.

Oh, and to the people complaining about the decor--ignore them. Clearly, those philistines have never been to a legit, authentic Mexican restaurant. Go here, get everything. Seriously.

I am THRILLED that Madison (I mean me) has a new place to go for superb Mexican. Keep calm and om nom nom, people.
