Wasn't hungry when I went so I ordered the cheapest thing. i forgot what it was called (carne something) but it was a sandwich. it was really good and very good portion. definitely want to go back.
there is a salsa bar with every flavor imaginable.
decor is sweet. lots of colorful quilts and pictures of mexican superheroes.
