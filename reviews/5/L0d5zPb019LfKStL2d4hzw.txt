I lived off Salazar Bros my first year of college because I lived right near it.  Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  

I had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  

The interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.

I recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.
