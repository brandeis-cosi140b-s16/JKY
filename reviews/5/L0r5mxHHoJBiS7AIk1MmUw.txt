Forget the corporate seafood restaurants. Spend an hour or so in Mexico, and eat some amazing food! 

Located at what ostensibly is the SE corner of Guadalupe and Priest, the San Diego Bay Restaurant is easy to miss...or disregard at first glance.  From the street it looks like just another Guadalupe market.  Then you go around to the lot and try to squeeze in between a BMW and a Mercedes. What do they know that you don't? That the San Diego Bay (named the best authentic Mexican restaurant by the New Times 2005) serves some of the best south of the border seafood around!

Forget ambience...here the food is the star. The whole red snapper, and the grilled seafood assortment are very, very good. But what trips my trigger? The shrimp diablo holds the key to my heart. Shrimp in sour cream, jalepenos, with garlic and onions. Kicks like a mule with velvet horseshoes. Oh so good. My sister orders the version without the heat...called camarones verdes.  

Do yourself a favor. Take a trip to Guad....and keep those Negra Modelos coming!
