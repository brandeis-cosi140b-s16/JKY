Maribels has opened a new location! YAY!! And it's just as good, if not better, then the previous location. Daily specials include a drink and the portions are HUGE! Free chips and salsa at the table and those will fill you up pretty good because you can't stop eating them; they're that yummy! Staff is wonderful and committed to providing good food and service at a reasonable price. So my authentic Mexican food fix is back on thanks to Maribels!
