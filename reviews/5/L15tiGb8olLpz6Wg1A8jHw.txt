Went here this past weekend for a Boise State football viewing party and we couldn't have received better service. It was my first time at this restaurant and I had never heard of it so I was somewhat hesitant, but my trepidation was quickly pushed to the side. Apparently the owners have a relationship with the BS coach and did an exceptional job of taking care of all us. To my surprise, they provided us with plenty of free food and drinks, including some nachos that aren't even on the menu, in addition to taking pictures of us and giving us free t-shirts. They were extremely hospitable, the service was fantastic, and the good was great. I will definitely return and recommend others to check this place out.
