Wow! Best restaurant food we had all year!
Got myself Carne Asada Tacos - $8.95, wife had Fried steak burrito - $8.95. Both loved it. If you are on low calorie, I suggest Carne Asada Tacos. Otherwise Burrito. Burrito is huge ! Got dessert, Churro with Icecream, which was delicious. Margarita, spicy and hot- $7.95. I'm coming back!!
