These tamales are soooo good and very affordable...they sell them in pairs for $4. I grab some every Weds at the local Farmers Market and I have been happy with them every time. They have a great selection of both meat/vegetarian and red/green chile. Also, I love how they are made without lard...not only are they delicious, they are healthy!
