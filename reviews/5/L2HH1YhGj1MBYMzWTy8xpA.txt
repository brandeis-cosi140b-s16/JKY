I've tried Roberto's once before and I wasn't too impressed until my fianc√© said that I needed to try the Carne Asade Fries. His advice is to get this to go, because you get more bang for your buck. He came home with this one day as a "snack." It is not a snack.....it is HUGE! Between the two of us we could barely finish it. There was plenty of carne asada, fries, cheese, etc! It was flavorful, but I am sure eating this all the time will definitely clog up those arteries. I would recommend it to anyone with a craving for something greasy, meaty and yummy! For less than 10 bucks a pop, it is definitely worth your money if you need a quick remedy for a hangover or if you just want to enjoy some fries!
