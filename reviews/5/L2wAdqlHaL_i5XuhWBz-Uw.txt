Great food, great service and wonderful staff. Tucked away in the Tonto National Forest, with a scenic view of the mountains this rustic restaurant isn't afraid to be quirky while maintaining a professional demeanor. We go boating at Canyon a Lake and make it a point to visit Carlos and the crew every time we are up.

Fun decor coupled with good people make the experience enjoyable every time! Try the shrimp tacos or chili if you are first timer. After lunch/dinner don't miss out on the awesome homemade ice cream at the parlor two shops down. You won't be disappointed.
