This place takes the cake when it comes to good food fast!  Used to come here for lunch while working in the area.  Basically order one of there combos, or create your own tacos.  Lot's of different meats to choose from.  Fresh tortillas being pressed in front of you, what more can you ask for? The salsa bar has a lot of choices.  I miss you el taco tote, haha.
