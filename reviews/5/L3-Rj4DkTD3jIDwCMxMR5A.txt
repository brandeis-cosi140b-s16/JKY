Best Breakfast Burrito hands down! It is very simple your meat of choice, potatoes, eggs, cheese in a slightly grilled tortilla. Red Salsa from there bar is perfect on it. I have had other item on there menu, everything else was good but I could eat there Breakfast Burrito any time of day. It is a meal for me.
