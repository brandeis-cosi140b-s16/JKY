So fresh and tasty!  What a nice surprise!  Totally exceeded my expectations.  Used to come by here occasionally for gorditas but noticed the sign changed and really didn't consider trying the new place. What a mistake!  It's now table service with some really unique items, check out the menu.  The fish tacos are not your average fish tacos. They had black beans, rice, avocado and a yummy sauce!  Shrimp on the tostada tasted so clean and fresh not like other shrimp commonly found around town and piled high!  And they have the gorditas on the menu still!  The lunch special was two tacos of your choice and included an agua fresca for $4.99!  Amazing for the quality!  Make it a point to try this place if your in the area.  No beer or wine yet but the staff assured me that is only temporary and they are just waiting to get the official sign off on the liquor license, any day now.  Can't wait to take some friends to this new find in that area.
