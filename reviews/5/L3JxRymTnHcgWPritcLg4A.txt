Ive tried to write this review several times, but I end up writing my
first sentence , stopping ,heading there, eating some mulas, tacos and
quesadillas, get so full that when I come back I cant even write my
name. It is that good, or im a fatty mcpherson.I would like to believe
it's the 1st.

Yes it looks sketchy, yes its right next to the wynn in a weird plaza, or on a not that nice of a part on charleston blvd,
yes you will have to walk a little far if you are staying at caesars
or mandalay , but it totally worth it. The adobada meat, the carne
asada, mulas tacos, quesadillas(real ones) are the real deal; Full of
flavor , and  authenticity.

Sometimes there might be a line but goes pretty fast. If you got at
"damn im drunk and need to eat something right now" time of the day,
which is after midnight, you might encounter  this said line to be a
little bigger. Fear not..95 percent of the time, it goes quick and
there is plenty of seats.
