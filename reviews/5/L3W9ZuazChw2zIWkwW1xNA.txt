How can you go wrong with Chipotle? With a full menu of amazing burritos, tacos, salads, and even a secret menu that includes quesadillas, I always leave chipotle as a happy customer. The line could be a mile long too, and they're ready for it. I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes from entering the door to sliding my credit card at any Chipotle.
