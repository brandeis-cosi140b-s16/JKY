Although it took a while for my food.....This was probably the best pollo con queso  quesodilla I have had in a long while. Very tender meat, great balanced with the food. The salsa was pretty hot, which I loved! Definitely a must try restaurant. By the way, they do serve enchiladas!  You just have to ask:)
