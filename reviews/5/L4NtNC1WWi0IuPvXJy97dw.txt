Our favorite stop downtown. You always hear that Madison has no good Mexican food. Almost true- except for this little gem. This place is 1) cheap 2) delicious 3) served by the nicest people 

Their beans are not thick and old. Their nachos own. Check out lunch specials for great deals. The sopes are the a delight, as are tamales. Nachos NOM. Fajitas mixed great deal. Roommates family is loyal to their mole over all others. 

Sometime open late for post- bars. Highly recommended by true Mexican lovers.
