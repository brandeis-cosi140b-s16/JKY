Last night, after eyeing this place for the last couple of weeks, I decided to stop by and give it a try.
They were turning their "Open" lights off already, but I made my best effort, with my big puppy-eyes, and asked if they could still prepare a "raspado" for me?? The owner said yes, of course, they still had enough for the whole group of people I was talking to just outside of their establishment, after our meeting. Well, sure enough, almost all of us got to enjoy this delicious treat, which is shaved ice, but prepared "Neza"- style. Neza is a suburb in México State, right next to México City. The difference here is that the sweet is not simple-syrup based, but fresh-fruit purée based.
It was delicious!!  I had the Cajeta (caramel) my husband got the tamarind, and both were gone in no time. The owners are very nice and funny, don't be scared if they invite you to dance before you order, ok?!
