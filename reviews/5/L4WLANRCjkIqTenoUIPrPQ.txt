I have been coming here since I was 8 years old so 12 years now and I have never been disappointed! The chips aren't too salty or flavorless-they are always refilled and the plus is that they are free! My drinks arrive promptly and the servers always have my food come out exactly how I ask for it. The ambience is great because it feels like you're in a real authentic Mexican restuarant and the people are always kind and polite. I will never stop coming here! Keep up the great service guys
