I love love this place I don't care where I'm staying in Vegas Ihave to make sure We come here, specially on saturday/sunday morning when they have a special breakfast menu, must order is their Chilaquiles.
They sometimes have an amazing 3 band players their good and funny!!
Oh and while your there don't forget to order a Chonga (a margarita w/ two coronita beers) . 
FYI Serves is alright, but remember the food is great, I absolutely recommed it!!
