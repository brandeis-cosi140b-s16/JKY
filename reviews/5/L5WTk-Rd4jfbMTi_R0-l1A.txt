This Chipotle is very clean and has the friendliest and most efficient employees. When I arrived there was at least 20 customers ahead of me and I thought it would 15-20 minutes before I would be eating but in less than 10 minutes I was seated and enjoying my delicious bowl! The brown rice was perfectly cooked and very well seasoned as were the pinto beans. The peppers and onions were caramelized perfectly and the chicken was so moist and delicious! Their corn salsa adds a perfect hint of sweetness that goes so well with all the savory flavors of everything else! I was surprised to be greeted, while I was enjoying my meal, by an employee asking me how my meal was. "Is everything delicious?" I know chipotle is not typical fast food but I was not expecting that kind of service, these folks are awesome! Every time someone finished their food and left, there was someone in the dining room cleaning the tables and asking customers how their lunch was going, great job Chipotle!
