Great little food truck, usually set up on the corner of Penn Avenue, across the street from the Benedum.

They have tacos & empanadas ($3.50 each) and usually a special of the day. I've had their tacos and empanadas on several occasions and they are quite delicious. The empanads have a crispy, flaky crust that is cooked perfectly. My friend tried the special one day which was a sausage and fried plantains...she loved it. They also have mexican coke, which I love!

I've always been too full to try their dessert options, but I bet they're good too!
