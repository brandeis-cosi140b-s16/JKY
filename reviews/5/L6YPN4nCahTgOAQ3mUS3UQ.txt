Komex is great; great food, great people, great prices, good location...I am always happy I chose to put their food in my belly and my money in their till. 

Their menu is just the right size; big enough you can try a few different things, although why would you do that, Bulgogi Tacos are where it's at, and ---oh, you're gluten free? Well those come in lettuce wraps. And your friend is a pescatarian? Well we can do those with shrimp? Both of those people are in your same group? No worries, is there anything else we can get for you?

The owners are amazingly kind, and I've run into them a few times without realizing. Food in the restaurant is as awesome as takeout, as long as you don't wait forever to eat your takeout. This is the sort of local gem that everyone secretly hopes gets discovered so the owners can have a million billion dollars and hopes never ever gets discovered so it never changes. 

Komex soars in the intersection of the cuisines; spice and texture. The korean slaw, crisp and salty and vinegary, playing off against the beefy spiciness of the bulgogi, and the spice of the korea-mexican red...stuff. We'll call it salsa. All in a taco shell or lettuce cup while the juice spills down your fingers...Get the fusion stuff, and step up your usual spice level, and you'll get what the "deal" is. 

Pros;
- Great food, people, prices, and locale.
- Easy parking.
- Open pretty darn late.
- Easy takeout.
- They really make it easy for you to give them your money. Never any complaints about splitting checks, half cash half card, debit cards.

Cons;
- Con....con...con...The chimichanga was my least favorite of the things I ate there? It got pretty soggy halfway through. But I'm pretty sure that's inherent to chimichangas.
- This is sort of my Yelp mantra, but Know What You're In For. If you order All the Wrong Things you will have a pretty "meh" experience.
