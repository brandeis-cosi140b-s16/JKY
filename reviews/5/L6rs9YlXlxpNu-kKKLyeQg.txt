Get the Big Booty Burrito with all the meats. It's the biggest fucking burrito that I've ever seen. I ordered one last night and the girl up front told me it was going to be big. I had no idea it would be the size of a fuck'n chihuahua. They told me I was the first person they'd seen finish it. That shit was the bomb too. When I was eating it I felt like I was on Man vs. Food. After I ate it I bought a 400ml coke bottle to wash it all down. The people who worked there were pretty cool too and I can't really say that about very many places. I can't believe nobody ever told me about this place. I just got lucky finding it myself. They for sure have a new regular.
