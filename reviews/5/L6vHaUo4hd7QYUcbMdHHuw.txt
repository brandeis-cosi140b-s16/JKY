Went here based on it's high score on Yelp.
Pulling into the parking lot I was wondering if we had made the right decision. Let me tell you this place is a diamond in the rough. My wife had the bugogi (sp?) Plate with pork and I had the fusion pork tamales. We also split an order of spam musubi. 
Everything was excellent. The wait staff was very good as well. We've put this on our "every time we go to Vegas, we gotta go here" list.
