Yes, I know it's a huge chain.  Yes, they only serve burritos.  But I had a friend in from out of town who'd never eaten at a Chipotle, because friends told him it was mediocre.

This is the best fast food restaurant I know.  Five stars.  I have never had food this fast/cheap/tasty in any form that was repeatable.

If you're not eating the vegetarian options, the carnitas pork + pinto beans is hands down the best combination.
