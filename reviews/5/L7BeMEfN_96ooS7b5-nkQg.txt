I have been going to Ninos for about 12yrs off and on. Surprised it took this long to write a review. I've learned when it comes to Mexican food, different things matter more to some people than others. I've seen people judge a restaurant based off their rice and beans (really!?!)

Ninos is a wonderful and small family owned business. They are busy most days and for good reason, the food and service is great. Their family knows mine now and are always so friendly when we come. They will take care of whatever you need, 

I have never had anything I didn't love off their menu from simple tacos to chimis. I think their ground beef is exceptionally flavored and tastes great. I love their chips and salsa. The salsa is a puree style, not the chunky like some people prefer. They do make a delicious guacamole too, just straight fresh avocados. That's why it is so good though, not processed or premade stuff. 

The building/suite it is in may be a little old as well as much of the clientele, but it is a very comfortable and affordable family meal. 

WARNING though, last I paid attention they only accepted cash or checks.
