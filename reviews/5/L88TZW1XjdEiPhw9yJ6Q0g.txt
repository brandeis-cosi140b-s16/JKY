Fantastic Mexican restaurant! I have frequented here for a few years now, and it is one of the best restaurants in De Forest. The Taquito's Mexicanos and the Flautas are phenomenal, and I rarely wait for more than 15 minutes for food. Great service, and fantastic food make Arandas a place I am proud to have in my home town
