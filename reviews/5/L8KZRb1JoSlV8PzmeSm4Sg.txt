A Friday night favorite for my husband and I since we moved to Charlotte- we started out going to the Tryon location, but now visit the Pineville location on a regular basis because it's closer to our new home. Both locations offer excellent service and great food at reasonable prices. I think on the whole I give the edge to the Pineville location, as they actually have better rice and a few additional things on the menu that the Tryon location doesn't offer.

If you're looking for some of the more authentic dishes, ask to see the picture menu- it offers several dishes that aren't on the english menu (at least at the Pineville location).

If you're looking for value, you cant go wrong with the combination platters- it's a ton of food for super cheap (especially if you go for lunch). And of course, every meal starts with free chips and salsa (two different kinds, a true salsa and a pico de gallo). They also make all their tortillas fresh, and at the Pineville location you can watch them being made at an open station near the kitchens.
