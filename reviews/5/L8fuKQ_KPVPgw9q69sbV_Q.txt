I've been going to this place for 29 years. They treat me like family. The waiters are friendly and very helpful. The food is delicious! I try to get something different every time and it is all good. My favorites are the fajitas, crispy tacos and combination plates. For dessert, nothing is better than a deep fried icecream. I now live in San Diego and its a must go every time I'm in town.
