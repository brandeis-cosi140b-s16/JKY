This place is unbelievable! We went here with some friends for a pre-party dinner on New Year's Eve. I think there is something magical that happens when they add the cheese and put the dish in the oven because it comes out tasting like heaven. Everyone in the group ordered different items, and all were completely impressed with the taste, speed of preparation, and price. We were probably about 2 bites in before the first person started to plan out how to get here for a weekday lunch from a job in North Phoenix. As someone who often chooses vegetarian options as restaurants, I was amazed at the number of choices for non-carnivores. I had an enchilada with chicken (needed the protein) and one with spinach and mushrooms. Both were great but the mushroom was perfect. Next time I'm trying the cornbread stuffing mix. I wish this chain would build locations in every part of town. In the mean time, I'll be looking for reasons to be in the neighborhood just so I can curb my enchiladas cravings!
