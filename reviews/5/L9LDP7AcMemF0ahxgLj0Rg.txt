You know you hit the jackpot at an ethnic restaurant when you are a minority.  I had the pork belly tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos.  Very good.  Very fresh.  We had a good seat - right next to the kitchen and we were able to see all the food going out to the tables.  It all looked good.  Come with a big appetite and you will leave happy and full!
