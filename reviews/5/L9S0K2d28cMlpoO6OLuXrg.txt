I grew up in Texas eating Mexican at least once a week. I can honestly say that this is possibly the best one I have ever been to. Everything about the food was amazing. Fresh tortillas made and brought to you hot, along with fresh guacamole made right at your table. Also, the only place I've ever been to that offers free bean dip with your chips. I had a steak with green tomatillo sauce, of course with torillas/beans/rice/pico. Fantastic meal. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas.
