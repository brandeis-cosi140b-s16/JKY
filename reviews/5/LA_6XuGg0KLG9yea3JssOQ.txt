Wanna go to Mexico but too broke in this economy to make the trip?  Well then take yourself on over to Huauchinango.  Named after a city in the southern Mexican state of Puebla, you will absolutely feel like you have left the US and gone south of the border.  Unlike most of the "Mexican" restaurants in this city, this one actually has Mexicans as customers.

While I have only had the egg, chorizo and potato burrito, I feel comfortable recommending the food across the board.  The burrito is excellent from egg to tortilla to chorizo, very high quality.  And the green salsa is outstanding.   There are fountain drinks, but also a case of Mexican juices and sodas as well.  The menu is written in Spanish with English translation.  The staff is super friendly, English speaking and happy to make recommendations or explain any unfamiliar items.  The environment is low key but clean and comfortable.  

I owe the boyfriend big time for discovering this gem.
