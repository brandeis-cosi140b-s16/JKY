Delicious and authentic and non-gringofied and strange meats and salsa bar and limited English and slightly divey and oh-my-god good.

My partner and I were getting ready at the warehouse before work the other day and someone walked by saying they didn't want to work that day, they just wanted to go home and eat tacos.

You know you've been working with someone for too long when you look at each other and instantaneously say "Tacos!".

After that it was just a matter or where tacos would be had.  It just so happens that around lunchtime we get off the Beltline in Madison and *BOOM*.  LA Guanajuatence.

We went in and were encouraged by the wobbly formica tables and the dingy lights and the complete lack of interest of our waitress in the finer points of the English language.  

We were given chips immediately and it took us a minute to figure out why we weren't given any salsa.  We looked around confused and ate some dry chips and were about to ask someone and Oh they have an entire bar full of a dozen different salsas we can try.  This makes so much sense that it's gone all the way back to stupid.  I tried almost all of them.  I can't recommend one in particular because my grasp of Spanish is about as good as theirs of English, but the creamy avacado not-quite-guacamole is just phenomenal.  I mean, really good.

I had a three pack of tacos.  One al-pastor, one lengua, and one machaca.  I've never even heard of machaca and had to google it after I ate it, but apparently it's beef that's marinated, shredded, and then dried.  Holy cow you have no idea.  One of my new favorite things in history.  I can't recommend it enough.  You need to try it.

Everything was great.  Service was awesome despite the language barrier.

I will go here again without reservation.
