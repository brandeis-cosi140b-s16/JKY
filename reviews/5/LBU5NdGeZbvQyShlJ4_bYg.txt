The food is awesome. Happy hour $2 tacos a deal you can't pass up and they're delicious! The margaritas are ok. I had the margarita saint Rita and the south of the border margarita which was pretty good. But the $2 tacos and the Mexican corn were delicious!! Squeeze some lime on those suckers, oh boy! The service lacks a little bit at busy times but the manager is very nice and on top of everything. They have happy hour sunday through Thursday from 3 to 5pm and 10pm to midnight. Stop in and get the  $2 tacos you won't be disappointed. This is the second time I've been here and definitely will be returning.
