I must say everything was great! My friend got the spicy yellowtail rolls & an assortment of tacos; one Korean beef, one wild mushroom, and one Al Pastor. I got the miso sesame eggplant, and the Al Pastor & Korean beef tacos. My friend and I both easily agreed, the food was awesome and we had nothing but positive things to say! Cool looking place too! Very open feeling to it inside. The bartender Jeremy was extremely helpful & just all around a nice guy! Great food, service, & location! See y'all soon...
