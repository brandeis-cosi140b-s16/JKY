Ok I found my Mexican fix!!! This place is awesome and I know real Mexican food living in El Paso! The chili Colorado was the best I've ever had!  Beans were amazing and everything is made from scratch with pride!  They had the best micheladas and actually knew what torreados were!  No kidding - this place is by far the best Mexican food in Phoenix!  Surpasses every Mexican place I've been to!  Service is great loved the atmosphere too!
