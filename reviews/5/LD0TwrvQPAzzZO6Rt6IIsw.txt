Love this place! Everything I've had has been great. Their Mexican pizza w machaca beef is my favorite thing on whole menu! Great food, service, and prices. This place has a vintage phoenix Mexican restaurant vibe....very chill and inviting. Been going there since I was little and La Pinata will always be my go-to for easy, straight forward, sonoran Mexican food.
