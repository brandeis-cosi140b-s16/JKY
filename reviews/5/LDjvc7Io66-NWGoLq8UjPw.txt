Growing up in Los Angeles it was always nice to walk around the corner and get tacos pastor on a rotating spit. I have not been able to experience that since living in Arizona, however Waldos Tacos brought those memories back of my favorite tacos today. Although it was not on a rotating spit the pastor was tender and very tasty,  I also tried tripas tacos that was amazing as well the sauce was just the right condiment for these tacos. This is my spot as long as I'm in AZ now.
