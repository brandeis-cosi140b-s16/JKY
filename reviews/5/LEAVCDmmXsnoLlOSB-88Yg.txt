This place has a cool "hole in the wall" feel to it.  Kind of small.  Reading the reviews...I guess it's lucky we got a seat on a Friday night (it was kind of late though, around 8:30pm I think).  Started with chips and salsa.  All very good.  Wife loved her chimichanga.  She thought it was great and will definitely be coming back for more.  She also enjoyed her Mango Margarita that had a good kick to it.  I had a double stacked chicken enchilada "New Mexican" style with an egg on top (got mine scrambled).  It was quite good also.  Got it "christmas style" with Red and Green "chili sauce" on the side.  Red was a bit too warm for me and the green wasn't my favorite...but in small doses it was actually pretty good on the enchilada.  I think the salsa would've actually been perfect on this dish and next time I go (yes, I definitely will return) I will order that dish with salsa instead.  Good stuff. 

Service was also pretty good.  It seems the servers (or at least ours) do double-duty tending bar and serving customers.  I did want a water at one point and our food had not come out yet, so he wasn't passing by our table.  I did look up at the bar and he was scanning the room, noticed I was looking up his way to get his attention and he ran right over to see what we needed.  No complaints.  Torn between a 4 and 5 star.  My only issues are subjective to my tastes...not necessarily a statement of the quality of the food or service...so I think I'm going with a 5.  My wife was especially pleased with her meal. 

Finally, their rice is also very good (standard side).
