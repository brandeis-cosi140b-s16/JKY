We had a hankering for Mexican on our first night in Mesa. We'd gotten up super early to fly in, gone straight to a ball game, the finally found our hotel and were ready to do some eating.

Rosa's was the perfect choice. Service was way above par and our waiter came by like every 2 minutes to make sure we were doing okay.

I ordered a shredded beef burrito and it was excellent. I wish their sauces had a little bit more of a kick to it, but that's all right.

We ended with the sopapilla's (a closet favorite of mine) and they were superb. I could've eaten them all day.
