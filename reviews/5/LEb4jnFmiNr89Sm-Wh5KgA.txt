One of the best places to bring visiting guests. Go early as they do not 
take reservations. Happy hour is 3-5 T-F with buck 50 tacos.
Long story short....although the tableside guacamole is "fun", skip it so you have room for everything else, including the churro dessert. Portions are not enormous, but decent.This is not your Americanized Mexican restaurant. Everything is gourmet and fabulous, with attention to detail. I don't consider $20 for an amazing entree to be too expensive.
We usually go here only for special occasions, or if we have out of town guests. I'm hoping we'll go once a week until I've had everything on the menu!
