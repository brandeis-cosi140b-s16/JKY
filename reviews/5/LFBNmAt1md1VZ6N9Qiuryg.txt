My husband and I decided to keep driving and found this gem. From the start, our experience at this restuarant was top notch. Our waiter greeted us, asked us our names and continued to use our names through the entire experience. He was very friendly and very helpful.  The food, oh my lord, the food was fantastic. I love this place. If we ever make it down there again, this is going to be added to our list of restuarants to frequent.
