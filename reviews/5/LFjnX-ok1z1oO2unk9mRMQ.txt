Seriously, this is one of my husband's and my favorite places to eat when I'm too tired to cook. If we ever want Mexican food, without hesitation we know we're going to Carambas.

The new staff are great.  Even the old ones were superb.  We always eat at the bar top.  The buy one get one margaritas will put you on your ass!! Served in small plastic Solo cups, these are the perfect end to a Monday. 

I always bring friends and family here.  The manager even made us dessert on the house (tortilla chips with honey sugar and cinnamon--simple and delicious).  

Everything on the menu is delicious.
