This was our first time to this place and it was great!!!   We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday evening and the place was packed.  We were seated right away and the waitress was there within in a couple of minutes for our drink order.  She was back within a few minutes with our drinks and we ordered.  She was back again within a few minutes with our food.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out of that kitchen and piping hot.

If you are looking for a good Mexican meal, with good service then this is the place for you.  Don't expect fancy, as this is a very casual restaurant with good food and fast service!
