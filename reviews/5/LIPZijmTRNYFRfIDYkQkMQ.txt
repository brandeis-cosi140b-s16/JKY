Holy cow, I didn't realize I hadn't had the chicken here when I wrote my first review.

This place has become our unofficial work conference room.  Everyone is drawn to the magical chicken - moist and tender, with a crispy skin that bursts with flavor.  And ridiculously cheap - $10 for the whole bird, with fixin's.  The frijoles charros they serve before meals is worth the trip alone - I don't know what they do to them (it definitely involves bacon), but they are fantastic.
