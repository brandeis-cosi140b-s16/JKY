This is the real deal. The owner is very friendly and I like him even though I would like him even more if he actually liked futbol-soccer haha! Anyways, go there on Wednesday for his delicious $1 tacos, they are great. I have been frequenting this place since I my first visit to this area 2 years ago and will continue to go there as long as I am here in Illinois :D
