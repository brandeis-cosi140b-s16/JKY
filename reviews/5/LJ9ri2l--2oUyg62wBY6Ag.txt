Best mexican restaurant in phoenix! The sandwiches are amazing.. You can't go wrong with one of the many choices. Don't forget to try one of their huge blended drinks.. I'd recommend the apple celery one. There is often a wait here, but it's not long and well worth it. The flan is also a great way to finish your meal!
