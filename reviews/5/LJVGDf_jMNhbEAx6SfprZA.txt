My wife read about Phrank's in a magazine on a recent trip to LV and insisted we try it. Am I glad she did! Her fish tacos were excellent, but my Adobado torte was spectacular, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Had a nice chat with Phrank too as there was no one else in the place. Highly recommended.
