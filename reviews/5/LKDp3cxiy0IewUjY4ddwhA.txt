We had a very good dinner here in a lovely outdoor setting.  I was a little put off at first because it seemed really crowded and was hard for my Dad to get to the table with his walker.  Also the table was dirty - I wasn't sure if it was 'bird doo' or food from the previous guests.  I quickly overcame those first impressions as we had good service, great drinks and a very good dinner.
