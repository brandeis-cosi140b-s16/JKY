I was here for a business trip near IBM center. I was craving Mexican food as always and was staying in the Druery Hotel which is across the street. The food here is absolutely fantastic! As always I order ACP. Now the interesting thing about their recipe is that they put Monterey Jack Cheese on top of the rice and chicken and baked the cheese rather than pour cheese dip on top. Very interesting ! I have to admit it was very good !
I also ordered queso dip with beef (no charge!). My waitress was very friendly and had a nice chat with her. I was totally full after my meal (NO MAS!). Prices were fair . Overall just a great place , friendly staff, excellent but interesting food , what more can you want? I was a little confused why this place wasn't packed because it was 5pm and there wasn't much people there. Hopefully they get business because I will certainly be back when I'm in Charlotte !'
