First of all, I have NO IDEA what these bad reviews are of this restaurant.
I'm an excellent cook myself, and I know crap a mile away - but this food was excellent. 

 We had a 20-30 minute wait last Saturday night - totally expected. Surprised it was not longer. Place was packed! 

Server was quick, and the food was extremely good. I had the chicken mole enchiladas and they were delicious. Chips were very good - and I do not know what people are complaining about with the salsa. It was 'different than other Mexican restaurants'  but I think that too is one of the things that sets this restaurant apart - in a good way!

Service was attentive, yet unobtrusive. I will look forward to returning to Frank and Lupe's.
