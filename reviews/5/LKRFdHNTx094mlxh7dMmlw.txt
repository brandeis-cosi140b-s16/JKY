This place has been well described by others so I will just say that it is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Pork tacos + some real sugar Coke and some great genuinely hot salsa = happy happy.  My Wife loves the tortas and the food is cheap, fast and delicious.

The only down side for me was that the in-room kitchen put off a bit of grease in the air and during the winter and the place is pretty closed so I had an asthma flare up from breathing the smoke and ended up wheezing my way through my tacos.  But I suppose if they had good ventilation the place would not be the quaint, authentic inexpensive gem that it is.
