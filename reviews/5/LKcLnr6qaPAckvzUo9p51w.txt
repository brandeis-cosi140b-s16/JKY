This is the true definition of a dive. Don't go in expecting much, just amazing food at great prices. One of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to.

Never judge a book by it's cover. Simple decor, standard mexican menu, but amazing food. If you are staying at a hotel near by, it's worth the walk.

The service can be a little slow when it's busy but when you take a bite, you'll forget about it all.
