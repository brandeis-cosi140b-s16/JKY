My favorite place to brunch after a long, alcoholic night! 
The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and the prices are amazing!
Oh yea did I say the food is amazing? from bean dip to shrimp cocktails everything I've tried here is excellent! it's a must if you're looking for a mexican meal in Vegas.
