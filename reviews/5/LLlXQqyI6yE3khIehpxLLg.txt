Wow- we had such a good time here! They really did make it feel like a separate restaurant, instead of a restaurant inside a casino. The service was amazing! Our server was funny, kind and responsive- he even helped us get salt on the rim of our beer glasses. The busser also did an outstanding job of constantly keeping our water glasses filled. 

My Dad got the bottomless margarita- you have to order a $12 entree, which isn't too difficult, and buy a first $5 margarita, and then there are unlimited refills. The only downside to this meal was the margarita was not really that good. The  mix was very overly sweet- it just kind of tasted like melted slushy. The frozen was not strong at all, but the rocks was quite strong, but the mix was still cloying. 

My dad's entree was the garlic, white wine and orange juice chicken- they gave him three full chicken breasts, and he loved it. My mom and I split a combination player with two ground beef tacos. They were very good. The beans were great and we also loved that they give you beans with your salsa, to dip your 1000 chips in, (they seriously give you a bag's worth of chips I think). 

My parents said next time they come to vegas they'll come to Willy and Jose's even if they aren't staying at Sam's Town.
