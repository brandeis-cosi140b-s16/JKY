Food is simple and delicious! Get ready to get your hands dirty. There's no forks necessary here.  Rotiserie chicken, a simple salsa, warm tortillas, and canned/bottled drink. Love it!
The salsa is simple and tangy. It can hardly be called spicy, but quite tasty. They also have roasted jalapenos, pickled purple onion, and go at it. 
When you order your options are a whole chicken or 1/2 chicken. The cook will chop it into pieces for you.  
The place is covered with the color orange, casual, indoor and outdoor dinning with a small tv for a spanish soap opera.
