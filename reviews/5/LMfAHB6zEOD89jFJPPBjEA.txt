We have been meaning to try this place for so long and finally went there. It was DELISH!  It's a nice "mom and pop" kinda place. The prices are reasonable and the portions are a good size.  We've gone back there 3 times!  You can sign up for their VIP club and get 20% off your first bill after you sign up.  It's kid friendly.  If you wanna go and hang and watch a game or something, they have a great happy hour!  I plan on going back there often!!
