Great family restaurant in a so-so shopping center. I live in Las Vegas, but travel to Phoenix every other week. I eat here every chance I get, and always order the same thing - smothered green chili burrito with rice. It's made with pork - more New Mexican than Sonoran, and it's absolutely fantastic. Plus their salsa has a nice fiery flavor that is highly addictive. Love this place! I just wish they'd open a place in Vegas.
