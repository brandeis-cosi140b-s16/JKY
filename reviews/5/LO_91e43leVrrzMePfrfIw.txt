I am in love with CHIPOLTE!!!

I always get the chicken salad or chicken quesadilla. I love the fact you get a generous bag of chips and salsa. I love both the green and red salsa. 

I do not like the fact the lines are so long but hey its worth it. I usually don't fax in orders due to the fact they are beyond busy and sometimes you can't rely on a machine to take your order. 

But.....I enjoy this spot. Its really good and satisfies your taste buds.
