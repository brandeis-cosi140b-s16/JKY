Just had lunch here. We only ordered 2 dishes , the coffee crusted brisket tacos and chorizo brussels sprouts. The flavors were amazing in both dishes. Sangria was good, too! The restaurant was easy to find and the waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. Can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu.
