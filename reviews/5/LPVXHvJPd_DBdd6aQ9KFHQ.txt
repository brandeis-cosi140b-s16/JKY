I love mexican food, I have gone to so many places in search for the best mexican food. I honestly think I found it! It was my First time here. Let's start with the chips and salsa. The salsa was AMAZING, and chips were really good. I ordered large carne asada fries, it was huge! Definitely too much for one person. My boyfriend got a carne asada chimichanga which was delicious, which was pretty big as well. Total was $21. For two meals we normally pay about $30 at other mexican restaurants, so it's much cheaper. This place is my new go to mexican spot
