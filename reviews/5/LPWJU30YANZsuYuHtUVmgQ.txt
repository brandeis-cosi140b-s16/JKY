Our family has been huge Filiberto's fans for many years, most particularly this location.

No matter how busy this location is, the staff really hops to get all orders prepared and served as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality. This evening's stop at Filiberto's proved my point yet again.

With long lines both at the walk-up window and drive-thru, the food was prepared quickly and promptly served to the customers all by staff members who were still smiling and very polite. 

This location is very convenient and easy to enter and exit. Located on the north side of Main Street, east of Stapley Drive.

Enjoy!
