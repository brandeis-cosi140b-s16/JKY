Hadn't been in awhile, but just as I remembered it. Had the red chillie combo, ladies each had the garlic shrimp. Friend had chili releno. Everyone loved their meal and the pitchers of "kick ass margaritas" were the best we've had in a long time - nice and home made tasting, not the excessive sour mix found all to often at other places.

Friendly Service was very good to boot.

 Bravo Molinos.!!!!
