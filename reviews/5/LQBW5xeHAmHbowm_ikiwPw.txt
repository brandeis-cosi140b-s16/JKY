Always dependable for late night tacos.

This is really a nostalgic review this spot when it was right by the Encore. It was the best to see hot messes while you were devouring hot messes. It was always packed as all hell.

For some reason it always amazed me that they took plastic.

If you happen to be in Vegas, this is worth a stop, even in the daytime.
