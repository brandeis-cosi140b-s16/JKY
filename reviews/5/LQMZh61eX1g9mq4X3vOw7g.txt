I dont usually 5 star a place, but they deserve it. Came here for the first time tonight because I had a coupon. No issues using the coupon either which is nice. I ordered the garlic cream enchiladas and they were very creamy and flavorful. The filling was dark meat chicken with some pinto beans which I thought was a nice surprise. Their refried beans were so delicious, they were fresh and slightly soupy which I love. Rice was a little spicy, and cooked well. I also ordered the guacamole appetizer which I requested with no tomato and they accommodated. They put queso fresco on their quac which was a nice addition. We eneded our meal with sopapillas which were rich and sweet, everything you'd want them to be. Customer service was quick and polite. All in all it was a winning experience and I will definitely be back. They are tops for Mexican food in Phoenix.
