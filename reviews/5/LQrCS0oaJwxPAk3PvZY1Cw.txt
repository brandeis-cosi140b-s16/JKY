I have never been to a Javier's due to my location on the east coast.  My husband suggested it as a good place to try for a casual dinner while in Vegas last week.  It was the best Mexican food I have ever had!

We walked up without a reservation and did not have to wait for a table.  That was great.  We were quickly greeted with water and chips and salsa.  The salsa was so fresh, and delicious my husband did not even mind the cilantro in it (he usually hates cilantro)  The chips were crunchy and seemed freshly made.

Granted the food is a little expensive for Mexican food, but this is not expensive by Las Vegas standards.  I had the enchilada and taco combo, and I was not disappointed.  The food looked so nice on the plate and tasted even better.  The rice and beans were delicious also.  I had a strawberry margarita and was in heaven!

My DH had the combo with an enchilada, taco and chille relleno.  he loved every bite.  he had two margaritas and really enjoyed them.  Apparently the restaurant is known for their margaritas.  The bartenders were busy making them and from what I could tell, the whole restaurant was happy with them!

The service was great, the entire waistaff was dressed professionally in black ties and white dress shirts. They were quick to get you a refill and the food came out fast.  We are definitely going back to Javier's next time we are in Las Vegas!
