Had never heard of this place before, and probably would never had had an opportunity to try it if I hadn't been meeting with someone in the office building across the street.  He suggested it for lunch, and I'm really glad he did.  

I had the Asado salad, which I can't say enough good things about.  The guacamole is some of the best in town, and this is Phoenix, where they know how to make it.  I will definitely remember this place the next time I'm around that area during lunch.  Can't wait to try something new.
