The food and the people here are always so amazing. They hire the best employees that always greet me with a smile and the food always tastes amazing. I recommend them to anyone. I get the California bowl and it is very delicious. These employees deserve a raise for always providing such excellent service! I will keep eating here on my lunch hour!
