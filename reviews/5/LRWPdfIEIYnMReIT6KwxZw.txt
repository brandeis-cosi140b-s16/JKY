Honestly, I thought I was going to be the first on this one! No matter. Del Taco! You are made of crack cocaine my friend. You are in my neck of the woods! you live on 3rd street, I live on 3rd street! Seriously, my friend and I try to stay away but we visit almost nightly! The place is open all hours and we pretty much know all the workers by name. We spend about $8 a night here but that's chump change. They have GREEEEN burritos! They are the best. The spicy jack quesadilla. best. Veggie Works. best. veggie works. again, best! Don't ask me about the meat stuff. That's gross. Ask me about the Tostadas! I just discovered them. Definitely NOT Taco Bell. For the record, I do not like the elementary school cafeteria french fries or the nachos. The breakfast? meh. whatever! Also, last time I had a strawberry shake there, it was like a STRAWBERRYMILKSHAKEPEOPLE. Don't eat anything but the MILD sauce and you're good to go! Tonight I made a home-made burrito at home and still put Del's mild sauce on it. mmmmmama!
