1st We have been coming here since it opened and I have never written a review, although I often read reviews on yelp for many a business.  In all these years a manager has never come to our table to ask how everything is.  Last night the new manager Tana came to our table and made us feel so welcomed, it was a nice touch.  We have had our waiter before and we will forever request his table..he is AWESOME so ask for James, incredible service !  If it's not right they will gladly fix it.  We love their Happy Hour, one of the best in town:  great drinks, good food, reasonable prices and a wide selection and on top EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!
