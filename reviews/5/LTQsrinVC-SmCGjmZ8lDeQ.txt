Despite my habit of routinely embarrassing myself and my wife with my terrible Spanish ("the flesh of the chicken, white or black?"), I enjoy every visit to this great spot.

The menu is neither too large nor too small, and they know how to make all of it very well.  The standout dish for me is the enchiladas with mole.  It's the best mole I've had in NC.

Go here any time you hunger for a well-seasoned Mexican meal that won't break your budget.

Now if only I could order a horchata without them thinking that I ordered an avocado...
