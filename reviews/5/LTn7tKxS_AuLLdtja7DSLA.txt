Had the Sonoran dog. Bacon wrapped dog in a bun with onions peppers and chili with a dressing on top. 

For a hot dog, these are pretty amazing!  I can't wait to go back and try their other specialty dogs!

They also sell homemade salsa and a green chile (for real green chile!!!) sauce which is out of this world!  

The people are really friendly and the place is spotless!  I only wish they were open later!!
