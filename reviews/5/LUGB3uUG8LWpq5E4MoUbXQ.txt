Considering the sea of Sonoran sit-down restaurants that is Chandler Arizona, it is with full-bellied satisfaction that I exhort Moreno's Mexican Grill. Believe it or not, their hot dogs are the most famous thing on the menu. You'd be missing out if you didn't get it with all the toppings. After you've aroused your palette, (and your appetite) try one of their burros or sopes. The grilled beef is terrific. Finish off with some fried ice cream and you'll be thanking these five lucky stars that you didn't go to Serrano's! 

A full five stars for the perfect exhibition of classic southwestern and your favorite Americana slapped together in one quaint little hut. The staff is friendly, Spanish and smiles abound, and you're always sure to get the same quality no matter when you go.  My ONLY complaint is that there is often times not enough room in the small space but hey, you can always head down to the location on Gilbert road which is roughly twice the size!
