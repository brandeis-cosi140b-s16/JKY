Wife and I have been to lots of Mexican places from Taco Bell to really fancy joints that over fancify the food.  Of all places, this is my wife's 2nd favorite, her favorite being a joint just up the road in Rantoul.

Wife has been going since her college days in the 90's and to date she has not had a bad experience (maybe the only eating establishment that holds that distinction).  Had the lunch fajita's which I thought were mehhh. . but wife loved.  I am a fan of the burritos which I look forward to having the next time we are back in the area.
