5 stars for a chain?  Really?  Ok yes, it's amazing how many people mistake it for authentic Mexican food and don't know that it was previously bought and then spun off again by McDonalds.  

But it is what it is - quick, made to order burritos and tacos.  It's also reliable, great tasting, fresh and high quality.  The chicken and beef never creep me out like some mom and pop taco shops around town.  The best thing about standing in line and ordering here is you can see your meal being made and ask for exactly what you want on it.  Customizing your chow has never been easier or more fun.  Chicken with corn salsa, black beans and guac on your burrito?  Why not?!

The guacamole and corn salsa both have too many red onions imho.  But other than that I really like Chipotle.  Their chips are made on premises, crispy, lightly salted with a dash of lime juice.  And I often get the guac anyway because it tastes so fresh.  I get the crispy (vs soft) shell tacos often.  And I had not tried a barbacoa burrito before visiting a Chipotle.  Now I recognize it on Mexican menus everywhere.  So they helped me branch out and enjoy something different.  How's that for a raving fan review?  I just like these guys.
