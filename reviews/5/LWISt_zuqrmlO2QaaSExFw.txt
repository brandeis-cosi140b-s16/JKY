I love the downtown Scottsdale location and was ecstatic to see one open closer to where I live.

The new place still feels very new, has plenty of parking and lots of room.

The food, just as with the downtown location, is superb.  I love Tex-Mex but it's a real treat to get an authentic Mexican meal like what Los Sombreros serves.  The guacamole is wonderful and I've never been disappointed with a dish.
