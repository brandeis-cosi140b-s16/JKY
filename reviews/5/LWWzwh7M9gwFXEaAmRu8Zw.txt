Wow! Made my day today finding this wonderful place!

We relocated here from Colorado Springs, CO a year ago and I have been searching and searching for Mexican food like I'm used to from home. I finally found it. Amazing!

Baja Cali style street tacos with wonderful carne and al pastor meats (my husband had the chicken taco and he said that was also really good). Also tried the Nacho Supreme and the guacamole was to die for! They even had a chicken quesadilla that my almost 3 year old and 4 1/2 year old actually enjoyed (amazing considering toddlers are some of the most discriminating food critics).

I was very sad that there weren't more people in the restaurant when we dined there. Hoping to get the word out to keep this place alive! So, all of you out there looking for a taste of the Baja, please please please eat here! Affordable prices and amazing food!!!
