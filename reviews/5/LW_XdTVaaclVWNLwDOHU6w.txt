Very friendly service, went in at 8:45, 15 mins before close on labor day Monday. It wasn't packed for a holiday which was nice. We were placed in a cozy room. The menu options were excellent. The food was 100%  authentic.  We couldn't get enough of it,  I would recommend any of it. Had the mahi mahi ceviche, huarache de rez, enchiladas divorciadas, i don't remember the name of my husband's dish but it was steak and a nopales salad, tres leches cake, and a cafe. The cafe i would highly recommend if you plan to have a good time :) we went in with high expectations and must say it went beyond.
