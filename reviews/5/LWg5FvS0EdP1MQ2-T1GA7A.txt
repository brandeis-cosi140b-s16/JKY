Our family went for an early dinner around 6PM on a Tuesday based on a recommendation from our hotel concierge.  Stephanie was right on.

The staff was very friendly.  Jen, Justin and Julia (guess you need a name starting with J to work there) all greeted us warmly, offered insight and assistance for first-timers and seemed to genuinely enjoy what they were doing.  Whether describing the history of the building, the flavors of the drinks and salsas or recommending meals and sides based on our interests, they were knowledgeable and informative.  I was glad I listened to Justin's recommendation to go with the street corn as my side over another selection.  It was delicious, as was the rest of the food.  The guacamole was fresh and flavorful.  The salsas provided a good variety of heat and spice.  The classic tacos were solid, and the modern tacos were creative and tasty.

I wouldn't say it is generally a kid-friendly place, yet they welcomed our tween and teen, and allowed our one son, a somewhat picky eater, to custom order off the menu.   While it may have had an impact on other patrons' experiences (see Tiara's review about "unusual mix of...music"), the juke box allowed the boys to program a few songs for their enjoyment during dinner, which were played at a reasonable volume, so you could still easily carry on a conversation.

Parking was the only draw back, as the lot adjacent to the building was relatively small and not surprisingly full; but I'd gladly park a block or two away and walk to the Taco Guild again.
