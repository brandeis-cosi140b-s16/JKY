Fantastic food. Fantastic service. I'm still addicted!!

Definitely give this place a try :) I'm not sure why so many people are hatin'... who cares if you have to wait a little bit? Quality of food is all that matters! Why do you think people are willing to sit in their cars for a half an hour down the street for a burger at In N Out? If I'm willing to do that, I'm willing to hang around Lee's parking lot for a coupe extra minutes for my Nate dog.
