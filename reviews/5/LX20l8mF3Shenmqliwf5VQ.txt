I'm giving this place 5 stars mainly for one reason - the chips and salsa. We went twice in one weekend, first for a late night snack and again the next day for happy hour, because I am in love with their charred tomato salsa, sooo good! The chips are great too, oh and did I mention the chips and salsa is bottomless? Not just during happy hour either, and for $2.95 its a great deal. I can't speak for any other food, but everything that came out of the kitchen looked great. We also had great service from the bartenders both visits.

We probably wouldn't have tried this place if we weren't staying at the Wynn since its right across the street from it (on the edge of Fashion Show mall), but I'm so glad we did. We'll definitely be making this a regular stop anytime we're in Vegas!
