I would be a fat broke regular if this place was closer to my home. The food here is incredibely flavored without being overpowering. I had the vegetarian quesadilla and the seared scallops. I was glad I sat away from the other guest because I was being a rude eater because the food was so amazing. I got to meet the chef. He was humble and patiently explained some of his techniques which were innovative.  I give it five stars for the food, the attentive service, and the ambiance!

A must try. I will be back here soon!
