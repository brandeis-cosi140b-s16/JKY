Taco Tuesday, anyone? Well make that Taco Thursday, too! That's when I discovered this lovely place. My friends and I was craving somewhere yummy yet affordable since our paychecks didn't roll in yet. My bestie and her husband actually discovered this place 2 days prior after working out at LA Fitness next door and they were like let's go back! 
They wanted to go right after they went; that I must check out. 
It was cute little place; even my friend was like, "You know this is an euthentic place when there is a chihuahua roaming around." No joke; there was a chihuahua just roaming abouts; super cute. 
Their prices were super doable; a taco for $1.50 and it's not like the ones from taco bell? I went crazy. I had three tacos, one quesadilla, horchata and (since I Yelp) got a side of chips and salsa for free at check-in (so CHECK-IN). I was soooo full after half of my quesadilla and 2nd taco but I kept going because it was so good. We went at around 6PM and the sun was still out. There are sprinklers outside so it did not feel too hot; very nice actually. 
Only complain I have is probably the salsa bar. It was small and wish there was another one so everyone didn't have to crowd that one table in the corner next to the salsa bar.
