This Mexican/Chinese fusion house is a Phoenix gem. It's definitely a hole in the wall but a loved one at that. CB is the only place I've eaten at that I use chopsticks for my rice and beans. The ambiance is fun and unique. It's set up cafeteria style and has a large statue of a panda with a sombrero that the kids love. It has even been featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives with Guy Fieri. But like I said, it's a hole in the wall/dive for sure, so don't expect beautiful decor. Expect good food.

The food is always great, and you can get free samples of whatever you want to try. Plus you get cookie with every order. My all time fav is the jerk chicken or pollo diablo but beware for all of you weaklings, they are spicy! The rice and beans are great and if you want a more mild flavor, the jade red chicken quesadilla is another fav of mine.

If you're new, the menu and ordering system can be a bit tricky and intimidating at first, but you'll get the hang of it. If you have any questions, someone will be right there to help! Once you get it down, you will feel like a pro. Let your tastebuds enjoy the deliciousness Chino Bandito has to offer. MMMM yum!! My mouth is watering!
