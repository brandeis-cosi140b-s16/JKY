I have been here three times and the food here is awesome!  I didn't even know about this restaurant until my mom asked us to go with her.  The first time I went I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) which was delish.  During yesterday's visit I ordered 1 chile relleno burrito, 1 tongue taco, 1 adobada taco.  I asked for rice to be added to the burrito, and this was done :). The burrito was great with a lot of cheese.  The tacos had so much flavor.  The day before I tried the tacos from Taco Tijuana but the tacos at
El cordobes are better that Taco Tijuana.

You can read my reviews for all.  
El cordobes has very good prices for their food.  Everything I had was 1 burrito, 2 tacos and 1 soda all for $10.50.  When I walk into this place it feels as if I were walking into my grandmas home to eat her food.  The only problem here is that they do not have flavored water like horchata, tamarindo and Jamaica.  All they have are sodas and beers, but the food is soo good that it makes up for this.  Please make sure you get the refried beans with your food!!  Also, I think it's cash only.  I payed cash but I think I saw a sign that said no debit/credit.
