Okay, I just finished breakfast and My morning chores, thought I'd finish the review I started on Saturday. first though I want to tell Y'all how great breakfast was, then again, maybe not. 
You see I have a little secret, You know how to keep a secret? You are all My closest Yelp friends, no?! 
Well right now for a mere $1.99 a lb @ Arriba's, You can take home the (World Famous) Hatch Chile's They're known for. Okay the only, drawback, They're like freshly caught Trout (You gut and peel them Yourself). The flavour though is worth every moment of prep, and Huevos Rancheros for breakfast, mmm.... 

P.S. They're Freshly Roasted, for easy peeling. 
...and Tatiana, 
that Spicy MiddleEast inspired, "Curried BourbonLimeChicken with Chiles" I made for ArabianNights that You and Your Man were lovin'. Yeah these Chile's....
