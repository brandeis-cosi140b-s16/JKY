Awesome find! We had the Emerald Chicken (my favorite), Red Jade Chicken, Chile Relleno, and Machaca. My wife loved the black beans! Atmosphere was laid back and the staff was friendly and made the experience a good one. Very inexpensive and would probably be categorized as fast casual. I wish they still had their east valley location!
