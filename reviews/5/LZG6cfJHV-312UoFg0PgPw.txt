Hands down my favorite Cheese Crisp in the entire valley. Perfectly crispy and delicious, I ate most of it myself. My second favorite dish is the Pollo Rico which is a delight, I love the jalapeno cream cheese.  This last time I split the steak fajitas and they were wondorous! The meat was perfectly tender and the vegetables were cooked perfectly!

I also love the chips and salsa, the hotter one is quite flavorful and doesn't just burn and the regular is really fresh!!
