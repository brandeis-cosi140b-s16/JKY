Can't go wrong with these spot. One of the best kim Chee fried rice in vegas. There fusion food is what they are know for and it is bomb. Fish tacos are my favorite but the flautas are definitely something that crave when I want something fried. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Oh and if you dine in you get fresh made CORN chips. Awesome
