I'm from the east coast so when coming to the southwest, I want anything else besides pizza. So I took a 40 min walk from Downtown Phoenix to this place and holy crap, are these tacos super authentic and delicious!!! Got the ribeye, barbacoa and cachete (cheek) with the latter being my favorite. 

The flour tortillas had that awesome bite to them, the meat was super flavorful and juicy and they let you add your own toppings at their salsa bar. You have to add the red onions and their salsa roja which is spicy (and they warn you) but so so so good. 

The tacos run you like 2.50-3.00 so it's pretty affordable if you ask me. The owner mentioned them opening up a location near Central and Grant in March/April so I'm hoping its way closer to my hotel because I'm definitely going back.
