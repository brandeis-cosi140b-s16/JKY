I was very excited to try this place.  My fiancée and I have been looking for a place to have our rehearsal dinner.  We want a good Mexican restaurant since we have family coming in from all over the world.  We have not inquired on the cost of renting their second floor, but that aside I would be very happy bringing out-of-towners here for dinner.

Unfortunately I work late, so I cannot partake in their happy hour, but we still wanted to try the place, so we came on a Tuesday at about 9 pm.  I got a house margarita and my fiancée got a strawberry mimosa.  I was very happy with the margarita, it was not overly sweet.  The mimosa on the other hand was not good.  It tasted watery and the strawberry seemed fake.  We let the manager know and he immediately took it off our bill.

We were there for taco Tuesday, so we ordered a bunch of the shredded beef tacos.  They were quite good and much bigger than I was expecting.

All in all it was a very good place, the service was great and the food was great.  We will be back to try a larger selection next time, and hopefully we will be bringing our friends and family here before our wedding!
