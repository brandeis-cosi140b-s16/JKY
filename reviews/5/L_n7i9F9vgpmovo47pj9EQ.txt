Green chile means more than one thing, and although I didn't get the New Mexico-esque concoction I hoped for with the green chile burrito, it turns out that the burrito was worth it for the outstanding, juicy pork. Not radically different from carnitas, it reminded me a little of southern pulled pork.

The accompanying green sauce was fine, but a bit like anywhere else. However, the red was a powerful recipe that no spice enthusiast should miss.

There are no indoor seats, just a couple of outdoor spots at this mostly drive-through venue.
