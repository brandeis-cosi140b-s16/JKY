This was one of the best experiences with a restaurant I have had in a while.

Having previously managed for an unnamed burrito place for a couple years I am critical of both service and quality. Manny and Ben exceed in both. Listening to Ben and Manny talk to guests and taking time to explain was great and professionalism on that level is something you just don't see anymore. He did everything to resolve my payment issue and explained what he was doing each step of the way. 

It was also great to meet and chat with Manny about the business, their vision, and living in Las Vegas (I am a transplant from WA).

My wife ordered about half the menu and it was all great. We will return.
