I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. 


This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again.
