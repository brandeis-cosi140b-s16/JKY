We have crowned a winner for Nikki's favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. Three Amigos, I hope you have a victory speech prepared.

Let's start with the chips and salsa. Can't.stop.eating.these.chips. What are these things laced with? I haven't had the guac here yet. Why? Because I have a massive crush on the cheese dip. Get it with onions.

I usually stuff myself full with all of the above, but somehow manage to force down some of my meal. I love the enchiladas. All of the enchiladas. Plates are huge. Huge and delicious.

Typically, I just get a water when I'm here. Hello, I need to save room for all the chips. However, on Fridays the big margaritas are on special. Who can say no to a giant margarita?! 

Yes, it's in a little shopping center on Central. Yes, all the neighboring businesses have bars on the windows. Yes, the sign on the convenience store next door reads "Do Not Enter with Mask or Hoodie." Don't let any of this stop you from visiting Three Amigos. Trust me, you'll thank me.
