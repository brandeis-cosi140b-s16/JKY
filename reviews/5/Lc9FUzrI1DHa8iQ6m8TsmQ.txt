I've been here a few times over the past few years and I am never disappointed. Usually I call ahead of time to place and order and just swing by and pick it up. They are not so accurate with estimated times your food is ready though. You can order one item or the whole menu and they always say it will be ready in 10 minutes. 

My favorites here are the chicken enchilladas and the quesadilla. I've never tried their burritios. The place is not too big and it can probably only seat about 12-16 people. So be  aware you may need to do carry out.
