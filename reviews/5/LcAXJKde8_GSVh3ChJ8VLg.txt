Awesome, affordable food. Found this place just after moving to Madison & have gone back time & again. The staff is friendly; the place is clean; the food is great; & prices are reasonable.

My favorite are steak tacos on corn tortillas. DO NOT SKIP THE ONIONS! They make all the food on site & the pickled onions (slightly hot) at the end of the condiment bar are so flavorful that you'll want a heaping helping.
