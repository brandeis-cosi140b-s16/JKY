Braddah's is the place to be! I came across this beauty by chance of Groupon. I went in with my good friend and we were excited to try a place as similar to Chipotle as we could find. Upon entering we were greeted with the extremely friendly Hawaiian vibe that people travel to Hawaii for. 

As we were reading the menu and continued to ask questions about what to get and what the options were, she offered us samples of EVERYTHING. The fish was my favorite, which I have gotten time and time again. She told us the different flavored salsa's that they had, mango pic de gayo and such. I don't remember the names, but the green is a delightfully sweet and sour blend added to your dish. 

I got the bowl, which is twice what they give at chipotle, my friend got the burrito and was not disappointed. Burrito stuffed and bowl overflowing, a food lover hearts dream. The flavors that exploded when we took our first bites made us instant fan-girls of Braddah's. We have been back twice a month since April! And will continue to come back this frequently. 

Now to the whole reason we spend so much money at this place. The coconut bark. My life completed it's journey when I took the first bite. Perfect blend of a saltine cracker topped with caramel, chocolate and coconut shavings sprinkled on top. I always get extra's for lunch and desserts for the next few days. 

Go try this little pocket of Hawaii in Vegas.
