Tried the chimichanga, queso, and house margarita.

This place has a very nice atmosphere, it's really interesting how they have a stage, and some billiards In another room. I didn't use them, but thought it was unique for a Mexican restaurant.

The staff was sweet, and everything came out as we ordered. Would definitely recommend.
