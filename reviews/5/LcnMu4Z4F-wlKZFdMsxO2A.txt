Love Tortas Paquime - everything is made fresh to order with high quality ingredients. Restaurant and kitchen are spotless and the staff is very friendly. On top of all that they have ice cream by the scoop, paletas, and fresh made pastries. The tacos de pollo are my family's favorite, but the Tortas are yummy too. You can't go wrong here!
