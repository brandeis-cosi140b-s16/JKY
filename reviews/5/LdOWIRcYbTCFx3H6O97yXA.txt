You know, I don't think I will usually review fast food franchises but this Del Taco gets an exception in a good way. No matter what time I pop in, nor what time of line there is in front of me, I can get my food in less than 5 minutes it seems, always hot and they always ask if I want hot sauce. 

It's sad to say but it's a level of service rarely seen from fast food chains.  So, I give it 5 stars as this particular Del Taco seems well run, and has been for all the years I have lived up the street from it. Great job and keep up the good work.
