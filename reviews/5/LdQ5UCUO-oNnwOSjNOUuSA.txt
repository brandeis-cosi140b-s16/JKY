I LOOOOVVVVEEE this place.  Granted, no one speaks English there, but that's how you know they are for real!!! 

I have tried their menudo there, and it is pretty decent, and by that, I mean it is greasy enough!  My favorite is the lengua (tongue).  I'll have it either in tacos or mulitas.  

Another thing to love about Tacos El Compita is that they are FAST.  We would order 15 tacos, and it would be ready in 5 minutes.  The kitchen is an open kitchen and it is right there, so you can see everything for cleaniness and what not.  

One downside is that it is a cash-only "cafeteria" so be prepared; otherwise, you'll be stuck with a $3 fee for using their ATM inside. 

Go there!!
