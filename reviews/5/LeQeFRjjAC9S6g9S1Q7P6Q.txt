I love the location of this fantastic (and somewhat secret) taco place: buried inside of the Carolinas' only Latin American-themed mall. The store fronts are designed like Latino market buildings, and there is a lot of different sounds springing from the mall's playplace. This ceiling high structure has a tangling network of tunnels, and if I was younger (and not 6'3â€³), it'd be fun to navigate.

I had read about La Poblanita, and since I grew up at Carowinds and passed Plaza Fiesta on an almost daily basis, I thought I'd swing in and give it a whirl. $1.75 tacos? The price is on the level of Taco Bell, the flavors are a world away. Corn tortillas, radish slices, and thick cilantro make these some of the best tacos I've had in the Charlotte area.

The lengua (tongue) is like a tender pot roast, with a little less moisture (ironic?). The red sauce was a lot stronger and saltier, so I didn't use it much for the taco with sharp radishes and light lime and cilantro flavors. The green salsa was a pleasant surprise with much more kick than a tomatillo salsa.

The menu is pretty big, and I'll be asking for more recommendations the next time I go. There are plenty of authentic Mexican sodas in fun flavors, like Jarritos or Toronja (a grapefruit soda).

I've got more tacos to try and horchata to sip. Or gulp.
