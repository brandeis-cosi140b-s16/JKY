There are two ways I rate Mexican restaurants, first by their guacamole and second by their margaritas.  Both were excellent.  The guac was creamy, chunky and seasoned just right and the margarita was simple and they used real ingredients - no mix.  

I had the mushroom quesadilla, which was what attracted me to the restaurant after reading another person's review below.  It was delicious!  My boyfriend and friend visiting from out of state had the fish tacos, which were also good according to them.  We all had happy, full bellies and I would definitely go back.  Their food was clean, well-seasoned and prepared well.
