Yes you do eat off of styrofoam plates and plastic utensils and drink from styrofoam cups. Yes you order at the counter and then seat yourself. Yes the inside decor isn't that great. But who cares?! This place is awesome. The dishes are very reasonably priced and the costumer service is great. They brought the food out very quickly. The food was very authentic and spicy which is how mexican food should be. I come from a Hispanic family and THIS is mexican food. Not that stuff Macayos and other "white mexican" resturaunts try to serve you. I reccomend everyone try this place at least once. You really won't be disappointed.
