Been here three times in the past few days, once for breakfast and twice for lunch. The breakfast I ordered consisted of two pancakes, two bacon slices, and two eggs - a great deal at $3.99 + tax. For one lunch, I had that day's special which was gorditas con chicharrones; it was very good. I came here for lunch a 2nd time, this time with fellow yelper and lunch adventurer Rand H. I had the $5 taco lunch platter, which consisted of three generously-filled street tacos and rice & beans. Rand and I also wanted to sample the albondigas (meatball soup) so we requested smaller bowls rather than the regular bowl and they accommodated us.  The broth was really tasty; the meatballs were delicious and had very pleasant herbal flavors -- I know I'll be ordering the regular-size bowl next time! This mom-n-pop eatery has very friendly service, too. The food is so inexpensive, but it's definitely worth coming here whether your budget is tight or not.
