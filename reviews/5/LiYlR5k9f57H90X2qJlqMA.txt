As flavorful a menu as you're ever going to find; the food tastes as good as it smells.  If you're looking for a quieter evening, be sure to request the Rokerij side, rather than Richardson's.  Unique, romantic, dark, and hip, the setting and dishes are one of a kind.  I plan on going back, but not before I finish my leftovers, today!
