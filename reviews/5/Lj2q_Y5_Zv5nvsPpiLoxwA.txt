Another great restaurant in the central corridor of Phoenix. The menu items are so interesting and tempting. Friends and family had highly recommended and I see why. We all had the street tacos and guacamole during happy hour on a Sat afternoon. Everyone was completely satisfied and anxious to try more items. This place is going to be a go to for us.
