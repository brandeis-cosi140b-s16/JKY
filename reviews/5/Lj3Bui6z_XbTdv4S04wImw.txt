When it comes to fast food I think 5 stars should only be given when it comes to amazing service. This location is rather exceptional in that regard. Don't get me wrong all fast food has its morons and this one has but it is far outweighed by the awesome people. Viet is by far the coolest person in any fast food establishment I have ever saw. His customer service levels are high and he knows the menu inside and out we waited in line for a little longer than normal and he offered us a free sangrita blast. I had never tried one up to that point but now that I have I am an addict, thank Viet
