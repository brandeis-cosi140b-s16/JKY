Best Mexican food in town, bar none. Maize is authentic as it gets unlike other so called Mexican restaraunts in town that serve more watered down American/Mexican food. There is not a bad item on the menu. All reasons why they have won best Mexican food in the C-U three years in a row. Cannot wait for the second Maize to open up in downtown Champaign later this month.
