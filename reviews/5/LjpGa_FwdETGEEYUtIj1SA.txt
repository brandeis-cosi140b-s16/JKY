This place is amazing!  My wife had brought home a leftover salad from here before and both the tortilla and dressing were so delicious.  I decided I needed the full experience so we went here the other day.  

Let me tell you this:  the Sweet Pork Barbacoa was one of the greatest meats I've ever had at any type of Mexican joint.  So tender, sweet, and flavorful.  Again, those tortillas are like a little piece of heaven.  The ordering process is fast, simple and they have a great selection of drinks to choose from.  I love me some Chipotle but I think I found my new go to for somewhat healthy fast food.

There's really not much more to say except I need to go back this week to try something else.  My wife's enchiladas were great as well so that might be my next choice.
