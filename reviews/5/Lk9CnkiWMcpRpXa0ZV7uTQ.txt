Happened to pick Borders to dine at prior to a concert at Mandalay Bay.  Conveniently located just steps away from the Events Center, the upstairs/downstairs was a nice choice.  We chose upstairs, patio, overlooking the pool.  The appetizer of pablano chili/potato was surprisingly spicey.  I feared indigestion later, but it never came, just the explosion of good enough taste to finish it off.  I had the skirt steak, medium and it came out perfect.  Slightlly charred around the edge, while it tasted like a rub, the waitstaff said it was a special marinate.  Regardless, virtually perfect as well as the side of corn and black beans.  My g/f's chili relleno was "the best"; delicate batter, smooth, melting cheese, fork tender and contrasted with green chili rice and tomato based rice, it was the perfect dish for her.  With no thoughts to diet, we capped off the dinner with chocolate/cinnamon/oreo cookie, almost like a cheesecake, but a lighter mousee-like pie, was, I hate to overuse the term, but "to die for."  Can't say enough about the staff; attentive, informative, courteous and absolutely spot-on in EVERYTHING.  As a local, I can see revisiting to try more of the menu.
