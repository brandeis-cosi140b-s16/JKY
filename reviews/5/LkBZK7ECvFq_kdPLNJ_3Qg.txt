Night before my wedding....tons of folks in town who didnt't want to sit in their hotel rooms and play Yahtzee. I didn't want a stuffy pretentious Scottsdale club and I knew folks wanted to dance. My cousin took me here on a bar hopping night eons ago and I figured this place would be the best spot to go out and not take ourselves too seriously. So my fiance, maid of honor, his best man and a mix of cousins and friends all piled in cabs and headed over.

The place is like Spring Break on acid. Outdoors, several bars, lots of string lights, etc. And yes we were a bit older than their average crowd (early 20 somethings) but we were able to sit at a huge table, talk over our drinks AND dance. How often can you do that at most clubs? Did I mention no dress code? I can wear my flats and actually dance my ass off with no risk of blisters. And of course I'm the only one not hungover this morning. :)
