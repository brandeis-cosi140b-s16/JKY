Wow! What a great meal. So excited that Indian Trail is getting some good restaurants finally. This replaced a restaurant that had great tasting food but had the worst customer service. It is an authentic tasting Latin food. Has a similar feel to Chipotle, but do I dare say is better? I certainly like it better than Chipotle, they also have more choices and they have authentic queso! The prices are in line with Chipotle as well, which makes this our replacement since it's right down the street from us. Lastly, the customer service was great, very attentive to customers and eager to please. You have a new customer! Thanks Sabor.
