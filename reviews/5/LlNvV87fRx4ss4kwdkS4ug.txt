I've been looking for authentic food like this for months in Vegas. Located inside the marketplace. This place has everything including what everyone forgets , great hospitality. The folks that work here treat you like family. Notice I haven't even started talking about the food yet. I ordered takeout late Friday. I called first but they didn't pick up later found out is because their busy. The owner called me back, first time ever a restaurant called me back lol. I ordered steak enchilada, carne asada fries and chicken wings. They told me exactly when to expect my order pick up and called back with update... I know crazy right. Upon arriving I noticed the place had way more to offer than what you can see on yelp. The owner gave me samples of other dishes on display that had me drooling. They have an app that you can download which is best way to order with pics. Hands down great place for authentic Mexican food, will order again so I can try everything. Not a sit down to eat place. Primarily takeout/pickup and delivery.
