Love the family owned Mexican restaurant. Nothing fancy inside, but friendly and amazing food for such a small place.  Love their soups and salsa bar. Owner was so nice to get us samples of the bar.  WOW. So good. The special seafood soup is great. Prices are affordable and menu is simple. We'll be back many more times. Oh, authentic food is in the eye of the beholder. Just remember that family owned places put lots of time, $$$, and LOVE just to survive! Be supportive of locally and family-owned places!!!
