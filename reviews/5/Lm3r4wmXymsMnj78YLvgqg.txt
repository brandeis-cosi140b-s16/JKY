I love Chipotle. It was one of my favorite chain establishments. I could eat here every day for the rest of my life. 

The people who work at this Chipotle are very nice. They are very generous with the cheese - which is one of the best parts about my burrito bowl. 

5 stars. It breaks my heart that people would give Chipotle anything less.
