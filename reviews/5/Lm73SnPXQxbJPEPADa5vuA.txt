Steak and potatoes with sour cream nom nom nom I drive out of my way on Saturdays to get this culinary treat lol all the meat taste fresh, food is never stale or dry, and I like the mild salsa. Worth a try if in the area and don't let the "shack" look fool you, it's clean great food by very nice owners.
