Honestly, I am only giving 5 stars to one item: The Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  Having grown up in Buckeye, I have gone here more times than I can remember.  This place was praticially a weekly occurrence in my youth.  I have NEVER gotten anything different.  Yeah I am sure they have other food items, they may actually even be good, but they could never compare to my GCC.  I may have moved but my love for these amazingly juicy yet crispy pieces of heaven has not left.  Every time I go visit my parents I have to stop by.  

Other than that, service is so so, either you get your food in a hurry or you don't get it at all.  You should probably ask for a to-go drink cup as the regular cups are as old as my grandma and look kind of gross.  Oh and all the art on the walls is for "sale" however when I tried to buy one once no one knew how much it was or who painted it so they couldn't sell it.
