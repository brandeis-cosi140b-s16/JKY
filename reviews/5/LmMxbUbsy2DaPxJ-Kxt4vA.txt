My husband (who loves Mexican food) thinks I don't like Mexican food, because almost every time he asks if I want to go to a Mexican restaurant, I decline. Needless to say, he was rather surprised when I told him I couldn't wait to try El Dorado Cantina for dinner while we were visiting Vegas. While leaving the airport, I spotted a billboard for the restaurant, showcasing their use of organic and non-GMO ingredients. I was immediately intrigued! Since I'll only eat meat if it's organic, I was really excited to know that nearly everything on the menu would be available to me. On the first page of the menu, they list all of the vendors for every category of food they use in preparation of menu items. I love that kind of transparency! 
We started with the red sangria, which is one of the best I've ever had. St. Germain is one of my favorite liqueurs, and that is one of the unique twists they have as a part of their sangria recipe. They brought us a complimentary basket of fresh tortilla chips, with a trio of fresh, delicious house made salsas: habanero, green, and red. For dinner I ordered the pulled chicken enchilada and my husband ordered carne asada street tacos. Both came with a side of black beans and cilantro rice. They were out of this world! My husband, who has gone to Mexico countless times on business, attested to the fact that this is truly authentic Mexican fare. We closed the evening with flan for dessert. Chef Paco himself delivered our dessert, spent a few minutes talking with us, and let us know the flan was his grandmother's recipe. Never before have I tasted a flan & actually wanted more than a bite or two. We cleaned the plate, and I actually contemplated ordering a second serving! Although it is off the strip, this is a destination well worth traveling the extra mile! Our server, Enrique, was charming, funny and knowledgeable. I look forward to coming back again the next time I'm in Vegas.
