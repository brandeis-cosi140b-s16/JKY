Best kept secret in Charlotte. Fast, fresh, and cheap. Excellent daily specials, perfect tacos and nachos. They have a super beer selection but will make a downright tasty Margarita too! PLEASE, for the love of all things cheesy, try their Elite Loco! Corn on the cob the way it was meant to be eaten!
