I almost didn't go here based on yelp reviews but then decided to take a chance.  I'm glad I walked in with low expectations because I was blown away by the great food and cool ambience!

We started with the lotus chips.  They were perfectly seasoned, sliced paper thin and then deep fried.  The had a great crunch and because they were so thin they just crumpled in your mouth.  It was a great start to the meal!  Next we ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice.  This was awesome!  Both my husband (who's half Chinese so he knows his Chinese food) and I agreed that it was one of our top fried rice experiences.  They used brown rice as well so it had a nutty, and grainy texture that was very pleasant.  The Chicken Ji Song (lettuce cups) was also delicious although a bit messy with the sauce dripping onto my hand with every bite.  Lastly, we tried the Chilaquiles which is one of my husband's favorite foods.  It was delicious with the melted cheese and green tomatillo sauce! The waiter told us all the dishes are small plates meant to share but I thought the portions were quite big (especially the fried rice and Chilaquiles).  The fried rice alone is enough for a meal for one person.

I loved this place and recommend everyone to give it a try!
