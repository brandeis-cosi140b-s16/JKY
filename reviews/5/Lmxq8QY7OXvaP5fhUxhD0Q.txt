It's clearly time for me to write an update since I am the duchess and all. What can I say. I love this place. I used to hate it and judge on it hard core but let's just say I'm going through a phase where I'm reliving my younger early 20's. (If you thought to yourself, but wait! Isn't she like only 24? Then bless your heart and we should be BFF).

I mean I'm pretty much here at LEAST once a week. Most likely 2-3 times. Mostly to rage face on the weekends. Sunday Funday? DUH. I'm usually pretty hamskied by the time I walk over here but I'm pretty sure you can find me dancing somewhere around the bar. 

I can say that now have actually eaten the food here and it's def better than I thought it was gonna be. I've had brunch here before...they don't do bottomless but they do like a $15 schooner and then penny refills. Not mad at it. I can't remember what I had for brunch but I'm pretty sure I didn't eat it bc I was hung over and about to vom. But I think the bite or two that I did have were pretty tasty. The tacos are pretty good too - I've had the steak, chicken and beef cheek. Beef cheek is probs my fav. Get it. Don't be a puss. 

Hefe is in my little hot corner and I do love me some of that hot corner - it's always packed! but I think with Bottled Blonde opening up, there's been a little more breathing room. 

Hefe..hefe..hefe..**sigh** so many blurred memories. All of which I'm sure were a great time.
