They had me at fresh "handmade"flour tortillas... Sad to say that you rarely find it in the valley...corn yes, flour no...Glad I won't be having to go to Texas for some authentic Juarez burritos... 

I had the lengua burrito:it's on the spicy side but it's so good 

Hubby had Picadillo 

Daughter had the chorizo and egg 

All amazing!
Huge portions at great prices. 
Can't wait to go back and try something different
