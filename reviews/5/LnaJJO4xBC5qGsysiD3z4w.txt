I have no idea how this place has stayed under the radar for so long, maybe that really awkward location on the Boulder Highway a little south of Charleston. The food however is some of the best in Las Vegas, much better than many of the very popular and highly overrated places that I won't mention  (everyone knows them) .

Carne Asada Tampiquena, Ceviche Tostada, Mojarra mojo de ajo, Cheese enchiladas, Shrimp, and al Pastor tacos, are some of my favorites. Hell, even the Hamburguesa is good. The owner is always there and the food is fresh and cooked with care. Highly recommended. The only reason I don't go more often is that they close fairly early, about 8:00 PM.

BTW, Lowes is directly across the street.
