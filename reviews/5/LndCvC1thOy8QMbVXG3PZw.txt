SuperMex is one of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants.  I've never been to the other location off Durango and I-215, but the location at Sunset and Pecos is an old haunt that features the best Mexican food in Las Vegas (a tall order).  Open 24 hours a day, the food is great and prices are amazingly reasonable.  If you've never been to SuperMex, you've never had Mexican food in Vegas!
