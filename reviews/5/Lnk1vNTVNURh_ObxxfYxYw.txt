I was truly happy with everything this restaurant had to offer. My friend and I were seated immediately, chips and salsas brought to the table just after we sat down. Our other friend joined us soon after, drinks were brought out immediately. The service was fantastic, our waiter was Fabian.  And the food...it was spectacular. I had the chimichanga with chicken....it was huge!  My only regret is that I didn't have room  for dessert, they have some I really would like to try. Definately going to be on our list of every other Thursday dinner nights out!
