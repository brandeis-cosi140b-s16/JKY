LOVE Spotted Donkey...Originally came for happy hour and have come back multiple times for dinner. The menu is inventive and unique, they offer great drinks and awesome happy hour specials. You'll also find plenty to enjoy on the lunch and dinner menus. 

Definitely try the "Shooters". They're Jalapeno peppers stuffed with cheese and bacon, panko breaded and fried, served with a buttermilk ranch dipping sauce. As amazing as they sound, they taste even better. The rest of the HH options are also good, the taquitos and chips and salsa combo are money and all of the happy hour prices are very good. They also offer a reverse happy hour from 9-12 for those who prefer late night dining. 

For lunch or dinner you can't go wrong with the tacos or fish tostadas, and they also have an awesome burger on the menu. The service is always attentive, and the ambiance is very cool as well. On the weekends there are live mariachi bands that will play. My favorite is an all female band with a great lead singer...They're legit.

I didn't know this place existed 4 months ago, but it's become one of my favorite dinner and happy hour spots in Scottsdale. Definitely worth a visit if you haven't been yet or just haven't been in a while.
