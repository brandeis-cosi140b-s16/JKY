An ode to Chipotle.

Oh Chipotle, why do I love you so?
Is it the funky art?
Is it the Marketing campaign about the quality of your ingredients?
Is it the barbacoa that no one else has (yes, by the way)?
Why?  Oh. Why?
Is it the messages on my cup and wrappers?
Is it the pictures of your restaurants in your restaurants?
Is it the burrito that has ruined all other burritos (yes, by the way)?
Oh Chipotle, why do I love you so?
