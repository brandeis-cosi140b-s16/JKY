Finally, a Mexican joint in Tempe I can rank with some of the best places in Phoenix.  We've been looking around for a while now to find a spot that is on the same level as Mi Patio or La Santisima.  This is it.  There have been a lot of disappointments and "pretty good" places, but the prize for best Mexifood in Tempe goes to Manuel's.

For between $10 and $15, you get a big, hot plate of food with a smile from your server.  Every bite of my enchilada was loaded with cheese and meat, with a taste far more complex than that of most of the Mexican places in town.

Manuel's has been around for a while, so they know how to serve you right.  Apart from the good taste of the food, our server and even the manager came around frequently to check in on taste, drink refills, or just to see if we wanted something.  Because of this, Manuel's is now our go-to place for a sit down Mexican meal in town.
