Roberto's, Roberto's, oh how do I love your greasy, authentic goodness that is classified as Mexican food. When I lived in Las Vegas, I went to school not to far from this location, and Robert always did me good during lunch period. And, if not then, then after-hours. Oh, how I miss stumbling in to Roberto's at 3am for some of the best drunk food I've ever experienced. If you want light (as light as you can get at Roberto's), go for the taquitos with cheese and guacamole, and mix the red and green sauces at the condiment bar. My personal fav would have to be the made-to-order carne asada burrito with cheese and guacamole added also with the mixed red/green sauces. I miss it just thinking about it. One time, I ventured off and tried the breakfast burrito which was as equally tasty, but I know that the carne asada burrito missed me so I had to go back (what can I say, I'm a sucker for love).
