This place is fantastic! Food is delicious and with a very authentic Mexican flavor!!Service was excellent!! We had the quesadilla sampler as an appetizer and as a main course, my husband had the enchiladas con mole and I had one enchilada roja and one suiza. They came with rice and beans. Everything was well done, tasty and really yummy!!!
