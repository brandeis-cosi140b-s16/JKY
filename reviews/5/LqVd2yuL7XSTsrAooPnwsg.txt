5 stars ppl! Don't listen to all these nay sayers. I've never had bad service here! Yes the employees are mexican, but isn't that expected when eating where Mexican food is served. And just for the record they speak English just fine! I have been a devoted customer of chipotle 4 years! But qdoba really takes the cake. Sometime chipotle can be hit or miss qdoba is always spot on! I love the veggies they have their guacamole is great. My fiance had a quesadilla which was melt in your mouth good. I love this place. Really really love it. This location atleast. The location on Stephanie is gross but when I tried this location I was pleasantly surprised. Clean establishment. TVs on wall makes me wanna dine in. Love this place.
