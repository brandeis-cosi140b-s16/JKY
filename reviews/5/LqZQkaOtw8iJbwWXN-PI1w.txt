One of my favorite places! I've been going there for a couple years and I order the special chimi (chicken) pretty much every time and the sauce they pour over it is sooooooo good I want a whole barrel of it in my kitchen! Everything there is good I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is always friendly. It's one of those places I am sure to take my family to when they visit!
