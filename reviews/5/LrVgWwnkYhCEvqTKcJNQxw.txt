I was staying at a local hotel, craving Mexican, not the frozen kind, but the real deal.  As my luck would have it, I found it here at Los Arcos.  A great surprise on my first bite (and last one too)!  REALLY GOOD!!  It was hot, it was fresh, and it was tasty!!  They had a special drink too that I tried, also refreshingly good!  Graciela was our waitress and she had a very witty personality.  Totally enjoyed the evening and will even go out of my way to come back here!   (If I had to say one thing they could improve upon, it would be the salsa needs some work).  Still 5 stars.
