I heart this place and go every time I return to UIUC.  (Which is becoming harder to do as I get older...)

The food is delicious and what makes me want to come back.  The vegetarian combos are particularly good, too.  Mom & pop-style Mexican food - none of that Chili's/Chipotle nonsense.

Service is prompt and your food is there before you know it.  My imagination leads me to believe that there is a Dos Reales Pit Crew that is timed from order to table delivery.  Prices are reasonable and it's great for groups.  

And the margaritas, oh the margaritas. =)
