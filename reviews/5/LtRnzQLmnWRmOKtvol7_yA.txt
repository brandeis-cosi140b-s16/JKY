This place was AMAZING! My coworker recommended it, and she was right to. I went with my boyfriend and I got the pork tacos and he got the pork carnitas. Both dishes were amazing and their chips and dip weren't bad either. I would definitely go there again, especially considering how much we both love Mexican food.
