Interesting atmpsphere in this place, but it's kind of cozy when you get used to it. The food is delicious. I ordered a Coke (served chilled in a glass bottle with a glass of ice on the side), a half order of shrimp cocktail (very refreshing when it's 107F outside) and the Costa Azul (Bacon wrapped shrimp). It was delicious and I had excellent service even though the place was very busy. Obviously this is a family owned place and I like to support such places. I would recommend this place to anyone.
