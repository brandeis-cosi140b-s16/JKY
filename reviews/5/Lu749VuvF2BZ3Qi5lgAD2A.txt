Amazing! Fresh salsas and handmade tortillas-- you can't go wrong with that. Also, they are open 24 hours and serve their menu all day.  I was on my way to work and stopped through the drive -thru for breakfast tacos. Their menu is simple--tacos, burritos, quesadillas with  a choice of carne asada or pollo/bean and cheese or cheese and eggs. My breakfast taco was filled with carne asada, eggs, cheese, and fresh salsa. The salsa had just the right amount of kick. The service was fast considering how fresh it was, and very friendly. The pricing is reasonable for what you get--especially considering what you pay for other "fast" food. Would highly recommend!!!
