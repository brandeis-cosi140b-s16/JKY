These are the best tacos I've ever had.  You must try the spicy pork tacos!  

The Asada fries are great too but if you order them the half portion is more than enough for two.  The full portion could probably feed a few Poeple.

The spicy pork fries are great as well.

The line can get long especially around 1am but it's a great late night meal after a night of gambling!
