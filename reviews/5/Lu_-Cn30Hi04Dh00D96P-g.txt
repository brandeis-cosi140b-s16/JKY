I'm so excited they have reopened! I love this place! I was craving their carne asana super burrito for months while they were closed. Went back today and it's just how I remembered it. Perfect and yummy! It has a drive thru, so it makes it so much easier with a toddler and the heat. The staff is always super nice. Also, don't forgot the green sauce. So good!!!
