Typically on first Fridays this is my first stop. They seriously have the best Micheladas EVER! they totally satisfy my craving for them! I love their Menudo as well, just perfect! Once I arrived just about closing time and they still served me. I thought it was so nice of them! Great  Service! Jose is Awesome!
