I used to go here when I lived in Charlotte the First time. I recently moved back so we returned to las margaritas hoping it was as good as I remembered it.  It was better!  The prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty large (def can take half for lunch the next day).  I feel like it's def one of the more authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  No nasty velveeta like some other places in the area. My family's Mexican and when I took my parents here they both approved.  Try it out!

Ps- the carne asada is awesome!
