Usually go thru drive-thru, but went inside.
I do like they have a sink with soap and paper towels to wash your hands before you eat!

I ordered a Breakfast Burrito with Ham, it wasn't to busy so the wait wasn't long at all. They have the red and green salsa with limes, radishes, carrots, and onions.

My burrito was very hot and I had to wait to eat it as to not burn a layer of skin from my mouth, as it was cooling down enough to eat I munched on some sliced radishes and they were nice and crunchy.

So now my burrito had cooled down minimally so I doused it with red salsa that was very flavorful. Plenty of ham for sure, I swear I could hear it oinking! Potatoes, Eggs, Cheese and Ham, what a combination!

Ok time for a nap!
