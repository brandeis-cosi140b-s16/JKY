Excellent service, excellent food, and the owner even took the time to come thank us since we complemented the food and serive. Tara, our server, was phenomenal!  I'll be back here every time I'm in the area! I definitely recommend the Carne Asada, and the habanero salsa is absolutely amazing, just not for your average gringo! (I pride myself for tolerance, and it teared me up, but the flavor was grrrreat) I really do recommend coming here. Completely amazing and worth every penny.
