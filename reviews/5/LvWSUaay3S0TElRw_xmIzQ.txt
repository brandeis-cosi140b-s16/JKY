This is our third time to Spotted Donkey and it gets better each time!  The Stuffed Peppers are amazing!  Possibly the best I've ever had.  Not to mention the best Margaritas and Nachos in town!  Love the outdoor patio--especially the fireplace this time of year.  Coming back this week to check out the lunch menu.  So glad this restaurant opened in our neighborhood!  This is a "must go" place.
