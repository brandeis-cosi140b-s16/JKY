Visited today with my wife after a long hike in South Mountain Park. Wonderful greeting from the owner sincere and friendly. We had amazing barbacoa puerco (Pork), barbacoa res (Beef), Cabeza (braised meat from the head), carne asada (Ribeye) and then finally 2 bean burritos to go. Wow absolutely the best mexican food I have found in entire city. I do reviews maybe once or twice a year. We will be back as everything was fresh and flavorful and overall very clean. Give this place a try there is a reason they have 5 stars and 30 plus reviews. Side note we visit Mexican restaurants about 2 times a week and very rarely go to the same place twice. This place is going to be on my travel routes weekly. I did learn a little bit about where they source their tortillas and I also get mine from there and know how hard they can be to get ahold of.
