Without a doubt this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at! We've gone here a number of times over the years and it is a must visit when in the Phoenix area!

They have a very unique menu that is half Mexican and Asian-Fusion in my opinion some of the best food combinations have been made this way!

If it's your first visit be sure to hit up the sample area where they will sample you a number of their most popular items it's totally worth it because it will definitely help you on what to order because there is soo many awesome choices it's hard to figure out what ones to get!

They offer combo plates that come with your choice of items. When I visit I must get a Jade Chicken quesadilla it's pretty much orange chicken inside a quesadilla but oh sooo good!

For the rest of my meal I had to get their amazing black beans they are sweet and just all around good! The jerk fried rice was also over the top had a great amount of the jerk flavor with some chicken in it!

For the other half of my meal I ordered a carnitas burrito which was also really good and went very well with the delicious salsa they had up front!

If that weren't enough food they also give you a cookie with your meal generally it will be snicker doodle but on the weekends they do offer another choice on the particular Saturday we were here it was a chocolate fudge cookie! 

We definitely will be back here soon I hope as this is one of the best places you will find in Phoenix and a must bookmark for any Yelper who enjoys good food that's full of flavor!
