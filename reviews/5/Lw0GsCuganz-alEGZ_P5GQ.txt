I love Chipotle in general. I hate their anti-GMO stance and their inability to prevent horrible outbreaks of terrible diseases, but that risk is MINIMAL. Go ahead and take that as a given in all of my Chipotle reviews. I'm reviewing each of these Chipotles independently and compared to other Chipotles. This is probably my favorite Phoenix Chipotle, but it has its issues.
This particular restaurant always has pretty long lines. I've literally never experienced short lines in here. That said, they always give out generous portions. Their staff is particularly nice. I remember getting a free drink after having a nice discussion with a worker here. Seating seems a bit sparse compared to other Chipotles. It's hard to blame PV Mall for any of this considering how dead PV Mall itself is. The parking lot is also tiny and setup in a very bizarre way. How the hell is anyone supposed to get in or out of there?! I often chose this one over a closer Chipotle because of the good service. Keep up the good work.
