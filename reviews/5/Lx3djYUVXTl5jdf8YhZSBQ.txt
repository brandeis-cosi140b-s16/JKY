This place has been here for the longest and I can't believe I haven't taken advantage of it being so close to home. Not only that I was looking for healthy food that was close to my place so maybe it'll be one of the place I frequently visit. Here it is "FISH TACOS"! If you don't like seafood, or sea fare well it's fine you can order something else off the menu, but as for me I go for the new 3 taco menu sampler. Can't get any better than the Original Fish Taco Beer Battered and so good.
