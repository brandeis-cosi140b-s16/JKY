I'm writing this review from the standpoint of someone who thinks Chipoltle is overrated when it comes to big,tasty burritos, because PHX Burrito House takes the cake.

I seriously don't know why any Phoenician would ever ever ever set foot in a Chipoltle when they could go here. One, it's local. Two, it has the same options as Chipoltle (rice/beans/meat/etc) and is ten MILLION times more delicious. The carne asada falls apart in your mouth and is seasoned very well. The carnitas are amazing, and one burrito was seriously the size of my face. When I dined in, I got complimentary chips and salsa and they were delicious.

Service is probably the only difference when comparing to Chipoltle. PHX Burrito House cooks up your food and brings it out to you, thus meaning it takes a little bit longer, but it's fresher. The wait can easily be avoided by calling ahead and placing a to-go order if you're in a lunch rush. 

So next time you're craving a giant, meaty (or beany or veggie) burrito, skip the national chain and go to PHX Burrito House. You will not be disappointed.
