I can't believe people call this a "rip-off" of Chipotle just because they have similar business models. So do Qdoba and Cafe Rio, among others. This isn't a reason to like or dislike a restaurant, is it? Plus+++ Zaba's is locally owned and operated - something those other folks aren't.

Best build-your-own-burrito in town. And those nachos are to die for! The salsas are made fresh daily and too good to be true. Wheat or flour tortillas, white or brown rice, regular or sweet potato. A great selection of made-fresh and delicious food. I could easily eat at Zaba's every day of the week.
