Five stars for: considerate service. 

I have a food sensitivity, to corn. The level of sensitivity has been increasing over the years. At first it exhibited itself in the corn starch of egg drop soup. But as time has passed I find more and more corn associated food items result in producing in me the symptoms of a diabetic attack: heart palpitations, sweats, nausea, some cramps and general malaise.

I arrived at Blanco for happy hour and ordered the guac (nutritious and tasty) and cheese dips. I asked my server and later the deliverer whether there were any alternatives to the corn chips, explaining my allergy. I was advised there was not, so I requested some flour tortillas to be served with my dip and they were.

As I was tearing off pieces of my flour tortilla and spreading it with guac, contentedly munching on my repast...Shane, one of my bartenders, noticed and approached asking in a concerned tone whether my chips had not yet been delivered. I reassured him that I had declined them and explained why.

Shane and Nikki are the bartenders who attended me that evening. They are both satisfactorily attentive and courteous. Additionally, Shane...well he is pleasant to look at.

Shane returned a few moments later to discourse again. He commented that he too has a corn allergy. He asked whether my allergy was severe enough to cause problems eating something fried in the same grease as corn. It is not (yet) and I responded as such.

A few minutes later, I was served a bowl of fried flour tortilla chips.
