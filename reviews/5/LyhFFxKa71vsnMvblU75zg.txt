We've spent some serious time traveling through Madison the last couple months and over and over again we heard about Salvatore's Tomato Pies. 

And we're like "okay," I hear you, but I live on the road and everybody everywhere recommends a place that has "the best" pizza anywhere. And I've learned that the "the best pizza anywhere" isn't everywhere, because it's actually in Madison. At Salvatore's Tomato Pies. 

Really. Perhaps it's not at all relative that I spend most of my time in Chicago, but maybe it is. They have good pizza there and I've had a lot of it. But this place is "MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE IN THE WORLD."

The flavors are focused. The crust is cared for and cooked perfectly. The combos are creative but not overly so. Classics taste better. "Classics" are redefined? 

Temperature. So often overlooked. But not here. When the pizza hits the table it's at perfect eating temperature. No mouth scalding night ending sizzling runny cheese. 

Many of us in humanity don't have the self control to wait for the pizza to cool and the cheese to set. It's a sensible thing to do, but how often do we go to a pizza place simply to be sensible? I appreciate and value that they take the time to let the cheese set and pizza cool before they place it in front of me. Thanks. 

I believe a good beer list should be small,  thought out, deliberate and fresh. They have it nailed down. Never in my life would I imagine walking into a  non assuming pizza joint and having a Jolly Pumpkin Seasonal Ale while I wait for my food. Everyone was able to pick out a beer that they were excited about, and the decision process is made easy by having a thought out and limited beer menu. 

Thanks.  Glad to have found my favorite pizza place in the whole wide wold. 

Chris.
