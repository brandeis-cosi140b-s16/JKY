I have been to Salt and Lime three times now and it's safe to say I will be back many more. Two of the times have been with my crazy toddler and everyone has been so great with her! They bring her drink and food quickly and help with anything she needs. The service has been excellent each time, everything comes out correctly and quickly. The food is awesome, and their happy hour specials are amazing! I have tried almost all their tacos and love the combinations! The braised short rib was my favorite, with The ahi tuna being a close second. I really enjoyed the pineapple salsa out of all of their salsa choices! So good, can't wait to go back!
