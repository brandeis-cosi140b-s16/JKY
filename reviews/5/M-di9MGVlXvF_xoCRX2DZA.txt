I never thought there'd be a place that rivals Roberto's Tacos.  This is the place!  A FOOT LONG Char Chicken Burrito for a STEAL!

The place is where the old Popeyes Chicken was.  They painted and spruced it up.  I came here with a friend and our food was ready within minutes of ordering.  It was fresh, it was BIG, it was delicious and I felt like I got way more than my money's worth - which is important these days.

There is a salsa bar off to the side as well.  This food is a great value.  I will be trying this place out again soon for sure!
