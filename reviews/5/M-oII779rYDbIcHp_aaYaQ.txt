I have loved Fili'B's since high school and this one is the best one I have found since the old fav in Mesa by our HS. They make a slightly different red sauce here but it is way better so that makes a difference and there rolled tacos are always good and crunchy just how I like them and I have a pretty low bar with food but rolled tacos are not their best when they get kinda soggy and I like to pick this up after work and its all still good & crunchy by the time I get home. After coming here so often the last few years (literally a few nights a week the last few months as we have put most of our stuff in storage as we move) I can honestly say this is my favorite location. They have made some mistakes like any fast food places but they have always been very friendly even when I point it out & they were always happy to be helpful & wanting to get it right. I've also done some really large orders for family stuff and they were awesome each time even the time I gave them no notice because it was very last min, all the employees have been great & do not even let a silly thing like our language barrier get in the way of good food and service- thanks to everyone who works there :)
