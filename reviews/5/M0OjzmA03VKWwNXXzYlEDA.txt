I'm a Texan currently living in Columbia, SC.  I have to drive 98 miles to get to Chuys because No where in SC knows how to properly make Mexican food?!?  Well anyways this place is the closest to Texas I can get..  Been to the one in Fort Worth too many times to count and I have only managed to check into this location 1 time but have been here at least 20 times.(probably overwhelmed with excitement I don't have anytime to get anything in except this amazingness in my belly!) 

I usually start off with the jalape√±o ranch dip(if you don't about this.... ORDER IT!) and queso..  I usually eat so much I have no room for anything else..  But we are going to pack this in like golf through a straw!  I then prepare myself for a Chuychanga (a fried chicken burrito?!?!?!) which usually comes out so fast that I'm not ready for it.  

If you're craving Mexican food and live in SC .....  This place is a must try!  Because if you had Mexican food in SC ..  Your judgement on Mexican food is very cloudy and I understand why it wouldn't be your first choice.  But I guarantee you that you have been missing out on this your entire life!  Nooooow go get you some!
