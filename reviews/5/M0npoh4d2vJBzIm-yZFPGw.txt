The food here is delicious. I like how fresh everything is here. The owner is really nice too. This is also hidden in the food court by CSN. The food is made in a timely manner and never disappoints. I reccomend the fish tacos and the steak tacos. I usually get 3 or 4 with a side of rice. (The Asian in me, lol). The salad with the tortilla bowl is quite delicious too. I intend to try many more things on the menu. I thought I could only like the Mexican food made at home by my second mom until I tried it here. Delicious!
