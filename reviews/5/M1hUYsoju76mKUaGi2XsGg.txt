I looked up top Mexican restaurants in Madison and this placed popped up. I read all the reviews and I'm the same as the rest. I've driven by this place before, but never thought to stop by. I regret my life choices. Every time I've settled for east side Pedro's. Every time I've settled for Taco Bell. Every time I've decided to try some new Mexican place. I regret every single time. This place is AMAZING. Since finding it three or so months ago, I've gone at least a dozen times. Their ingredients are just so fresh and delicious. I've never had better Mexican food.

Funniest thing, they don't really speak English well. The first two times my boyfriend and I went they thought we wanted the spicy, pickled onions. We were kind of annoyed, but didn't want to cause a fuss. The first two times we had it we hated it. Now we've grown to love it and neither of us will get the pork burrito without it.
