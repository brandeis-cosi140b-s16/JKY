The wife and I have been searching for a good Mexican joint since we moved to AZ seven months ago. Until today, we hadn't had any luck. (My wife is from West Texas, so we're a little picky about our Mexican food.)

We absolutely loved this place. I had the chorizo breakfast, she had the machaca breakfast, and we shared a bowl of pozole. It was all amazing. It tasted like a party in our bocas!  

This is definitely our new Sunday morning hangover breakfast spot!
