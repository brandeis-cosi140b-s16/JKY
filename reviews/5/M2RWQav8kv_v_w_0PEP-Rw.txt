You need only one reason to come here: chili verde nachos.  The chili verde is too good.  It has my boyfriend and I driving 20 minutes there and back just for it. The tacos are good too from what I've tried.  The menu is kind of hard to follow at first and cluttered with tons of photos.  Probably why we stuck with what we knew in the beginning; but then we branched off to the "special items" listed next to the register.  Chili verde nachos is where it's at.  I crave these things constantly.  Melt in your mouth good... just beware of the hidden jalapenos in there if you are sensitive to spicy.
