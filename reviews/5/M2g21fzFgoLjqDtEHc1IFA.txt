Loved this place! I am from out of town - here for our son's graduation from UW Madison grad school - and, as a native of New Mexico and a student of Mexican food throughout the US, I can enthusiastically recommend Pascual's. Nothing fancy, but good nonetheless. This is a fast food place - think Qdoba or the like - but service, price, and food are all well above average. Very busy tonight by the way, which seems in opposition to the so- so Yelp ratings. Try it!
