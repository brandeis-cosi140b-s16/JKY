Love it when a place is fast food and doesn't taste like it. 

Carambas is my go to when I need a quick Mexican food fix without killing my wallet. 

Pollo Fundido is great, the salsas are awesome and put together from scratch. 

What's even cooler is that they have a little mini bar at this location.  The other locations don't have that from what I've seen.

Love it that they are home grown too.
