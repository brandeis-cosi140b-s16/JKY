Okay 5 stars because they are the alternative to Filibertos style food, without the Filibertos taste.

Its pretty clean and they have a nice salsa bar.  Menu is a little cluttered but they have many combos and different types of items.  If you are lost, order a carne asada burrito.  if u dun like guacamole, order a green chili burrito (pork with green sauce)  real good.

what else do i like about this place, price wise, its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places.  U order at the front, pay and get your own food and drinks and bus the trays after.  

its also 24 hours, so whats not to like ?
