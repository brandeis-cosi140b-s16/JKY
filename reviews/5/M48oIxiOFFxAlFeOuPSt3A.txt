Had lunch here with a group of friends.  EXCELLENT!!!!!  We ate outside because the weather was nice and the atmosphere was so relaxing with the water feature going.  Everyone in the group was very pleased with the food.  The prices are very reasonable, service was great and the portions are substantial.  You can't go wrong with lunch here.
