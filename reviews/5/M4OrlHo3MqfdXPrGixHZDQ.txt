After a day of sightseeing around the Strip, we wanted to eat something that was not a chain.  So when we spotted Tacos Mexico we immediately pulled into the lot.  There is nothing fancy about this place, but the food... oh dear lord the food.  Everything was delicious and spicy and super authentic.  Nothing was overpriced and the service was quick and friendly.  The only thing we found to be a tad bit lacking was the lack of sides with some of the meals, particularly the burrito and the torta.  But the flavors were outstanding and exactly what you should expect from a Mexican eatery.  Definitely hit this place up the next time you're in Vegas.
