If you want to know my review of the food for this place, read my review of Guanajuato Taqueria... they clearly still have the same chef, with different owners.

The place now seems to be owned by an older white couple, that is, if it wasn't already. But the couple was there when I went recently and they had never been there any of my previous visits when it was called Guanajuato Taqueria.

So, after the remodel/renaming/reopening the place looks cleaner, nicer and better lit. The food is just as amazing, the service is just as good. Just as I am about to leave the city I've loved and called home for six years to go to New Orleans, I wish that people would make this the popular Madison Mexican restaurant! GO and EAT!
