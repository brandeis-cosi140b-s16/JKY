Excellent food at a fair price and far better than the chains of the same vein. A nice family owned business welcomed in a growing neighborhood. Perfect if you're across the street at Honeywell or Midwestern U, but easy to get to since it's a mile south of the north valley 101. Get a Rumba Burrito with pork, your choice of fixings and hot green salsa. You won't regret it. You can even grab a cold beer to wash it down.
