Best tacos in town by far!!
Can't beat the price either.
With two locations in the valley that are always CLEAN and really nice staff you're sure to make this an enjoyable experience.. Highly recommended from carne Assad tacos to Barbacoa.. they have very good tortillas and a salsa bar ...  I love this taco shop
