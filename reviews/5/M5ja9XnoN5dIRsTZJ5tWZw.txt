Why the low reviews? Their burritos could not be better.  However that is all I ever order so I'm not speaking to the other stuff.  The burritos are giant. In fact I always eat half one day and the other for another meal. The beans are so yum and the creamy rice I'm still trying to copy in the kitchen. If u r not too hungry get the kids burrito meal a light version or a midday snack for around 3 bucks. They have a lemonade bar which is also fun and changes from time to time.  They r busy but always seem to have searing both indoors and outdoors.
