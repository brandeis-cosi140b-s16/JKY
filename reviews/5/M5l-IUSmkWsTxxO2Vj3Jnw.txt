This is one of my favorite places in the Valley to eat and Barrio is my favorite place to take friends who come to visit.  The atmosphere, service, drinks and food are great.  The table side guacamole with the pomegranate is very good (we always try to duplicate it at home) and the cochinita pibil is unreal.  Park in the back of the building and check out the cool art that is painted on the building walls and fences along the alley.
