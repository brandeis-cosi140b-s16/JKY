Have you checked out the Chipotle website?  How cool!   How about their decor?  I want to hire their designer for my future kitchen!  

Now I remember why I loved Chipotle so much in college.  This is such a great spot when you are looking for really simple, fresh 'Mexican' food.  

5 stars for free food for teachers!  THANK YOU CHIPOTLE!!  This location did an amazing job with crowd control on teacher appreciation day.  Thanks to the manager for his great attitude and crowd control as we teachers lined up in hordes for our free tacos.  I had a chicken salad with all kinds of deliciousness on top and was very happy with my choices!

This is such a great location in relation to my place and I will for sure be back!!!
