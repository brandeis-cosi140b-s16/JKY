Verde/ Vert/ zelenyee doesnt matter how you say it; green carries many connotations in the mind. whether it be envy, nature, ralph nader, or mean joe, "verde" brings to mind many things. All that changed for me when i experienced CenPho's verde on saturday morn. My world was rocked, a sea change had come and with it a paradigm shift in what i associate the word verde with: from now on verde for me will mean delicious. Palo Verde trees now make me hungry...
After a long nights revels this last first friday i awoke to a blinding headache and pained back from a restless sleep on concrete with a gnawing hunger that could propel a lesser man to rob a chinese take out at gunpoint. We roamed the streets towards the saturday market, the vendors were just settling in, and the food options- while all nice in their own way, couldn't dispell the ravenous hunger that plagued me. we settled for coffee and cigarettes, but those only distracted us for so long. We espied the token line surrounding Matt's Big and pondered whether we could withstand the wait.
And then it hit us, a slight breeze and with it the smell of fresh tortillas and meat cooked in a wood burning stove feuled by mesquite.
We headed towards the aroma, our nostrils our guides. We ambled into Verde like refugees.
I ordered a $5 breakfast burrito of green chili pork pinto bean and egg.
Biting into this plump and delicious burrito was like a first kiss. sparks flew, i was in love; smitten with the savory goodness that radiated happiness and nourishment throughout my body. It seemed criminal to have only paid $5 for something so delictible!
