Let's face it, anyone can fry up some tortillas, throw on some lettuce, onions, diced tomatoes, a little meat, and some salsa or hot sauce.  That's not what this is.  This place should be called "Taco el Perfection" because that's what it is.  Taco y Taco has nothing on the delicious, perfect recipes that this place has put together.  Every taco we ate was divine.  Beware of the 15 minute wait at lunch... it's worth the wait so much that we waited in line a second time to get more tacos.    And it's cheap!  Damn, this place is good!
