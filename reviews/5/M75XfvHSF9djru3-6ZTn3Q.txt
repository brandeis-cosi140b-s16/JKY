If you are looking for authentic mexican food, you have found it! This is the only place in the Charlotte area that I have found to actually be authentic! My husband is from mexico and he even agrees this is not just some americanized or texmex food! I am very impressed by the quality and portion sizes here and I have been here numerous times and will continue to return! The staff are all latina ladies that don't speak much English, but they sure know good food! The customers are usually all hispanic which is another good sign that this food is delicious!
