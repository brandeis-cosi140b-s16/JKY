I have reviewed Richardson's before, but I wanted to give a quick update on Happy Hour. We came from seeing a play at Phoenix Theatre and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had always heard about the happy hour, but never caught it before. 

Turns out that we were very lucky! During happy hour the small plates are $5, glasses of wine at $5, and draft beers at $5. This makes the place fairly reasonable. As for the food, we had Green Chili Sliders (outstanding), Carne Adovada Sliders (outstanding), Chicken Skewers (darn good), and Tostadas (crunchy and tasty). There are maybe 4 or 5 more things you can choose from. 

The only hitch is you have to sit at the bar or in the cove (a closed in patio area). Small price to pay.

N*Joy...
