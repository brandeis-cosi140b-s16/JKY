Food is fantastic. Service is fantastic. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for some authentic Mexican that has a bit of a flare. The Windy City fries are out of this world, and the Barbacoa burrito was on point. Great food decent prices. Definitely a gem- of which I will be returning to very soon!
