I love this place. Chicken fajita, chicken enchiladas, and tortilla soup are my regular selections. And some fried ice cream if I went running that morning :)

I sometimes call to get it to go on my way home from work, and it's packaged by the time I get there, and always hot when I get home.

Tastes amazing, and is nicely priced. Always clean inside as well!
