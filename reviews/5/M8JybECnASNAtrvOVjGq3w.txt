This place is awesome! I lived a few blocks away from this place for years before trying it with an entertainment book coupon. From the first visit my wife and I were hooked. I've tried numerous items and have loved them all. The bean queso dip and salsa served with the chips are both delicious. In the summer they have 99 cent margaritas. Everything I have tried there tastes freshly prepared and full of flavor. Nothing is too spicy and there is so much variety on the menu. The service staff is always friendly but can be slow on occasion when it's busy. The kids menu is generous and includes churros and ice cream.  This is my favorite Mexican restaurant and I highly recommend to anyone.
