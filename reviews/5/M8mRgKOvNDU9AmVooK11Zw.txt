Cute, cozy, pleasant and very friendly service. That is really all I have to say about them. The food was oh so delicious! Little bite sized tacos. Service was fast and just perfect! They even use the square card reader on their iPad to charge cards. Which truly shows its a small and quaint restaurant.
