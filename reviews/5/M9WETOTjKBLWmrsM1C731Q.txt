Phenomenal food, excellent service, and really cute decor.  I love this place.  No matter what I order the food is amazing.  The horchata is completely delicious and the serving is huge.  I had the burrito and it was amazing.  Everyone I was with ordered something different and we all loved our meal. I'll be back, again and again.
