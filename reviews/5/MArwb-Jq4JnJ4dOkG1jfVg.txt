This pizza was AMAZING!! There was a little bit of a wait, and my mother had to ask to get a seat a bit faster because of her being diabetic, they were so kind and willing to help.  The server was really kind, explained all the ingredients down to where they came from, and suggested his favorite. We had two pizzas, both were delicious. I feel like it was the first time I have had a REAL pizza. The mozzarella is to die for! Only complaint: They aren't open Mondays :)
