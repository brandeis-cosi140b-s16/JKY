Love this place!! Our server, Jesse, was absolutely the best server we have had in a very long time. Great food, great service. Amazing atmosphere. I have always enjoyed coming here. Just steer clear of the server with glasses and his hair pulled back in a pony tail that looks like he hasn't washed it in a year.
