We came here during restaurant week last year and it blew our minds. I heard good things before, but really, it started with their award winning drinks. I recall a blood orange margarita that was amazing and then the almejas, which is a Peruvian stew, touched every part of my heart. I got the scallops and split my honeys entree, which I think we're tacos? I can't help but recommend this place to people. I wish it wasn't so loud though. I guess that's part of the Scottsdale thing though! Worth the wait for sure.
