We came for the Sema show and found this place on yelp. When it comes to mexican food there are soo many places to choose from in Vegas. 

This place was a few miles from the strip, I don't think I've ever been that far away from the strip but it was definitely worth it. 

Everything was fresh, tasty, hot and authentic. It was a Saturday night and they had live music. Will definitely come back next time we are in town.
