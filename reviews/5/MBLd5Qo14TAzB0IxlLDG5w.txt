I would never imagine getting freshly made burritos inside of a gas station? Best food decision I made today!!

It was the tail end of this employees day but you would never know it. We ordered two burritos (carne asada burrito and a Cali burrito) and got them pretty quickly since there were only a few people inside. The food was delicious!! And the salsa was also kind of amazing! He's truly a hard worker, friendly, and stays busy in between customers. 

I'll probably be back this week... :) glad I stopped in today!
