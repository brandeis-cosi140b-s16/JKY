Been a Zabas fan ever since the first one opened here. Always loved Chipotle but since I've discovered Zabas, I haven't eaten there in years! Just imagine Chipotle's bigger brother....on steroids...or should I say a health kick?

They have everything they have and more. A choice between white and brown rice, a choice between white or wheat tortillas and a whole lot more! And they have Coke Zero! Whoot Whoot Holla!!!

Staff is quick and know what they are doing! This location even offers free WiFi! I recommend everyone to try this place and jump off the Chipotle bandwagon!
