Ok, it's my first time here - and won't be my last! Pleasant surroundings, friendly staff, and outstanding food!

The place is very clean, and open. In cooler months, the patio would be a good choice.

Julie was very friendly and helpful. As soon as I said it was my first visit, she offered samples. That helped me decide between Green Chile and Machaca Beef. Both tasted great, but I gave the nod to the Machaca. The beef was tender and oh so flavorful! I was also undecided between a standard burrito or enchilada style, and the staff recommended that I get it plain.

My order came quickly. The tortilla was fresh and tender, and the burrito was incredible! Very moist and well spiced. Next time I'll try the Green Chile, maybe enchilada style.

Highly recommended!
