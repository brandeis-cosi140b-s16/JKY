Canteen is a great place for food and drink on Mill Avenue.  The place is spacious and the crowd isn't just the college aged crowd.  There is a great mix of people of all ages.  The bar menu is extensive, especially if you like tequila.  The food is also really good and they have a great happy hour.  Canteen always throws great events and parties.
