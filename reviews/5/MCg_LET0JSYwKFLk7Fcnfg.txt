This is a definite must try if you are craving Mexican food in the area. Everything is quite delicious, and fresh. I love the fact this restaurant is somewhat health conscious (as much as you can with Mexican food.) They actually use Canola oil in replacement of adding lard, as well as offering other dishes off the menu to cater to those wanting something a little different. All meats are of high quality as well as very fresh sauteed vegetables (try the fajitas.) 

So if you are in the mood for mexican, stop by, check it out and grab a margarita while you are at it. You cannot go wrong here.
