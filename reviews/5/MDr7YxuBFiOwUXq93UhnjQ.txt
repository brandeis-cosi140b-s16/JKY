These tamales are DELICIOUS!!!!!   Do yourself a favour and go here.  The website recommends calling first, which is a great idea.  Not only to find out if they have what you need available that day, but also to see if they're open.  They don't necessarily open right at 8 or 9, but the tamales are WELL worth it.

Best tamales I've ever eaten.
