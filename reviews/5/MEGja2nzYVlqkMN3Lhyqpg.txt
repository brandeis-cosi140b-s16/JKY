We love this place... #16 and Lengua taco are our favorite...their chips are the best in town, fresh and warm also the salsa bar is to die for with varieties and freshness, almost forgot to mention about the prices that are very reasonable.  We like to support local who care about quality and service. I definitely recommend this place!
