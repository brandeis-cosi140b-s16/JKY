I can't imagine an authentic mexican seafood restaurant (in a questionable strip mall) being any better than this. Our waiter could not have been nicer. The shrimp empanadas were great, and the accompanying lime chile sauce was INCREDIBLE. My eyes were watering from the heat and I couldn't....stop...eating.

Everything else (guac, chicken burrito, fish diabla) were SO much better than your normal mexican place. Prices were very reasonable. Can't expect anything more.

Go now!
