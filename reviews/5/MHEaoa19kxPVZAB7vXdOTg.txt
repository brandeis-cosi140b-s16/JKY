This place has everything. Their torta selection is extensive. I had the Mexicana and it was made with everything delicious: steak, mushrooms, peppers, saut√©ed onions and lots of avocado. I want to try a paqueme next time. The limon agua fresca was also refreshing. 

If we didn't have to run to catch a Dodgers spring training game, I would have stayed to have one of their colorful pastries or enjoy a paleta. 

Definitely going back when we're in the area again.
