Lifetime Burritos Consumed (LBC): 12,081

So seriously, this is the absolute freshest burrito place in the West Valley. 

NOT CHIPOTLE. NOT FILIBERTOS. 

Extremely flavourful HOT meat choices;  home-style tortillas, fresh and unique burro stuffing like cabbage salad; fresh-grilled green chilis, and mango salsa.  

My favorite item on the menu? Macho Sauce: a fiery, spicey, smooth salsa that always make the hubby throw in the towel early, "It blows the doors off my mouth!"

Prices are fine considering the taste and freshness. Absolutely love 'designing' my meal to my specifications! I get it right every time.
