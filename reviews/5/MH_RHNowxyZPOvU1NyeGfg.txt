It's a little sad how many times I've been here and been buzzed or flat out drunk. And when I wake up the next morning with burrito wrappers in bed with me I think, Hey, at least *something* came home with me last night. Then I eat the extra burrito I drunk ordered and call it a good day.

Okay, seriously, this place is wunderfundle! Whenever I'm heading home late on a Friday, this is my final stop before going home. While the tacos are probably some of the best I've ever stuffed in my face, the bean and cheese burrito is my standard order. Two of those bad boys, actually. And in a pinch, they're in the lot with Charlie's. You know, for times when I want more than a burrito in bed.
