The happy hour at this place is awesome and having a reverse happy hour menu is always a bonus! The fact that they're open after 3am is a major plus because there are very few places open that late that isn't Filibertos. The service is always fast and courteous, & the food is consistently pleasant at a great price. I've come here multiple times and have brought friends who have had nothing but good things to say! I will definitely be frequenting this place more often.
