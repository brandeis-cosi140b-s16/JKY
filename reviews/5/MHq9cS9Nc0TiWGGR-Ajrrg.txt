This place is a great location. Right on Camelback and 16th Street.
 When you are running errands you can stop in here for a really delish meal. 
Every thing i have ever ordered here has been very good. Prices are good, the place is really clean. You have to watch the spice it can be a little hot for me though. I love it, and highy recomend it to you.
