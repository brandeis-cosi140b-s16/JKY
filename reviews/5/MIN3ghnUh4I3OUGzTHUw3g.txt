Omg! The manager is amazing!

Had to come all the way back because they got my online to-go order wrong. Expecting to have to be defensive when the manager came out he was so nice and offered to make me an entire new one! Schocked because all he had to do was add what was forgotten. But I did appreciate it because by the time I went home and went back to the store the food was wayy cold.

10 Stars for the way he handled my problem!
