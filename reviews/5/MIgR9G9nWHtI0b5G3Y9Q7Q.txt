Squash Blossom is closed, replace by this awesome Mexican joint. From the art on the walls to the cocktails served in real glasses to the live music and flamenco dancer, this place has improved by no less than 3,000%. 

Let's face it, Squash Blossom was a little weird. It always felt like one of those motel restaurants you eat at when you're driving through bat country. The new look and feel is definitely less weird, and in fact has a great ambiance. 

We went for an appetizer and drink, just to check it out. We had the guacamole, which was fantastic. Very fresh and lime-y, with an added bonus of what I believe to be currants, but may have been craisens. Either way, it was delish. We also had the quesadilla, which was fried. It's hard to mess up fried cheese, and this did not disappoint. Served with fresh tortillas, this was a perfect snack before a night out on the town. 

I asked the waitress (who was super nice and very helpful) what her favorite cocktail was, and she recommended The Bull. I don't know what was in it, but DAMN was it good. All I know is there was fresh lime juice. Highly recommended. 

To top it off, the kitchen is open late, which is a great addition for downtown Phoenix, because that's an area we are currently lacking in. They are open for brunch on Sunday, I can't wait to try it out!
