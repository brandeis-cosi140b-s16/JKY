i was on this burrito quest last week. every day after painting i would stop by a different mexican food dive and try a burrito.  this is definitely one of the top states for mexican food (IMHO).

i remember seeing these "berto" burrito places popping up in phx (roberto's knock-offs) from san diego.

if you want a $4-out-the-door burrito the size of a tennis ball can, all meat and no rip-off filler (beans, rice, lettuce) then this is your place.  in a vain attempt to stave off my trigliceride killjoys, i ordered a chicken burrito.

when the server handed it to me out the take-out window the bag nearly ripped under the 2 lb. load (this was 1 burrito mind you)

as i commandeered my nissan frontier while simultaneously shifting, steering, signaling, pouring red and green hot sauce on the opening of the tree stump sized burrito and attempting to masticate the tender juicy shreds of fowl...alas, i was only able to consume 3/4 of the monster.

a feat that i could easily have done had i gone to any other burrito barn.  if you're a cheap-chinese like me and my wife, you can easily give her a 1/3 and you get 2/3 and be 90% satisfied (just go home and eat a peanut butter sandwich) and you're good to go.

way worth it
