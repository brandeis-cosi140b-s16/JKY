Excellent food.  More cost than fast food but you get what you pay for.  Best Mexican cuisine in the West Valley I can find.  Portions are large.   The burrito enchilada style could probably feed 2.  It is small (15 chairs) so take home is probably best.  Get the green chili... it is sweet and spicy and worth every bite.
