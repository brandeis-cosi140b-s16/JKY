I was very saddened to see this Qdoba ranked so low on Yelp, so I decided to try to boost its average.  

We frequent this particular Qdoba in the University area about once a week and have had nothing but fantastic experiences, quality service, and fabulous tasting food!  In fact, I've mentioned during lunch how we see the same people working week after week and how they've got it together.  I've been to many other Qdoba (and other similar burrito restaurants) and have yet to find a staff that is more consistent in their quality service and delivery of fresh, tasty food.  

Now, onto Qdoba's food.  I think I've tried practically every single item on the menu by now.  Their chicken choices definitely top my list over their steak (sometimes tough), beef (sometimes greasy), and pork (usually dry).  The chicken, in the words of Goldilocks, is "just right."  Every time.  The regular chicken burrito (with extra hot salsa, please!) is always a winner.  However, when I'm in the mood for something with a little more pizzazz, I go with the pesto chicken burrito or formerly, the retired mole chicken burrito.   And when I'm in the mood for something naughty, I go with the queso chicken burrito.  The Naked Burritos (without the tortilla, for you low-carbers) are good...but I leave still feeling hungry.  

Since we go to Qdoba regularly, we've signed up for the Qdoba Card, earn points each time we visit, and have gotten a handful of free burritos over the past few years.  It's a great rewards program for something we already enjoy!
