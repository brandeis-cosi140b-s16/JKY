A authentic place with a small salsa bar. This place is very close to those in the LA and SD areas.  
A must is the carne asada  burrito, torta's, or for sharing, asada fries or nachos! Breakfast is pretty good here too, plenty of chorizo dishes! 
The Chicken is ok, with the Carnita's being the better choice. 
The salsa rojo and verde is not too bad, plenty of flavor and heat!
The cooks are pretty cool, order in spanish! 
Very easy on the wallet and it's open late!
