I enjoy both authentic Mexican tacos and excellent variations of the originals. The restaurant offers both. The simple and delicious street style tacos are as good as the ones cooked on the carts on the side of the streets in Mexico. The shrimp taco was also divine. The salsa bar was a treat. The chips were just ok.
