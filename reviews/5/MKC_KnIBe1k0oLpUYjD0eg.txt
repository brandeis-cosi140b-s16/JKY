Been eating at this restaurant my whole life, and I have always loved it.  The food hasn't changed in 25 years.  Jade red chicken is obviously a favorite here.  The cuban black beans and jerk fried rice are the two perfect sides to go with.  You can order any of the meats here inside a burrito or quesadilla too, for some variety :D
