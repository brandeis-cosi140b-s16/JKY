Ate here for lunch today! BOMBERS!! I had the beef flautas and the meat was tender and oozing out the ends, the salsa was on point, my husband and I will definitely be returning!!

It was clean when we walked in and the line moved quickly. Also I thought the food was reasonably priced. They give you a number and bring your food out to you. All the food I saw coming out the kitchen looked ahhmazing! Worth a visit!
