If you haven't been to a chipotle you should. And if you're looking for a good one try this one! The staff has always been top notch and the food prepared exactly to specs. The times I have put in online orders they were always on time and the one time that it wasn't they gave me a free drink while I waited! The manager and employees all seem to enjoy their work and that always shows in a meal. Nothing but good things to say about this place!
