I got to say this is the best mexican seafood in Vegas since I moved from Los Angeles. The service was great. Even tho its hidden in a small cornered location , once you're in you're in a totally different  atmosphere. My family felt like if we where in a beach with the murals painted on the wall. The food was excellent, the molcajete withe the 3 meats was the best with the home made tortillas! along  with  the  mojara frita(fried tilapia whole fish) I'm definitely coming back. Not that  far from the strip either!

Ps I recommend the micheladas and horchata
