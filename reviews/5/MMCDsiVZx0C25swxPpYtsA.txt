We've been frequenting here for five years now and their food is always consistent.  Service is great.  My only complaint - well, there's 2 - is they are SUPER busy during lunch hours and the parking isn't so great.  If you go off peak, no problem.  As far as Chipotles go, this one definitely passes muster!
