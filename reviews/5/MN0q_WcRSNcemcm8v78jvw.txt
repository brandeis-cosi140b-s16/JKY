I am new to Vegas and was looking for some good, authentic Mexican food. Well I definitely found it at Pepe's. Happy I was referred here because I'm officially a customer as long as I live here. I got a burrito two days ago and now that I'm typing this I'm salivating. Go get one- you won't regret it!
