I grew up eating La Casita in Mammoth, which is owned by the same family. I have also eaten at their other family owned restaurants in Globe and Showlow, and this one is my favorite. The food is always great and the service is fast and friendly. The beans are tough to beat and their bean burro enchilada style is always a must. I just wish we lived closer so we could eat here once a week.
