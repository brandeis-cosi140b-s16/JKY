Located on the quieter side of the strip- on the North side I came here on a suggestion from a friend. This place has an awesome happy hour with drinks at $5 each. The Big Stick and the Sol margaritas were deliciously strong and my go-to. The happy hour bar menu is also awesome with a variations of Mexican dishes at a really great price. I enjoyed the quesadillas the most- and do you wanna know why?! Because they came with guac, pico de gallo and sour cream, and the pico de gallo was actually DELICIOUS. We also tried the fish and lobster tacos. I'm a fan of the fish although my friend preferred the lobster. I also really loved the bar tender whose name I didn't manage to get but she's a really kind lady with long blonde hair. Very attentive and polite. Def a place I would come back to if I ever came to Vegas again.
