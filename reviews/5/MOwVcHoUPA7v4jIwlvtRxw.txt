The wife and I try to hit up Maria's at least once a month.  The food is no-thrills, and yet amazing.  If anything, I highly recommend the street tacos.  It's a full meal for under $5.00 and the food's ready in about 5 minutes.  Make sure to grab a bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola or a large cup of horchata.  Highly recommended.
