Oh, Felipito's how you've come to my rescue time and again!  Do NOT eat here if you don't appreciate a good measure of grease with your Mexican food or if you're squeamish about ordering out of a food hut.  But, let me tell you, that will be your fault because no one has Felipito's beat for Mexican fast food.  Not even that other place.  You all know the one.

First of all, the 24 hour drive thru is an absolute godsend.  3 AM burrito cravings are strong, unignorable, annoying things and Felipito's will satisfy that quickly.  Everything here is freakin' yumtastic, and they even give you enough salsas to keep even the biggest sauce fiend happy.  Once, my friend Pouncy and I shared such a delightfully greasy quesadilla that we had to actually wring it out and thereby invented the Felipito's Wringing Out the Quesadilla dance, a gyration that's remained popular for over three years now.  Any place that incites such a lasting movement surely is worthy of a visit.
