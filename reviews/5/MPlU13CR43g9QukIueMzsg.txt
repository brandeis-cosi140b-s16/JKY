Breakfast Burritos - Get them here. You may find other "fancy" places that put arugula and avocado in their breakfast burritos and charge you $12 per, not here. If you come to Fausto's, you're here for the meat, cheese, and potatoes mixed together in a fresh tortilla to make one huge burrito for under 5 bucks. All you need to do is load up on salsa and get down to business. 

Everything else here; get it, eat it. 

I am a vegas native that now lives in Chicago and is taking Xanax because I can't eat this everyday.
