This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  

You should definitely try the various versions of their Guacamole and their Ceviche.  It is so hard to find a good ceviche besides going down to Costa Rica and they do it well here.  Their specialty tacos are a great option if you want to try various flavors, but the other entrees they have are great as well.  

This has a great location in Scottsdale Quarters and has outdoor dining as well.  If you are looking for some great food and margaritas, I would head over to check it out.  At night this place is typically crowded, but it is very easy to find a table during the day.
