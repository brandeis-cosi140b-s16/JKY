Great Food, Great Service.  My husband and I were greeted as soon as we walked through the door.  We were asked if we had ever been which we replied "no".  We got a very  ice explanation of the menu and how it works.  My husband got the carnitas burrito and I opted for the carnitas bowl.  The toppings were awesome.  All of the food was fresh and delicious.   The beer on tap perfectly compliments the food.  We will be coming back for more, it was quite simply delicious.
