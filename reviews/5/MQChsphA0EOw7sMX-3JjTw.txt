First of all, I'd like to say that the owners are wonderful people and it seems that everything they serve is handmade and from the heart! I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the jalapeños were amazing! My entrée was the carne asada, which I have heard of but when I was brought a plate with a thin steak on it I was a little confused. Oscar (the owner) came over to the table and explained the best ways to eat it, and it was absolutely delicious! The pinto beans were whole and once again were absolutely cooked to perfection. He brought out 3 different salsas for us as well. One was the house salsa, which was the perfect blend of spice and sweet. The other was a much hotter salsa that definitely creeps up on you! It takes about 4 seconds before it tears you up! The third was a tomatillo salsa that was green. I'm not sure how to explain it but it was very good. For dessert I had the fried ice cream and it was awesome! The service was spectacular, as we were promptly seated and the food came very quickly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great handmade Mexican food! Kudos to Cafe Posada!
