Easy drive thru transaction with some special requests: #5 with extra sauce on the chicken soft tacos, nachos instead of the French fries (I'm sorry, I've just ALWAYS hated the French fries from all Del Tacos...tacos and fries just doesn't make sense to me), and a Diet Coke with no ice.
Order was quick, perfectly accurate, and the drive thru attendance was very pleasant...just like the experience should have been!
