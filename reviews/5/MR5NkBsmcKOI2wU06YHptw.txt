In the mood for Hawaiian BBQ today and the ratings on Yelp said we should give this a try. Good call. 

Not your average Hawaiian plate lunch spot.  More like a Zaba's/Chipotle with a Hawaiian inspired tastes. 

When we arrived and looked over the menu we were asked if it was our first visit and would we like to sample the meats.  Of course we did.  A delicious seasoned chicken, Kalua pig and a teriyaki style beef. All were delicious and between the four of us we ordered each of the three. 

We ended up with two burritos and two bowls. The portions were very generous. The ingredients were fresh and cooked perfectly.  

The bowls were served in real bowls with real silverware.  They do the busing of the table when you are through. I think that adds to the immaculate appearance.  

The staff were so friendly and seemed to sincerely want you to enjoy your meal.  The prices were very fair.  It came to $10 per person with drinks. Quite reasonable for such high quality ingredients and preparation.  

We also sat outside on a nice patio area with umbrellas and palm trees. Nice atmosphere and not too close to traffic on Rainbow. 

Excellent choice today.  We will be back and this looks to become part of our weekend lunch rotation.
