Whew! Bring on the ice cream. This is the real deal.

We ventured over to this little spot after hearing that this location existed. We had been to the original one a long time ago but we were unaware of this one. The D-Backs were playing and the place was hoppin. We were seated right away and home made chips and fire-roasted salsas immediately followed. 
We were greeted by the owner Drew and he served us up his own personal creation, pomegranate margaritas. Wonderful.
I ordered the Victoria's chicken (named after Drew's grandma) and my dinner date had the pork carnitas.
These guys don't mess around. Our food was delivered to our table in a flash which was surprising as they were slammed with two large tables. Just like I remember from my visit to the southern local, the heat level of the food is off the scale hot! But in a "hurt me some more" kind of way.
The roasted chicken breast was ladled in wonderful red chile and was unbelievably moist. The beans were rich and spicy. I don't treat my self to the caloric content of authentic New Mexican food very often but this was true indulgence.
My companion's pork was lean and tender and he kept stealing the red chile off of my plate. (Get your own next time.)

Nothing fancy here just very unique, well prepared food from a family who takes true pride in the traditions of their cuisine and hospitality, all at a very fair price. We'll be back with friends.
