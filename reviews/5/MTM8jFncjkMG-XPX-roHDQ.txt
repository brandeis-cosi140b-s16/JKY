Yum! My husband and I came here for a quick, early dinner. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Taco and the Chicken Tinga Taco. My husband ordered the Chicken Burrito, which I had a couple bites of. The flavors of each were so different from the other, but equally scrumptious. Not to mention, you can never go wrong with free chips and deliciously spicy salsa. This place not only has delicious food, but the atmosphere and set up are great! I definitely want to come back at night to enjoy the lights, fireplace and drinks.
