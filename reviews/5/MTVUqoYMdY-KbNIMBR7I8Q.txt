I have eaten at Abuelos several times and I've enjoyed their food everytime. The first thing that I like about Abuelos is that it doesn't look like your typical Mexican Restaurant. I hate it when they over exaggerate the Mexican theme. Abuelos does it right with a courtyard feel ambiance. 

The food is amazing. They have one of the best beef fajitas I have ever tasted. They also have various flavors of enchiladas that are very good.

Depending on time of day, you will experience a wait time to get a table which means there will be a wait time for your food. Don't worry, they provide chips and salsa and they are good. The food is definitely worth the wait.
