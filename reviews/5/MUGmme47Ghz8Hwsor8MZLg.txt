I love this place!  It's similar to Chipotle, but your food is being cooked right in front of you as you go down the line, not just assembled.  The chips and salsa are great, they have horchata in addition to soda and beer, and the shrimp mango quesadilla is amazing!  They've got some good salad and dessert options too.  I just wish they were open on Sundays!
