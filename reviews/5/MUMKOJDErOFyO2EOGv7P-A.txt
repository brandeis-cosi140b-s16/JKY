Hi Tacos el Gordo!
Just wanted to let you know that the only reason we came to you for tacos (and knew what to do/to get/how to order)were the reviews you got on Yelp...to think we could have driven by and scoffed at your establishment like the gringos we are!! Everything is so freaking good...the adobado is like crack, the grilled onions and peppers great additions to the best fresh tortillas we've ever had.
If there were more than 5 stars avail we'd give it to you BUT for the decor, smell, and overall chaos inside this kinda-shady location off the strip.  Seriously, TEG, clean up your act a bit (place smells a bit like a latrine, no clear lines for food unless you are "in the know" and are prepared to eat whatever is handed to you wherever you end up at the grill, and we're not certain if there was carne asada or dirt on the floor everywhere)...clean it up just a smidge and you would be millionaires by months end by our visits alone.
Mucho besos,
Us
