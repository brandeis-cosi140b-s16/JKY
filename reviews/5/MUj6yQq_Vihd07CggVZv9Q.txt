Perfect date night. Just as a warning, the service here is rather slow. Not bad, but slow, so just be patient and enjoy yourself. 

The decor and atmosphere is unique and comfortable. The courtyard, as well as the dining room, is beautiful. 

The food and cocktails, incredible. I ordered the Devine Beginnings cocktail and it was delicious. For my entr√©e, I ordered the short rib. I was not expecting it to be that excellent. The short rib was cooked to perfection with the most flavorful rub and sauce I've ever had with that meat. The creamed corn and beans worked so perfectly together, I wish it came as a side so I can just order that with every meal. There were so many other dishes that looked good on the menu, so I'll definitely be back! 

But, if visiting for the first time, order the short rib and never look back!
