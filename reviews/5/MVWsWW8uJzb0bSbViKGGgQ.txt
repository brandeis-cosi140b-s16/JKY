A bean burrito can be the true measure of a Mexican restaurant. A simple concoction, yes - but an establishment that takes the time to make really great tasting beans and wrap them in a great tortilla - is my kind of place. Los Favoritos makes a stellar bean burrito, as well as an outstanding Carne Asada burrito. Others I've gone with have liked their food very much as well, but I haven't been able to get past those burritos. Great green and red salsa in squeeze bottles. Definitely a go-to place for fast (but good) food.
