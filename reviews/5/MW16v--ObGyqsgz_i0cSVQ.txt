Being accustomed to near-flawless Mexican food from San Diego, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to try what Phoenix had to offer. On the menu at Poli's, I was taken aback by the California Burrito, which normally is a ubiquitous staple for every local in SD. Could it be? Judging by the menu, the ingredients were the same. I must try it. 

The burrito itself was long and must've weighed over a pound. The inner-ratio was spot on and the overall portions generous. The carne asada showed no signs of gaminess and the texture amongst the fries, meat, and cheese was of ethereal nature. Best of all, it costs about a dollar less than any California Burrito I've had in California.  An epiphanic sensation, I have now bent over and assumed my new standard for what is the California Burrito... in Arizona.
