Have you been to Viva Arepas?  If you have, you'll love Felix Hotdog Taco Shop!  It's the same owners.   If you haven't, you need to visit both!  

Felix Hotdog Taco Shop is literally a taco stand in the parking lot of Dino's.  So be aware there's no tables. 

I seriously had the best hot dog I've ever had!  Don't expect your everyday hot dog though.  Words can't describe.  When they ask if you want cheese on it, just say yes.  The rotisserie chicken street tacos are $1 and are delicious.  

If you love hot dogs or street tacos, you won't be disappointed.   

I may start keeping beach chairs in my trunk at all times for impromptu street tacos!
