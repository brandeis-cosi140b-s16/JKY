I've been visiting this place since it opened on 1st st near check cashers before it moved to it's current location.

This is THE roach coach we visit most often when a craving for a burrito hits and Filibertos is not enough!  The carne asada is always grilled with a great char flavor, I usually get the carne asada burrito or tacos although I"ve also tried the torta.  Other items I've tried and liked greenchile/cheese burrito and chorizo breakfast burrito.  My kid also likes their shrimp ceviche tostada.  All the items I've tried have been satisfying.

If you visit this place don't get turned off if someone comes by asking for money.....Once in a while they will have homemade horchata and that's not bad either.  Love their bottled sodas and the prices are very decent for the flavor and load of food you're given.  

Since it's outside it's super hot in the summer, so be warned to take it home or buy some very ice soda to sip on while enjoying your meal!
