I was really impressed by the food. Great carne Asada and the burrito was very well portioned(size and item wise). Some places put way too much onion/cilantro or not enough steak to beans rice. The rice and beans were great, simple yet delicious. Comes with avacado freshly scooped out. Asked to add white cheese but might come standard. 5 bucks... Add 1.50 for bottle coke. Can't really beat that price, especially for taste.

Fair warning, they don't speak the best of English(but enough), know your order in Spanish for best results. However items on the menu they know the translation. Friend only eats ground beef for teeth reasons, the couldn't understand ground and I didn't know it. They only have shredded and Asada. But she got everything else.

Still 5 star taste and quantity for price. Might not be best ever or in town but definitely worth a visit.
