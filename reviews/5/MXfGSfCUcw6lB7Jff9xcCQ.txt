I'm from Los Angeles California I grew up with traditional Mexican parents and traditional Mexican food. 
Since moving to Nevada I have been to numerous taco shops some ok, some horrible!!! 
After coming here I was an immediate regular. This place is the most authentic taco shop I have been to in southern Nevada. The food is excellent, great taste. The lady's that work their are very nice and humble. I feel like I'm at my moms kitchen! 
If you don't mind a hole in the wall and are looking for authentic Mexican food then this is it. 
I don't usually write reviews but this place is definitely worth the time to let people know about my experience(s).
