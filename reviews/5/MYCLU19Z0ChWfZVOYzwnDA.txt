Mi Amigo Ricardo's is our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Casa Grande.  We eat there a couple of times each month.  Our favorite entree is #14.  Chicken Fajitas.  Tasty grilled chicken with peppers and onions, refried beans and rice, flour torilllas, with chunky salsa and guacamole!  The BEST!  Reasonably priced and more than you can eat.  We usually take half home.
