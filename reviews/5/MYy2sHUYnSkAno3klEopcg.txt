My wife and I love this place.  What a surprising and delicious way to serve your favorite type of sushi.  They offer salads, bowls and burritos  (wraps) with your choice of sushi. It's similar to a Subway sandwich shop where your selection moves down a food assembly line whereby you may choose your fresh ingredients. At the end of the line, they offer an array of sauces to top your meal.  

There is a shirt learning curve to understand the menu but we'll worth the brainpower.
