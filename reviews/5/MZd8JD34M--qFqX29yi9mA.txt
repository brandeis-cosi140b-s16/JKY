Happen to come across this little restaurant while staying at the wigwam, the food was awesome only to be outdone by Michelle our waitress we cannot say enough about her prompt friendly service to helping us decide what to eat, great job Michelle. I also want to give kudos to the guy who brought out the chips and salsa great job.....
