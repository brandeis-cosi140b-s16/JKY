Americas Tacos has delicious, well-made food that is consistently satisfying. They have authentic Mexican recipes with surprisingly tasty options for the health conscious. The food comes out quick, but it doesn't feel like just some food chain. The service has always been above average as well. This place is a good find for a quick bite ( let's be real, we can only eat so much Chipotle).
