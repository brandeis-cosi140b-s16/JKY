I had an awesome experience at this cool new fusion restaurant in Scottsdale.A group of us tried a lot from the menu including the fried rice, pad thai, sea bass pork belly..you get the idea. Every dish was served on a well presented plate and was equally delicious. Im picky about rice and their version was a nice mix of Mexican spice and Asian elegance. Every dish was cooked to perfection. The pork belly was a treat and the sea bass went really fast. If you're feeling decadent, and I often am when I'm out, try the billionaire roll. Way overpriced kobe beef roll that includes gold flake..Had to have it and it was stellar! Our server was busy but efficient and friendly. The patio was comfortable and had a nice selection of attractive Scottsdalites. Great new addition to the scene.
