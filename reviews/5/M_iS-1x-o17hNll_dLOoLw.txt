If it's been longer than a week I literally crave a burrito from Someburros.  I usually get the veggie burrito on a wheat tortilla with no cheese (pinto beans, pico de gallo, avocado) but will sometimes splurge on the bean and cheese burrito.  Their hot sauce is super hot and has a great flavor; it tastes great with the burritos and their chips.  My husband loves their breakfast burritos.  

Someburros is definitely a set above fast food.  I appreciate that their prices are reasonable and that they have a call ahead pick up window.
