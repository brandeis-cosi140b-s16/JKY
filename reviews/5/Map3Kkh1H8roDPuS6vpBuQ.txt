Four of us went to Fogon a few nights ago. We sat out on the patio because the weather was great. The patio is beautiful with a fireplace and fountain. The drinks were all made with fresh ingredients and tasted amazing. We all had different entrees and they were all very good . The beef brisket enchiladas were my favorite. All in all good food, great atmosphere and perfect for date night. We will be back.
