Was staying close by, a fifteen minute walk away. So worth the "dangerous, un-lit walk" (I was staying across the freeway and had to walk there)
Fresh guac made right in front of the table so you get it tasty just to your buds!
The waitress recommended everything, but said to try a little of everything the dish with steak,shrimp, and chicken (I forget the name) was best. It comes with beans and rice.
SO GOOD! Wish they had a location in New York City, I'd be a constant costumer ;)
