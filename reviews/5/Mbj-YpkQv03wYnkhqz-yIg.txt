America's is a chain, and it's a good chain - don't get me wrong, but this place gets 5 stars for a different reason.  There's a guy here (I assume it's the manager, but I could be wrong) who just really takes care of people. Like, he's friendly, comes to check on you while you're eating, gets you things if you need them - it's just a higher level of service.  Hell - it's better customer service than I get at many classier places.  I've only been here like, 3 times, but he's always there and helpful!

Anyway, America's is awesome (try the chips and guac, and an Al Pastor taco), and I recommend it, and this location is awesome.
