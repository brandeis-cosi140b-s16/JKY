I really love this place! I've never had anything here that I haven't loved. Their taco salad is really great! The meat could use some seasoning, but that doesn't stop me. The inside of this establishment could use an upgrade, it's pretty outdated and misleading. Walking in the door, I probably wouldn't want to eat the food honestly. The only other downside is that the drive-thru takes a really long time. I would still highly recommend this place!
