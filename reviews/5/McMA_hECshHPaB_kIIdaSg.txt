Consistently good food!  Good iced tea.  Cooked in front of you if seated at the bar.  The beef tenderloin quesadilla is unreal.  A little pricy, but worth it.  The salsa (red) is perfect to me with a unique tang.  This is good food.  I see the same staff there for years, this tells me something about the owner-must be a decent guy.  Very charming and unique setting.  Next time you check it out, if you can find it, ask about why the shower is in the Bathroom!  I kind of hope you dont find it so all the good stuff is left for me!
