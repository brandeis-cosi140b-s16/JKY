I've been here twice now and the carne asada is on point.  They cook the beef over mesquite lump charcoal while many of the others cook it on a flat top.  That means flavor and the flavor of the beef is outstanding.  The menu is limited but what they do serve is all very good.  The flour tortilla is nice and dense with plenty of lard while the corn tortilla was soft and supple.  They also have a salsa / topping bar with items like shredded cabbage, limes, radishes, pickled onions, avocado salsa, a hot salsa and another salsa I didn't try.  

The atmosphere is lacking and there is bar seating inside with about 3 or 4 tables outside.  The service is great and both times I was greated warmly and they seem to appreciate that you are there.  

All in all, this is where I will now go for carne asada.  America's is eh, Tacos Atoyac is awesome but I've never been wild about their carne asada and many other places simply can't match the flavor of the meat here and really, isn't that what it's all about?
