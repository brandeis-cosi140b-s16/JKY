Great place for dinner!! We had the 2 enchilada plate, green chile plate, and the chile relleno plate   All were delicious as usual. There food has a slight kick to it which you can kick it up with the tabletop salsas. Please eat here. We want this restaurant to stay around a long time. Dinner for three with drinks and chips $28.
