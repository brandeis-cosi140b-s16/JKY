Cafe Tranqilo is fantastic.  All the staffers were pleasantly sweet and personable.  The foods superb, for those not from Phoenix.  I was very impressed at there authentic Mexican style fusion.  Just so you know I have never had Gallo but I'm sure it would have been great.  I believe in giving this restaurant a try,  not too many restaurants around Clarendon Hotel.  Loved there Guacamole and Chorizos.
