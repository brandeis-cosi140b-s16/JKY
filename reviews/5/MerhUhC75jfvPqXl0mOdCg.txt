Was there twice with my family during Xmas  Holidays. Both times we were very pleased. Food was good, margaritas great, prices very reasonable (specially the lunch menu by 2pm) but in particular the service was excellent. Owners are very friendly and courteous. I'm glad there is a good Mexican restaurant in the Queen Creek/Gilbert/San Tan area. Looking forward to go back for a meal.
