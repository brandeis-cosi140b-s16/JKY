First, I should say I am from out of town (east coast) and have only been to this restaurant once. However, I have been to other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area and at my home. The food here is very good.  The sauces and guacamole are spiced with care. Watch out for their special sauce-one taste will bring tears to your eyes! My husband had fajitas and I had taco salad with blackened fish. This is a very casual place, but on my visit I felt like the staff worked hard to present quality fresh food.
