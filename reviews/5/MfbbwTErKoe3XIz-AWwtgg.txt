WOW! This place is fabulous! From the decor to the margaritas to the food, you can't go wrong. The murals are beautifully done and placed throughout. The margaritas are made with fresh fruit juices. No concentrate here. I had the traditional and strawberry. Both were amazing. I also had the chance to try the mango, and you really can't go wrong with any choice.  The service is impeccable! We had regular salsa and habanero salsa. My boyfriend likes the heat, and he said it was HOT. I had the chorizo and potato tacos with white rice. The chorizo was a little spicy for me, but tolerable. (Maybe the margaritas helped.) I don't remember the name of my boyfriends dinner, but it consisted of lamb, beef, chicken, chorizo, and vegetables, with a side of red rice and refried beans. Again, everything was very tasty. I will be back to try dessert.
