I searched Yelp for a place to have lunch in the Historic Glendale area today and decided on Farjardo's Cafe after reading through some reviews. 
We ordered a couple of the daily specials and I had the green chile soup also. Everything was very good and the service was fast and friendly.  Someone on another site mentioned they need to install a fryer and make fresh chips and I agree but the chips we were served were fresh and warm. Add the fresh home made salsa was really excellent so we were not disappointed. 
All the food was excellent and I was really impressed. The green sauce was supurb and the flavor of the rice and beans was really beyond what I normally expect. 
This place gets da two thumbs up from me!
