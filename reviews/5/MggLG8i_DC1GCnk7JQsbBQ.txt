Great chips and salsa's!  Friendly and tentative service.  This is clean, authentic Mexican, not American-Mexican.  If you eat at Taco Bell or think the food at your last all inclusive vacation in Cancun  was great and Mexican, your in the wrong place.  Tacos are awesome and all their sauces are made in-house, you call tell.  Great authentic beverages also!  Go and enjoy
