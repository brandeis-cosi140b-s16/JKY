Excellent Mexican food. This spot has been a favorite of mine since I first tried it many years ago. The food is authentic and delicious. I usually order a bowl of menudo and a few carne asada or lengua tacos. The building is bright yellow and located next to a tire shop. It is hard to miss. Tacos De Chandler never disappoints.
