Hands down favorite place in Chandler. The margaritas are phenomenal and about 4$ To boot! Fresh made sour mix and plenty of tequila. There is nothing I hate more than a super sweet margerita with little tequila and cheap premade mix. Not these ones! Delicious! Recipe for the best experience ? Pair about 4 margeritas with 2 shrimp tacos and complimentary chips and salsa. You'll smack yo mama ! Awesome bartenders , great atmosphere paired with the delicious margaritas and shrimp tacos gets 5 stars from me BOOM!
