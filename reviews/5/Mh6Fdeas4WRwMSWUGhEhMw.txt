I can't even drive past this cart without stopping! I used to live right around the corner from it and got hooked right away! I don't live that close to it anymore but I will take the drive from anywhere in town to get to it! LOL I'm not going to say its just soooo different then other carts but they are for sure really good! I like all of the men that usually run the cart and like a past review said, ALL YOU NEED IS $5 TO GET FULL! lol. All in all, THEY ARE MY FAVORITE!!!!!!
