My girl and I found a groupon so we figured it was next on the list.


First thing when I walked in I was amazed at the big outside patio and how classy the place looked.  

Had shrimp cooked in a garlic butter and I think it was the most perfect piece of shrimp I have EVER had.  I cant wait to get it again.

Had a Guac salad that is as Good as Sombreros ,which I think is as good and fresh as can get.  The green salsa they had I also found to be unlike any other I have had.  

Service was great.  No complaints at all. As a matter of fact, I question how this place could ever get a 1 star.  I mean.. ok it is all an opinion.. but decor alone makes this place at least get 1 and half stars and the food even if it was mediocre would get it up to 2 stars.  Oh well.. Opinions are like ASSHOLES.  (I love that saying!)

The waitress explained that everything on the menu is cooked fresh to order and made on command, and nothing is kept ready for quick use.  I tasted it in the food. Loved it, cant wait to get some more of it!
