Carnitas tacos all the way!  If I didn't listen to my belly, I could easily kill 10 of these suckers. So I stopped at 6, and surprisingly, did not feel gross afterwards. That's a 5 stars review in my neck of the woods. 

Don't be fooled by the exterior, the bars aren't meant to keep you out, it's to protect you when you're inside. I've never felt so safe, watching Telemundo music videos, eating tacos, and hanging out with my buds.
