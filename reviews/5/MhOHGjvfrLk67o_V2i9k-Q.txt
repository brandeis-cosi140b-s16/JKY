Lovelovelove.  I'm not too adventurous when it comes to food but I really like their menu.  Lots of chicken dishes and all sound great.  I've tried a few things but none of which I can remember but I know I liked them all.

Good mojitos and dancing later in the evening too.

Definately an enjoyable place.
