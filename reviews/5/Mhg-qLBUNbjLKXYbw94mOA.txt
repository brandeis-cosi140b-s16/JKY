What a pleasant surprise!! Certainly don't judge by the friendly neighbor--the restaurant is located next door to the acclaimed sapphire strip club. But to our surprise, we found a family-friendly classy Mexican joint that delivered delicious food with unparalleled friendly service. Chef paco will emerge from his kitchen to greet you himself, representing his independent restaurant in fine form. After a long night of drinking and partying, I came with 3 other companions seeking a wholesome breakfast (sure... It was lunchtime, but no matter). We tried fajitas, burritos and I had the huevos diversado--2 fried eggs lathered in green sauce atop tortillas, with rice and beans. Everything is well seasoned and constructed very well. There is a flan dessert which is exceptional--a family recipe says chef paco. 

All in all, I cannot possibly express how much fun it was to find this surprise in Las Vegas, a short cab ride from the strip (we were at the SLS). Give this place a chance. Worst case scenario, you find yourself next door to help digest the meal.
