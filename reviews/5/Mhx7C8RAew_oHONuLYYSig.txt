This place is amazing! I love their salsa bar and the quaint environment. They don't skimp on the serving sizes either. The tacos always have large portions of meat and fixings. It's one of my favorite places to take out of town visitors. They are always impressed and satisfied. Oh, and the horchata is the best I've ever had. Yes!
