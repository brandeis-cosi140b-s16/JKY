We love Joyride Taco House! The staff is excellent and the food is always great! I would recommend the shrimp ceviche, I think it's the best in town! Our waitress at our last visit (Ashley) was fantastic, she really went above and beyond. From our experience, this location is a little less busy than the Gilbert one, which means quicker service.
