We had a Restaurant.com coupon we needed to use. We chose this restaurant because it was close to home, but I kept hesitating because most of the reviews have said good food, slow service. We found the food was great, and the service was excellent. We arrived for dinner at 5:30pm on a Thursday evening. Granted there was only 1 other car in the parking lot, I just chalked it up to we were there really early. The restaurant was very cute. The server, Walter, was excellent. He was very attentive and came to our table often. I had the Combo Special #1 (with Shredded Beef, came with beans and rice) and my husband had the Carne Asada. My plate was very nice for 1 person, not overly large and I finished it all. My husband thought the Carne Asada was good (came with flank steak, rice and beans), but I thought the flank steak was a bit thick. I still much prefer Zapata's in Ballantyne for Carne Asada. Prices were very reasonable. Oh, and I would definitely recommend to the owners that they change their name to something more along the lines of "food". It was way more of a restaurant then what I would consider to be a bar, as the name kind of indicates. I would hardily recommend Tacos and Tequila and will definitely return.
