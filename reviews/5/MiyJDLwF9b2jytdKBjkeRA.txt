Finally remembered this place was open, had to check it out.  Currently there are only 6 vendors in place.  The atmosphere is very casual.  I tried Adobo Dragon (Asian Latin fusion): Thai chicken wings, carne fried wontons and 2 Bao special/abondigas & salmon.  Very interesting fusion and really tasty.
