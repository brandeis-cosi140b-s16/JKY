I've been going to this place with friends and family for about 5 or 6 years now.  The owner of the restaurant seems to work every day of the week, she is the sweetest woman and a phenomenal cook!  Everything on the menu is so tasty, her salsa is THE best, true taco truck style tacos, I love El Panzon! It's my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas to date.  Highly recommend it...and it always feels good to support a small business!
