Found this restaurant on a whim. We don't go out for Mexican often, but when we do we have high expectations. This place was awesome. It had been open for 5 weeks when we were there and you can see the passion of this family. Decor is fun and cute while still being high quality. Place is clean and spacious. The beautiful owner Tanya came out to say hello and make sure our meals were delicious. Server was kind and gave us recommendations and checked back often. Can't wait to come back and bring friends !  Ps - Wednesday all day is all you can eat .... Come hungry and bring your family.   Great find for a Saturday night dinner.
