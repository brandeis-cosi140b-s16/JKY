My girlfriend and I have been going to Baja for happy hour for well over a year now and we'll continue to go--we've never left disappointed!

The carnitas, chicken, and fish tacos are all great, but we're completely hooked on the potato tacos. I know it sounds weird, but their seasoned hash brown style potatoes make for awesome tacos. 

They run daily specials often, we're so hooked on the cheap beer and dollar tacos that we rarely stray, but I've never seen anyone order anything that doesn't look delicious.
