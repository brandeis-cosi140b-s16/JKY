Viva Mercadito!  Great happy hour! great food and my favorite server Lainie! The margaritas were delicious.  Traditional margarita was a perfect blend. We had guacamole which was served with your choice of salsa. We chose the tomatillilo.  It was fresh and delicious.  We sampled some of the Happy Hour tacos.  The carnitas was sweet smokey heaven!  The swordfish was charred blackened and just the right amount of fish.  The deep fried Mahi was so fresh.   The patio is beautiful and faces Red Rock.   I can't wait to come back for dinner!
