8/16: MEXQUITE HAS CLOSED. Submitted request for Yelp to update the restaurant. Went there for lunch today, and they've moved out. Sign and website are still up, but a paper sign in the window states an Italian restaurant is opening there soon. :-(

I've been eating here for a good long while now, so figured it was time to update my review.

The most important thing you need to know about Mexquite? Two words: CHIPOTLE SALSA! It's the tastiest salsa I've found so far in Charlotte. When I go in, I not only get a side of it, sometimes I'll ask for a large takeout container of it to enjoy at home with our regular tortilla chips. Their chipotle salsa is the best.

My favorite menu item these days is the burrito in a bowl. It's perfectly executed with rice, beans, plenty of lettuce and your choice of meat. It far surpasses the burrito bowl choices at other Mexican restaurants in the area.

Pleased to see Mexquite doing well. If you haven't tried it yet and you're in the area, you should!
