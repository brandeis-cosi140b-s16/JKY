i'm happiest when traveling with people who, like me, are down to try unusual hole in the wall places. for our recent trip to arizona, instead of eating at some fancy schmancy restaurant in the city or spending our time at the buffet line at the hotel, we searched yelp for some seafood. and alas, marisos sinaloa! 

first, you start off w free chips and salsa. the beer was cheap and they serve em in chilled mugs with salt and lime. 

i had the bacanora shrimps and it was unlike anything i have tasted before. creamy spicy sauce and delicious shrimp served with rice, papas, and salad. i got hungry right now just thinking about it :(

the bf had the shrimp tacos - delicious, and shrimp burrito - good, but probably too much for him. 

our two other friends got a mojarra frita and the seafood mixed rice veracruz style (?) which tasted like a seafood paella. both were good and hit the spot. 

overall, the food was good, the price was reasonable, and the service was fast and attentive. straight up simple and good.
