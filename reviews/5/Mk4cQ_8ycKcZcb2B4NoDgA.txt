Fuzzy's is Great!!!! Been going there for months and keep finding new things to try. Staff is very cool, friendly and will meet just about any request you have! Don't waste your time with a bean burito or the hard shells, hit the Grilled Shrimp and if you really want a treat, have them deep fry a pork taco or 6 for you :)
