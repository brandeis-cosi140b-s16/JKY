Hands down, our favorite place! My husband and I come here about twice a month and my friends and I recently starting coming for Happy Hour too.  Delicious chips (flour and corn) and salsa as soon as you sit down (they keep them coming too).  The mango margarita is my drink of choice here.  We always get the corn tamales and shredded beef tacos, and sometimes the spinach enchiladas (get it with shredded chicken and ask for extra almonds)!  Everything is amazing and the portions are large.  Whenever we have guests visiting we make sure to come here.  The owners are great and always check to make sure everyone is happy.  We will continue to come here (and to Rhythm and Wine which they also own).
