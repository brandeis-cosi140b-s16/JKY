Come here for the EMPANADAS!!!!  The food is good- but the empanadas are AMAZING!   When I came here- I was planning on taking a photo of the food to post- but it didn't last long enough for me to do that.  I highly recommend the pumpkin and/or pineapple empanadas.  

I also bought about 3 dozen to take with me to California to visit family.  I just packed them in a cooler for transport.  Once we got there- we just popped them in the oven for a few minutes and they were awesome!
