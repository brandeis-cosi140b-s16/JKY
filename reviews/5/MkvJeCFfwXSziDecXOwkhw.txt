I've been living on this side of town for almost 6 years, and this is the first time I ate here. Only ordered the chicken flautas to go, and OMG,  it was so good!!! I haven't eaten these since I left NY, and it reminded me so much of this Mexican joint I used to always go to. It was just an appetizer but they add lettuce, tomatoes, onions and guacamole so you could easily have it for lunch or dinner. Ok, rant over. :-)
