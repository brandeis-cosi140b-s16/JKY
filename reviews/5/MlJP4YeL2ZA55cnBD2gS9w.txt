The other day, a coworker suggested this place to me, so I thought I would try it.  Wow.  Just.  Wow.  These street tacos are pure crack, I tell you.  One bite is all it takes and you'll be hooked.  I decided to go here yesterday for lunch, and I'm so glad I did.  As others have mentioned, their menu is small, as they only serve chicken and steak street tacos, but hey, that's all you need!  Three bucks per taco, and you get to load it with all the sauces and other toppings they have on hand!  I decided to try both the chicken and steak tacos, all on flour tortillas.  I took one bite, and I instantly fell hard for this place.  It's one of those places that you just take a bite, and you're finding yourself in your happy place.....until you have finished the last taco.  That's when reality settles in and you realize that you don't have another one to eat, so you become saddened and then want to go run back and buy more tacos.....

I'm so glad my coworker suggested this place....I'm definitely coming back.
