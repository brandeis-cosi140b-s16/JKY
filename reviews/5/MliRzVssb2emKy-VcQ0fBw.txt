This is my go-to place for lunch when I work downtown.  I like to eat healthily for lunch so I don't feel like I'm in a food coma after, and they have many healthy options.  

Also, you feel like you're walking into a friend's kitchen to grab lunch with the chatter going on. You get to pick all of your (probably 20 different ingredients) for your salad or burrito and... Bonus:  they have Twizzler Tuesday's, free chicklets (old school - love it!) etc. - that stuff cracks me up.  

The ingredients you can build for your burrito, salad, etc. are fresh and delicious.  Love this place and everyone who works here!
