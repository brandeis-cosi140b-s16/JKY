Carne Asada torta = mmmmmmmm! So yummy! I saw someone's review that says the tortas come with Ruffles, yes, they do... And it totally makes the sandwich. I think the balance is awesome with crunchy, spicy, etc. 

Make sure you get everything on it, if you don't, don't bother going. Also, ask for jalepenos and spicy carrots. 

The tacos are Mexico City style, small tortillas and carne asada, tripe, tongue, pastor, etc. So good. I went to Mexico City in May 2010 and this is as close to the real thing that I can find in Phoenix. 

I also love that the owners are sometimes the cooks!
