Came in with my little brother because he surprisingly never had a burrito. He said he wanted a steak burrito. When we arrived there was a wait time on steak. The manager who was eating what seemed to be a late dinner stopped to give my brother and I complementary drinks. After our wait he called for us to place our order. To my surprise he told the cashier to comp our meal. Needless to say our late night burrito run turned into a little miracle. Might I add it was delicious! You can't beat quality customer service !!!!!
