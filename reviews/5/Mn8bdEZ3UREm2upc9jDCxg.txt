This is the original location. There is now an additional location in Goodyear. This one does have a home feel and the building has a lot of character, but the other location is more like a regular restaurant, which you might prefer it if you are claustrophobic or don't like being in tight quarters with strangers.

The food is always fantastic. The enchilada sauce is the best I have ever had. I could drink it!! Food is consistent between locations and visits. Portions are generous. Prices between $7 and $13. One of my favorite places.
