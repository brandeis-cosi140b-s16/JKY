Most honestly, one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Actually.. one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to!! The whole meal was delicious, right down to the salsa. In fact, the entire meal was filled with "mmmm's and ahhhh's!" 
I was even kind of sad there wasn't one closer to Tempe, until our server informed us that the Burrito Shop on University is owned by the same people. Score!
