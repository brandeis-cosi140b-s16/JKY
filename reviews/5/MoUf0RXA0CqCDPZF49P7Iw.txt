My delivery order was totally screwed up. Everything tasted so good that I don't even care. I ended up with six tacos of unknown variety. I could identify the shredded beef, which was fantastic. I didn't get the ground beef tacos I ordered, but the chicken were good. Despite the $10 delivery fee, I will reorder. Delicious!

Maybe they could label their tacos? I'll ask next time I order.
