Great place, incredible food. A modern flair to authentic Mexican food. Clean beautifully decorated place! The waitress was a doll, so courteous & pleasant. My parents retired in this area & are so excited we found a great Mexican restaurant. We ordered the Nachos Nortenos, chili rellanos & chicken fajitas. All fabulous!! You won't be disappointed!! Will come back each time we visit my parents.
