What a gem!!! Not located in the best of areas but you would think they were getting ready for the President to arrive and dine! This place was spotless! The cashier was extremely friendly, not pushy, offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while I was deciding (since it was a chilly 40 degrees outside it really hit the spot!). 
  
I was undecided between two menu items and she graciously helped me decide based on customers feedback. I ordered the torta cubana.... It was fantastic. It would have been nice if it was cut into two pieces but I devoured it anyway. 

Fresh homemade torta roll, the avocado,lettuce, and tomato were fresh! The meat was delicious! Great job guys! Great selection of baked goods, homemade ice cream, palletas, and horchata.

I will definitely be back!
