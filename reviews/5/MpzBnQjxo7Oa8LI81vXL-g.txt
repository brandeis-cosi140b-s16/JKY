OMG, Amazing flavors that make you say, "yum yum" with every forkful. 
It's feet under the table  "toe-tappin" good..  

This is our 2nd visit to KoMex!  This time we had the Bulgogi fried rice, Spicy Pork Torta, and the fusion enchilada plate!  The fried rice was the BEST (Hand downs) we've ever had!  The torta rocked our  taste buds.  Hubby and I shared it.  The fusion 3 enchilada plate can't be described - The flavors of each meat inside a light (not heavy weird texture) corn tortilla, smothered with red sauce.. So, good!  KoMex is the place to eat if you want to experience flavor explosions on your taste buds!  It's an extra 100%+ when the owners and staff are  nice..  KOMEX is the place for great food and service.  We love it!  Can't wait until our next visit..   I love this place and I'm allergic to sesame oil.. OH WELL.... I MADE IT THROUGH VISIT #2!  No worries.. When food is as good as KoMex.. I'll take an antihistamine, a fork, and a prayer!  Delicious!
