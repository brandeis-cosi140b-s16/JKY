Came in later for drinks and dessert. 10pm-ish. They prepared my fianc√©'s whiskey perfectly.  I had the horchata w/o alcohol.  Good horchata!

I tried the churros. They were excellent!  Not greasy at all!  Someone knows how to fry!  They had a perfect amount of cinnamon and sugar. The chocolate dipping sauce was good  I think I would have preferred a vanilla cream custard to dip them in though. 

Great vibe, good music.  Felt like I was in another town. I love the atmosphere there.
