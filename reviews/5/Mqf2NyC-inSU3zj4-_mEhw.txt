I went to the mesa location a few months ago but don't remember ever coming to this location. We had an in-service day at work so we had an extra long lunch. So me and some coworkers decided to head over here. Great choice. I can't speak for the rest of the menu but their chimis are great. I got the shredded beef one this time. So good. I love them. There is a reason it is their specialty. If you go to a steak house you don't order the chicken or go to a sushi place and order a hamburger. So if it the specialty why get anything else.
My girlfriend loves Macayo's too so we will definitely be back. So will my coworkers if we have another long lunch.
