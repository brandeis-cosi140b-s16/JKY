I was doing a one month rotation at UNLV student wellness center, so I was always looking for a new place to eat and I stumbled upon this place. AD(the cool register guy) helped me out with a selection of some awesome tacos. This place is definitely worth a try, its got taco bells prices but 100x better taste and you can actually see the meat your eating unlike the grounded stuff they call meat at other places. Thanks AD
