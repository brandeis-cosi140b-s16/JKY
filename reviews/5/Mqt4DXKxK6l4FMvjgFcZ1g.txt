We drive all the way to litchfeild from Old Town Scottsdale because the food is to die for! Tonight we had the Sonoran enchiladas, carnitas enchilada green burro and shredded beef burro. All were a 10/10!! I can't wait to bring my out of town family here! Service was wonderful as well and the patio is dog friendly!! Five stars, all day long!!!!
