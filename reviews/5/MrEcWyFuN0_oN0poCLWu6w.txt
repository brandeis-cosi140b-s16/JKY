I go to this hole in the wall at least a couple times a month and they are almost 20 miles from my home, and i don't know why i have not YELP them by now.  i guess i want to keep it my secret, but it is only fair to them to let every one know how good they are.  I have been going to this place for over 20 years  they sell great food at a great value.
 
THEY MAKE THE BEST GREEN CHILI BURRO (and it is only bout $5 for their Monday special including a drink)   even if you don't go on a Monday you must go and try it.  i have tried other things like the tacos, but i all ways find my self going back for the green burro.   it is really nice that i can go there and Lisa know exactly what i order.   THIS IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES THAT YOU SHOULD REWARD WITH YOUR BUSINESS.

One other thing i think it is great that they only accept cash, and have not passed the cost of credit cards on to those of us that dont.   keep up the great job......
