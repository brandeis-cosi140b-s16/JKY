Sometimes accidents are happy. Today I ordered a PV burger with fried onions and green chili. What I got was 2 patties, with bacon, as well as tomato, lettuce, cucumber and the fried onion and green chilies. Great combination (and I don't usually eat bacon). As always the fries are awesome as is the slaw. Despite the incredible dinner crowd (that included a sweet 16 party) the staff was friendly and made sure we were well taken care of. PV Burger has become a perennial favorite.
