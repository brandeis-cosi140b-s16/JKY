Taco Bell is what it is, rating the food is senseless. You like it or you don't. Since I'm a vegetarian, I appreciate their 7-layer burrito with 7 layers of everything but meat. And their crispy potato taco. For 89 cents, it's a basic taco with some seasoned fried potatoes, some sauce, cheese and lettuce. It's not gourmet, but I love it.

Anyways, forget about the food. The employees in this place must be making a hefty salary because ALL of them are ridiculously sweet. They are quick, but always eager to find out how you're doing. "don't feel like cooking today?" she asked me tonight "wow, I love your tattoo, how long did that take?" he asked me last time. "have a good night sweetie" I hear as I take off. 

Good ol fashion personality. Love it.
