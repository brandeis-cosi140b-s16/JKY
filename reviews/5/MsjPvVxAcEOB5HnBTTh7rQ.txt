At Christmas time they had the pulled pork Tamalie's and OMG Loved them. But when we went this time they did not have them any more. 
They did not have the rice ready when we got there and we got there when they opened 10:30am..
So I got the pork Nachos and my Husband wanted a Bean and Cheese burrito with rice and ended up with just the Bean and Cheese. But the food was very good.
The staff seemed ok kinda talking amongst each other but, they did aknowledge us also.
We will be back
