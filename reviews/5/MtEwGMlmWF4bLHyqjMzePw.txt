Yelp prompted my bf and I get some food here late one night. We were not disappointed. We got steak and pastor for our tacos and bf also ordered a burrito. The pastor was awesome and the pickled onions were also great. Can't say anything bad about the food and there was a point in time where we had it for dinner 3 nights in a row. Best tacos in Madison, in my opinion.
