We were staying as a group of friends and kids at the nearby Hilton resort and found this on yelp. We arrived with 12 people and they quickly moved tables and seated us. The food was awesome from the Tortas to the burgers and burritos, The Aguas we so fresh and fruity. None of us had been before and all adults and kids were happy, happy, happy!! The prices were really good too. Good food good service, authentic
