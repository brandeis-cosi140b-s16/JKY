Speedy's is my new favorite lunch spot. They are open 24/7 and I'm working overnights so I really appreciate a tasty snack at 3 am.
Carne asada is perfectly seasoned, and the street tacos are huge and dressed with fresh veggies. $3 tacos are perfectly priced when you see the generous portion size. 
The night guys are super friendly and welcoming.
Way better than any 'Bertos!
