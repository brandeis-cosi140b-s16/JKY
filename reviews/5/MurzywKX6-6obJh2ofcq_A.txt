El Charro is a family tradition and will continue to be. I've told my loved ones that if I am ever to a point where I have to order my last meal ever, it will be a cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa from El Charro. I could then die happily. And make sure Colette is my waitress.   Love this restaurant and always will.
