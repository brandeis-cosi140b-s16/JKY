Do not skip this place! In a place where you can spend your money anywhere, this is the hidden gem in the strip!!! 

Awesome $2 Tacos... Cheap prices drinks/shots... Awesome bartenders... Try to go when H.L. Is working... He makes the experience all the better, best bartender we experienced our while trip, and that's saying a lot. 

The food is flavorful, drinks are cold, an the bathroom is not far away! :-) 
Our chips were warm and fresh, Tacos flavorful.. (I got beef and chicken) 

If you go and plan on drinking (I hope you do!) please try the infusion tequila... It may seem A bit pricey at $7...but what you don't know is that it comes with a plate of cut up fruit that has been soaking in tequila... The shot itself has absorbed all of the fruit juices... So it honestly tastes like candy... With no tequila burn... The fruit... The fruit... Is where it gets fun... It has absorbed all if the tequila burn and flavor, so each piece is like it's own shot... And you will feel it after a few minutes... Super fun experience! 

We went two times and each time spent hours eating and drinking... And both times are bill was less than 40 bucks... And that's with the $7 shots... What I'm saying is... U can have a GREAT time for under 20 bucks! 

To end the review... Please so not walk by Bally's and not go here... And please seek out the great and wise H.L.... He will take care if you!!! (make sure and tell him his new Minnesota friends actually put a review on Yelp!!)
