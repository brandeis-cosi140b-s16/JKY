I love this place. Seems family run since I always have the same waitress and see the same guy in the kitchen and the same lady doing office type things. I love their salsa it's different and I'm not sure what it is but I love it. They also bring a red bottle of spicy sauce with your meal and that stuff is good! I like to ask for the red bottle right away and mix it with the salsa to add some heat! Their queso dip is decent and I love the flautas, burritos, chimichangas, nachos, omg I haven't had anything here I don't like! Oh and I always get at least one margarita with my meal! Love this place!
