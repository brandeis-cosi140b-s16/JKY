Fast...food...fast!

I am sorry that others have had slow/bad service. Maybe that was then, but now, they are pretty fast.

Typically, I order for two or three folks in my orders and rarely have they been wrong and never have they been slow.

I've had their ceviche and guacamole fries (special order-no salt) several times and was very happy with speed, amount of fries & guacamole and spice-level of the guacamole. My son has had the carne asada fries, also no salt. As well, those orders were excellent, fresh and fast.  And is say that I've eaten here maybe 15 times now...usually forget to check in, but always  am pleased. That's why I continue to come...and will continue to do so!
