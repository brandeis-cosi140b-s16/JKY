The carne asada bowl is absolutely divine. So much so, I may have to eat it daily! Marinated steak grilled to perfection rubbing elbows with guacamole, creamy rice and cheese to create the best bowl I've ever had. Pair it with desert blossom iced tea for lunch and you'll be doing a happy dance all afternoon!
