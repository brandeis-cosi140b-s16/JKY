KoMex is one of the few places that I felt deserved a review from me soon after enjoying the amazing food and service.  KoMex is a definitive reason for why YOU should rent a car when visiting Las Vegas and leave the overpriced Strip for amazing food and service.

I was in Vegas with a group of 12.  We rolled in and without batting an eye, the server smiled at us and seated us quickly.  Her service was attentive and always with a friendly smile and great attitude (even though we were a loud group).

On to the food!  The highlights of the menu:

1) Bulgogi Fusion Taco - So I have had plenty of Korean Tacos, some good and some I threw away right away.  This one was good for one simple reason, it came from a Korean cook.  The bulgogi and slaw were legit and the flavors were amazing!

2) Calamari Taco - I will admit, I am a huge sucker for sauces.  Cruising through the menu, I originally was going to get the shrimp taco but saw "special sauce" in the description for the calamari taco and knew I had to get it... and I was not disappointed at all.  The calamari was crisp but not burnt with soft texture and squid flavor beneath the batter.  The sauce was really damn good and enhanced the calamari with a sweet spiciness.  A must try!

3) Kimchi Fried Rice w/ Bulgogi - Honestly... do I need to say more?  The kicker of this dish is the fried egg with runny yolk combined with the kimchi.... DROOOLLLL.

4) Bulgogi Fries - Cheese. Pico de Gallo. Chips. Kimchi.  Bulgogi.  Fries.  Oh man, the combination of flavors, spiciness, coolness, fries, and other amazingness makes this dish sooo coma-inducingly good.  Try please, for the sake of you future children.

Oh, and the service, again, is AMAZING!
