Can I just say wow? The abodaba is delicious. Everything on the menu is good. The lines are ridiculous but worth the wait. Table space is limited because its so delicious. The staff are really friendly. They see a lot of drunk messes but they're still really nice.The lengua and cabeza are super tender. The taco just melts in your mouth.  I come here every trip. It would be the true sin if you come to sin city and not come to this place.
