I love Mexican Soups, Menudo, Abondigas,tortilla soups, you name it! I found the Mother of all soups especially if you like seafood. Its called the Molcajete de Mariscos. Its a spicy shrimp soup served in a hot lava bowl. The bowl is made of lava stone and they cook it in the oven to heat it up and serve it to you piping hot with your choice of tortillas.
