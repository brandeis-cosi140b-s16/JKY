We have been here several times and at various times and this place is busy but seating is quick.  Service is the best, better than in many high priced joints.  Never an empty water glass or beer glass for that matter.  The beer is always cold and served in a great chilled glass.

Lelt me counter a previous poster - I am from Cali and I love this place.  Fantastic and varied menu so anyone should be able to satisfy their Mexican food desires.  Every entree I've had has been tops and the tortillas are like those made at home, light, fluffy, warm and downright excellent.  I could make a meal out of them!

Very good sopapillas if you have room for dessert.  This is no doubt one of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in the entire southwest.  Anyone posting less than 4 stars wouldn't know a tortilla from a tomahawk.
