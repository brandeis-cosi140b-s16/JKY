This is one of my go to spots whenever I find myself in Tempe. Admittedly the very first time I tried it I was like this is great but not as wonderful as it was pumped up to be, however I gave it another shot and have been going here ever since. Both of the meat options are delicious, but I prefer the scrumptious pink skinned grilled chicken the very most. Usually I get a small order of both meats and mix them together in a taco/burrito fashion. The decor is basic, but the food is bomb. The workers are humble and friendly and the food makes great leftovers too, what more could you ask for?! :D
