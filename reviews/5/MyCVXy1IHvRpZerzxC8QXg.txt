We stopped by the Nacho Daddy to watch the Sunday night Eagles game and were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service and delicious food at this great neighborhood bar. Our server Kim was smiling and super friendly,  she gave great recommendations for food and drinks and also filled us in on all the great specials throughout the week. BTW Tuesdays is 2 for 1 margaritas! Restaurant was clean,  staff was smiling and helpful, we will definitely be back again!
