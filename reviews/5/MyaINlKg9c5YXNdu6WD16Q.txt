As you enter Planet Hollywood you see Gordon Ramsey's burger restaurant.... Keep walking. YOLOS was my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. 

To start off the atmosphere was so relaxing and fun! The set up of this Mexican restaurant was so cool and modern looking. 

But what do we all really care about? Food and budget! This place was so delicious and completely affordable!!!! We had the fresh guacamole which is made right in front of you! Amazing taste. Then we had the mahi mahi fish tacos.. Cooked to perfection with great flavor. The pork fajitas were out of this world! The meat was so juicy and the vegetables were excellent. What also stood out was cilantro rice! WOW. I could eat a whole bowl of that alone. 

It's Vegas, and the margaritas and drinks are very affordable and they have a variety of tequilas and specialities. This restaurant truly has something for everyone and this Mexican food is SO MUCH BETTER THAN CABO WABO which we also went to one night. Service was fast and no wait. Very kind staff and our waiter Felipe gave us wonderful recommendations and was so sweet!!! You should certainly ask for him!!
