I have been eating here for the past 15 years or so, and I have never had a bad experience. The food is absolutely amazing; probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. (I have to admit that I don't venture off to many other Mexican restaurants because their food is so good!) My favorite item on the menu is the #1 combo - a red chili burro with a cheese enchilada and beans. Delicious! They will certainly remain a favorite of mine for many years to come :)
