I know this review is worthless but I've always had such a good time here. The champagne brunch and buffet is second to none when it comes to Sunday mornings. The champagne flows until you become obnoxious, inappropriate, and obliterated. Needless to say I have a new hatred for Walgreens. R.I.P. El Torrito on scottsdale rd. you will be missed by all.
