Amazing food and the service is just as wonderful. The cooks go out of their way to accommodate my family's allergies and always do it willingly with a smile. The girls at the front register are so polite and always smiling. Their carne asada tacos with potatoes are to die for. Not to mention their amazing carne asada bowls and fries. You won't find anything more authentic than here.
