I've been to Ricky's several times in the last few months, and each time I have left extremely satisfied with the food. Plain and simple, there is no better place in Scottsdale for Mexican food. The carne asada and barbacoa are amazing, and everything tastes fresh. Definitely make sure to try the chips and salsa that they serve--it is made in house and has a good kick. I will definitely keep coming back!
