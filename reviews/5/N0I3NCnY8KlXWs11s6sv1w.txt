We had a fantastic time enjoying this new restaurant. The name intrigued us along with the location being very easy for us to get to.
 No Que´ No  really offers very friendly service, really delicious food and that made us plan to come back very soon.   
      Betty had the carnitas and they were so good, she had to order more tortillas to eat it all.  I had the taco salad.  I know it's not an authentic Mexican dish, but it was what I was in the mood for.  All of the lettuce was fresh and not one wierd piece of browning core! ( These days, every salad I get has at least one brownish/whitish or chunk in it).  I loved the seasoning of the ground beef and the lightness of the huge taco shell.   
      The owner at No Que´No takes great care to pay attention to details and it showed.   While talking to him after dinner, we found out that they are working on getting better and better.   Also they are especially wanting to get the word out that they serve breakfast.  We look forward to trying that out!     
    Give them a try, we loved it and can't wait to go back.
