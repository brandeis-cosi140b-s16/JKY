There's not much in the way of good, non-chain restaurants to choose from in Laveen, so thank heavens for Gorda's Baja Tacos. They have great, fresh, authentic Mexican food! The fish tacos in particular are amazing, and the salsas are also impressive. And to top it off, the owners and staff are very friendly, helpful and attentive.  Finally a great restaurant in Laveen!
