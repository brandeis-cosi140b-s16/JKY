...and now they make bacon-wrapped hot dogs!?

I'll take 10, please and thank you!

I guess I was a little late to the hot dog party, so to speak.

I wish I had known sooner.

Zaipi's is now my go-to place for cheap, kick-ass hot dogs.

In my opinion, these guys make a much better hot dog than Short Leash in Phoenix.

You can go here and pay $2.50 for a superior product or you can go to Short Leash Hot Dogs and pay $10.00 for a mediocre product.

It's not a difficult decision.
