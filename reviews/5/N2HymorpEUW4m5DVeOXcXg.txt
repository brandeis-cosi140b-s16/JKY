Cantina is authentic Mexican food.  It is awesome.  I have been to Central Mexico for cooking classes.  Mexican food is highly complex.  Cantina captures that, which is much different from the typical places that are just stuffing seasoned been into a tortilla on a scalding hot plate.  The guacamole is amazing.  I have no idea how this place has received some of these reviews.
