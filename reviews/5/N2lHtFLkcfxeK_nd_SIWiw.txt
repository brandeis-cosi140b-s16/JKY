Every time I come here the food is fresh & delicious- plus my order is ready & not a lot of waiting. These people know what they're doing & they do it well! Flavored are on point & the creamy cilantro dressing is so good I could main line it! Lmao! I didn't try them for a long time as I assumed they were just another Tex-mex southwestern place but I regret it because I was so wrong! If you haven't been here try the ANYTHING! LOL
You won't be disappointed !!
