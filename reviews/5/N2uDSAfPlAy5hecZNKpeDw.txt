Being that I live in San Francisco and only make it to AZ once or twice a year, I'm thankful to get just about any burrito when I'm back home. That being said, Sylvia's burritos are some of the best I've had. I quite enjoy the serve yourself chips (have as much as you want) and the beer selection. I had a simple veggie burrito-  scrumptious. I saved half for the next day's lunch and it was just as good as the night before.
Oh Sylvia, I wish I could whisk you away to SF.
