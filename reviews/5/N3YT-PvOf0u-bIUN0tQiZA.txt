This is one of the best Chipotle's we've ever eaten at. The team members are quite attentive, and the management check in with customers from time/time to see how things are. We've been there quite a bit, so the staff remember us. Big plus for them. They execute the recipes well, recognize any of their own errors, and make sure that supplies are stocked up. If you're in Pittsburgh, or visiting from out of town, this is a good Chipotle experience.
