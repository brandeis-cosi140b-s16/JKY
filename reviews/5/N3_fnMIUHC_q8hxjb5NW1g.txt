The food was AMAZING!!!... great variety of options and salsa... Chef Paco was awesome I've never met a chef with such passion and friendly service... He came and introduced himself and asked personally about his food... I will definitely tell all my friends and bring all my business dinners here... This is the place for authentic mexican food :) I've been to Mexico several times and you can't get better margaritas and food unless you travel to Mexico yourself but I would save the trip and money and go here since it's the same quality if not better
