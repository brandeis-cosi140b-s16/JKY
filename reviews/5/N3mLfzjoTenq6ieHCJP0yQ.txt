Oh my tasty goodness!  This very small and basic hole in the wall restaurant is cash only, and so worth it.  I go with the combo of steak & chicken.  I love the pickled onions & the salsa tastes just like my Tata used to make.  Although I feel like the flour tortillas are a little undercooked, they are still delicious.  No frills, no fuss, just good food.  I will absolutely be a regular here.
