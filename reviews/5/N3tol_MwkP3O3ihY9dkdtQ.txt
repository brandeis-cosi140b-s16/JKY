Yep, I'm going 5 stars....mostly because all of the Mexican food in the NW valley is average.  I came here yesterday and was blown away by their green corn tamale with baja sauce, I want to go straight back today just to have another.  Damn was it good!  I had the 2 item lunch special and also got the beef enchilada with beans, total cost came to about $8 and another $2 for the drink so with tax and tip it didn't cost much at all for a good meal in a restaurant.  I always think of this place since I have to drive for more authentic Mexican but Macayos has pretty darn good chips and salsa (which is how you know your food will be good) and I also get another dish here but I can't seem to remember right now....guess I will have to re-review later.  Not sure I will ever get anything else but that tamale anyway, just get it done.
