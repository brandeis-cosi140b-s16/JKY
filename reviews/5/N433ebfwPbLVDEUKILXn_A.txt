The bean and cheese burrito with GREEN sauce is by far the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, hands down.  Be prepared for nothing fancy they are located in a neighbor area and only have outdoor seating. But it's 100% worth it if you like burritos. They don't have a large menu so don't expect tacos and stuff.
