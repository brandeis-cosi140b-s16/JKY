Incredible tequila selection! The food is consistantly very very good. Service is always attentive. Both the mild and hot salsa are two of my favorites but I'd suggest asking for some of the freshly made pico de gallo.  This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  The shredded beef tacos are very good but the machaca are even better.
