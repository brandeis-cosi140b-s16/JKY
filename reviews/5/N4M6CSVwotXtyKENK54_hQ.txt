Awesome food! Great staff and awesome service! I have been going to this location since it was El Picante. While I was sadden to see El Picante go, Taco Tio with it's awesome service, personable staff and great food is a fine replacement. I was a bit hesitant at first but they had reassured me by making the Tacos the way I wanted them. While it was not the way they usually prepared them, all you have to do was ask and give specifics if you wanted your tacos a certain way. 

It's true that I miss the way El PIcante would make you your food right in front of you, that was awesome, but if you like certain ingredients and your food a certain way, just ask them.

I've been reading some of the reviews on here and the people who gave them bad reviews probably has something up their butts and didn't have the common sense to ask for things the way they want them.... cough Kevin H. cough cough haha.Anyway, I personally live around the area just a few blocks away and love coming to this place. I hope more people will try this place out that way they can stay in business and make me my tacos! haha
