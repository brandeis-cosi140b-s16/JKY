LJ vs the Amigos Grande Burrito attempt #1. The "biggest in NV"!? maybe. All I know was that it was very very delicious and well worth it.  For $14.95 you get a very intimidating about 25 inch long burrito filled with a ton of ingredients not just rice and beans but all the good stuff, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, steak, salsa, etc. I had no shot, not even close maybe ate about a 4th of it and I ready to throw in the towel. UYE challenge anyone?

They were pretty fast in making it just waited about 5 mins. If your planning on taking it to go be careful because it's a little flexible, maybe they could make it like a chimichanga so that its firmer.

They also have a real good carne asada super nachos for $7.25.
