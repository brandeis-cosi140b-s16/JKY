Chips and salsa are sooooo good. The chips are hot fresh,crispy and salsa is fresh I love the hot salsa as well. We usually get the steak picado plate it is so good the meat is tender full of flavor, rice is good, there red enchilada place is also one of my favorites. Soda is good not watered down. The waiters are nice and my order has always been made right. I live in Goodyear and I will make the drive all the way down here just to eat this delicious authentic reasonably priced food. They also have several flat screens if you want to catch a good game and enjoy some good food
