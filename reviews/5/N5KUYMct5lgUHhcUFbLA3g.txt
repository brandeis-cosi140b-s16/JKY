I had a late lunch at this fantastic restaurant. The service was fast and the food was wonderful. They have a great selection of import beers which included my favorite, Dos Equis Amber. My server was in good spirits and polite. Her name is Ingrid..ask for her if you happen by. I will definitely be a regular.
