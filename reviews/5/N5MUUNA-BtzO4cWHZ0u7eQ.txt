Guacamole - RULES. Best I've ever had.
Empanada appetizer w ground beef - DELICIOUS!!!
We shared a sampler platter for 2, which was delicious. The flautas rule!
Chicken Mole wasn't the best I've ever had, but the meal was on the best Mexican I've ever had. 
Service was very friendly and prompt and genuinely nice. 
We will def be back
BYOB - there's a package store down the street. Grab some Corona and bring it with you!
