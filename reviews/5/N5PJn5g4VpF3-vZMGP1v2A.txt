The employees handled themselves well the other night when a disgruntled employee -  Ashley loudly in a vulgar way left the restaurant in her misguided teenage angst driven meltdown. Kudos to the staff and manager for keeping a level head and providing good food and service during a clearly uncomfortable situation for them. Thanks for the good food and service. We'll be coming back and enjoyed the entertainment Ashley provided. Albeit the employees were uncomfortable but we lead boring lives and this is all the fun we ever have.
