I like Rudy's because the food is very very good, and the prices are awesome! My husband loves this place and always comes here, and he brought me in today and I loved it. Alysa is very friendly. Our food took a little bit of time to come out but it's because they only have one cook, and I see why, because she makes the food taste really good. The enchilada sauce is a bit spicy just to let all of those people who can't stand spicy food know. Since the food came out a little late, they gave us our drinks for free! PLEASE NOTE: THEY ONLY HAVE ONE COOK SO COME WHEN IT'S NOT BUSY.  they have awesome food and will be back again.
