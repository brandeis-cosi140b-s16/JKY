We come to Anita's every time we're in town. I've been coming here since the 80's and the food is as good as ever. 

My favorites are the cheese enchiladas, shredded beef tacos, and the spicy salsa (the mild is good, too).  My wife loves the chile rellenos  

Typically, we are out the door for less than $10 per person UNLESS we buy a bunch of margaritas :-)

Great value, great food, fun time.
