Thank you Yelp!  I never would have found this hidden gem on my own. The complimentary roasted green chili/onion salsa is healthy heaven in a bowl, with a rich, smoky flavor. And the fresh guacamole is some of the best I've had.  The wonderfully warm and accomodating owners let me change the standard taco combo to have one carne asada taco (as good as others here have reported) and one fish taco (FABULOUS!).  I don't get to this part of town very often, but this modest place is SO worth the trek!
