I went to phoenix to visit friends and they highly recommended this restaurant for authentic mexican food. We went there for lunch, I took a look at what other people were eating as we were getting our table and it looked interesting. I had the fish tacos baja style and they were very good. We also had the sarandeado fish fillet and it was delicious.I also liked the cebada drink. the service was very good, staff was friendly even though they were fairly busy. too bad I was in phoenix for just a couple of days.
