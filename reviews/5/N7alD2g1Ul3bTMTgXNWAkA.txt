I have eaten here at least 50 times. Normally get an Arizona burrito with a side of guacamole. It has everything you need. Meat cheese tortilla potatoes and guac! I have never had a bad experience here, except that time they forgot my guac! Yes I was distraught... But I still had a burrito. Super nachos are good as well for those late night after bar times. Better than filibertos IMO.
