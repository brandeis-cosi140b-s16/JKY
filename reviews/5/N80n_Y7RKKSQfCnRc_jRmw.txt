The best tacos we had on our journey out west. This is a family owned business and you can taste it in the food. Don't let the bars on the windows deter you. We popped in a little after 10 am and shortly after all the tables were full. If you're adventurous and like to experience authentic meals, Santarosa will fill your taco, burrito, and menudo needs.
