My new favorite. Their salsa bar rules! Their tacos are stellar! Best of all, they have specials that are tremendous. S.U. had a wonderful bowl of green chile posole that would make our son, a green chile aficionado, extremely happy. I had their barbacoa special, a very generous serving of flavorful lamb shank with all the trimmings. The chips are hot and fresh, the salsas, see above. They have some grill platters (parilla?) that looked amazing! I asked about mole and they say that they make their own from scratch sooo ... that's next on the 'to try' list. Once I saw a seafood stew special that also looked incredible. Gusto mucho!

I do love Tac. Guad. on Park. There's plenty of room for more good Mexican food in Madison. Plenty of room.
