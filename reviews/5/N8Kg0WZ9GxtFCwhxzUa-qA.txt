We were staying at the Encore and we were on our way to Kim Chi right around the corner and were intrigued by this restaurant so we decided to pass on $28 per plate korean bbq and had us some tacos and carne asada nacho style fries.  This place did not disappoint at all Yes I agree the set up is a bit confusing but everybody was super nice, there is hardly any seating and it's always packed so take it to go.  I got the usual carne asada and I also had the al pastor.  I cant wait to go back to Vegas
