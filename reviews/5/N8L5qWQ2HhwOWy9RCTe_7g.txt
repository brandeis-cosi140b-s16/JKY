The wife and I had the pleasure to dine in at Mejico this evening and we absolutely love it.
Even thought there were a few little hick-ups with our order the staff did everything to make us feel at home.
We loved the food, from the chips and salsa (very unique) to the main course (the Diabla Shrimps and Rellno Cheese)  plus the desert (Flan).
I almost forgot to mention the awesome Margaritas Mejico serves...yum :)
This is a diamond in the rough, so make sure you visit before the place gets packed.
I recommend this place highly and looking forward to our next visit.
Thank you Logan for your friendly service.
