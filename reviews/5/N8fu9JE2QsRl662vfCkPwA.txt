I can't believe I'm giving a Filiberto's five stars. Yes...this is real life. And this is seriously the best location. 

The lobby is open until 3am on weekends. Nothing extraordinary for this type of food, but they take VERY good care of the interior. Most of the lights are off, so it looks quite dim. Coupled with the soft music, it's like a scene out of some stoner romance film. 

The employees are nice, and they care a lot more than anyone at any late-night Mexican place I've seen. They don't just yell out your order, they bring it over to you and present it with pride, as if you were at a *real* restaurant. 

"And for you, sir, the carne asada quesadilla".

They actually take time (it was like a 10-minute wait) to season everything to perfection. Nothing about my meal looked rushed or sloppy, which happens at literally every other location.

Classy AF. If I'm around Indian School after last call, and I'm faded, you best believe I'm dropping by here.
