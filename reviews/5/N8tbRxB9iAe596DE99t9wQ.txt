We chose this intimate and romantic Mexican bistro for our last night in Las Vegas. Everything that we had was the best of its kind that we've ever enjoyed: Best chili relleno (with butternut squash!). Best enchiladas, perfectly seasoned with spinach and mushrooms. The red sangria was perfect. The manager brought us a sample of their watermelon sangria--also wonderful. We finished with the best flan ever. Thank you, El Sombrero, for a night to remember!
