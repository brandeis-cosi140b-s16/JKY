I went here very frequently when I lived in C-U. They have a good variety (plenty of vegetarian options too), reasonable prices, a kind waitstaff, and I've never had to wait for a table. I love the outdoor patio in the spring & summer. It's also a great place for a birthday, as they are very accommodating.
