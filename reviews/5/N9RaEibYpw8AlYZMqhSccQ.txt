This location in particular is really good. Great, fast service and good amount of meat/shrimp portions. During lunch time with a long line, the staff is always very fast and efficient. The manager Maria is always helping and right up front when the lunch rush is at its peak.  She is hands-on and very friendly with staff and customers. After visiting another location under different management, I'm even more impressed with Maria and the staff here. The location near my house is considered a better area of town, but this location beats them in my opinion. It's a bit of a splurge lunch for me only a few times a month with the shrimp bowl or salad coming in around $10. It's well worth it though, as I'm always super full afterwards.
