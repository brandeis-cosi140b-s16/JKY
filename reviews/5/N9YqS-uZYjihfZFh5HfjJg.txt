Excellent....order the Steak Nachos and Ceviche Sampler (trio of baja, fusion poke, carribean).  The nachos had a burst of flavor, all the way down to the homemade chips. I also enjoyed the chips and trio of salsa before the meal. .....if you are in vegas, this is a spot you need to try at the Mandalay Bay. This place Rocks!
