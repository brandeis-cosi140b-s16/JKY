It seems that all the awesome food places are far from where I live. Well, perhaps it's just as well that this one isn't within easy reach for me because if it were, I'd be gorging on way too many tamales way too often. This small, unassuming store makes the best tamales I've ever tasted. The masa is rich and flavorful, the fillings are nicely seasoned; I like that their red chili is quite benign and doesn't oppress your tongue with heat. And the  different flavors work so well in combination, even when the combination seems strange at first. I thought cream cheese should never be put in a tamale but the green corn and cream cheese tamale quickly changed my mind. And such friendly people in the store! No wonder I've fallen in love with this place.
