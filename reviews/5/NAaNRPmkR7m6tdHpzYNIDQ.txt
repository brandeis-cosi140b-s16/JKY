What a gem, located in airpark just across from EOS fitness. This place serves up some of the most authentic Mexican food in Scottsdale. The bartender is very knowledgable on tequilas and does not mind making custom margaritas to your liking. My favorite is the Chilli Relleno! The absolute best I have ever tasted.
