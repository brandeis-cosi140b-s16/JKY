Came here extremely famished and ordered the 3 course family meal for $20. An absolute great deal for what it comes with: Mexican cobb salad, 8 pieces of chicken, corn or flour tortilla, your choice of 2 sides and churros for dessert. Quality of the food was fantastic. For a fast food place, they're all about healthy dining which is a plus. Service was awesome, food came out in a timely manner.... I'll definitely be coming back !
