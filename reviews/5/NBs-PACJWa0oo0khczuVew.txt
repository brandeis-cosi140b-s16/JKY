I read the reviews and wanted to try it. Super good and the pictures don't lie. A hole in the wall but if you feel like adventure and not afraid of the hood try this hidden gem.  The signature dish came out bubbling and full of flavor. My husband ask for a more traditional dish with diablo sauce. It made his eyes tear up and way to spicy for my taste.  But he sucked it up and ate it like a man.  They only serve beer and frozen margaritas and played really loud music.  The 4 stars are for the food only. Glad We tried it.
