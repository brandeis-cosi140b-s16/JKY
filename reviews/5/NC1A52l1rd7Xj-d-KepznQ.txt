What a truly lovely experience! Ben is an all around awesome person, I felt very welcomed and a very personable experience. The customer service care was beyond exceptional, there was definitely a nice vibe and good conversation. And the food omg.. I love tacos and these are definitely now on my top 3 list. I can't wait to go back and try a burrito! Ask Ben to show you the tortillas, promise you'll want one too!
