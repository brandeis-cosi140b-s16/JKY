I've been waiting for Qdoba to open up a location in Scottsdale since I moved here a year ago. It was my go-to place in college since they were open 24/7 on the weekends and the price, quality, and options are so much better than Chipotle. However, I know a lot of people who would argue that Chipotle is better.

I almost always get their Craft 2 Menu with 2 chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla. It's enough food to last me 2 meals, unless I'm really hungry. Their queso is really good too, especially in a queso burrito or burrito bowl. 

The staff was very friendly and offered to get us refills and helped to clean away our finished plates. They just opened up so some of the workers are still under training and becoming more efficient. 

I usually don't bother to write reviews for chains but I figured I'd leave the first review here because I love Qdoba that much... and you should too :)
