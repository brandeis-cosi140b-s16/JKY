I absolutely love this place. I was just there last week! In all honesty, the area is not the best, nor is the actual building. Although, once inside, depending on the time of the day, it usually is fairly clean, and the employees are very nice. I personally do not speak Spanish, but I have been coming for so long that they recognize me. But don't be alarm, most employees speak fairly good English. 

Though the location is questionable, the food is delicious! I LOVE their Carne Asada Burritos and this is the ONLY place I go to get a burrito. There homemade Flour Tortillas are to die for, as I am VERY picky when it comes to Tortillas. I don't go ANYWHERE else for a burrito. They also have very good Tortas too. So, don't let the location make you hesitate, it will be worth it if you LOVE a good burrito. 

The Carne Asada Burrito has Beans, Carne Asada, Pico De  Gallo, and Guacamole. And before I forget, their Red Sauce has a very different taste than something you would get at Phillibertos or any other Mexican Food Restaurant. This Red Sauce goes PERFECTLY with their Carne Asada Burrito.
