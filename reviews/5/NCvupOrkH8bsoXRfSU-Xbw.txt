I frequent this location a lot. It's a fav of mine. Not located in a good area but it is a great store. Salsa bar always fresh which is pretty important to me. Love love love the salsa. They have a great lime salsa, pick salsa, hot salsa.. You name it. They will always give you chips with whatever u order even if your meal doesn't come with chips. You can also buy a refillable cup that you can bring back and get dollar refills. Most of their stuff you can make pretty healthy. Patio area outside is large if you want to sit outside. Overall great place and will come back soon!
