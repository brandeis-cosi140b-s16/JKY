I came here with some friends on a whim & was pleasantly surprised! The menu is small but everything is made from scratch. I got the huevos rancheros, my husband got the breakfast burrito, & my friend got the veggie burrito. All items were delicious & the owner made sure to stop by & tell us about all of the salsa ingredients & meats that they smoke in house. This place is also BYOB friendly which is a huge plus since it's right next to the liquor store! The horchata was refreshing & not too sweet & the guacamole was extremely fresh. The couple who runs this place is thorough & truly cares about the quality of their food. I have no complaints & will definitely be back!
