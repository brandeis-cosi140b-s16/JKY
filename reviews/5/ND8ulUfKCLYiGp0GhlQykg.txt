Winnas!  It's a combination of Hawaii flair with Mexican.... You start off with with a rice bowl plain or with furukake, a burrito wrap or 3 tacos... they you choose meat chicken or fish, the steak and chicken was awesome, fish was lillle bland, but they have 3 awesome sauces to spice it up.  you then can add beans, lettuce tomatoes, sour cream crunchy tortilla strips and gor a bit more guacamole.  The coconut bark is a must try.  We came at 11:30, kinda slow our server was very friendly and offered us samples. after we got our food it started to get busy.  It's a must try when you get to Las Vegas.  We'll be back !
