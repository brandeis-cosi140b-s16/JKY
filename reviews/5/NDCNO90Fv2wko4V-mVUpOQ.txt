From the outside of this strip mall joint, you would expect typical low end Mexican you get on Bell Road in Phoenix.  NOT THE CASE - THIS IS EXCELLENT!

When you enter, it appears to be primarily take out with only a few tables, but sit and eat here.  The owner personally waits on you and is awesome.  The nicest person with great recommendations and knows his menu and food.  

On to the food....WOW, everything was yummy, perfect flavors, taste, temperature, etc.  Quick service, great food, cheap prices....I have a new Mexican favorite.
