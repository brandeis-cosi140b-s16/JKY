I was going to give it originally 4 stars, which is still exceptional in my book, but something happened that changed my opinion. 

I went to Chipotle's website and I found out that you can build your own meal online and it creates a nutritional facts calculator real time! I weigh my food, count my calories and watch my macros so having the flexibility to build my meal in advance to meet those requirements was an absolutely amazing feature! This way you are 100% in charge of your nutrition and can eat as good, or as bad, as you wish. This, in my opinion, is a game changer!

Great idea Chipotle! You just earned yourself a fan.

Aside from that, the they have a "to the point" selection of items, but definitely enough to taste good and mix things up. Like the In N Out of Mexican food. To the point and delicious.

This particular location, the lines moved quick, cashiers and food was consistent with Chipotle's standards.
