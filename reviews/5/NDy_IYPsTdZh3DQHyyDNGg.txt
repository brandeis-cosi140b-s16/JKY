What can I say, the whole meal was to die for! The salsa and guacamole were both fresh and seemed to be homemade, the pork stew was amazing, and the pork osso bucco was fucking phenomenal. The pork was fall-off-the-bone tender and was beautifully dressing in a mildly spicy sauce all served over black beans. Finally, to top off the delicious meal I shared the dark chocolate, marshmallow, and almond croissant bread pudding that made me want to melt and eat the whole thing myself instead of sharing. This place is a must go if you're even in the Tempe area and I know I'm definitely coming back.
