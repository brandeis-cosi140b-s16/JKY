A family favorite since America ran them herself. We frequent the one at 16th and Camelback Rd. We might miss the ambience of the original spots but appreciate the location as well as their great food and service. The portrait of America keeps watch of the crew at this location. Our large family always feel welcome--thank you guys! :-)
