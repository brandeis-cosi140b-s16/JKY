I don't know what the name is. I don't care.

The thing is, I was on my way somewhere else this afternoon and realized as I was getting off the highway that the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Bonanza was really, really close. So I went. And I found the trailer. And I ordered one single taco al pastor ($2.00 untaxed).

Best al pastor I have had yet.

There were no issues with saltiness, which has become all too common an issue at Taco y Taco as of late. There was also just savory, and sweet from the pork and pineapple, as well as the perfectly portioned complement of onions and cilantro, and some sort of green salsa. Side note: you have to add the onions and cilantro yourself from the condiment area, so I guess I know who to thank for all of that.

I will try other tacos when I can convince friends or family to go. But for now, I have validated for myself the hype from Yelp (and mainly Nelson Q.): this is definitely the spot for al pastor.
