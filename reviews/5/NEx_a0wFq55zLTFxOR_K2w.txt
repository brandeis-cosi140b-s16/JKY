Delicious tamales. Tried the pork, chicken, and beef.  Chicken was very spicy for the people who like it hot! I enjoyed the beef and pork more as I am not a spicy fiend. The masa was juicy and yummy. The meat was flavourful. These are the best tamales I have had, I do believe. I will be back to pick up some tamales.
