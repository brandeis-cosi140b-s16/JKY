Chipotle in Phoenix has gone organic, hormone free with their meat! Yay! The stores in California have been using Niman Ranch meat for quite a while (they're a group of humane organic ranchers). 

I don't know that AZ stores are using Niman, but they made an announcement today that they are going organic, hormone free. So your prices might be a few dimes higher, but BRAVO, Chipotle!
