YUMMY! My hubby and I tried this place tonight and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food. This is not tex-mex, but it's authentic homemade Mexican food. I had the Baja chicken chimi with jalapeño cream cheese. The green sauce over the chimi was so delicious and the chimi was huge and stuffed with so much chicken!! The jalapeño cream cheese was so good with everything else. The salsa tasted great, too. My hubby had the "pick 3" meal and got a burrito, tostada and enchilada. He also thought his meal was outstanding. The portions were very huge and the prices were so reasonable. We will definitely be back again!
