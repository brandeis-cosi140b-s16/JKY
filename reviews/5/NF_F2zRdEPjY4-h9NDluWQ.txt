Considering the overhead they have to be running to have a location like this in Oldtown Scottsdale, they have very affordable prices. The food is authentic Mexican fare of the taco truck variety. Burritos, tacos, tortas, etc. The waitress was very friendly and helped me find the World Cup on the TV, and at one point the cook came out and said hello. I felt very comfortable and relaxed while I was there, and the food was delicious. Great place to grab a bite if you're in the area!
