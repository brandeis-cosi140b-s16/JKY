Okay just to start off all of the Ajo Al's locations are good, I just decided to to write on this one because it has cool cow patterned booths.  I have eaten at plenty of Mexican restaurants but nothing compares to this.  It may not be the most authentic, but it is tantilizingly delicious People who don't like this place do not order the right things.  There are really only 4 things that rotate between.   First, you should always treat yourself to a cheese crisp appetizer. It is very thin and light so it won't ruin the meal  but provides a perfect start  it.  Then for an entree I either get a shredded beef chimichanga or there signature dish, the "pollo con queso" which is like a chicken chimi with melted cheese and jalapeno sourcream on top.  Also opt for  the rice and beans to accompany your Mexican dish and you won't be disappointed.  Ajo Al's offers great portions at resonable prices.  Finally if you still have room for dessert there is only one thing to get....the deep fried ice!   I truly hope that someone gives this place a chance because I promise they won't regret it.
