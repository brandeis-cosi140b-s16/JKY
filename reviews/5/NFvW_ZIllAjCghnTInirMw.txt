Wow i am really surprised at all the bad reviews! I live at the airport and i can tell you this is one of the  best places you will find in an airport anywhere.  It is a little high on the price but, so is all food at the airport except Philly because, they  have street prices.  The food is excellent and always very fresh! You have so many choices on what you  want to have on your burrito. You just cannot complain at all.    Everyone seems cranky when they are at the airport and throwing out the hate vibes. Everyone really needs to stop it. Be happy, be thankful for everything and everyone around you. I like this place i think it is really good just,expensive.
