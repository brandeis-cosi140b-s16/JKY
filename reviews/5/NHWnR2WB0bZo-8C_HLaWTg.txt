ok so AMber M. put it perfectly! Im lovin' on this place.. I usually go to Dos in Chandler... its def a lil more calmer, but I decided to try this place out last Thursday nite, went w the sister in law...  ended up having a blast, got drunk off of 50 cent Coronas, and had tons of fun dancing along w the dj's music... lots of guys, lots of girls... everywhere you looked peeps were having a blast and it was only Thursday nite... all I could think to myself, was why Ive never been out on a Thursday nite before!?!
