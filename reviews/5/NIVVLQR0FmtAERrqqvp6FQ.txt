I love me some Tacos...  And as such, I'm always in search for real, authentic flavorful tacos...  I was waiting for my pets to come out of the vets office and decided to do a quick Yelp search for tacos nearby; this is how I found this place.

The place had one customer, not that unusual since it was like 3 PM when I stopped by, but said customer seemed to be enjoying his food.

The cashier/waitress was very nice and took my order promptly.  Not knowing how the food was, I decided to do a "sampler" plate, with Carne Asada, Pastor, Buche, Carnitas and Deshebrada, one taco each.

When the plate arrived, the tacos were made with the small tortillas, but they were filled up very nicely...  I enjoyed all of the tacos while drinking an orange Jarritos soda.

The food was so good that I had to order more tacos to go.

I can definitely recommend this place to anyone and you won't regret it...
