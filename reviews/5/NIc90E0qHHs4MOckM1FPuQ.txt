The most amazing calamari I have ever had in my life! You've never had calamari like this! They use a different part of octopus then everywhere else. Its so moist! Omg! Also got the huevo rolls, very good too! 
The naranja margarita was the most delicious drink I've ever had, be careful, I could easily have one too many of these! You can barely taste the tequila, but even with my high tolerance, felt it after one. Every one here was super friendly and the manager, or guy that sat us was pretty charming and cute! Don't sleep on this place!
