I'll give it 5 stars. Parking is a little iffy, but maybe because its still so new. Valet was almost our only option, til we spotted a business lot without any restricted parking signs, accross the street. 

All drinks were 2 for 1, til 7 along with 1/2 off apps. 

Service was decent. 

The atmosphere was cool and spacious. I could hear a live band coming from the pool area. I did not explore the pool area this time, but from a distance it was looking pretty popular

Worth checking out and worth a 2nd visit, if not more!
