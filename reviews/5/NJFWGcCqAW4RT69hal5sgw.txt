Been coming here since i was 7 and im about to be 29. Theyve hardly ever messed up my order- I cant even think of once actually. Melanie is best in the drive thru, shes always really friendly and sweet.. must not be an az native! =)  Ive seen her like triple check my bag before- so shes really thurough. I usually dont go in to eat- havent in years since it was the go to munchie place when i was a teen. So I cant really comment on inside...but the drive thru has never been an issue - that and the food is consistent and good!
