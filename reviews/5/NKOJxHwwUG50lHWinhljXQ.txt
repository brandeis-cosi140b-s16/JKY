Great new place. The food was very fresh and light, but incredibly filling. I got a chicken burrito, while my husband got two tacos and a chicken quesadilla (the tacos and quesadilla were small-ish, but made a great meal together).

Will definitely be back again! I think this may become a regular carry-out for us. Too small to go to with a group, but great as a grab-and-go meal.

As for the parking - I recommend using the meters across the street behind Domino's. Waaaaay easier to get in and out of than the tiny parking lot by the restaurant.
