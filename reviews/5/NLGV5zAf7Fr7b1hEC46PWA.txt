Cute little Mexican eatery right along the canal. We asked to be seated at the table right by the water. Very quiet and it was fun to watch the gondolas float by. Not your traditional Mexican food but very tasty nonetheless. The waiter was really nice and had a very down to earth attitude. He even brought us a sample of their guacamole, which was delicious. I ordered the Tres Tacos and my husband ordered the chicken mole. The mole was exquisite and did not look like any of the mole dishes we've seen. It looked like a more "fine dining" version. Decent prices for being in the Venetian. We would definitely go back here.
