Still coming and still loving it. They went under new ownership recently which is why they were under construction for a while but it was worth it. 

Prickly pear margarita for the win followed by spinach con queso for an appetizer (FAVORITE). 

I usually just get cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend always switches it up with tacos, quesadilla, etc. 

You should really try this place out. Bernie the manager is great and super friendly!
