If you have never been here before, you have deprived yourself from an amazing flavor experience. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with smiling faces. Since it was our first time at Santo`s they had us sample all the meats from the mildest to the hottest. All were absolutely delicious and well worth the tongue burn when you got to the hotter end. 
We ordered the 5 small taco plate which gives you a nice variety of meats if you choose to make each one different.  Each loaded with toppings however you like it. We also ordered the nachos which were piled high with delicious, fresh toppings including cilantro, onions, tomatoes, shredded lettuce, roasted corn, beans, and choice of meat.
The decor is all lucha libre wrestling which gives the quaint little shop a bright, fun, and lively atmosphere to enjoy some truly great and delicious food. This is definitely a must for anyone in the mood for some great, great food at a good price.
