When you arrive ask for Ernesto! 

We have never been here before and its a more traditional Mexican restaurant than those i have been at before. I haven't heard names/ingredients for some of the food options, and he was very good at explaining each option. 

Food was DELICIOUS and the beverages were perfect for a warm sunny day in Scottsdale. For margarita choices, all you gotta do is tell them you desire, more/less sweet or more/less fruity and you be set!
