Three Amigos is the best Mexican food ever! It is so authentic and tastes so fresh. The queso is my favorite and the guacamole is to die for. Made so fresh and so yummy! The margaritas are also delicious and made with fresh fruit & the fishbowl ones are so big and good. Get the chimichangas with shrimp, they are amazing & so much food so you will have yummy left overs as well!
