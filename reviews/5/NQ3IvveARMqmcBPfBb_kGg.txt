Great Mexican food, and drinks! I had the tacos rancheros and the meat was really good. The dish could've used a bit more salt but other then that it was delicious. I also had the perfect margarita which was perfectly crafted. Choose your margarita size carefully, I had the medium and I had a good buzz halfway through. The salsas are also good. Can't wait to try different dishes and margaritas next time!
