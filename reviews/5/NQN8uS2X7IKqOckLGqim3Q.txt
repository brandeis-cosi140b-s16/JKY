Started off terrible. No one helped us for 30 minutes. Yes, it was National Championship night, but still. Asked for the manager. He came out... very sincere and took care of us. Great service from than on. Been here 20 times. Always great food and great people. People make mistakes, Or places get busy. It's all about the attitude to correct the problem for me. Definitely recommend.
