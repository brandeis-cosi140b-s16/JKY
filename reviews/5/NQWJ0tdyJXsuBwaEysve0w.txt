This is my kind of place.  They do what they do - they do it well - they hope you enjoy...  that's it and it's that simple.  It is authentic and unpretentious.  

They do molcajetes here.  I guess the molcajetes is the cooking/serving vessel made from volcanic rock.  You have your choice of steak, chicken, shrimp and I think they had octopus.  It comes with cotija cheese, cactus leaves, onion, jalapeno, tomatoes and maybe a few other things.  The best part is the sauce.  It really ties the dish together.

I had the combo; steak, chicken and shrimp.  The steak was a little tough and not to flavorful.  I could have done with out that.  It didn't matter thought the sauce made up for it.  It was a big dish - big enough for 2.

The sauce really was that good.  It is like an enchilada sauce but with more flavors.  I think I tasted a hint of chipotle.  It was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  It really was just a bunch of stuff in a heavy hot bowl... but the sauce... makes it MOLCAJATES!  That sauce was so good you could have dropped some cat turds in there and it would have been good!!!!!!!!

I really liked it.  It was different. It was NOT some half ass Mexican dish served with some rice and beans.  

When we ere leaving - they actually said thanks for coming in.  (that is a hint to some other restaurant owners)

It is worth the trip to the east side!
