Love this place!! The owner/operator is super friendly, loves his work, and makes great tacos. He kept me entertained the entire time I was at his stand, walking me through all my options. His tacos are bigger than expected and delicious. These are no frills tacos with beef, chicken, and pork options for 3 bucks each.
