I have wanted to write this review since our dinner at Richardson's.  Procrastination being the culprit.  I had read some iffy reviews of the new place, but we loved the old place too much not to give it a try.  Walking in to the restaurant was a bit of a shock.  I couldn't believe it was the exact same!!  That was a little weird, but in that the restaurant LOOKED the same, the food TASTED the same if not better!  Sea bass was perfect in every way! I had the chili rellenos which I love.  The sevice was wonderful! I believe his name was John.  I hope that is correct, because the reviews about service have been spotty at best, and he deserves a great review.  We will, definately, return to Richardson's, but not soon enough for me.  Glad to have it back!
