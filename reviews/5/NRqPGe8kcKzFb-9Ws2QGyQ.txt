Ordered their Thursday Special of 4 tacos & a drink. I love "carne al pastor" so my tacos were Al pastor. Loved how well seasoned the meat was since I'm always having a hard time finding ones who aren't over seasoned or under seasoned. Tacos come with double tortilla and fully loaded with cilantro and onion & salsa of your choice. Pepe tacos never fails in authentic Mexican food spots and loved the fact they are open 24/7
