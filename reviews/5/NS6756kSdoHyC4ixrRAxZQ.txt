Tequila Restaurante came across in one of the Yelp email newsletters, and have been very pleased that it did. 
This location is a nice intimate spot, with great food and guest service. 
The staff is courteous and very attentive.
With few authentic Mexican places to eat in town, it was a joy to find this venue. 
I appreciated how the bar was separate from the dining area. 
Love the rustic, industrial ambiance. 
Will definitely be back.
