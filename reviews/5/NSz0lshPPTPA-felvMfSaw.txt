We'd walked by this restaurant a few times and never tried it until it was recommended highly by the staff at the nearby LensCrafters. We had the taco plate and liked each one a lot, especially the fish taco. We were really impressed with the quality of the food. The chef obviously cares about the recipes and preparation, and the staff was friendly and fun. Try the caramel cream cheese dessert. It's addictive. We had a great time, and return often.
