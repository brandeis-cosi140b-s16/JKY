Yooo this place takes! i suggest eating this food.  cus what else u gonna do for dinner bruh? i suggest it, so good. im addicted to the green sauce. i really have a hard time thinking clearly with such incredibly strong cravings for the fucking green sauce. which is odd because i always mix the green and red. kindof a "who is the real hero" deal. anyway. breakfast burrito & california burrito both go so hard. period. if youre coming here to eat someplace nice, fuck off. its good food, sort of shitty inside but dont act like you wash your dirty ass sheets every day anyways. love it
