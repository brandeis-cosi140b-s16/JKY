This is really the best place to get burritos in the east valley.  It's the tortillas!  My son and I go there before I drop him off at school sometimes.  On weekends we get burritos for the whole family.  My favorite is the chorizo/potato/egg burritos and my son loves the sausage/potato/egg burritos.  We also get a dozen homemade tortillas frequently (they are amazing) because they make the BEST cheese crisps at home.   We never get tired of the food from El Sol.  If you haven't tried it, try it today so you know why everyone loves it.  The owner and the staff are the friendliest people and always make us feel welcome.
