I love this place so much I joined Yelp just to communicate how amazing Casa Rasta is. Tacos are great even when they're awful but these tacos aren't awful at all they are actually the best. The carnitas tacos are amazing. Pickled onions are involved! And Mexican Cokes! Both salsas were terrific and perfectly spicy. This is my favorite meal in Pittsburgh at the moment and it is also incredibly inexpensive. The best part is you can eat tacos and then get pizza at Slice when you are finished! Why not? Seriously, because I don't even know about things that are better than pizza and tacos. Maybe puppies but I probably wouldn't like to eat one of those.
