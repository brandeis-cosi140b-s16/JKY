I use to live in San Diego and loved this place. I was so excited when they opened a location in Vegas. It was a short walk from where we were staying so we ended up coming here TWICE in one trip. First was late at night after some drinks which was perfect. There wasn't much of a line and we were able to find seats right away. The second time was Sunday at noon where the place was a ZOO! I think they need to figure out a new way to ensure people know they are in the right lines and to also pay! I saw a few people that just sat down at tables after getting the food...I'm pretty sure they didn't pay? Anyway, I was able to ask the guy in my line to also get me two carne asada tacos from another line, tehehe.

This place is awesome. I'll be coming time and time again!
