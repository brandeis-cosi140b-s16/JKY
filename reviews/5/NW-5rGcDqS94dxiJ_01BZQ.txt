Move over Robertos, there's a new fast food authentic Mexican spot in the hood, and IT IS WAY BETTER! Don't be fooled when you walk in and think, the same menu/same food. WRONG! Just try the cheese enchilada plate, or California burrito. Shoot even the hot sauce is better. 
If you are looking gourmet, keep driving. But if you are craving that quick, messy, maybe make your stomach hurt but worth it taco, STOP AT FAUSTOS! 
I can eat tacos 24-7. You would swear I had some Hispanic in me somewhere. I like street tacos, white boy tacos, Indian fry bread tacos. It is something I eat on a weekly basis and if the family would allow it I would eat there more. 
I use to be a huge fan of Robertos, but now, I am spoiled and it is hard for me to eat there, knowing there is a fresher, better tasting, and cheaper option. 
Another plus for Faustos, I heard the first year they made it big, the owner bought every team member a truck. I believe it is true because whenever I go to the location by me, the same guy with the same truck is always there! 
Good service. Good Prices. Great food. EAT HERE NOW.
