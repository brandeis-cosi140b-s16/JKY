Awesome chili rellenos...possibly the best in town!!!  I prefer them covered in their green sauce.  Great home made chips and salsa also- though be warned that they do charge for add'l baskets of chips.  Great service!  Never crowded unfortunately. Very casual atmosphere but a step up from quick food as they do wait on you.
