I could never understand why my boyfriend would always rave about this place.  I am not a fan of Mexican food but this place is a game changer.  I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed my meal here.  You can customize your orders and the servers help you along the process which makes ordering here a breeze. 

Overall, I could not get over how huge the burrito was though.  It could easily be shared for two.  This is a great fast food restaurant to get your Mexican fix in a jiffy.  I will definitely be back again the next time I'm in town.
