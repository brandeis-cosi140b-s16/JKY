Green Mixed Chimi, you are the death of me!

Rito's is the In and Out of mexican food. Made with great products and frankly their lack of selection is what makes them so good. Make good food and make it right.

Best Chimi that has ever entered my mouth.

My waistline is somewhat grateful that there is not a chain of Rito's especially with in 10 minutes of my house. Rito's is always a treat when I am downtown working. 

Oh and the counter help is pretty easy on the eyes to.... And they laugh at my jokes so hey, winning!
