Met some dear friends for dinner on Friday night... I absolutely loved this place.
They were pretty busy at around 6:15 pm, they told us it would take 30 to 45 min to get a table but we were seated in about 15.

This is what we ordered:
-Queso fundido con chorizo
-Cochinita pibil torta
-Pozole
-Elote Callejro
-Guacamole
-Carne Asada Tacos
-Fish taco
-Carne asada torta

I tried the first 5 and all of them were really good.
I was undecided with the Tamal Oaxaqueño and the Pozole, but our server assured me the pozole was very good. And she was right! it comes with 3 home made corn tortillas and it had enough meat for me to make 3 tacos ; ) The salsa was soooo good. I liked them both but the red was the most popular in our table.


Oh, for drinks I had the prickly pear margarita and it was awesome... I am glad I tried it even though I barely ever order drinks with alcohol.

Parking was decent, on the street or on the lot South of the  hotel.
Service was nice and friendly, a little slow, specially at the beginning, but it was a busy night.

We will give it a try during lunch or earlier... because I gotta go back try that tamal Oaxaqueño : )
