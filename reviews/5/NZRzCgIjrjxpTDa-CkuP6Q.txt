by far THE BEST tacos i've ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

i first tried tacos el gordo in san diego and i was relieved to find out that it was just the same at this location!!! tacos with al pastor! MMM MMM MMM DELISH :) oh! and also try their tostadas!!

warning: this place can get extremely crowded and it doesnt help that this place is freaggin small! there are different lines for different tacos and the cashier is on the opposite side of the room...its an awkward set up for sure but bare with it because it's really worth it :)
