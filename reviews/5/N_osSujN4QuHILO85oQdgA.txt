As I am eating my way through the menu, this time I tried I tried the pulled pork sandwich, which, if you are expecting a Cuban knock-off, it's not, but it is wonderful. It comes with coleslaw, a roasted Poblano and dressing with the wonderfully prepared pork. I had a side of fries (always excellent). My GF had her usual burger (the Beach House) but with a side of coleslaw. The house coleslaw is good, don't get me wrong, but, with almost everything else on the menu having a culinary "twist" I can't help but think that this is an opportunity waiting for a touch of creativity to be applied. Even so, the slaw is fresh, tasty, and we'll done.
