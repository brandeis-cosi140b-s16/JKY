Great Tortas for the price and flavor, very clean. I live right around the corner from them so I'm a very repetitive customer. First time I went I fell in love with their bread, not to mention the freshness of their products something fast food chains lack.

I grew up in central Mexico, tortas in Mexico are like burgers in America, every restaurant has them each with it's own unique style and flavor finding them here and portraying the meaning of authentic  Mexican food can sometimes be hard to find.  But Tortas Paquime has it and it's fabulous!!!
