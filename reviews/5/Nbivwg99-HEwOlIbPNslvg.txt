This place is awesome! The atmosphere is very lively with great music and entertainment! Our server, Larissa, was very outgoing and helpful. She recommended the carne asada tempequena and it was to die for! The drinks are pricey but totally worth it considering how strong they were!! Every time I come to Vegas I'm eating here!!!
