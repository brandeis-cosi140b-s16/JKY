The food here is everything they say it is, but the small place is not very easy to find, even with a GPS! It's to the right of Panda Express right next door to the Burger King on West Elliot, if that helps. You should enjoy this place while it's still swinging for the fences and being run by the friendly man who started it, because it will surely be a multi-location chain in the near future! Unbelievably inexpensive for the high quality product!
