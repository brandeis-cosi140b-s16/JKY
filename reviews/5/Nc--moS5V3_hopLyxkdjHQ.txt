The food has been solid the las 10 or so times we have come in for lunch as well as dinner.  They had some kitchen issues in the past and for a while we stopped going in.  A couple familiar faces as servers are still here.  Jon always takes good care of his people.  Drinks are solid and delicious.  I had the trout for the first time and it sure won't be the last.  Contrary to rumors in the papers and on the news the Z is doing just fine and media needs to get full story and records straight.

Come on in and enjoy the food....the people... And just sit back and chill
