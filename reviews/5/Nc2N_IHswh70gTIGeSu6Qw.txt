We were here on Wednesday, 12/21/11. We had been at a Rubios in CA recently and was extremely disappointed. Not this time!

Jacob was our order taker and was VERY courteous and professional. 

My husband got two fish tacos that were a good size and yummie. I went with the grilled veggie burrito and man, it was huge and tasty!

This is what Rubios is about!
