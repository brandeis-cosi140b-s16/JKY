Worth finding. Sure it's in the back of a poorly lit grocery store, but it's clean, inexpensive, fresh, and delicious. Grab a Coke from the fridge (the stuff w/ real sugar not corn syrup) or order a horchata. If you're a big eater, try one of the enormous tortas. It's a hot sandwich with your choice of breaded chicken, pork, or beef, topped with fresh tomatoes, avacados, lettuce, cheese, and mayo. Half of one and I'm stuffed.

The little gorditas with chicharones are another favorite. A small tortilla, stuffed with spicy, crispy pork belly, deep fried, then stuffed with fresh cilantro, onion, and a little cheese.

Or if you're adventurous, try something off of the menu in Spanish. They're happy to translate if you don't know what the items are.

Definitely one of my local faves and you can visit all you want without breaking the bank.
