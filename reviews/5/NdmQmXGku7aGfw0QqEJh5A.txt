Chipotle oh Chipotle. What can I say? I love, love, love LOVE Chipotle. No matter what state you're in, you can always rely on Chipotle. Many restaurants (many, not all) offer organic meats and veggies. 

One downside that isn't really a downside: Picking up multiple orders is a chore, because it's cafeteria style ordering/burrito making. Best bet is to fax or complete your order online. Have I mentioned that I love Chipotle?

They have a signature cilantro lime rice that is quite tasty. All of the meats are fabulous. For meats: Carne (steak), barbacoa (shredded beef), Chicken (chicken) and Carnitas (roasted pork). Pinto (whole not refried) and Black Beans are also tasty.

Phat Burrito is pretty good too, but Chipotle takes the cake for me. I'll take Chipotle over Moes, Qdoba or Salsaritas ANY day. It always taste much fresher than any other burrito place. For those of you who are hesitant to try Chipotle, you won't be disappointed. 

Suggestion: Chicken Burrito w/rice, Black beans, Corn salsa, pico de gallo and hot salsa. Bam! That's the winner right there.

BTW have I mentioned that I love Chipotle?
