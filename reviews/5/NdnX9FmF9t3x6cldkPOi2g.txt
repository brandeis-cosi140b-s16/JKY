Criminally under-reviewed. What's up yelpers? This place is bombbbb

You can't really eat in so here's what you do:
1. Go inside
2. Order 1lb Carnitas
3. Order 1lb Barbacoa
4. Order 1lb Toritallas
5. Order 1lb Queso Fresco
6. Get cups of salsa, particularly the dark and smoky chipotle one

EAT A LOT.

It's good, don't be scared it's not that hard and the staff is super friendly and helpful.
