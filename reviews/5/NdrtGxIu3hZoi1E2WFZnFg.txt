This is as hole in the wall as it gets- an it's awesome.  My husband and I found this place because we were hungry for breakfast burritos one morning and stumbled upon it.  Then, we loved the food so much we have gone back consistently and taken many people.  This place is clean and the food is great.  It's definitely worth checking out!
