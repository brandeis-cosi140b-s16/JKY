This place is really good. My father-in law told me about it we drove by it like three times. Finally, we realized that the place had no signage. Then we decided to try it, WOW! It's was awesome! So delicious, so much flavor. Personally, get the green chili pork, totally worth it. Did I mention they have fry bread, and they are reasonably priced. It's like chipolte meets filibertos. Meaning great food, simple decor.  You serve your own chips too.
