Very good food! I was actually very surprised . And I got much more than I bargained for. I got the shredded beef wet burrito and my boyfriend got the foot long chicken burrito and a side of fries. We were both very pleased . I tried his burrito, the chicken was very tasty and tender and the fries were really good to be only a dollar, plus we received plentiful They did have a small Mimi bar inside. Not as good as Roberto's but in MY opinion the food taste better than Roberto's and ITS CHEAP! I'm defiantly going back!
