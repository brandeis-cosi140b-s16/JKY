I have been to Cantina Laredo a handful of times now, and have yet to have a poor experience. I think my favorite entree is the enchiladas y asada plate. Amazing!

On my last lunch date at Cantina, I was introduced to their apple pie. I was told it smelled like heaven. Now, I have yet to actually smell heaven, but if I could image what heaven might someday smell like, Cantina's apple pie is right up there. It is served on a hot skillet and drenched in brandied butter sauce... to die for! 

I've always had good service and received beverages, food and chip refills in a timely manner. I will absolutely return to Cantina Laredo again soon - especially since there aren't many nice Mexican restaurants in the Summerlin area.
