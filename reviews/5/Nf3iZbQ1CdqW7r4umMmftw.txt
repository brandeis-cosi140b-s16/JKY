The first time I ate at this place, I went back twice on the same day.  And now every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to make the time to eat at this place at least once.  Two favorite items on the menu are their tuna ceviche and Dan Dan Mian.  Both are to die for.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about how delicious their food is.  An absolute 5 star experience.
