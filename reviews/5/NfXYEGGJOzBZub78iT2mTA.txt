It's not Chico's Tacos but it's pretty damn close! I like this place a little better because they have tables and chairs instead of only booths. They also have functional AC in here. 
We drove 25min across town to check it out and I'm glad we did. The presentation is on point. Looks just like Chico's. Their sauce is a little more watery and their cheese melts unlike Chico's. Pour some green salsa on
top and enjoy these beef flautas. You can order a single or double of them. You might need a fork by the time you get to the bottom but those ones are the best. They've been marinating in the red sauce. When you're done dunk your fries in there too. 
I also ordered the flautas Juarez while we were here. I chose the chicken ones. They were crunchy and cooked to perfection. Lettuce, cheese and a green sauce were on top of them. 
The elote comes in a cup off of the cob with all of the toppings. Way easier to eat it like that. 
While enjoying your food check out the ceiling. There is T-Shirts from the original Chico's Tacos. Saw an El Paso Chihuahuas one up there too (minor league baseball team). There's also a lot of historic pictures of El Paso and Juarez all around the restaurant. 
The staff was very friendly and spoke both Spanish & English fluently.
