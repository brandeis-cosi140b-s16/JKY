At first glance and not used to the South side of Phoenix I was a little hesitant to try this place out, but it has been by far one of the most delicious Mexican takeout/restaurants I have ever eaten at. I go at least once a week and enjoy their chips and guacamole with their cruncy beef tacos. Slight wait in the drive through line but it's worth it because their food is always so fresh!
