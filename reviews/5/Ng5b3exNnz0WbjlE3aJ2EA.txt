I love Christina's! It's a tiny family-run Mexican restaurant with delicious and affordable meals. The owner and his family are extremely friendly and always make me feel welcome. They can tailor menu items to be vegetarian and dairy-free, if desired, which is fantastic. I go here for lunch whenever I'm in the area.
