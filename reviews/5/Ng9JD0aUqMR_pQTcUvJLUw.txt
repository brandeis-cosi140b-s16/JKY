Burrito Express is the most important thing that has ever happened in the history of the United States of America. The steak potato and cheese burrito is the only thing that matters in the universe. It makes me want to freak out all the time. I think about it and I just want to throw glass on the ground and freak out and scream and panic because I want it so bad. It's the best burrito I've ever had in my life, hands down. Also their sauces in those cold containers really make the experience... Hats off Burrito express. Don't you ever change
