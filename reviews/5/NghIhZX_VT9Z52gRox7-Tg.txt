My wife and I enjoy going here on occasion, but we don't like going when everyone has their groupons to use. I wish they would avoid running the groupons, as the restaurant doesn't have the large kitchen to keep up with the orders when they get packed. This is when we pay regular prices and enjoy our food,  but hear the grouponers complain about every little thing possible. It's comical, and I feel bad about the staff. 

Their food has been consistently good, and service is friendly.
