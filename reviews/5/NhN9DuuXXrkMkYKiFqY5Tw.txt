First time customers last night. Went to dinner with my parents. I have to admit it was delicious. The big platter they have like San Pedro was amazing and the price was right $35.99 and feed 2-3 people. Pineapple pi√±a colada was great! My dad is one picky person and he loved it and wants to go back for his birthday in 2 weeks. Definitely Going back.
