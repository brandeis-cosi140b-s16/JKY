I've been trying to locate good Mexican in Las Vegas and this place takes it! This place is real home-made Mexican food! It's not too fancy though, I'm not about to shove out $20-25 for a carne asada plate when $10-15 seems more reasonable. 

I had the green enchiladas with chicken and they were delicious. The chips, the refried beans, and the rice were great! I wasn't a fan of the salsa that came with the chips, but that's just me. My friends liked it and I'm a firm believer that you really can't have it ALL. 

The service was professional and attentive. The setting was a little loud, but when I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect to have live (or some form of) music and to enjoy the general "ambiente".  This place had just that. 

I will definitely be back with adults only to have some adult beverages also. If I could just place this restaurant closer to my house in Henderson!
