Las Margaritas is a great mexican restaurant. Usually, my family and I would eat as Don Pedro's, but after eating here, we switched. Food is a bit cheaper, a bit better, and the atmosphere is fitting for a mexican restaurant. Service is also very good and there are rarely any issues. I'm yet to have a bad food experience, their cheese enchilada is to die for! Also, their complementary salsa and chips are delicious, as well as the cinnamon-cream desert chips that come with the bill. Portions are huge, but filling, and you always leave happy! Great restaurant that I will return to!
