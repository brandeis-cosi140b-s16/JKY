Dint be afraid of the bullet proof surrounding the cashier, i recall seeing it 10 years ago when glendale was a really high crimed are, but its gotten better....anyways the carniceria is good. Their meats are fresh, i will admit its higher than avg price. The one thing i really like is their chicharones. Not the thick ones but the smaller narrow strips. They grill chicken on the weekends on the charcoal you will see if you ever drive by.
