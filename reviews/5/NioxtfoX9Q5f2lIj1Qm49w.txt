Rarely do I give a 5 star review and this place probably deserves it the most out of any place I've been! 

I give it 5 stars because of the authentic ingredients, amazing taste, incredible service, giant portions and awesome value! 

I've never seen a combination of all of the above like this place. This IS your "hole in the wall authentic Mexican cuisine GEM"
