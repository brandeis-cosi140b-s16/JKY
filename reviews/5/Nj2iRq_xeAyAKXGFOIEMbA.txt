One tortilla with butter will make you love Carolina's! I've been going here since I was 19 and working at America West Arena and it hasn't changed a bit over the years.  

Open at 7 a.m., expect a line with hungry guests waiting to order their regular ..green chili burro or try the eggs, machaca and potatoes burro.   Lunch time, Carolina's is a hot spot for downtown workers who are ok about venturing into a central neighborhood, so go early! 

The building is old and there's no glitz and glamor to the furniture but when you have really good authentic Mexican food, who needs that!
