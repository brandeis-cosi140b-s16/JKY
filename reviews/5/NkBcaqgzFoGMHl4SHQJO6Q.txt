TACOS!

Pop in here day or night for a great casual atmosphere, and some seriously good tacos.  Their kitchen is shared with Vida Cantina next door, so all the food is great quality, and it tends to come out pretty quickly.

There's occasionally live music or a DJ posted up at the front of the restaurant, and when the weather is nice, they'll open up the garage doors to the patio. 

Stop in with a friend or two and have a couple Tacos, a frozen margarita and a beer.  If you're really hungry, get the chips and guac, and split the taco platter with a friend.

I haven't had them all yet, but my favorites are the Fried Chicken and Carnitas tacos.  They're served on small tortillas with just the right amount of meat and vegetables, and go down easily.  The price is pretty fair, too.  Best taco spot uptown for sure!
