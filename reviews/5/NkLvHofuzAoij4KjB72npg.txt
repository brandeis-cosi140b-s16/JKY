Open 24hrs, Senor Taco (Famous for the Shrimp Burrito) is a must stop.

The Diablo shrimp burrito is to die for, Lunch or Dinner. Ham & Cheese Quesadilla's for breakfast are great (Ask them to mix in a few Jalapenos with the ham).

All my friends drool whenever they come over cause they want to stop.
