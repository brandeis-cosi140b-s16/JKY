This was definitely not a restaurant I would have tried had I not read the reviews on yelp first.  It's not in the best neighborhood and looks rundown from the outside.  I have now learned that appearances mean nothing.   The food was fantastic, and that's coming from someone who is not a big fan of Mexican food. 

I had the tacos design Carne Asada and they were wonderful. The meat was so tender it melts in your mouth.  Add that to homemade tortillas and tortilla chips, and you can't go wrong.
