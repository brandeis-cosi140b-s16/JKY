I will admit right up front, I have never eaten dinner at the Rokerij.  I have, however had happy hour there about a dozen times, and that experience deserves a consistent five stars. They have recently modified the specifics of happy hour for the better, currently it is $5 small plates, house wines and well drinks from 4-6 PM and 11- Close every night.  All of the small plates are top notch food.  I personally recommend the soft tacos with Adovada, Brie and Tenderloin Toasts, or Bacon Wrapped Scallops.  However, there are about 12 other options and all of the ones I have tried have been excellent. Steven is the regular bartender and is extremely courteous.  The music is also a highlight, it is played off an old mac laptop, and features a mix of classics and cutting edge indie rock.  I love the downtstairs bar, great atmosphere for what little winter Phoenix has to offer.
