Wish these folks were closer to where I live.  I miss this place already!

A seasonal poblano was available.  Score!  Chock full of chicken and fruit and coddled in an almond. white sauce.  Fabulous.

We also ordered the miraculous quak.  Someone in the kitchen who is quite skilled in the handling of pomeganates (I think that's hard!)  laced the quak with plump, fresh seeds.  Great touch.

No watered down Tex-Mex culture here.  There are fabulous paste-ups on the windows of black & white Madres.  Another mural inside has the Dia del Muertas skulls.  Small skulls encusted with sparkle are at the cash register for purchase.

It's in a strip mall within Old Scottsdale, so parking can be a challenge.  Walk, baby!
