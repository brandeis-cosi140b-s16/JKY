Been eating here since I was 5, inconsistently but None the less I am 16 now. Awesome place with delicious food that has great variety. Friendly staff and an overall clean environment with very little wait for food

My suggestions:
Carne Asada fries
Carne Asada California burrito
Pollo Asada burrito 
And to top it off some Jamaica juice
