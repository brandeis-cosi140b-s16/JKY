Disclaimer: I am from California. I grew up in NorCal and spent my college and post college years in SoCal...and I miss Mexican food.

First of all, I read a review stating "Socal, Tex it's all the same to me for the most part." They are very different styles of food and I think its important to go into Los Cabos knowing that

Now to the meat of the matter (yes that word choice was on purpose). This is not your Northern California Mexican food; no nicely grilled chicken with rice and black beans in a whole wheat tortilla. This is a burrito that consists of only large amounts of meat, cheese and guacamole wrapped in an amazingly tasty (and likely fatty) flour tortilla. While not quite the same as what I ate regularly in Cali, it is still very good. I would probably give it a 4/5 stars if it were in San Diego, but I'd still eat there regularly especially because their California burrito is actually better than the ones I used to eat. 

If you've never had a California burrito, you should. It has the usual meat, cheese and guac, but also has fries. The reason why Los Cabos' California burrito is so amazing is that they make sure their fries are crispy which add more texture and flavor to this awesome burrito. I have yet to try their carne asada fries, but I can only imagine they will be amazing. 

You must try Los Cabos. They are by far the best Pittsburgh has to offer for Mexican food that I have found so far.
