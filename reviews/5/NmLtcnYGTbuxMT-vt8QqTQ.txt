Best fast food Mexican place I have been to in the Phoenix area.  Menu has great variety and their Salsa is damn good.  Go here instead of Fili B's!  So far I haven't ordered anything that I don't like.  The restaurant is fairly clean for a fast food establishment that is busy during all hours of the day/night.  Food takes a little while to cook but is well worth the wait.
