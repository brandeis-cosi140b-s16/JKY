Yes, this is the same La Bamba Org.  that had a line out the door on State St. a decade ago from 8PM-4AM. Same food, Same cipes, and  thankfully the same Burrittos!!! La Bamba was forced out of State St. by rising rents due to that Pig, The Arts District. Unfortch La Bamba STILL hasn't caught on yet in Monona. If They were located in Yuppie Ville, They'd have Stellar reviews. The Food is affordable, fresh, and clean. Served to You by People that know what reall  Mexican Food is all about. I prefer a Large, Steak, No Beans, Extra Sour Cream. Frankly it's all I've ever ordered at all three La Bambas. Don't confuse this with Pedro's, it's not designed to be a Pedro's,, but if You're hungry in Monona, and time is   a factor, try La Bamba for great Mexican Food... ,.
