Love Love Love the new healthy menu! So much to choose from. I'm glad they are next door to my gym location.
The drive thru is hardly ever busy and the staff is always so nice and answers any questions you have about the new menu.
I ordered two shrimp tacos with avocado, two for 7$. So delicious and healthy with the wheat tortilla and cabbage. I was full after just eating one. And the shrimp are medium size(not bay shrimp!), and so flavorful.

Definitely give it a try if you don't have time to sit down for lunch and want a fresh healthy option.
