It was my first time here. I got the del rey torta and it was spectacular. My friend got a breakfast plate that looked as homemade as it could be. I would definitely go back to this place and try the other tortas and fresh drinks they offer. Never had a sandwich like this before, MUST TRY! friendly wait staff too
