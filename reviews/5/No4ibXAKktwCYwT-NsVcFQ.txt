My husband and I had not been to Los Sombreros since we first started dating and on a whim decided to revisit tonight.  After a horrible service experience revisiting Carlsbad Taverns earlier (*see review*), we were hopeful that our fond memories of Los Sombreros would hold true while visiting with our young son this evening.  From the moment we entered, we were immediately immersed in the warm and welcoming environment that we recalled: For lack of a better description it is relaxing yet vibrant all in the same and clientele are fed and treated like close friends and family. 

The staff is extremely personable and gives the feeling that they are genuinely happy to have your company.  Our waitress, Miriam provided outstanding service and was genuinely friendly towards the three of us as well as towards her other patrons.  The food was just as delicious if not better than we remembered.  The highlight was the chicken chili relleno...Yes, we scraped up every last drop of sauce from our plate:-)  

In spite of our adverse experience at Carlsbad Tavern earlier in the evening (*see review*) Miriam and the rest of the staff that assisted us helped to make for a night we will likely remember fondly for quite some time.  We will definitely be back to Los Sombreros very soon, and will make a point bring family and friends when they come to visit.  Thank you Miriam, chef and staff for a fabulous evening!

Sincerely,

Carolyn, Matt and Michael
