Amazing Food and Service

Blanco Tacos  + Tequila was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Blanco Tacos  is really trendy and cool. Blanco Taco is an open restaurant and can get loud at times however, I enjoy the energy inside the restaurant. 

Our server  suggested the short rib enchilada and short rib tacos.  Both entr√©e's were fantastic.  The enchiladas are served inside a hot pan with melt in your mouth short ribs.  The short rib tacos are served with black beans or charro beans, rice, which was served with white corn and are some of the best tacos I've ever had. If you make your way to Blanco Tacos  you have to sample the guacamole it is fresh and absolutely delicious.  

The house margarita's are good, esoecially the orange blood. Fresh food, great drinks, incredible outside seating area and very friendly wait staff make Blanco Taco + Tequila a great dining experience.
