I love this place. This place is a real hidden gem in Las Vegas, it's my go to spot for an authentic Mexican meal. The entire menu is outstanding and very affordable. The people are great, very comfortable, homely atmosphere, very welcoming. Soups, tacos, gorditas, huarache, tortas, flan....everything here is great. Highly recommended.

Everything that I've had here has been great but so far my favorite bites have been the enchiladas Pollo De Mole and consomme loco.

The enchiladas pack a punch of flavor with the mole and the consomme loco is just a great example of less is more.
