Talk about delishhhh!  
An awesome person (Martin) introduced me to this place. OMG their food is excellent. I tried the chicken, the beef, white rice, red rice, the salsas they are ALL on point. This is definitely my new favorite spot. I recommend that you try it. I loved it and I'm picky I'm sure you will love it too. I will definitely be a regular starting today
