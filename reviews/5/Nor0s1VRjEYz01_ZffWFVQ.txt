not only have i been going here since i was a wee one, so has mi mum. yes, the food is that good, consistently! when i lived in sf and came to visit this was my first stop in town...i missed it terribly. so i came back, for you popo's...well, not really. the things i love: cheese crisp, mexican pizza, the complete, chimichanga! also, for some reason the sarsaparilla just tastes better here. my 1 year old loves their salsa so much that she refuses to share, i kid you not. in fact she tried to drink it. like i said, it is that good here.
