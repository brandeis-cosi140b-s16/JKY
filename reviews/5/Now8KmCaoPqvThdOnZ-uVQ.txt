Absolutely in love with this place! 

What a great happy hour!  

I met a good friend there and we both had a spicy margarita...ok, we had more than one!  I had 3 tacos and cannot decide on my favorite...ok, the mole!  hahaha I'm really bad at making decisions! 

Considering celebrating my birthday here next month...that's how much I loved it!
