One word: Delicioso! 

You gotta try it! All the ingredients are fresh and everything is made to order. The restaurant has a cool modern look and very clean. The staff is always friendly and happy to make suggestions. They will even offer you a sample of their daily soups if you're interested (and trust me, you are). 

Be patient while they make your food. It doesn't take too long, but the chef it making it fresh for you right there chopping and grilling it up. It takes longer than similar restaurants, but trust me, it's well worth the extra few minutes (like maybe 3 extra, be patient).

Since you have 3 extra minutes to kill, check out their little garnish bar -- salsa, avocado sauce, radishes, carrots. Everything a traditional taco stand would have! Pick a few to try. 

The Paquime salad is gigantic. It's piled high in a nifty lookin' bowl. Beware, the dressing has a bit of a kick -- it's not so spicy you can't eat it, but the spice builds with each bite. But it is so tasty you probably won't be able to stop eating it anyway. 

The street tacos are simple perfection. I've personally had the ribeye and their are flavorful and juicy. Add a little salsa, their avocado sauce, or a squirt of lime. I'm drooling all over my keyboard...

And when you are done get dessert. No better way than to end the meal with some of their amazing traditional Mexican desserts. But don't take my word for it, once you see the cakes, pastries, and ice cream there is no way you can pass them up.
