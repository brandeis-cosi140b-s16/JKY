Great fast Mexican food! Really friendly and always large portions and good quality. We've tried the steak burrito, green chili chimi, taquitos and breakfast burrito and have loved them all...over the course of months and not all at once (or our tummies would have exploded). It's our go to place for fast, fresh mex. As a bonus, they are open 24 hours so great for late party nights!
