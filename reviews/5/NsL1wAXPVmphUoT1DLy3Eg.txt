Tediberto's rocks my word every time with spicy flavorful tacos and playful dishes that I just could not create at home on my own. Tedibertos is the type of restaurant that makes dinning out a treat and unique experience. 
The kale salad is my favorite but not available every night, which is really a good thing cause id never try new dishes if it were.  I love that the menu offers new dishes often and the specials on Taco Tuesdays has me coming back once a week.  Keep an eye out for posted specials on Facebook, and check this place out, at least once for the ambiance and unique Mexican inspired food.  I bet you will love it and want some more of it.
