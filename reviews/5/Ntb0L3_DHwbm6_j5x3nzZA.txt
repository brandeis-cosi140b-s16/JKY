Five stars no doubt about that!!!!! Tacos and burritos are amazing! The meat quality is the best...I had tacos de tripas and my fianc√© has a burrito de asada...the best in Vegas!!! Even the rice was good salsa was great free chips and salsa friendly and fast service...the closes to LA tacos in all of Vegas!!! Will come here over and over and over again!
