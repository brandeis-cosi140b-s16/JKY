I've been to this location several times! The food always hits the spot! I like that they got some REAL tacos in this shiznit! I ALWAYS order the tripe, beef brain & pork stomach. Food will never let you down. There were some drunken times where we drove 25 minutes to get there because we were craving their tacos!

Awesome drunken or sober food. Take your friends and family there but NOT a first date! Comprende?

Stay awesome my friends.
