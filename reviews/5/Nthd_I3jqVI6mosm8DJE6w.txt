First off, the people here were SO friendly. I thought it was really cool that they let us sample all of their meats before we chose. I got a taco salad with Barbacoa and it was great, slightly spicy but nothing insane. Tried the fish tacos, fabulous. Chicken Tinga, delish. Everything was great. I can't wait until they a bar and start serving booze, that will complete the whole experience.
