If you're itching for cheap, down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare, this is your stop!

Taco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s! I mean, who can resist those crunchy tacos? So delish. 

It is especially good after a wild night out. I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when you're intoxicated and you go to bed, you'll feel pretty damn good in the AM. It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy. Silly wabbit!
