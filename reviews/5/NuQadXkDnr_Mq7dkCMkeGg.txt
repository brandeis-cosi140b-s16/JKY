Randomly showed up during their trial tasting event and the food was complementary :) 

The service was perfect! The food on the other hand, needs a bit of work. Since it was only a test trial, I was asked to critique the food and service on their printed menu. 

Thank you to the owner who invited my friend and I in to partake in the event!
