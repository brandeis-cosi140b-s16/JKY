Great place with great food and spirits. Best Happy Hour in the valley 2-7pm everyday. I'm a huge fan of the chicken enchiladas with green sauce on top with rice and beans on the side. The Chicken quesadilla is very excellent as well and your able to spilt the meal among two ppl easily. The unlimited chips and salsa is a plus as well.
