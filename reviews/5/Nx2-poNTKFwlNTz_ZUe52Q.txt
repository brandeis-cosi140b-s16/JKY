The place is legit finally, coming from a guy that was raised in juarez/el paso. I've only tasted the barbacoa and colita de pavo and there both off the chain. Unfortunatley they only sell the barbacoa on fri, sat, sun. Most mexican spots that pro-claim they have barbacoa is only dried up brisket. This is beef cheek, which the flavor is the best compared to any other meat. Its  greasy, but what do u expect ur eating mexican food. Colita de pavo is a favorite back home and like i said its the only restraunt in vegas that has some. Roberto's is a disgrace to mexican food and doesnt even close to authentic. Its made for american people that dont know any better. I've waited for years and tried mostly every mexican restraunt in town to assimilate the authenticity from juarez/el paso. Its about time that's all I can say!!!
