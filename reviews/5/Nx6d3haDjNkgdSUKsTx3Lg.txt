Since people seem to be comparing Qdoba with Chipotle, I'll stick with the trend.  You wouldn't be too far off to say that they are essentially the same thing.  If you just want a standard issue burrito, you'll probably have a hard time distinguishing one from the other.  However, Qdoba has a bigger selection and has better seasoning/spices in my opinion. Three examples are the quesadillas, the fajita burrito, and the chicken nachos. 
The one and only time I tried to get quesadillas at Chipotle, they weren't even on the menu. So they slapped together something that was literally cheese and chicken, and charged me almost $6.  At Qdoba you get the whole nine yards for the same price. The fajita burrito seasoning is much better at Qdoba, and the chicken nachos (you can get steak, pork, etc. too) are hands down the best fast food nachos around.  They're about $6.  Oh, also Qdoba's taco salad is very good too.

The portions are pretty big too at Qdoba, which is nice for leftovers as long as you can stop yourself from over-eating, haha.

The other reviewers complaining must have had a randomly bad experience.  I frequent this Qdoba about once a month and have never been unhappy with food quality or service.  In my opinion I would always choose Qdoba over Chipotle or other similar restaurants.  Also, someone complained about a "3,000 calorie monstrosity of a burrito".  Well, if you actually look it up it's more like 1,000 - 1,200 calories for a standard burrito.  Still not exactly healthy.  But come on now, this is fast food after-all.
