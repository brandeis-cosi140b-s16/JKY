Just came back from El Patio. Our first visit based on Yelp comments. Very inexpensive Friday night out. By chance they had Friday night special, half price dinners. And if you are UNLV student $1.95 margaritas!!!

The fresh plate of chips and salsa was very good. Fresh chips and very good salsa. 

For appetizer, had melted cheese and chorizo appetizer...I could feel my arteries clogging as I ate the delicious dish with warm wheat tortillas. Washed it down with horchata. Soooo good.

Dinner for me was chicken enchiladas, half price. Very delicious. Dinner for my wife was the carnitas with verde sauce, half price. Her dish was good but a bit salty. She likes meat and I like chicken. She got one of my enchiladas because I was too full from the appetizer and she liked my enchiladas better than her dish. 

Very pleasant place. Live music next door was a bit too loud. The service was excellent. Very patient and very accommodating. 

Highly recommend the restaurant. Will definitely go there again.
