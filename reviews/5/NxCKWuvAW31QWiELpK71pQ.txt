American Mexican food.  Clearly not what they eat on the streets of Nogales or Mexico City, but satisfying all the same.

Catch the guy working the guacamole cart.  Best bang for the buck in town.  Can't even buy avocados in store for price.  It's a bit of kitsch, yet a nice touch.

Ask for the "picture menu," which is family, share style.  Again, good price point and somewhat more adventurous than the standard ground beef taco, beans and rice.

Dos Compadres enough for a smaller family.  Grilled need, chicken, green onion, etc.

Family operated.  Don't assume server is Mexican, as you have a better than even chance speaking with an Ecuadorian or someone from another Central American country.

Nice people.  Good food and cheap price.
