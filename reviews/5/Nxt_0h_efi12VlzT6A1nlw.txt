The value, the food, the Happy hour, the service, you can NOT beat it!!  They give you three sauces with your chips, a salsa, pico de gallo and some sort of guacamole  dip.  Trust me, it's ALL amazing!! No, this not a five star but if it's lower prices and yumminess you are after-Go Here!!!!!  Nothing like this compares to most places in Colorado, my husband grew up here a d was very impressed!  And if you enjoy the Alcoholic beverages please try the Widow of Oz drink, it's a twist of the Margie.  I thought it would be sweet and I
 can't handle sweet but I had two and now hubby is saying 'I am sweet'  lol
Enjoy!!!!!!!!
