Loved the one I had to drive 30 minutes to get to in WA, was thrilled to find them all over the LV Valley! I am so addicted to thier smoky queso, I could hurt myself eating this stuff. I use it as a treat to reward myself with for long days or finished projects. Today I tried the tortilla soup because I was feeling under the weather. Wow! It's cheesy and spicy and really yummy. Can't believe I've never tried it before!
