I enjoy going to this place. After being at the mall all day, of course you get hungry, so I went to this place and it was simply outstanding. 

I was seated right away and my waiter was very quickly to take our orders when we were ready. His name is Joe and I recommend having him as your waiter. If you have any questions, he was able to answer them and was able to give you details on a meal you had questions. Joe was fantastic, best waiter I have ever had. Not to mention, he was so helpful and very personal. He isn't all about himself and he interacts with you. Love this place!
