I'll have to strongly disagree with this Robert guy, the employees there have only ever been kind to my friends and I. We came as much as we could and were treated with hotdogs better than anywhere else I've been in the valley, with great prices and exceptional quality. 

These people show so much passion for their work, it's hard to believe anybody would speak poorly of them, and with so little actual information nonetheless.
