Was out with my boyfriend and he suggested Chicken and Waffles. I've never had it and Jorge's was right around the corner. My goddess, it was delicious! The waffle was crispy (this is the way a waffle should be), the chicken was tender, boneless and delicious. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Boyfriend got the dinner version of the chicken and waffle with added jalapeno coleslaw. Plus with $2 Flat Tire how can you pass it up?! We sat at the bar and we got chatting with the bartender. The place is amazing, the food is delicious, the workers are awesome. I highly recommend. I have been to places before where you have to clarify your waffle as crispy, or you have to try to get  one of the worker's attention. This was not the case. I will definitely go back.
