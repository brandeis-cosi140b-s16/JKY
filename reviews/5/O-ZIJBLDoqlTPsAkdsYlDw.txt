I am obsessed with this place! It's so cute, inside and out, big portions, and delicious food that sticks to being authentic!

I have gotten a sample platter to share with another and it was seriously so filling and yummy. I recommend it to try many options on their menu. And it's hard to fill me up as my appetite is ginormous lol. I also recommend the chicken enchiladas. Their mole sauce tastes pretty authentic and not generic or bad quality like most restaurants.

It is a bit pricey so it isn't your cheap Mexican eats. It's actually perfect for a nice occasion maybe like a date or taking friends or relatives from out of town...which is what I did. And my relatives loved it too!

The servers are also just amazing. So attentive and sweet. Please tip them well. 

They also have the cutest bar and fun, Latin music playing. It made us want to get up and dance, lol. The only thing is that the music is a BIT loud so if they turned it down a notch or two, it would be perfect. 

This is a great place for a nice, Mexican dinner. I highly recommend it!
