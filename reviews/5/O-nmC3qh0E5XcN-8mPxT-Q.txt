While it's owned by two celebrity chefs and is a gorgeous room inside a SoCal Hipster Hotel, we found Border Grill to be unpretentious with outstanding service on every visit. The margaritas are potent, and the food isn't heavy. While i was here entertaining clients, I'd come back here and spend my own money.
