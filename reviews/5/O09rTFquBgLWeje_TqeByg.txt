Awesome food - but I wouldn't expect anything less from the owner of Soho.  I had lunch here today, finally, after hearing this place was open.  Great concept and execution.  I had the Redondo with tuna, salmon, yellowtail.  The fish was fresh and tasted incredible.  The wasabi mayo is awesome. I also got the taro chips on the side which had a nice texture and good flavor.  Prices are very reasonable - around $12 for the entire lunch which, for good sushi, is more than fair.  I'll be back!
