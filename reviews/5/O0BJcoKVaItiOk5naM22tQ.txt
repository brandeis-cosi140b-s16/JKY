I love this place! They have the best chips & salsa before your meal, service was great, food was great. The best margaritas in town for sure! Last time I was there I had one of their Super Mex Chicken Burritos. SO good. I've actually only been to the Durango location a few times, but I used to go to the other one on Sunset in Green Valley all the time. I was thinking about trying their breakfast this week & decided to write a review on here. Can't wait to go back.
