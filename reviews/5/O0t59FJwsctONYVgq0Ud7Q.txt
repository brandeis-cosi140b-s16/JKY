Love love love this place. Same spot that Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, and same company. I was not the hugest fan of Reeba but was going to eat there for a change...and this was here instead. It was really nice, the food was excellent.The five stars I gave it  has nothing to do with service, which was great, or food, which was amazing, but I gave 5 starts for the awesome bottle of water they give you to share with the table and the awesome handblown loook of glasses that took everything inme not to steal it. The outdoor seating was very cute with a tree canopy with lights kinda romantic in a casual way, the sangria was waaay too good which also helps that romance, and the prices were reasonable for the service and awesomeness of the food. I mean, I wasn't paying anyway, but the very handsome man I was with didn't complain ha ha. As much as I normally hate the strip and avoid it for all reasons, I will side step my contempt for this place any day!!
