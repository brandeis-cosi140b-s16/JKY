Delicious food! I got the rib eye tacos and my Pop got a burrito. The tacos were prepared and seasoned perfectly. I would have liked the tacos more if there was more meat and less fat pieces but over all they were spot on for flavor. The addition of the Chile was enjoyable.
Pops burrito was enough for two people. We will be back and I'll try one of the Tortas. Its very small and busy with very little seating. So come early or go later in the day to sit comfortably. 
This is my new favorite place to go!
