We used this Rubio's location for a fundraiser we had this year for our school. FANTASTIC staff, friendly service, and the food is great. Very generous portions and fresh, hot and yummy. You will never eat at Taco Bell, Del Taco or any of the Filiberto's spin offs ever again. 

The restaurant is always clean and you can count on a good experience every time. :)
