La Condesa is amazing.  I'll keep this review short and sweet...

Short wait is well worth it. 
Horchata is amazing
The Mahi Mahi Burro might change your life... if i wasnt already in a relationship with the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus from Pita Jungle, i might actually try to make love with this burrito.  

Everything about this place is great.  Eat here... if you don't, you are probably crazy... maybe you are the dude at Circle K that is always talking to himself by the dumpster...  That dude creeps me out a little bit.    So, i guess the moral here is:  Eat at La Condessa, so you don't end up talking to a dumpster.  That is all.
