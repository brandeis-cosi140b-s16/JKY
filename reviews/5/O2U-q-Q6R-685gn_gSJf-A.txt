Loved the food. I had the food to go. Portion size were huge. This was my first time in this restaurant and I ordered 3 plates for 3 people. We couldn't finish ofcourse and 2 of us had our lunch done with the left over.
I have Indian taste buds and I dont like bland food. And I liked all the dishes very much.
The burritos were my favorite.
