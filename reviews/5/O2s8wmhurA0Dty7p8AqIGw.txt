The reason I give it five stars is the terrific customer service this place has.  I went there with an offer from groupon.  When I gave the waitress the groupon, she happily took it and didn't even groan (groupon customers know well to hide their groupon till the check comes),  I wish I wrote her name down, but regardless, she was fantastic.  My friend had the quesadilla and I had the tacos al pastor,... both were extremely filling, good, and were all we ate all day.  They weren't the BEST, but not bad.  Because we had great service, we give this 5 stars.
