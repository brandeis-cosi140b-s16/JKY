My wife and I have been coming to this location like 2-3 times a week for the past 2 years.  We LOVE it.  

What I love about Chipotle is the fact that the food is All natural, most of it is Organic, but its all 100% fresh.  I love the fact that the menu is so simple, why complicate things?  Mexican food is basically a taco made a hundred different ways anyway right?  

While you order, you tell them exactly what ingredients you want, how much, and best part is you witness it made!  

I am not sure if all managers do this, but THIS specific manager at this location loves to take care of her regulars.  Occasionally, she will just give you the orders for free and make your day!  I wish I could remember her name but I cant.  

OH!  Almost forgot, the Iced Tea here is brewed FRESH, and is awesome!  Combine the tea with the raw sugar packs they serve and its the perfect drink to compliment that burrito!
