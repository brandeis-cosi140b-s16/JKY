I read all the reviews on Yelp and planned to head over tonight. We certainly were not disappointed as everything we had was every bit as good or better than all the rave reviews. Lots of special touches and each item was delicious. We had the burger, pulled pork, and toasted cheese along with some sides.  The owner and employees were friendly and gave impeccable service.  I have definitely added this place to my list of "go to" restaurants. Yes it's in a strip mall and casual!  Perfect for lunch or dinner.
