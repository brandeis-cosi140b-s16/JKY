Had Cinco de Mayo dinner here. Quickly found a parking space. No host, just seat yourself. Served chips n Salsa within 30 seconds n quickly greated. Offered drinks. Loved the Modelo Michalada with spicy salt. Gr8 seafood options n other suggestions. I enjoyed the Mojara frita (deep fried fish). Also bought 5 bootleg DVD's n yes, they all work n have both English n Spanish language options. Had a nice Mariachi band playing. Basic ambience. Clean n very modern bathroom. Had a push button to flush. Never seen one before. 

I hate leftovers but I actually finished them the following morning. They also gave my daughter some funny occasion glasses n a lollipop. Gr8 family run restaurant.
