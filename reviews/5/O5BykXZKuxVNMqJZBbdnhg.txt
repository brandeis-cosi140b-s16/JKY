This place is a rare gem. My friend and I came up from Tucson for a fun weekend and this was a great brunch spot. I started with a nice pulpy mimosa, had the amazing carne adovada Benedict. She had the huevos rancheros. Both were delicious! The friendly patrons next to us ordered the rellenos and breakfast burrito. They looked fab. The atmosphere was quirky and dark. You'll have to really look for the place. There's no sign outside, but if you walk right next to Luci's you'll find it. It's worth searching for!
