My husband grew up in Chandler and has been telling me how good the food is here for 10yrs. We just moved back to Chandler from Mesa where you can't find a good Mexican food place to save your life! I was hesitant to try Espos because from the outside, it looks questionable. LOL. It's literally a hole in the wall type of place. But I am SOOOOO happy we tried it. The food is amazing!!! We love Mexican food and have struggled to find good, authentic, Mexican food places so I am over the moon about living close to Espos so I can get my Mexican food fix whenever I want! :)
