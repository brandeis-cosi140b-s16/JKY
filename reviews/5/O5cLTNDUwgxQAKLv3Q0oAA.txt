The rental car guy at the hotel I was staying at raved about this place (while establishing it was fairly casual, busy, and inexpensive). He was right on, and the food was INSANELY GOOD!

The tacos were supurb, the chips outstanding, the beans so creamy. Yum, yum and yum.

If I lived down there, I'd eat here once a week. And be fat :-)
