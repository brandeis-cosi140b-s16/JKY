Really dug this place.  So much we went twice in a 3 days.  First trip was lunch. Pineapple Pork and Chili Chicken were great tacos. Great service from a nice girl from Connecticut. She was clearly very new but that didn't stop her from giving us a great experience. Second trip was dinner. A leisurely 15 minute wait with beers at the bar was no big deal.  They sat us at an extra large table outside which made for easy sharing. Only complaint... no plantains.  Can't wait to come back soon when I am in AZ
