Came for business from DC and was looking for great Mexican food.  We were welcomed by the owner and his two sons. The place is unpretentious but those can be the hidden gems.  This sure was!!

Extremely friendly family and the food was made to order. Started with carne asada nachos and it was spectacular. Then ate chorizo con papas burrito and the chorizo was delicious!!  Not greasy and very tasty. 

Great food, nice owner. What else can you ask for.  Definitely recommend and I will come back next time I'm in Phoenix.
