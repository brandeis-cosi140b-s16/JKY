My husband and I go to DeLa Cruz for lunch and dinner..their menu has everything you would want for a good Mexican dining experience and  the food there is over the top..always fresh and delicious ... we absolutely love it.. In addition, the staff is super friendly.. and always remember us when we go in..

They also have a really nice dining patio with a beautiful water feature, and a good time bar.. perfect place for great food and great Margaritas...
