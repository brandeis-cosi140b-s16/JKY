Laredo's has been an old favorite for many years.  We've been countless times, and the service is always good, and food excellent.  The bottom line is that you can't beat the good food for the price.  Sure, you'll find better Mexican places in other parts of the country, but this quite possibly could be the best Mexican food in town.
