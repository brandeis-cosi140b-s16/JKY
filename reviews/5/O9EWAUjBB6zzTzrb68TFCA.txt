Michael Reyes is a class act.  He does things well, and his new Paz Cantina food truck is no exception.  He is introducing empanadas, and I can't wait to try them.  He had duck empanadas today, but I didn't learn that until I'd already stuffed my face with two delicious pork belly tacos!

Oh, and he has a new location that looks to be long-term, next to Modified.
