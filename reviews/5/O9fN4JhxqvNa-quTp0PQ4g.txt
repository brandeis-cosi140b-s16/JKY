Everyone who knows me knows how much I love tacos. I've had a lot of tacos in a lot of different places, and these were pretty top notch. So many different types of meat! And a cart full of fresh cilantro, Pico De Gallo, and tomatoes! I didn't know what half the sauces consisted of, but what I put on was delicious. The red sauce I haphazardly chose was the spiciest thing I've ever put in my mouth. I was dying. It was awesome. I can't wait to go back and get more.
