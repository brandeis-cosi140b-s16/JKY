Delicious, good fast food at a great value!
Fresh street tacos with a variety of meats (or potato), corn tortillas and DIY toppings bar with fresh salsas, guacamole, tomato, onions and cilantro all for one low price.
A generous portion of meat and toppings made me full from two tacos.
No seating is available but tacos can be put in a to go box and enjoyed in Schenley Plaza which is only an 8 minute walk away.
Lots of Mexican beverages are available in the grocery store that the taco stand belongs to.
