CHIPOTLE! Been here numerous times and I haven't had a bad experience yet. Every time I come here, I always get the burrito bowl cuz if you think about it, you actully get more food than if you ordered a burrito itself and its less messy cuz you are eating it with a fork! Dont get get me wrong, a burrito is still good but messy cuz the contents tend to spill out cuz of the enormous size factor. You cant go wrong with whatever type of meat you pick. I usually get the steak. Occasionally I would get the barbacoa or carnitas. Just recently they added brown rice to their simple menu. I love brown rice so that just gave me all the more reason to eat here! If I could I would eat here for everytime I see a subway! Not to bag on subway, but I dont think you can beat the real meat they use here and I love the sauteed veggies they have. They seem to cook it perfect every time! You know, its cooked to the point that its still crispy but soft enough to chew properly. The different kinds of salsa, sour cream, and guacomole are the icing on the cake!
