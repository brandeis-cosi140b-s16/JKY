Love this place, great decor, food - while not traditional Mexican, is very tasty and reasonably priced as are the drinks.  We stopped in the first time just for drinks and they kindly gave us chips and salsa and kept giving us more and the service was very attentive. Close to the light rail grid for easy transport. I feel like I am on vacation even though I live here so they have succeeded in my mind!
