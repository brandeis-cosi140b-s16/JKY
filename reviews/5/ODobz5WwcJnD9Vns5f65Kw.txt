oh my gawd, this place is amazeballs!!! Service is fantastic, food is phenomenal, great drink selections!!! Visited on a Friday night with a large party and we were well taken care of.  We mingled for a bit on the bar area before being seated where I had the fried shrimp app ans an overflowing shrimp taco with pasta salad.  I wish I had more room for everything else on the menu!  
The d√©cor was fun with sugar skull chicks, paintings, signs, wood floors, etc.  Music was  loud-ish but not so bar-like that you're going deaf yelling in someone's ears.  Plenty of bathrooms, although I was a bit thrown off looking for them as they're up against the wall in the bar area, but there's more at the back on the dining room as well.  There's also patio dining.
