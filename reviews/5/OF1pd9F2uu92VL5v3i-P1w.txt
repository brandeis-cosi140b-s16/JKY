Love this place... Never once have I been disappointed... And on Wednesday is dollar beers... Who can beat that!! Tortillas are fresh made, you have the option of chips with different dips or what I like to call hang over soup... Either choice is great!... I have gotten the tacos and it is authentic, but most times I get the carne asada plate and I love it... A lot of food for the price and I am always taken care of... Would recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food in the university area! It's a hole in the wall, which is how I like my Mexican restaurants... I hate chain restaurants... This is down home good food!
