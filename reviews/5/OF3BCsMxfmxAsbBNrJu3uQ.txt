Glad we tried this authentic Mexican restaurant for lunch. In the area for business and saw the ratings on Yelp so gave it a try. They offered us all the meats to try since we were 1st timers and it was all so good it was hard to decide. I got the 3 tacos with 3 different meats and was very happy. Will go again if I am ever in the area!
