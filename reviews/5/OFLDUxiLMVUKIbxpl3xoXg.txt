I have three words for you that will change your (food-loving) life... CARNE ASADA TACOS...wait I have a couple more words for you too.. CHORIZO TACOS. Not just any ol' carne asada or chorizo tacos but the ones at Lempira...and not at just any Lempira (and Ive eaten at all of them except the one at Steele Creek ..I think ) but the ones at the South Blvd location. A couple things you should know about me first. ONE : I am not one to order tacos when I go to a south of american food spot. I know, its the authentic thing to do, which is usually what I'm all about but something in me needs cheese when the option is there. Oh and a chimichanga..and TWO: I can be a bit lazy at times so I am all about convenience. Why on earth would I drive 20 minutes to a location on South Blvd when there are 2 Lempiras within a 10 minute radius of my house?! the answer is simple. THREE: friggin' crazy good food trumps everything. 
Im always so underwhelmed by tacos I've have at other comparable restaurants in town, and even when I've even had these exact "Lempira" tacos at the new Central Ave location (bleh) and at the Eastway location (runner up to South Blvd.) they aren't quite as good. Great homemade tortillas, meat is soooo tasty and top it off with a couple squeezes of lime that they provide you and the green salsa...yes. yes. yes. Just please don't go in there trying to get lettuce and cheese on your taco or complaining that the chorizo taco is greasy..its sausage fool, its supposed to be there and trust me its the best part. 
So if you are still confused about what to order...here it is: the 3 tacos (at least) which will set you back a mere $6, with at least one carne asada and one chorizo. I usually go 2 CA and one chorizo because the chorizo is really rich. Get them as they come and do make sure they bring you the green salsa that goes with it. You're welcome ;)
