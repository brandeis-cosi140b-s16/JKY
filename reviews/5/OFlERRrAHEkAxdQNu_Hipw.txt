Umm, I know this place has been closed for years, but they had some of the best food I've ever eaten.  If anyone knows a good substitute, please let me know!

Lol, gotta love how these other low reviews only complain about the service.  I'm sorry, I go out to eat to EAT, not to be waited on hand and foot.

That being said, I had no complaints on the service or the food.  Every time I went there, I was personally greeted by Chef Moises, who had a definite passion for his food. We were often given free samples of new dishes and salsas, and though short-lived as this place was, there always seemed to be something new on the menu.  Their salsas and sides were extremely unique, and every thing I tried was bursting with flavors I'd never experienced before or since.

I've been trying to find something similar to it, but keep coming up short.  As far as I'm concerned, this place is sorely missed.  If you know where I can find Puerco Pibil and Mole this good anywhere else, please share!!
