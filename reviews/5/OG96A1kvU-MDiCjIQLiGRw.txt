Tacos Atoyak's fish tacos are the best in Phoenix! I've been going here since they opened and I still have dreams about these fish tacos, tostadas, el pastor anything and their multiple styles of quesadillas.  The not-so-expensive area of town and not-so-expensive decor provide the customers with the benefit of very inexpensive yet extremely delicious food.  They could easily charge more for what you get!  Dan, aka Big Mike, you are doing things right, sir!
