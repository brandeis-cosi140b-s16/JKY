I'm obsessive when it comes to tacos, and i gotta say, I'm a HUGE fan of tacos el gordo. They are great, they have the authentic taste and feel of any great taqueria in Mexico. I particularly crave about tacos al pastor, and these are amazing, whether you order a plain pastor taco or you try the pastor "mulita" (which is a pastor taco in a flower tortilla with a bunch of melted cheese) these tacos are outstanding. Also try the campechana fries, an order of french fries topped with cheese, guacamole, sour cream and a bunch of asada and pastor meet, its heavenly. The place is very good but it sometimes gets very crowded, so chances are in a saturday night you might have trouble finding a table, but its definitely worth it. Also, on weekend nights, you might find a guy outside selling home made donuts, do yourself a favor and try them, they are very good.
