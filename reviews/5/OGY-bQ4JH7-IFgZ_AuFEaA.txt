I had such a memorable experience here ! The GM of this restaurant is lovely and it shows that she cares about her customers and her employees. 

House guacamole is amazing, some sort of creamed corned tamales still have my mouth watering, the steak nachos are something to write home about - even the chips in this dish are special. 

The appetizers alone were fantastic and of course the entrees left nothing to be desired. I got to try quite a few due to our large group.

Can't wait to come back for the Sunday tapa style brunch !!

I'm sure any Border Grill is great but this one at forum shoppes is EXCELLENT!!!
