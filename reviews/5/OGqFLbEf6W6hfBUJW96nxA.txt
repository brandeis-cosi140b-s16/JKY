If you're into Mexican munchies and their exotic styles of shaved ice, then you have to check this place out. They have the best mangoniadas in Phoenix. I drove half an hour to enjoy this tangy, spicy, sweet delicious icy dessert that garnished with fresh mangos and thin rolls of tamarind candy. It sure helps beat the heat!
