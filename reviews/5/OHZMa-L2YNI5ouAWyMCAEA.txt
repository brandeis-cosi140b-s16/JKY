What a gem!  Love having this restaurant in the neighborhood. Very authentic Mexican food, excellent service and very reasonable prices. My husband and I usually come for breakfast. Love the chorizo and egg platter and the menudo. My husband is Mexican and has high standards for his menudo. He loves it here. Don't wait to try this place. Extra bonus in supporting a local business.
