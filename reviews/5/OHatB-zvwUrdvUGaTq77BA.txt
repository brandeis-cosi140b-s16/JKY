Every time i come here for food,it is a great experiance!  Last night included.                I got a bowl and my date got the Burrito. It really was the biggest burrito we had ever seen. The food was fresh and really tasty.   No wait time at all,which was great since it was a Friday night after all.         The staff is very nice and the place was so clean!  We got it to go and the parking lot was full, but hey it's a busy place.
