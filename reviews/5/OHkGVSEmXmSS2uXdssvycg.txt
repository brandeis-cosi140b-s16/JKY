Hands down the best authentic tacos in Vegas. They have a variety of meats to choose from but make sure you know what you are ordering. Some include tripe (pork stomach), lingua (beef tongue), and sesos (beef brains). I tired the stomach and tongue and it was delicious but if you aren't as adventurous the spicy pork and steak are more mild. Very long line and crowded but well worth the wait!
