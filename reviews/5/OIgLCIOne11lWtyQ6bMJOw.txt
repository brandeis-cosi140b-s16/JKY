This is one of our FAVORITE places. We drive over 15 minutes, the food never dis-appoints.  We were in the habit of going a couple of times a week! 
We did however have a bad experience a few weeks back. We arrived 30 minutes prior to closing. Ordered and sat down to begin enjoying the yummy chips and salsa. Our food was delivered and a few minutes later they came out into the dining room with the mop bucket. I was completely disgusted as the smell of pine sol is not what I usually enjoy smelling while trying to enjoy my dinner. They also had the drink machine torn apart for cleaning so we were unable to refill our sodas. I understand that employees are anxious to end their shift and go home, but seriously? These things should not happen before the posted closing time. 
They even turned a few customers away saying they were closing. My understanding is that you take orders up until closing time in a restaurant. 
We weren't familiar with the people on staff that evening, but I know for certain that this would not have happened if Sherry had been working that evening, but with the new girl on shift we definitely did not feel welcome at all. 
With all this being said, our food was amazing as always just totally turned off by the poor lack of customer service that night.
