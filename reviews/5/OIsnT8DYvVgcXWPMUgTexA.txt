I lived in Champaign for about 8 years and just moved back to Chicago this summer.  I miss El Toro more than words can describe.  Outstanding and fast service, great prices, and delicious food.  My husband and I loved El Toro so much we had our rehearsal dinner there, and our priest mentioned El Toro in our wedding homily.  

I miss you Toro. :(
