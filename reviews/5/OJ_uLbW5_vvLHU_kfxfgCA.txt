I don't even live near this place. But every time I can I drive all the way over here because I really like the food. Its a small place, probably four or five tables, but they got something that just keeps me coming back. If you like mexican antojitos you definetly should try this place. My favorite are the rolled tacos. They kind of remind me of home made tacos back at mexico.
