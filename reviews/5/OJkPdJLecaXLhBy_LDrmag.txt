We returned here to celebrate my father in laws birthday. Service was great, we were there about 3 pm. Food was excellent. Carne Adovada was superb. Others had the Halibut and meatloaf and that was great also. We had a party of 8 and had a booth, room was adequate. Not a place for large parties unless you sit outside in the misters...
