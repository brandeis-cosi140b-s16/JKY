this is true Arizona old school Mexican food!!!! there is a reason this family has 10 plus restaurants across AZ and still in Business!!! the green chili is good and the cheese crisps are the best around!!!! the salsa is mild and has a great taste!!! the burros are made with another local tortilla company and delivered fresh daily!!!! I am there enough that I have seen the delivery truck on a daily basis and always stop at the other locations this family has in Globe, Safford, Miami and anywhere I have traveled.... highly recommended!!!!
