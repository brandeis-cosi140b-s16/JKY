I visit my fiance in Savoy, IL once a month and every time I am here we go to this place. I believe the staff is very friendly and the food is great. I like the Tacos de Carne Asada the most, and both my fiance and I love the green sauce (spicy) and the orchata water (rice water). Try to avoid flower tortillas, because if you are having those then maybe you should go to Chillis or On the Border. We both love this place and will miss it, but if we ever come back to Savoy, we are sure to come back to Mas Amigos.
