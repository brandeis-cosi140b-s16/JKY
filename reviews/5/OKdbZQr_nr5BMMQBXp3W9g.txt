This place is the best! I used to eat lunch at this location all the time because it was near work. Not only is the food fantastic but the service is too! The manager Jeremy is so friendly and helpful. I stop here whenever I can for a delicious and healthy bite to eat.

Favorites here are the Chicken Tortilla soup, the Salsa Verde Shrimp tacos and the Grilled Gourmet Chicken tacos.
