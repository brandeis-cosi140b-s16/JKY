Delicious authentic Mexican (NOT TEX-MEX) food!  I may be biased as I grew up in Southern AZ and have been living in the mid-west for the past couple of years where it's really hard to find good sonoran style Mexican food.  But this place was delicious!  And you knew just walking in, that later that night the place was turning into a discotec!  I had the Chile Relleno plate which was perfect!  I loved that the beans came in a fried tortilla bowl.  Margaritas were large and refreshing!  Loved the entire experience!  It helps if you know a little spanish when you go there as well!  Our hostess didn't seem to know English, but our waitress did.  Can't wait to go again! (When you are ready to leave, you pay at the register by the door.  You will wait all night for someone to come take your card for you haha).
