My first experience was awesome. My father  works nearby and always raves about the salmon they have. Unfortunately, tonight they were out of salmon but my vegetable quesadilla was perfect! Not to cheesy or oily plus I got corn on the Cobb as a side which was also great. The food was prepared fresh and I can't wait to go back again!
