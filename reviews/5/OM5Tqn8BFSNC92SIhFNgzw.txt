Okay, you might be asking yourself "who reviews a Taco Bell? or even looks up reviews for Taco Bell?" Well, I would ask myself that if I were you, but here we are.

This Taco Bell is awesome. They have really nice and friendly people working for them, and my husband and I would eat inside because we liked the service. We lived a block away, and came every so often over 3.5 years and it was always the same. We appreciate that kind of good service, and it's not one you would expect to get from a fast-food chain.
