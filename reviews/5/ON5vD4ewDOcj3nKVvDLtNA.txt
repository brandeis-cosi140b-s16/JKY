The most authentic place for that South West Mex flavor in AZ that I've had by far ! You can def distinguish the flavors ! Food melts in your mouth , Spicy I might add but good ... Some dishes even come with the sopapillas for desert .. If you can find a plate that comes with them , I highly recommend getting it .. So good ! Cozy little restaurant with that old school authentic feel .
