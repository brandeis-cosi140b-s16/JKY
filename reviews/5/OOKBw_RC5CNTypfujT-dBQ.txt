I've never had a bad experience there. I love the Mexico City burrito -- their chorizo is fantastic. The service has been a bit slow at times when they are very busy, but even in those situations, the food comes out pretty quickly. The fresh guacamole is also FANTASTIC and made right at your table. Highly recommended.
