This restaurant is amazing! I've never had tacos wrapped in lettuce and let me tell you it was the best I ever had. This was such a refreshing dish lite and absolutely delicious! The service was awesome I can tell the owner and his wife really care. I would definitely come back here whenever I come to Vegas.
