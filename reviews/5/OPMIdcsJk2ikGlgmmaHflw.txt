I don't know if there is a real Paco out there , but I want to kiss him. Hard!
This is by far the best Mexican/Texmex I've  tasted thus side of the country. 
Yeea-haw, Se√±or Paco. Ride on!
Ps: fajitas are pricey but come with a whole second plate of fixins, and for my tacos, I mixed and matched and the brisket in tacos was Di-Vine! I'm really happy now...purr-purr
