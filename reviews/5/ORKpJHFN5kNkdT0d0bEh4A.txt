Went there yesterday (Saturday) to celebrate two bdays! We had 17 in our party and had called ahead of time to find out about reservations. Although they did not take any the hostess gave me pointers..get there before the evening crowd, have at least 1/2 the party present and be patient. 40 min later we had our table (happy dance) ...we passed the time at the bar and found the bartenders busy but friendly and attentive. They sat us in the patio like we hoped for and realy enjoyed the nachos and papas appetizers before dinner. And had no complaints about the food... from the bacon wrapped hot dog, tacos,burritos, torts and enchiladas. ..everything was good! Thank you for making our night awesome! Will definitely be back.
