I walked in and, after hearing the list of ingredients in the veggie burrito, asked them to make me a vegan rice, bean, veggie, and guacamole burrito.  The cashier named "Nash" made sure I got the correct rice, so it was vegan and repeated my order just to make sure it was right  When my burrito arrived, it was pretty low on rice, so the employee who delivered it, "B.J.", quickly got me a free side of rice to correct the problem.

The burrito tasted great, and I love the free salsa bar.  Both Nash and B.J. were friendly and happy to help me, and I'll be going back the next time I'm craving rice and beans.  Thank you!
