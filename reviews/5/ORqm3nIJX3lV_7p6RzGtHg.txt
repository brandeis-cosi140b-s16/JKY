Recently opened Lenero's Mexican Grill and Cantina was a hit for us the food was delicious, all the meats are smoked over Applewood and the portions were huge.. We had the Smoked Ribs (1/2 slab filled a whole plate) and Fajitas and both were Amazing, the Margarita's are fresh squeezed and very tasty as well. DÃ©cor was very nice and they're building an outside patio for live music, can't wait!!!
