Love Jalepeno Bucks!! Their food is excellent. Pulled pork, salsa, chips, burritos,and sandwiches. My family loves the sweet green salsa and the smoked pork. Anytime we are having Mexican at home we crave Jalepeno Buck salsa. The service is great too. Family owned, fun casual atmosphere. I recommend it for sure!
