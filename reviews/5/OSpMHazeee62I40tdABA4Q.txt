Holy moly guacamole! Tonya P. & Nicole W. introduced Dion L. & I to the deliciousness that is Three Amigos today. How I haven't been here before is beyond me, but wow, I'll become a regular now.

First off the chips: Seasoned & crunchy! There's nothing worse than soggy, soft chips...no fear here!  And smart Tonya got us an order of guacamole - FRESH guacamole. Nice sized tomatoes & cilantro & good consistency/texture of the avacodo.

$5.00 margaritas on Friday? Why not!? They're huge & so refreshing, but had just enough tequila that I was one & done.  Poor Dion was headed into her big girl job, so she couldn't enjoy any. :(

I went with the four steak tacos off the lunch menu...but you can order them with chicken, too. And of course, I got the cilantro & onion, which was heavily piled on. I'm cool with that!  Both were fresh, the onions a little too fresh; even after partaking some yelp mints, I'm still tasting onion. :D The steak, was in small tiny pieces & tasted SOOOO good! Wow, I was so impressed.  Normally I'm used to the steak in tacos being the skinny strips of steak, so Three Amigos way is much better.  It was seasoned nicely, too.

Other notes: Prices are very reasonable, place is clean, & service was exceptional.  

Cons: It's pretty small & parking is extremely limited.
