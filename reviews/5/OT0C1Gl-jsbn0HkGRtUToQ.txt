I'm pretty sure this place has a different name, but I'll post here and try to search the real name later.  

This is primarily a panaderia-Bakery.  So they have the typical Mexican breads and fresh corn tortillas.  

Then, they have the grill, which serves all sorts of Mexican foods including our favorites: Pozole (red/white), tamales (red/green/sweet corn), tostadas, taquitos, tacos, burritos.

They also have the freshMexican drinks and additional desserts and Mexican candies.  Plus, a little side cooler with regular american drinks and some basic Mexican necessities like avocados, cilantro, onions and Mexican canned food.

Recently, probably in the last year, they've added a carniceria-meat counter.  Where they also have included cheese.  Decent prices.

Most of the workers are Spanish speaking, so yes, non-Spanish speakers may have problems ordering "special items" like with our without this or that type of foods...But if you just order what's on the menu, or put your grocery items or baked items in your little carrier and check out, all will be fine.

There's a lot of in and out traffic, but they have a few chairs/tables for some in-dining.  They're right on the corner of the little shopping center that they're in on the SouthEast of Thomas and 32nd Street.
