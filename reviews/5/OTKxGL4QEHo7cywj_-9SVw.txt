Absolutely incredible food!  The Green Chile is homemade and the reason I drove 6 miles.  Breakfast is also stupendous.  The prices are so cheap I typically tip 50% because they deserve it.  Literally hands down best mexican food I have had in Arizona. Dont judge a book by its cover.  The outside is no ritz but the ritz could learn a thing or two from the chef.
