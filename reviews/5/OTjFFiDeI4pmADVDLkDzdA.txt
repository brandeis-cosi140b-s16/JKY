I ate here yesterday before leaving Vegas. It's a really big restaurant outside of the crazy area of Las Vegas. The service was pretty on point when I was there. The owner made sure the items came out right. She saw a server bring out the beans and cheese not cooked well and she made him turn around and fix it. Glad to see that. It began getting busy here. I had the chips salsa and queso dip.

The queso dip is to die for! Addicting ooey gooey cheese with chunks of chicken in it. The salsa here was extra good as well. I had to keep getting more and more chips. It's not authentic street Mexican food but it's great for what it is.
