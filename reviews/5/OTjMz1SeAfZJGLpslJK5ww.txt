What a place. Fun, a nice scenic drive, a live band, a great ice cream parlor. A fantastic hot chili that we gobbled up. A fantastic burger. One half pound of juicy great arizona beef. Good fries. You people, this is a chili and burger place and you order fish in the middle of nowhere and expect goumet. Thet are known for their great burgers and chili, not there chicken, turkey and fish. They also make some great Mexican food and taco salads.
