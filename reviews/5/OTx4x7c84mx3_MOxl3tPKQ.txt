Went there last Sunday at noon and stayed until 7. This is like one of those Vegas pool parties, but slightly tamer and you don't get near strip-searched before going in. 

There were about 20% N Scottsdale folk and the rest were younger, but it was all cool. First come first serve on the lounges and you pay for a cabana. 

If you need some incentive to keep that diet going, just go here. If you are in awesome shape and have a significant other who's 'letting themselves go', just go here.

If you are overweight and want to hang out near the pool , you will certainly be shamed into keeping that shirt on until you get yo' food/exercise act together!

(some people may be offended by the above, but it is what it is!)

It looks like the same people who one would see at Mint frequent this place, but everyone was nice and we had some good times, even though we're a little older than the 20-somethings.

There's an inside/outside area of the bar that is open, i.e. no doors, it's just an overhang. There's 1 pool table in the bar area.

Bartenders were great (thanks Brewer!), and when he was busy the other gals really stepped in (thanks Patty!). 

Later in the afternoon the DJ played, who was awesome, and the music was moderately loud, but not obnoxiously so loud you couldn't ever hear yourself think (like they do at Dirty Dogg)

The bouncers were very nice, and even chatted with us as we were walking in, which was refreshing. Sure they checked our licenses by scanning them , but whatever, they've been doing that in Seattle for quite a few years now.

I had a quesadilla which was awesome, (no I didn't go home and weigh the thing), and all drinks were great. Expect only Mexican and American beer here but what did you expect? 

We didn't go during happy hour, which is 1/2 off drinks, so it was just as pricy as other places, but for some reason I didn't seem to mind that here !

Bottom line, it's a great place and the staff were excellent!
