This was my family's third visit to Azteca, and my fourth with my honey. It was his birthday, which I quietly mentioned to our server. Although, it was a Monday (June 1, specifically), the dining rooms and even the bar was crowded. That being said the service was prompt & pleasant. Having 3 hungry young men at the table kept the chips & salsa person busy. I knew better than to partake, because the entr√©es are huge. I did have a very large Margarita, and my honey and eldest son had 2 of the largest Does Equis that I've ever seen. Each time I visit I try to order something different, rather than my fave from my first Mexican restaurant in Charlotte when I arrived some 30 years ago-El Cancun. They too had an amazing air of authenticity & super food. My honey had a dish with the mole sauce (which is a delightful mix of dark chocolate & spices, my eldest ordered the Steak Azteca- a nice piece of meat with rice & refried beans. He said the steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare. The younger boys ordered the super nacho plate. I fell back on my old El Cancun fave- the large chicken burrito. I was not disappointed. It was filled with good quality chicken breast & all was seasoned to perfection. Portions were so large we all brought food home. Finally, my honey was amused to have the sombrero put on his head and have his birthday celebration. More to go boxes needed, as the boys brought home their dessert. I wasn't left out, as even though, I didn't order dessert, they brought over a couple of Cinnamon chips topped with whipped cream and a cherry! We will continue to go to Azteca, especially as summer comes, just to drink margaritas on the patio. Well done Azteca!!
