Great atmosphere, inside an old church. Offers indoors and outdoor seating. Full bar with local beers. Free chips and fresh option of salsas. When it comes to ordering tacos, there isn't a bad option. So many unique options and flavors. Highly recommend the Coffee Bean Beef, yes I said coffee bean beef. 

Great for family and kids too. High chairs and kid options. 

Friendly staff.
