We have eaten here once, and the experience was great. This definitely is a hidden gem in El Mirage. We just moved to the area recently, so we will be going back to this restaurant soon. Hopefully our next trip is just as nice.

It is a bit noisy but nothing that bothers me. I have 2 kids so I prefer the noise. If you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner then this probably wouldn't be the place.

The service was a teeny bit slow but it was packed, so that's understandable. The food was worth it. I got the tacos Mexicanos and it was delicious. The tortillas are excellent, I could eat them plain! So yummy. The food is a bit greasy but I've never gone to this style of mexican restaurant without having greasy food. It kind of comes with the territory.

We will be coming back for happy hour soon. I'm so glad we found this place! I recommend that you at least try it out, as there's not much else to choose from if you live in El Mirage.
