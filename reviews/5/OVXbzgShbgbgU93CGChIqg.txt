Wadaa is the real deal! I'm a bit of a taco snob, having enjoyed street tacos in San Luis, Mexicali, and Tijuana for decades. I've rarely, and I mean *very* rarely, ever encountered tacos that approximate what you can get from a simple street vendor in Baja. The most important thing is grilling over mesquite hardwood, followed by grilling home style corn tortillas, and of course providing the right toppings: Pico de gallo, cabbage, that deep red super spicy salsa, and a nice thin aguacate salsa. Mmmmm...delish! Both the carne Asada and chicken were outstanding. At $3/taco a bit on the pricey side for a roadside stand, but worth every penny!!!
