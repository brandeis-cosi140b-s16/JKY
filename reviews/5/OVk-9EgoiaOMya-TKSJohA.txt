I'm moving out of North Phoenix, and the worst part about it is that I'm moving away from PVBC.

Great burger, salty fries, and mounds of creativity. Just walk in and order the special. Doesn't matter what's in it; just get it. It's good, even when you don't think it will be (e.g., a burger coated in ground up lucky charms!? Oh yes. Weird but so good.).

I'll be back. Definitely.
