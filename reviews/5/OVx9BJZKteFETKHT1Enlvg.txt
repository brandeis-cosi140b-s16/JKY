Another outstanding establishment that doesn't receive nearly enough attention.  I went to college just outside Philly - so I know what I'm talking about.  Their Cheesesteaks aren't identical, but they're the best substitutes I've found on this side of the country.  Everything is fresh, and everything is outstanding.

Their Mexican food is nothing short of incredible.  And for a small amount, you can eat like a king.  They're happy to make your food to order as (again) everything's done fresh.

Friendly owners, but there's been a lot of confusion lately as management has changed and the previous owners didn't bother doing the right thing and shutting down some of the deals they had put up prior to leaving the establishment.  Don't let the reviews about that reflect poorly on these guys - they bust their butts and it shows in the food.  Give them time to fix the old manager's mistakes with the online ordering/coupons - or just stop in and order at the counter.  You won't be waiting long, and even if you were, it'd be worth it.
