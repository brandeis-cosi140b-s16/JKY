I went to Adobo Dragon the first time and loved it.  I have since brought friends and family members and they cannot wait to come back to Phoenix and return there. The food is great. I have tasted all the menu options and love it. The fresh salad, crisp and light; the mushroom vegan bao is super and tasty.  The chef explained the options and was very informative.  The cerviche was excellent.  It has become my favorite place to go.  Highly recommended.
