This is a wonderful little family owned business! Their food is fantastic and the folks who run it are so nice. I Am fortunate to work in the same plaza as them so I  get to enjoy their food all the time. They recently catered lunch for our office, and did a great job. This place is the best and all of our employees eat here constantly.
