Redemption for Sandbar Chandler.

After a less than pleasant experience our first time at Sandbar, GM Bill Hovey and staff truly put the customer first.

Bill saw my complaint and immediately left two voicemails, an emall and eventually invited me and my wife for lunch today via facebook.

We were greeted by the very pleasant Jen as we walked in. Our waiter was very pleasant and funny without being too over the top.

We started off with chips and a great trio of salsa and cheese dip. My wife had a very tasty burrito and my ahi and shrimp tacos had a great combo of spicy and sweet. (FYI Tuesday is $2 tacos).

We finished off with fried ice cream with fresh pineapples. A tasty end to the meal and the beginning of my food coma.

In a time when you hear more excuses than accountability, Sandbar Chandler was a refreshing change.

They are back on my radar. Thanks Bill.
