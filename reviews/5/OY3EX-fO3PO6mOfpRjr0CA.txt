Brilliant timing on a Pink Taco visit at The Hard Rock Hotel in Vegas! Carlos the waiter and a bunch of girls serving things from the new menu. Great happy hour specials, great DJ, great food and the margaritas are always good as well. I've been to three of these locations (two in LA) and love them all!!!
