My wife and I had breakfast here for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. Our burritos were very good (really liked that the veggies were crisp-tender and not just mush), the service was attentive and friendly, and the restaurant was quite clean.   I've always liked their salsa bar and it was kept well-stocked. We'll be back!
