I absolutely love Zaba's. My favorite thing here is the Zaba Bowl! Its filled with your choice of meat, rice, cabbage, sour cream, and hot sauce! BEST damn thing I've eaten in awhile! Their quesadillas are also good! I usually get the steak quesadilla when I order one. The staff is very friendly, most speak Spanish so there is sometimes a barrier and they do make some mistakes with your order sometimes, but that's OK, they're always happy to fix it.
