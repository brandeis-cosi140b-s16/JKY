Just when I gave up hope for any good Mexican food or tacos in vegas, Taco y Taco saved my day. Or possibly, my life. 

Since Tacos el Gordo (one of the most popular) was a disappointment for me, I had given up half a year ago. IT's been a while, yeah. 

I think this place has hands down the BEST Al Pastor Tacos. OH MY GOSH. I don't even really like Al pastor tacos, and prefer carne asada, but it was a smashing hit for me here, surpassing the other tacos available. 

Al pastor tacos- 7/5 stars. 
Carne asada tacos- 4/5 stars. 
Shrimp tacos- 5/5 stars. 
Mexican hot cocoa- 2/5 stars. It was chunky, had strange bits in it, and it tasted almost like they used lard or a different type of fat instead of milk.

This place will be my go-to tacos spot in vegas until I find something better.
