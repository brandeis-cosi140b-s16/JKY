Another little gem quietly tuck away from the far reaches of stereotypical Vegas Hotel and Casinos.

Everyone else's review has been spot on despite the occasional bad review here and there. 

The establishment is VERY clean and the decor tries very hard in attempting to take you away to a far away beach where everything is chill and the food is very down to earth. You know what? They succeed. 

The mural on the right wall is just absolutely gorgeous and reminded me of Nha Trang Vietnam during sunset.

Food is amazing. Has a home cooked taste to it. Beef chunks could be a little bigger and meatier but was very flavorful with occasional bits of fat here and there.

Sauces arent all that spicy but have a very rich taste.

Some of the best Horchita i've ever had, owner confessed it's actually distributed by Pepsi because the real stuff isnt shelf life stable for too long and is grainy in texture.

Good eats. Will return here if i find myself in the area
