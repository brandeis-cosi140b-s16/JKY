This is the most amazing little hole in the wall restaurant! We always phone it in to bring home, since air conditioning was invented. Their shredded beef, used in any of their dishes, is fantastic. I've tried to duplicate it, but unsuccessfully. Since I moved about 200 miles away, I have driven back twice for the express purpose of eating here. It's the real deal and my family loves it.
