Was definitely impressed by this place the other night.  I liked the atmosphere and most importantly the burrito and beer I consumed.  

I've been meaning to try this place for the longest time, but every time I've ventured out - they were either closed or some extemporaneous circumstance kept me from trying the place.

Walking in, my first impression was "this is going to be unique" since the place was empty and the chalkboard menu had a lot to choose from.  They also have a salsa bar with varying levels of heat to enjoy with whatever you order.  I kept it simple and went with a chicken burrito with guacamole and sour cream.  The burrito came out really fast and the first thing I noticed was the cream flavor... I guess all the other chain burrito stores use the same generic sour cream, but maybe Phat Burrito makes their own or has a different source.  The burrito was great!  

I think looks can be deceiving since there are bars on the windows and doors, so it does look like a "rough" place, but the food is the star here.  I've been to many "pretty" looking restaurants and their food is less than worthy of the decor in the restaurant.  I think we beat the dinner crowd since the place starting filling up when it was time for us to go.
