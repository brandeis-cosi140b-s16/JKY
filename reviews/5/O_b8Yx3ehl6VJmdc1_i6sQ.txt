5 stars for this old favorite.. 
This place is one of the few places that will serve me menudo the way I like it and on a MONDAY! 
I love menudo but just the corn so I ask for just corn. Most places just serve me whatever they serve which I hate. BUT this place did actually try to remove all of the meat from my bowl! I was extremely happy! 

They serve homemade tortillas just like my aunt makes which I love! 
The waitress was very attentive and the food good. I will be coming back for more!
