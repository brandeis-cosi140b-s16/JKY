Best "personal" burrito in town!  I ALWAYS get the chicken burrito with medium salsa and cheese.  The great thing the burrito tastes the same today as it did the first time I went in over 6 years ago.  And...the same cool guy is making my burrito over all these years.  It is always so nice to go in and see his smile!

The meat is flavored and cooked well, the salsa incredibly fresh, and you can't beat the cheese.  This place tops any other "build-a-burrito" joint you have ever been to.

Tons of burrito choices (regular or whole wheat tortillas), tacos, quesadillas, taco salads or "burritos in the biff" which is a burrito but in a baked tortilla shell.

PS.  You can pick up a beer or margarita here too :)
