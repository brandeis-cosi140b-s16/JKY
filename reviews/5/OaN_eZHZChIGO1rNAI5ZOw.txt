Healthy Fast Food- the best tortilla soup ever- just be careful because it's piping hot. The marinated chicken is seasoned perfectly, tender and not dry. The chicken burrito is really good, too. But my favorite besides the tortilla soup, is the bowl- I like the basic one because the deluxe one is too much. Also worth mentioning is the avocado sauce. Free drink refills. Bathrooms, but sometimes some people (not patrons) use the facilities, so I'd be careful or bring some clorox wipes. Drive-thru window if you prefer to avoid the super busy lobby. 
 
Good Prices. Great food- never had a bad meal here. Busy location, especially around lunch time.
