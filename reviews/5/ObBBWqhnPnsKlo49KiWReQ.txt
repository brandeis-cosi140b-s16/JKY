Found this place in Best of Phoenix list in the New Times. BEST OF is right on! We got there at about 11:30 on a Saturday and there was a 30 minute wait which was no big deal. Our server was very kind and cheerful, and the food was AMAZING. My husband loved the chips and salsa - definitely spicy which is great. He had a combo of an enchilada and a red chile beef burrito. The big chunks of beef inside were so tender and flavorful!  I had a combo with a cheese enchilada, bean tostada and beef taco. The sauce on the enchilada was fantastic as was the rest of the meal. The rice is super flavorful and the beans are delicious as well. I loved everything about this place for sure. Highly recommend and I will be back over and over.
