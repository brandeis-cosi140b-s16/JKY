It's a few short nervous blocks from the freeway.  Inside, it is a world of color, a world, of textures, a world of flavor (this is a pretty, pretty, vibrant interior - -  a complete world of fun if you weren't into the serious business of eating lunch).

I completely simpled out  when ordering and simply got the Mar Y Tierra  (surf & turf - - a stir-fry-up of strip steak and gobsmackingly richly embroidered shrimp).   The little tortilla that came as an appertizer-thingy with the meal was like tiny cubes of chunk tuna in a vinegar-like sauce.   The big plate with fine beans,  some salad accents,  and the incendiary steak&mind-blowing shrimp was super delicious.   A twenty covered it including tip.  Anytime, anywhere, take me back and please let me try some more menu items.
