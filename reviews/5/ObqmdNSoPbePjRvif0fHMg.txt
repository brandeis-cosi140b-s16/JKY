My heart sank the moment I realized that my wallet was still at home on the counter right next to the garage door. 

I met a colleague for lunch. It was great food, great service and a comfortable environment. The check came and everything was going great until I reached for my wallet. I didnt have it. I thanked my colleague for his company and sent him on his way noting that I wanted to hang out a little longer. 

I informed the host at the front door that a manager was needed because I had forgotten my wallet and then I called my wife to get my AMEX number. 

To my surprise, the manager walked over and thanked me for my patronage. Encouraged me to come back and then kindly offered to cover the bill on my behalf. 

That kind of service deserves 10 stars but because I can only give 5 they get that for sure. This place is simply awesome and this is an experience I will continue to tell people for years to come. 

I was already a fan of Z Tejas but now I'm a raving fan!
