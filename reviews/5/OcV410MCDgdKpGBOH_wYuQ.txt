This has become a staple for lunch.  We go  about three to six times a month. 

They have a few tasty lunch specials for great prices (try the sweet pork enchilada). The flying saucer--basically a sort of salad with tasty chicken or beef--is one of my favorites.  

Give it a try.  Good food fair price!
