Food is excellent, service is excellent, the restaurant is clean and the price is right!

I had purchased a discount coupon for this restaurant back in April, but it is about 6 miles from home and not in an area that I frequent regularly.  Thank goodness the coupon had no expiration date as this restaurant was a pleasant surprise.  

Myself and two girl friends stopped at Casa Layla for lunch. We all shared the large pork nacho appetizer and I had the pulled pork tacos. All our food was fresh and very good.  The waitress was friendly and accommodating.  Food came out quickly and inviting.  

Without a doubt I will plan to return.  This is a hidden gem on Thunderbird Rd, not far from the indoor swap meet.  So if you plan to visit the indoor swap meet on a week-end, include lunch at Casa Layla on your agenda.  You'll be glad you did.
