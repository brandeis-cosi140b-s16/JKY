Wow, what a find! If you're a foodie and you love Mexican food then you have to visit Imperial Tacos and Beer! My wife and I tried several different selections and found all of them to have a very vibrant and colorful taste! Plus the lime rice has to be one of the best I've ever had. Also they serve their tacos in a soft corn tortilla that they make fresh as soon as you place your order! The staff was very friendly and attentive and the price was definitely right! We will be back before we leave town!
