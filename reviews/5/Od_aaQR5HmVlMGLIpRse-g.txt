My husband and I love this restaurant. We go here once a week. We are originally from Southern Colorado and there is a restaurant in our home town called 3 Margaritas---turns out--- same family as Plaza Bonita! We love the Burrito Colorado, the Carnitas, really everything. It's consistently good and fast.
