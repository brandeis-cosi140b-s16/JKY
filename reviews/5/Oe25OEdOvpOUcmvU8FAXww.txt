Having lived in the area for quite some time, I frequented Agave a few times and was never really impressed. Food was bland and service was very lack luster, which is why I have been hesitant to give Dos Caminos a try. I was shopping in the same plaza and decided to give them a shot. I had an amazing experience. The decor was way better than that pepto bismol pink that was agave before. My servers name was Will and he was a pro. I had the brisket enchilada and was not what I expected... it was better. I really liked spicy smokiness. Will suggested a prickly pear margarita to wash it all down. Also delicious. I enjoyed the fact that they are not your typical slop and serve mexican joint. I will absolutely be back with friends.
