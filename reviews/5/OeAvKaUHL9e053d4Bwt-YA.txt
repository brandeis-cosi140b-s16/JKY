Well I ordered chicken enchiladas to go xtra xtra hot. What I got was chicken tamales and the green chili was mild. It was good but disappointing at the same time. 

I just love this place. The owners really know how to treat their customers. They made me chicken enchiladas that are to die for (I'm eating them for breakfast)!!  Thanks for taking care of me.
