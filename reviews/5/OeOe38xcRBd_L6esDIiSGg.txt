I ordered sopapillas and asked for honey instead of the strawberry sauce. The waitress (who was awesome) said she will check if they have honey. She came back and said they did - but when it came out they were plain. She came back and apologized that there was a misunderstanding. 
The owner walked through the door a couple minutes later with honey...he went out and bought honey just to complete my order. 
If that isn't amazing service then I don't know what is.  We will be back!
