i drive through Gila Bend when i go back and forth between San Diego and Phoenix, usually about every month.  ALWAYS stop at Sophie's.  She's a hard working lady, always there and puts out awesome food for a very good price.

Noticed last time that there are now 3 mexican places in gila bend  Used to only be Sophie's.  Was concerned.
On Sunday, when i stopped there, couldn't help but notice the other two had zero cars and Sophie didn' have an open table.

........guess that says it all.
