Padres is by far the best place for margaritas, guacamole and atmosphere. I haven't tried anything on the menu I don't like. The staff here is amazing as well. They are so friendly and helpful. They remember what I like to eat/drink but always recommend other great options. If you don't already try this place once your crazy!
