Best Chipotle I've ever been to! The crew members are always friendly and smiling and the food is simply amazing! I got a chicken and barbacoa bowl (gotta love extra meat) with brown rice and pinto beans, then added some corn salsa, sour cream, and guac. It was enough food to last me two meals! Love this place and will definitely return everyday!
