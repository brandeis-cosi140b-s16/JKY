There are lots of restaurants to choose from in this vicinity, and I wanted to go out on a limb and try a totally new eatery.  My husband, though, preferred to walk across the parking lot from the hotel (after he swore that I could choose--but I digress).  Well, after a sangria and Pork Carnitas, I am so glad we went to Azteca.  The dinner portion is far too big, so I neglected the rice and beans to devour the extremely tender and flavorful pork in a warmed corn tortilla topped with pickled onions.  My husband had a bean burrito meal, I think.  Who knows?  I was busy with my delicacy.  He also drank tea and the bill came to $32.  It was delicioso!
