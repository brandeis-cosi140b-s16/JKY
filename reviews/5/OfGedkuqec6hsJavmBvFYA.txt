We were in the neighborhood and my husband hit Yelp to try to find a good place for lunch. Las Margaritas' 4 and 5 star reviews stood out. It was Cinco de Mayo, and Mexican seemed like an ideal choice.

The menu is good, and the lunch specials are available even on weekends. We each ordered one of the lunch specials for $5-$6. My husband ordered the Arroz con Pollo (his standard) and I tried a dish new to me... "Chilaquile" or something like that. I was in it for the tomatillo sauce. Kind of like an open faced burrito with corn tortillas.

The beer was cold. The salsa (both a veggie based slaw-type salsa and a regular thin medium tomato-based salsa) was good. The chips were fresh and warm. Our food was excellent, and portion sizes were generous for the prices we paid at lunchtime. Service was fantastic and a great soccer game was on the telly.

For me, a 5-star rating means there's nothing I can find fault with or suggest improvement upon. Las Margaritas is a humble strip mall Mexican restaurant that serves delicious food at great prices and with attentive service. For what it is, I can suggest nothing at all to improve upon. If we're ever in the neighborhood, we'll be back!
