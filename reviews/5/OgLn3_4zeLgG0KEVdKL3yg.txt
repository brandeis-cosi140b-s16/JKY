Fantastic service, excellent tacos and guacamole, trendy fun atmosphere!  My husband loved his burrito.  Blood orange margarita is my favorite!   We have been here half a dozen times and every time it's been stellar!  If you order tacos in a group they bring them all out together which can be complicated.  Great place if you have kids!
