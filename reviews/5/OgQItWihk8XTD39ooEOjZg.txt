These people literally saved Christmas - ok, maybe just Christmas Eve, and maybe just dinner, but it was a really big deal, nonetheless.  

First, the critical information: the tamales are delicious!!  They're not cheap ($28/dozen), which is totally fair because they're made without lard and taste incredible.  We had a dozen green corn chiles and just ate the last ones last night - yum!  Can't wait to taste their other flavors!!

Next, a compliment on availability: through a series of schedule changes and misunderstandings, our Christmas Eve tamale order fell through and I had to scramble at the last minute.  This place was open on Christmas Eve day, and the lovely people who run it were pleasant when answering the phone, and truly friendly and welcoming to all of us who lined up right out the door. Genuinely, my family and I are grateful!!
