Had dinner here tonight, we were greeted warmly by the hostesses as if it was a red carpet. Seated promptly at Ricardo's teppanyaki style table were we were quickly met by server Samantha. Started with guac and shrimp ceviche both good sized portions and excellent. Followed with the chicken fajitas and the steamed fish in a banana leaf which was cooked in the table side wood fired oven. Both entrees were generous in size and very tasty.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't miss this place. Its firing on all cylinders now!
