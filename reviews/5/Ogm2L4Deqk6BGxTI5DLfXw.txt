I just went here for my second time and am still in love with the Carne Adada Tacos. I usually add lettuce, onions and cilantro, avocado sauce, and lemon juice. It makes the Carne Asada taco to die for. I recommend this place to anyone who loves a satisfying Mexican food meal. Will definitely being going back again.
