I've been coming to this place since I was a kid; it's a great family restaurant and has stayed constant in its great service and yummy comforting food.  

The tamales are better here than at any other comparably priced Mexican restaurant, but they don't have the traditional pork...only beef or chicken tamales.

The margaritas are great.  The chips are always warm and served with salsa and beans.  I got tortilla soup the other day, and the waiter brought me the bowl of soup with the tortillas and cheese on the side so I could add as much or as little as I wanted.   It was a nice touch.

My husband had the Chile Relleno and thought it was amazing.  I really have no complaints!
