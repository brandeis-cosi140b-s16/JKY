Best mexican food on earth! The bottles salsa is incredible!! Ohhh and the shredded beef tacos are the best I've ever had. I know it sounds funny but their cheese quesadilla is unbeatable. They make something so simple absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, they keep raising the prices so I am not able to visit as much as I would like. El charro please decrease your prices and I will see you ever week!
