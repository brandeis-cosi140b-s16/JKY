Great for breakfast.. no sign on the door, so you have to go there deliberately.. it would be hard to stumble in to Dick's.

But once there, the New Mexican cuisine is to die for.. too much food.  Better take a box home.  The carne adovado is excellent.. My wife gets the handheld burrito & the slow cooked pork melts in your mouth, & bursts with smoke & peppers.  Coffee is good, service attentive.. food is excellent.  Anytime i'm close to phx for breakfast, we make a bee line for Dick's.
