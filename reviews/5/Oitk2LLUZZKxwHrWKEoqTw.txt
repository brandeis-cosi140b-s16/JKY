An excellent dining experience. The ambiance of Mexx 32 is incredible for starters. It reminds me of a lot of the trendy restaurants in San Francisco. The food itself is reminiscent of the old Revo Burrito, but has a more varied flavor. I had the smoked pork burrito which had one of the most authentic smoked flavors I have had. For those looking for Mexican fare in a trendy environment at a reasonable price point, I would highly recommend giving Mexx 32 a try!
