Came to check out El Dorado Cantina because my friends had told me how good the food was and that it is organic and also read great reviews. The restaurant is really nice when you walk in the red rose walls were very nice loved how dim the lights were and the music playing. Very nice!! We ordered the Tinga tostadas for an appetizer they were Delicious!  They werent too spicy just perfect. We also ordered the Al pastor tacos the flavor was on point loved the pineapple chunks in it.  We ordered the shrimp tacos those were really good as well loved how they put guacamole in them so much flavor in your mouth. And the Chef recommended that we had the flan for the desert his grandmas recipe . It was delicious I have to give it to his grandma it has to  be the best flan ive tried. But overall i loved the food the place was great and the customer service was perfect . i will recommend it to friends and family .
