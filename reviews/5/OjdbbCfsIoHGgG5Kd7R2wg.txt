This place is so good. I've gone to this place twice and it was amazing both times. Prices are very affordable. Service is friendly. The carne asada is great. I can only say great things about both the food and the service. I always passed by it but I never went in to try it because it looked more like a house, but I decided to try it after my friends highly recommended it to me. I'm glad they did. I love this place.

The only con is parking. I walk, because I'm close, but I had friends who said there wasn't anywhere to park other than spots on the street that will tow your car. Apparently parking is kind of a pain, so if you're walking distance, like me, it's more convenient to walk.
