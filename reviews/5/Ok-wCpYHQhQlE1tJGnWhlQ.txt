This place turned out to be so much better than I originally thought. My mother took my family out to lunch with a "groupon" she scored, and thanks to her I now have a new favorite Mexican food place!

The environment is relaxing and refreshing with a beach-theme and colorful murals along the walls. Service was fast and friendly, and they have great accommodations for families. 

As far as food goes, I couldn't stop eating my carne adobada. Rice had wonderful flavor and texture, beans were tasty, and the homemade tortillas reminded me of the ones I get from Mexico. My family members all tried each others' plates (we like to share) and no one complained about any menu items we ordered. All of the seafood dishes were deliciously fresh. In fact we liked everything so much we got dessert- sopapillas. Those filled us up and just like everything else, didn't disappoint.

Overall I find this restaurant very deserving of my 5-star rating and encourage all of you to try it out! They tend to be a bit spicy on some choices (they even offer a habanero pepper sauce I enjoyed immensely) so ask your server if it's something that might potentially burn your tongue off. Other than that though, go try Baja Joe's for yourself!
