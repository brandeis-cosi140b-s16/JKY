This place was delicious. With little joints like this, it always seems hit or miss. 

But color me impressed!

I got the two shredded beef tacos (#5) with rice and beans. 

The tacos were crunchy and meat savory. The beans were NOT dry like some other places. The rice was soft and fluffy. And the tomatillo salsa tasted fresh. 

A perfect lunch. Good job, se√±or!
