Apparently not new to Vegas but our first time.  We had the Huevos Rancheros, pastor sopas, and taco trio.  In the midst of discussing how fresh everything tasted without the overpowering spice/heat, someone from the restaurant came to our table and explained what flavor profile they were shooting for .. Which confirmed what we were talking about.  Definitely will be coming back often.  Great location and atmosphere!  So very close to our home as well.
