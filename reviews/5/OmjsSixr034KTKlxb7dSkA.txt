We drive by all the time and never know when it is open.  We finally hit the jackpot today!  It is just a hole in the wall.  Tony's is spotlessly clean.  The service is very friendly.  
I ordered the huevos rancheros.  It was a little different than I have ever had them, but boy were they delicious!!!  My husband had chorizo and scrambled eggs.  He was trying to lick his plate.  
The food comes out bubbling hot, literally.  
The downside-they only have regular coffee, no decaf.  My husband had the coffee and said it was very good.  They also only serve powdered creamer.   It was also very cold in there.  I can't wait to go back again!!
