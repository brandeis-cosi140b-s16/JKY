Delicious first time visit! Empanadas were hot and tasty filled with beef and potato. The special was chicken soup but we were surprised by the enormous bowl with side salad, avocado and rice. Finished with a sweet tart passion fruit cake.  Owners were very friendly with helpful suggestions. Clean with simple decor. Can't wait to come back!
