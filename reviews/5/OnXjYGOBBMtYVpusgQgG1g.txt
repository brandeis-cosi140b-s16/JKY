My partner and I have had breakfast and lunch at El Sol at least 20 times since moving to Arizona two years ago. We typically have Mexican once each weekend, and El Sol gets more of our business than any other place in the valley.

The chips and salsa are almost always excellent, the latter being refreshing with just the right amount of kick. Their shredded beef / machaca is great in any form: burritos, enchiladas, crispy tacos. All great. My partner likes to order shredded beef or carne asada chimichangas made enchilada style, and their red sauce is delicious. I've had the breakfast burrito a couple times, and the other reviews are spot on with their compliments.

The bakery is not to be overlooked. We've tried the empanadas, Bavarian Cream Cones, various cookies and rolls, and everything is fairly good, but the Mexican Wedding Cookies are to die for. When we order a bag to go after lunch, they are usually gone before we get home. By usually I mean always.

Service is friendly and very prompt. The food is the best of its kind in the East Valley and can hold its own against any of the more widely yelped places in Phoenix.
