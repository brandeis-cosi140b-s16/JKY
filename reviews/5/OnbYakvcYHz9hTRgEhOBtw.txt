Ordered food to go via internet. Was told it would be 10-35 minutes. Got there in 35 minutes and was told it wasn't ready. Manager came out and explained the order was just received but that he would have the kitchen get the order done as soon as possible. Took another 10 minutes to get the order. Manager gave us chips, salsa and bean dip and $10 in gift certificates. Even with the delay, we were taken care of.
