Super friendly staff. The guy at the counter gave me a sample of the green Chile which was fantastic. The chips took a minute to come out because they were literally frying fresh tortilla chips. Fantastic food and really good personable service. Authentic dishes like birria and lengua and food to satisfy the gringo like carne asada. Go there!
