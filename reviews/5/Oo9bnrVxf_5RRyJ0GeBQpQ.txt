I've tried some amazing Mexican food down at San Diego and CA and I would have to say that Tosinos is pretty up in their game. 

Absolutely loved their Carne Asada Fries and CA Burrito. I like how their fries are still crispy and not too drenched in the oil and sauce. 

I want to try their Sopes next time!
