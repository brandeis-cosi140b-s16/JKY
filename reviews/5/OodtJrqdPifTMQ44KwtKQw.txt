Cocina Latina is amazing. The Barbacoa de Borrego is great, extremely flavorful. They make their own tortillas fresh. So good. Better than the Barbacoa I've had in LA. I don't think (non-Mexican) people in Charlotte really know what's up when it comes to real Mexican food otherwise this spot would probably have a few more reviews.
