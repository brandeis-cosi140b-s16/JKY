This place is excellent. Both quantity and quality! There salsa bar is amazing. They have a unique avacado and jalepeno cream style sauce that is very good. They also have free fried onions and jalepenos for free with food purchase. Caution the fried jalepenos can be hot, actually the hottest I've ever had but not always. My favorite is the Arizona burrito but there's a ton to cheese from. There side of Flauta's is a meal in itself. Great authentic food at a great price.
