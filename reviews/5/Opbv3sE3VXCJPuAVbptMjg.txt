Yo Rita is delish!  Although the bottomless chips with two salsas (one mild and one spicy hot) were fresh and crunchy good-don't eat too many!  Save room for the main event-gourmet tacos that will tantalize your taste buds. 

On our last visit, I ordered the chicken taco and the pulled pork.  The chicken and pork were insanely tender and seasoned perfectly.  I loved the use of cabbage rather than the typical lettuce so many places use as taco filler.  (To Rachel C. those aren't Fritos on the chicken.  They're strips of the SAME tortillas used to make those yummy free chips you probably ate.)  

My husband ordered the chorizo taco and the special of the day-crab cake taco.  I was kicking myself for not ordering the crab cakes as I watched my husband take each bite as he oohed and awed.  (He did let me have a bite too :)  

We also had a refreshing, thirst-quenching watermelon margarita.  It was a nice size and reasonably priced.  They have a great variety of tequilas too. 

(And I  just have to say one more thing.  To Micheal M. many restaurants have the policy to not sit partial parties.  If that's the policy then just get over it and go with the flow.  If you don't return because of that-then it's your loss.  Don't worry I'll eat enough tacos for the both of us.)
