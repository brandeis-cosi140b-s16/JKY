Yelpers, you haven't lived if you haven't been to taco y taco.

You know you've eaten somewhere fabulous when you're itching to write a review while your man is driving you home after such a great meal! 

Tacos y tacos is a clean, authentic taco shop that offers a variety of meats including the typical carne asada and al pastor to the tripas, lengua, and cabeza. 

The staff here is REALLY friendly and everything is made to order - including the corn tortillas. Be sure to tip the jar at each station because they are very patient and helpful to the new folks. 

I'll have to come back to review the other items they offer but I'm sure they won't disappoint!
