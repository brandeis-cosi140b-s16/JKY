Not sure why so many low reviews.  Maybe they didn't order a drink while they were there?

I was actually surprised how much i like the place, we ended up going there several times last weekend.

Breakfast- Had a breakfast burrito and was surprised on how good it was, slightly spicey along side a huge pile of potatoes.

All you can drink for 20-  Me and my group of friends took advantage of this.  The only thing i didn't like was that Rolling rock was their only choice for beer.

Buy one get one Plastic Margarita glass- They were okay, a little weak.

Nachos- Must try.  These were the largest pile of nachos good enough to feed several drunk friends.
