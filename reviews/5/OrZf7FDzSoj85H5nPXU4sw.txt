Look, coming from the east coast I was never huge into Mexican food.  But let's just get real here....this place is THE BOMB.COM!  It's a tiny little spot tucked away in Old Town in a strip mall so it's pretty random.  

From the moment that Cucumber Marg touched my lips...it was over.  Right now they also have the Cantaloupe Marg that is new for the summer and it is also glorious.  I mean, the only one I haven't liked was jalapeno and that's only because I don't like a hot kick to my beverages, I like them to refresh me not kick me! ;)  They also have the tequila challenge which I have yet to begin, but one day I will start !  You can get on the plaque as well as a t-shirt.  Legend says, if you go one step further you get happy hour (or half price, I can't remember) drinks for life!  

Their street tacos are also D'LISH!  My favorite is the Tinga, shredded yummy chicken with their sauce and cabbage! Amaze.  I have tried the majority of them and have not been dissapointed. 

When it's nice out the patio is cute and quaint, not a bad spot to post up having some margs.  Otherwise, the vibe inside is also pretty great.  Bright and vibrant plus you can actually see the crowd rather than the alley outside where it's a bit more intimate. 

Overall, this place is BOMB - TRY IT !
