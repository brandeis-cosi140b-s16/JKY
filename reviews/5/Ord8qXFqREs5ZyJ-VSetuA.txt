Mexican Food-101....small joints kick-ass!!

Coming out of a gym of all places I discovered this little joint across the street.  I started to get that "warm tingling inside" and that is always a tell-tale sign that good food is near.

Small quintessential Mexican-Joint with the requisite Mexican ice-cream cooler near the counter.  The menu is dizzying with ALL the favs.  I quickly settled on a carne-asada torta and a small order of taquitos with gauco.

It took a good 10 minutes for the food to come up, which is a good sign that freshness is happening in the kitchen.  The torta was the best ever.....bursting with flavor and the seasonings were perfecto!!  The taquitos were delicious and the icy cold Coca Cola washed it all down and soothed the fire.

What an amazing little gem!  For their sake I hope you all give them a try, for my sake I hope no one else ever discovers this little slice of perfection on the WestSide!!

Oh best part.....$ 8.50.....and it could have fed TWO!
