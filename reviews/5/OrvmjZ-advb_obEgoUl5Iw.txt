I love this place! I go here at least once every few weeks for their Mexican breakfast (Chilaquiles is my favorite). The food is always prepared fresh and most mornings you can see the owners there making the food themselves. I love the family feel and the relaxed and friendly atmosphere! I take all my out-of-town friends here for real home-made Mexican food! Highly recommend!
