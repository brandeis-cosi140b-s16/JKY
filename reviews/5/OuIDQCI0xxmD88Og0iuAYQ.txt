Thank you Clint and Keith and Blair! I saw my Yelp homies love this spot so when I saw this was across the street from Herbs&Rye, I dropped in before the UYE..I was starving!

Got the super taco of al pastor and lengua and a horchata. Pretty legit.

I like that they toast on some cheese on the taco til its crispy. Lengua was super tender and the al pastor was nicely spiced...I thought I wouldnt like sour cream on it, but good that way. Just add a dab of lemon on al pastor and a little bit of the salsas on the lengua- perfecto.

Horchata was surprising. Most places its too sweet and here it was just lightly sweetened the way it should be. Most places it's just smooth where here it was gritty and yes, that is a good thing. You go to Mexico or eat at my parents and this is how it is because it has real ground rice and cinnamon. Some people don't like it, but this is the legit way. Gritty not gritty, I just wish most places don't make it so sweet but they use a horchata mix. 

I look around and noticed- some of the signs are ENTIRELY in Spanish. No English explanation what so ever on spots like the drink dispenser. Funny. but I guess adds to the "realness" of this spot. 

Thank you Yelpers. These are very much like back home like the stuff I would get when I would go to TJ for lunch with my parents.

I forgot to ask for the pineapple though like Keith mentioned! 

Til next time.
