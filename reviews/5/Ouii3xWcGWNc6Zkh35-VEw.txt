After I devoured my meal in under 10 minutes, I texted my cousin (who recommended the place):

"Why is this place SO good?!"

Not only that but it's also SO cost efficient after being used to being gauged while staying on the strip. KoMex is a fantastic little hole in the wall that is probably most well known to locals and also out of town foodies like me and my cousin. 

The inside is clean, well lit and full of the mom and pop/hole in the wall vibe. The server is also the host/cashier/everything but a cook so please be patient. We ordered:

- Beef Bulgogi tacos: Wow, just wow. Perfectly cooked and seasoned beef neatly tucked in a corn tortilla. What took it to the next level was that the lettuce/tomatoes were marinated in a special type of vinaigrette that was part savory and citrusy at the same time. I've never tasted that type of flavor before in a taco but man was it phenomenal. 

- Kimchi fried rice with spam: Another fav. When I order this at Korean places, it can get super greasy but Komex got this shit down right. Right amount of spice, seasoning and spam to keep me shoveling in the rice spoonful after spoonful.

- Chow Fettucine with veggies: Loved this dish. It was nicely seasoned with just the right amount of soy and the veggies had a slight crisp. I would order this again but with beef and also a full order!

Definitely  coming back here the next time I am in town. Totally worth venturing off the strip for some good quality local grub!
