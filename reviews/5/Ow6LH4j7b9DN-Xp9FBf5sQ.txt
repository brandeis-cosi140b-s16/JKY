Durangos has the best food. Their salads are my favorite. The restaurant started in St. George, Utah and I just found out that they opened one here. It is on the other side of town from where I live, but I am more than willing to drive the 25 minutes to go there! 

I always get the same thing, because it is so good. Small salad (which is more than enough), with black beans, lime rice and marinated chicken. They put their sauce over the beans and rice with some cheese which melts it all together. I get marinated chicken, but my husband loves their sweet pork.  Then they top off the salad with guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream. Get their spicy tomatillo dressing, it is delicious. 

Warning: this place is addicting!
