First time to this establishment and we pretty much ordered the whole menu. Molcajete Barbarroja was excellent and very flavorful and spicy. Ceviche was great, just needed some salt. Also had the Mojarra and it was cooked to perfection. Our server Christina gave is exceptional service and will definitely be back.
