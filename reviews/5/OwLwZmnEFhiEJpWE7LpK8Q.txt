This place is the bomb, and if I want a little something more than your basic beef, lettuce, tomato and cheese taco I head to Yo Rita. Note you won't find this said taco on the menu and some hot sauce otherwise you will be disappointed (as one guy was one of the last times I had gone).

Each table is given a bottomless basket of tortilla chips and salsa and the white wine has always been delicious. I've had quite a number of the tacos and only the tacos but the ones that come to mind are the chorizo (dippy egg, asadero cheese, maple-arbol chile sauce and chorizo) and the calamari (jalapeno, tomatillo, red chile-garlic aioli, cilantro and calamari). 

I am a savory person, and the tacos and chips hit that for me with the right amount of salt and flavoring. If you aren't that hungry one taco will suffice but I usually find myself eating two since everything on the menu sounds tasty and being really fully. Tacos range from $4-$8 (more expensive for the meat ones) and you might initially find yourself wondering why you're paying that much for a taco but I think it is justifiable once you've had Yo Rita's tacos which have a contemporary spin on a classic.
