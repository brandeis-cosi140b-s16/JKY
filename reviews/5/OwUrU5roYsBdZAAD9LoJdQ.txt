I am not sure what all the fuss is about regarding the food or service at San Gabriel. We have been several times and I have to say it is always enjoyable. The food is always fresh and we can't get enough of the margaritas! Not to mention they are only $4 at happy hour! 

My lady and I usually start with the customized guacamole. I tend like it more on the spicy side and she prefers a more mild approach. However, this is never a problem because it is made to order with your choice of fresh ingredients.

For dinner its always a toss up between grilled fish tacos or the traditional molcajetes. I am pretty sure they are the only restaurant in the valley that serves this central Mexican dish. First they heat up a lava bowl on a open flame for around 10 minutes. After the optimal heat is reached they add asadero cheese and a three chili salsa. You can get your choice of steak, chicken, shrimp or whatever the special may be for the day. Last visit it was lamb (and it was amazing). The final product is almost like a Mexican fondue. So gooooood! My wife usually goes for the mole enchiladas or chipolte shrimp. Chef Josh Cordova always lends a helping hand to our decision making process, gracefully guiding us through every step. 

I have to say if you get a chance yelpers, stop by and give them a try. I know you won't be disappointed. The quality and execution of everything on the menu  will leave you feeling completely satisfied and counting the days until your next visit. Ask fior either Josh or Joshua and tell them Jason sent you. They will make sure you are taken care of.
