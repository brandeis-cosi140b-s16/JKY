We love sitting at the bar, having a drink, and some chips and salsa at Tranquilo. This is made even better by the very attentive bartender Matt. He is one of the engaging, responsive bartenders I know. He is the main reason we like hanging out at the  Tranquilo bar and the reason we will keep coming back.
