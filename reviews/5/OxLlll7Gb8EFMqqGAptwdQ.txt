I can't visit Vegas without visiting this restaurant.  The very first time I came to Vegas, I ended up spending a ridiculous amount of money because my party did NOT want to leave!  The service was a little slow, but I always had a drink in front of me... scratch that, I always had an EXCELLENT drink in front of me, plus the owner came by and gave us free tequila shots!  The food was really good; there were a lot of unique options, things that I definitely don't get anywhere else.  Obviously you should order the tacos.  They are FAMOUS!
