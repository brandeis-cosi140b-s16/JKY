Just ate here after a visit to the gym and I am completely thrilled with the food. I got chicken tacos, cilantro and lime rice as well as salsa and chips. The portions were smaller than what you'd get at other places but that's fantastic if you ask me! Americans overeat to a frightening degree and a place that serves high quality fast food that's healthy!? Sigh me up!

Chicken was all white, tender and tasty with a white cheese crumbled on top. It came with pico which I got on the side. The salsa (I got two fire) was pleasantly hot, left a nice burning tingle for a few seconds after eating it but didn't make me want to run for a glass of milk, just how I like it. The unsweetened tea I got was good too, too often when I buy it it's really watered down but no problem here!

I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone with the warning of 'smaller portions, slightly expensive but you're money is going towards quality not quantity!'
