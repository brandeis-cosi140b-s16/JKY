I love Garcias. This location is great because there is never a wait and everyone is very nice. I always get the 3 combo plate for $12 with a chile relleno (they make the best rellenos), a pork burrito and chicken burrito. I eat the relleno while I am there and the other two burritos the next day. Its a ton of food for a very good price.
