Ill start at the door. Definitely a "hole in the wall" but I would recommend this place to my closest friends and family. I personally ordered a steak burrito combination (rice + beans on side). I found that my food was perfect temperature, wasn't "thrown together" like other places in town, and was frankly delicious! The rice was not dry and had great flavor. My burrito was phenomenal, they had some a.w.e.s.o.m.e salsa as well. I will be back! Thank you for the delicious meal Fausto's!
