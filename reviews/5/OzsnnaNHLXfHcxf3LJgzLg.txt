OK. I wanted to make sure I tried several of the menu items before giving a review. This place has 5 stars so there is some pressure to make sure that the review is accurate. I don't want to do something knee jerk and ruin their rating. I've been here 4 times now. Each time I have gone with different family members or friends. I've got to say that everything I've had here has been excellent. Everybody else I've taken has really enjoyed the food as well. We've tried probably 80% of the menu and everything is extremely good. Customer service is excellent. They have special Systems set up to remember your past orders. That's really nice. The owner/manager Ben also remembers your name. Also a very nice touch. 

The only downsides are 1) it is in a gas station tucked away behind Ann road 2) seating is very limited, and 3) since they are getting more popular and busy sometimes you have to wait a while to get the food.

But now that I think about it the down sides are just more excuse for it being unique and eclectic. Kind of like Tommy's burgers in LA. In short they deserve the 5 stars that they have so far. Take the trip, try to find them and enjoy a great Mexican meal.
