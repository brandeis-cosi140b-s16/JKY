Simply amazing! I was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant in the area and didn't even know Al Fuego existed. Once inside, the owner made me feel like an old friend. He took the time to explain each menu item and display his passion for food. I ordered four different items, each better than the last. Sharing with my wife, we had a barbacoa burrito, a Vampiro, a Caramelos and a Fuego taco. The barbacoa was some of the best I have ever had. The owner recommended it plain, without rice or beans. My wife was gracious enough to allow me a tiny bite of the Vampiro before inhaling the remainder. The Caramelos was similar to a quesadilla but somehow much, much better. My favorite was the Al Fuego taco. A chili pepper with cheese and carne asado on a flour tortilla. All of this for less than $15. The best deal in the north valley. 
Don't forget the sauces. The verde was very good, the brown sauce was fantastic. The red was a bit hot but had a really great flavor. The Sinaloan style guacamole was so good I could drink it. 
Both the owner and his son were very friendly and helpful. It was like I visited friends I haven't seen in a while. Amazing food, the alluring smell of food cooking over mesquite and a friendly atmosphere. Al Fuego will be my go to place from now on.
