We'll definitely be back. Very comfortable, nice restaurant without being fancy. There were two teenagers and three adults in our group and they seated us at one of their very large booths. You could probably fit eight smaller people into one of them. Good start.

Waitress was very nice and patient and happy to explain and recommend items. We were all very happy with what we received. 

We'll definitely be back the next time we're in Case Grande.
