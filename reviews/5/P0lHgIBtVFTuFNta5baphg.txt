What can I say I love chipotle. It gives me life. Haven't had any issues coming here. The food is fresh, the service is fast, and the price is right. The choices of taco, burrito, or bowl and your choice of meat or even without meat are great. 

The only thing I don't like is the area or that shopping center. Normally I'm in and out, but the area inside is big enough to have multiple people eating in.
