This place is super authentic from the music playing in the background to their friendly employees and cooks. I was pleasantly surprised that my strawberry agua fresca came blended with ice. I ordered the quesadilla de maíz with chicharrón. I squeezed the lines that came on the side over it which added a lovely citrus flavor to the delicious combination of fresh tortilla, pork and cheese. It was very big so I didn't finish the whole thing but wow was it good!
