Great location right on my way to work. I'm usually a Del Taco person, but what Taco Bell misses in flavor (IMO), this location makes up for in its people. Even though I'm only in about once a week, if that, the staff know me by name and are very friendly. One cashier in particular is definitely fond of my hair ;^) Between the employees, the convenient location, and the fact that I can order ahead with an app, there will definitely be more Taco Bell in my future.
