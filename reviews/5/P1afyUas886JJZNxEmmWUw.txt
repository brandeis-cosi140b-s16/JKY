This is our favorite place for Mexican food currently. My all-time favorite is Carlos O'Briens, but it's too far of a drive when you just want some takeout.

The beans are phenomenal, as are the chicken chimichangas and homemade tortillas. I have never had a bad meal here and I've gone at least a dozen times. My only complaint was that the outstanding tortillas are way too big: storage is a real problem and there invariably ends up being too much leftover tortilla when making a reasonably-sized burrito with them.

The atmosphere is Filiberto's but the fare is worth it.
