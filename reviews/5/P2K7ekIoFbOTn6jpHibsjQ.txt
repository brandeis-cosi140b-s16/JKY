We tried this place after a recommendation and a pic was post up. 

Let me just say. This place is the best by far for burritos! We tried the red chili, beef and green all enchilada style. It was delicious and we will definitely be back! Very clean, affordable and Family owned and operated. They take pride in preparing fresh food daily. I would highly recommend any thing on the menu. Real plates silverware and now serving beers and margaritas!!!
