As their sign says: Autentica Comida Mexicana. The food, the vibe, the service - all excellent. My friend and fellow yelper John M. and I had quite a feast here. Acting on advice from the reviews I read here, I ordered the seafood enchilada - it was pure ambrosia, loaded with juicy shrimp and fish cooked just right. John had the garlic shrimp and let me try some of it; the shrimp was succulent and the garlic flavor intense - I loved it! Caveat: I'm a very big fan of garlic and am one of those people who believe that you can never have too much garlic in a dish, so some of you might find the flavor on the aggressive side if you order it. But I know it's what I'll be ordering next time ;)   The generous and tasty house margaritas were a perfect complement to the delightful repast..
