Taqueria Mexico is a hole in the wall nowhere near anything I usually frequent in Charlotte, but it's a top-notch find.

I'd say it's the best authentic mexican food in town, hands down. 

The chile relleno is one of the best I've had anywhere. I also LOVE their huevos rancheros and huevos a la mexicana. So delicious!

Chips and salsa is plentiful, including a spicy and amazing tomatillo salsa. They also have a fire roasted smoked salsa, with a lot of heat and flavor (though, truth be told, I'm not a fan of smoked anything, so I stick with the salsa verde and the traditional tomato salsa).

Friendly staff, delicious home-made food. Really, you can't go wrong with anything here!!!
