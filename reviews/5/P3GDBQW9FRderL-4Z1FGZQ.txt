The service is friendly,  chips and salsa are fantastic. I order the combo lunch #1 taco and enchalada plate. Generally when I go to a Mexican restaurant that is always my intro meal, I have to say I was quite impressed and bewildered but in a good way, the enchalada was superb and the taco to my surprise was good, it threw me off at first because seldom does a cultural Mexican restaurant use ground beef as the meat for a taco, that being said it was a nice treat and deviation from the norm. On another great note I left my debit card when I left. I went back to retrieve it they promptly had it for us waiting,  for great food and the honesty of the staff I say we'll done :)
