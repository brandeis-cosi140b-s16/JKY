My personal favorite Mexican Place in Vegas. I know the menu by heart and the food is consistently good! I love the ambience and I love the booths. 

The staff is friendly and will fix whatever you want. They care about their customers. 

Some of my favs. are the chicken soup, chile relleno, melt in your mouth carnitas, and their guacamole is fresh and delicious. They have a drink made in a real pineapple that is refreshing and beyond delicious on a hot summer day!  Yummmm!
