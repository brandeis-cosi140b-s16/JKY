There are so many choices for fast-food burrito/tex-mex restaurants.  In fact there are about 5 different restaurants within 5 miles of my house!  But my favorite is absolutely Salsarita's.  It has the freshest ingredients and and a healthier menu than the others...granted you can throw some of that queso on anything to up the calorie intake (and delicious-factor)!  The chicken is more flavorful and their veggies are crispier.  I always order the burrito in a bowl with chicken, black beans, their hottest salsa and extra cilantro.  Something else that adds to their awesomeness, there are no extra charges for sour cream or guac--which I think all their direct competitors do.  The service is good and fast making it easy to zip in and out.  Sometimes parking is a problem because of all the other stores around, but I don't mind walking across the parking lot for some awesome tex-mex.

Check out the great lunch deals they have.  There is a different special featured every day of the week.
