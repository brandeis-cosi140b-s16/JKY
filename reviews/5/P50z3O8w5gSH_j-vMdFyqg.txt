My husband and I love Casa Mina and think it's truly special! The Enchilada Suizas is on my obsessed list. I get this dish with red sauce instead of the green sauce and I've had it 10-15 times. Consistent quality and my favorite Mexican craving, hands down!  My husband gets the carne asada and it is deliciously seasoned and I always get a few bites!! 

Casa de Mina, keep up the quality ingredients and passion for perfect recipes!!!!! We love your hidden gem and will be back soon!
