I don't usually like "tex mex" or "Cali-mex" food, as I usually enjoy authentic Mexican food. However Rubios is my only exception! 
I have now been to this location in summerlin 3-4 times now since I have moved here 6 weeks ago. The location is clean, fun and they play 80s rock which is good for the whole family. I always see a bunch of families here especially on Tuesdays after 2:30 when they have their original fish taco (cabbage, lime, white sauce and mild salsa) for 1.50 (originally 2.99) and their fish taco especial: guacamole , cheese, cilantro/onion, usually 3.29 is only 2.00!!!! Such a steal. I usually get 6 tacos for my husband and I for only 10$!!!!!!! They are quite large too! I can only eat 2 tacos along with my husband. And we take some for work the next day. 
The fish is Alaskan poluck and is very crispy and tasty. No signs of fishy smell or taste. 
If it was only closer to where I live I swear id eat here every day. 
They best is that they close at 9pm on Tuesdays so when ur feeling lazy/tired after a long day of work or the gym, the fish isn't greasy and taste really refreshing esp with a squirt of their fresh lime and tomatillo sauce (which I hoard) lol 
Other options at the salsa bar include fresh lemon/lime, the mild and tomatillo sauce for people like me who don't like spicy. But for the spicy lovers their chipotle is smokey and lightly spicy and their picante is real spicy as well.
Come try it and come on Tuesdays usually after 7pm to skip the usual rush of dinner. I one time made the mistake of coming here around 7pm. Big mistake. Long lines and at least a 20-30min wait for my tacos. Now I know not to come til after 7pm
