I was three years old the first time I visited this restaurant and have been coming here ever since (thats over 30 years now!)it has always looked pretty much the same,sorta bland ,kinda wore out and some might think in need of some updating,but its always clean and a comfortable environment bathrooms are always clean also. the people who work at La Pinata are always nice and tend to continue to work there for years. the food is very tasty, its not quite like any other Mexican food place Ive been to,Ive had a couple Mexican coworkers of mine say its not "authentic"Mexican food.Honestly I couldn't tell you one way or the other if its "authentic" Mexican food or modified to please the pallets of Americans, perhaps it is authentic but from a different region of Mexico then my friends came from therefor unfamiliar to them i don't know, but i CAN tell you there food is all very good and there chips and salsa can't be beat. they have a bar area separate from the main dining areas that is always pretty lively,really the whole restaurant feels lively,its not a real quiet place,people tend to come here in pretty big groups so the place is full of talking and laughter,my girl and I like to come here a few times a month even though its close to a 30 minute drive from where we live. prices are good, service is good all in all a great place to go eat!
