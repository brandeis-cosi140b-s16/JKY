I have lived in Ahwatukee my whole life & finally a good authentic restaurant.  I just discovered it about a month a ago & go at least once on the weekend.  The food is amazing & the people are genuine. Not to mention the prices are unbelievable,  my family of 3 eat there for under $20. So far I've had; a chicken taco, a chicken tostada & a breakfast burrito, they were all full of flavor & the chicken is all white meat.  I definitely recommend Papa Chevos to everyone!
