When you have to debate between admiring the aesthetic beauty of the presentation of your food and stuffing your face with it, you know that you have a winner!  Such is the experience at Abuelos, without the five-star price tag.

The architecture is nice.  From the indoor sky that makes you feel like your walking through Caesar's Palace to the handmade ceramic plates, the place creates an ambiance that 99.9% of people will like.

Even if you are part of that .01%, I dare you to not enjoy the chips and salsa that are placed before you.  No, I'm not referring to the one salsa that they supply (like most restaurants in the area) which tastes like it's mixed with dirt like it's 1774 Sonoran food.  I'm talking about the green one in particular.  Lime, Tomatillo, Cilantro, and who knows what else is perfectly mixed to make you think that you've entered Heaven.  There is another red salsa to choose from and another is a spicy, Habanero mix.  But, the point is that the green sauce is awesome, and then you can experiment from there.

Now, with the menu before you, don't think too hard because it's hard to go wrong.  The lunch specials will likely stuff your face without breaking your bank (e.g. try the Grande Burrito).  Their happy hour also runs all week from 3-7PM and will definitely come through for you.

So, if you are looking for a Mexican restaurant in Northwest Phoenix which will be sure to deliver, go to Abuelos and thank me later!
