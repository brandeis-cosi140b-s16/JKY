I don't fall into this social media but I love this place so much that I started a Yelp just to review it and spread the word. You can't find any more authentic New Mexican food than La Ristra. The stuffed sopapillas, with ground beef, and green chile sauce is my favorite and is consistent every time I order it. The aduvoda pork ribs, however you pronounce that... had just the right kick to it and the meat was tender and falls off the bone. The portions are very generous, try the Nachos. They have great margaritas, good selection of drafts/beers. They have a nice bar area to watch the games, a lounge with couches, a large dining and party room area. The atmosphere is warm and alive, enjoyed the music which is a mixture of country, alternative, salsa (no pun intended) and they also have live bands on the weekends. The owners obviously know how to run a restaurant, the staff are friendly and very attentive, not like places that just want you in and out. My only complaint is the lighting was a little dim and I had trouble reading the menu but the waiters are more than informative. I am addicted to dining at La Ristra's and have made it a weekly routine.
