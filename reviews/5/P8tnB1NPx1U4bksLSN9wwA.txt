Finding good chicken that's cooked fresh and not fried is hard. That's why I love el pollo loco. I can get a chicken bowl without rice to get shreds and keep these gainz brah. 

I go here all the time. Order food, get food, eat food, fart in car, and go about my day. Why would someone write a yelp review for a fast food joint? That's because it was special today. An el pollo loco employee's customer service display wowed me. 

This young man seemed to love his job. He genuinely seemed to love it. I can see him becoming a CEO of something someday. I hope gets a scholarship or something. Usually it's busy when I go in. He helped us with a smile, tried to upsell with a smile. We sat down ate our food. It was slow and I watched him clean the dining room, cleaned the salsa station, and came by out table and asked if he can take our empty tray and take care of it for us. He did and I looked at his name tag. I was really appreciative that he did that, at a fast food place.

Wow. I hope his bosses see this and tell him about this yelp review. Patrick you are the man.
