I'm a noob to this place.  I had no idea it was a franchise until I looked at the back of the carryout menu because inside it kind of looks like a hole in the wall.   After seeing the words "Taco's 24 hours" in the window I thought, "I'm in the Southwest and this is a taco place, go now."  So I did. 

Beef taco and Chicken taco, 10 minute wait, tray table full of condiments from pickled hot peppers, carrots, green and red sauces.   The taco's?  Oh my sweet gracious underwear.  Never had any this good in Michigan.  

The peppers were huge and the heat and flavor were balanced so nice.   I went back 2 more times while in this area.  Wednesday was 99 cent chicken taco day.  The other items were ok but tacos (especially the chicken) were where it was at.
