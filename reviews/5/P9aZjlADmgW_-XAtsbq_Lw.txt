First of all, which I'm very sad to say Lily's Cafe is closed for business.  I'm writing this because I happened to see a review for them.  This restaurant was the best Mexican Restaurant I have ever eaten at.  I would take people here knowing that they would love it.  The salsa and chips were amazing, never had anything like it.  They had chili rellenos to die for.  My two favorites were the beef enchilada and the green chili burrito enchilada style.  The rest of the food at Lily's was really just as good.  I really wish it was still open and we could all still be enjoying their wonderful food.  If for some reason they open back up please let me know.  I will take a 5 hour trip from California, stuff myself and drive back.  That's really how much i love this place.  R.I.P. Lily's Cafe, you are still always on my mind.
