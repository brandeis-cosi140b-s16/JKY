The food and service at Sol are excellent!  I'd like to thank Sharon who was extremely helpful to me when coordinating a business dinner for 20 people from my company's management team in October.  We enjoyed the atmosphere of the back room, attentive service, and variety of great food that left everyone full at the end of dinner.
