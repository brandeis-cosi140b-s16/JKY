Cinco de mayo and here we ended up for some Mexican food. 
Great food, great service, owner was on duty and super friendly.  

This place has only been open a short while...stop in and enjoy a great meal. 
(Keep them open so I can return on my next trip lol)

For cinco de mayo the specials were buy one get one beer and buy get one tacos...

So I ordered one of each taco of course! (And got two of each!)

Street tacos and they were delicious..my favorite was the pastor tacos...amazing...

Also order tonight was a combo green chile burrito/green chicken enchilada....flavor was great and plate nearly licked clean. 


Muy Bueno !
