These are the best tamales I've ever had. I've had tamales from places that claimed to be the best in San Diego and So Cal and were highly rated on Yelp - those ones don't even compare.

Though, I will be honest, I have only had the vegetarian varieties.  However, every tamale I have eaten is great there. What makes them different, is that their tamale is so moist and full of flavor, unlike most tamales I've had. They have a wide selection of vegetarian, vegan, and meat tamales.  My favorite tamale is the green corn and cream cheese.  Amazing!

I get them whenever I go to the farmer's market in Phoenix or Scottsdale. You can also order ahead of time and pick up your order at the farmers market.
