!Hola meego! That's the enthusiastically friendly greeting everybody gets at this fun little Mexican restaurant. The decor matches the enthusiasm of the staff well: bright colors (even for a Mexican restaurant) are everywhere and everything intangible about this place is bouncing off the walls cheery. I guess its not a coincidence its called "The Party".

They have a pretty extensive menu of all the expected classic dishes, plus many that you might not expect. I ordered the "Ceviche Mexicano" with chopped (cooked) Tilapia and shrimp in a very lively light lime sauce over tostadas with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, onions and other good stuff like beans, rice cheese, etc. I liked it a lot. The lady had very good Burritos Suizos, which were far too big to finish. Prices were $10 or less per entree. Good fried tortilla chips with salsa were gratis.

The highlight of the meal were the (Friday night special) 27 ounce Margaritas for $5.95 each. Dont bother with the math. This is by far the best Margarita deal I have ever come across in this town or any other en los Estados Unidos. No, I didn't drive home.

I can't review this place without one more mention of the fact that everybody working here is just so damn nice. As our meal was winding down, no fewer than 5 staff members asked us how everything was. Any server/busser coming within 3 tables of us checked our table to see if we needed anything, every single time.

La Fiesta is not fine dining. However, it is a superlative casual dining Mexican restaurant and delivers incredible value and I can't wait to go back.
