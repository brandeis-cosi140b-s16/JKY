Let me start off by saying this; I am a Mexican food freak. If I could only eat Mexican food for the resting my life, I would die happy. This place is the best I have found in Vegas so far. The people working there are nice, but most importantly their food is amazing. Good tacos, burritos and their chili verde is awesome. This is my go to place. The thing that stands out the most is the green salsa at the salsa bar, it is to die for. Love this place, I'm a huge fan!
