We eat here as often as possible because:

1. We have the Qdoba frequent eater card.

2. We love their food.

3. The location is usually convenient to where I'm running errands on any given day.

4. The staff is friendly and they help me with my Spanish.

Having said all that, your "portion size" depends on who is fixing your order.

I order the same thing every time and I've gotten a range of barely enough of some fixings to just right on some others. 

Yes, I know it's a matter of personal preference but I've never had to say, "No, that's too much" when the employee is adding tortilla strips to my naked burrito.
