Found this very very nice Mexican restaurant close to 43rd & Dunlap 
It's called Anaya's 
Food is amazingly tasty  & the guys/dames who run this place are very hospitable & friendly!!!
That means a lot coming from a picky eater & a food critic like me - as you know!
U should come here with ur friends!
They have a full bar!!
