Based on a small review in the Nov,12 edition of the Las Vegas Weekly and the positive review on Yelp the Three Amigos decided to give Mariscos Playa Esondida a try instead of or normal Sunday night Mexican seafood haunt.
Well fellow Yelpers, this is for sure a hit if you are a Mexican seafood lover.  You can not beat this place.  Do not let the fact that it is hidden in a dark inside corner of a strip mall on the corner of Maryland Pky and Charleston stop you from trying this clean and charming location.
Decorated in a beach motif with maybe a dozen or so tables the food here will have you making Playa Escondida a regular on your list.  We started with the gratis crispy chips and spicy chunky tomato salsa. We also had a couple cold beers to help wash those chips down ($3.99) Each of us then had a different shrimp entree served with the typical rice and beans and mixed salad. ($11.99 - $12.99) The food was served piping hot and presented in style on square white dinner plates.  You can tell they take pride in there food and the presentaion.
Based on some of the larger and more popular Mexican Seafood joints in town Escondida not only has better tasting food but beats them in price by 20-40%.
Why would you want to go anywhere else.
Service was top notch, even though the food came out a little to fast for our pleasure as we like to sit and have a beer and chips before the food arrives.
The owner was on site and made sure we were well taken care of.
BTW how about a little salad dressing or pepita dressing on that nice naked salad that sits in the corner of that beautifully presented plate of food.
Thanks again for a great meal we will for sure tell our friends about and you will see us for sure again.
