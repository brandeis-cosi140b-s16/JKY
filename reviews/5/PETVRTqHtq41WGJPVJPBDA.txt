Cheap, fast, decent atmosphere, and great flavor. You can't go wrong at Tosinos. We stepped in on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. The wall menu is digital, with pictures of their various items scrolling through the screens.

I ordered a carne asada burrito ($4.75). At less than $5, this was a great deal. The burrito was made in just a few minutes, huge and filled to the brim with lots of carne asada meat, guacamole, onion, and tomato. The salsa bar on the side had 2 different red sauces, a green sauce, and lime wedges, which were great condiments to compliment the burrito. The nicely grilled tortilla held all the ingredients in well.

The restaurant has a lot of booths for people to sit at, and compared to other places that serve similar quickie Mexican food (Los Favoritos, Filibertos), the atmosphere here is a step up from them!

Definitely a new favorite for Mexican food in this area!
