Every time I come to Arizona, I always have at least one dinner with my dad.  Usually it's at a place around the corner from his house, sometimes it's at a sushi restaurant, sometimes the AYCE Brazilian BBQ.   This time he picked SumoMaya, and I am so glad he did.

It seemed really out of place in a business park, but once inside I decided it was one of the best restaurant layouts I've ever seen.  There was a (fake) tree right behind our table, and the whole restaurant was open to the outside lights, yet enclosed so it wasn't too hot.  The kitchen was also open so you could see them making the food.

Our server was super friendly and helped us pick out some dishes.  I have to say literally everything that was put on our table was amazing.  We've dined at SushiSamba before and you can tell the chef came from there, as some of the dishes seemed to come from there.  Our favorite was the tuna tacos, of which we ended up ordering another round at the end of the meal.

I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Even the basic sushi rolls were amazing.  Can't wait to go back!
