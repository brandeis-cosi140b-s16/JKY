Fuzzy's Taco Shop is one of my favorite casual restaurants on Mill Ave. Conveniently located and in walking distance to my work, I have to resist being there every week for Taco Tuesday. 
Needless to say, this place does get really crowded during lunch hours, especially on Tuesdays. So if you want to avoid the lunch crowd, avoid going there between 12 and 1 pm. 
But not only is Fuzzy's one of my to go places for lunch, it is also one of my favorites after a night out on Mill Ave. Those juicy tacos really hit the spot and absorb anything in your system before heading back home.
They have two registers to take the orders and the kitchen staff is pretty fast and efficient. With that crowed the occasional mix up is unavoidable, but all the great flavors you get to enjoy, really make up for it.
