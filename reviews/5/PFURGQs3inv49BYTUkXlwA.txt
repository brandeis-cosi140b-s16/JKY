This is the 4th time I've eaten at Asado. Tonight we got to go and tried something different. We got the spin dip for an app... AMAZING. I love this stuff!!!! 
For the main course I got the carnitas burrito. I'm pretty picky about carnitas and this was melt in your mouth delicious. Rice and black beans were great as well. The cotija cheese on the black beans is a great touch.
My husband got the grilled chicken tacos, which he said were excellent. The grilled pepper and onions made it for him.
The best meal I've had at Asado was definitely the Chile lime roasted chicken. The chicken itself was tender & juicy. The chipotle mashed are always fantastic and the grilled vegetables add that extra touch of awesome. Oh, and you have to try the nutella empanadas... They are freaking incredible.
Every time I've been to Asado the service has really been exceptional. And you can't beat the tamarindo margarita!!!
