I have been a very loyal customer here for the past 8 years. The reason - this is the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had and the service is great! What more could you ask for?

Manuel and his family have been so kind to me over the years as I have come through here with friends, family, and more times than not, have just come alone to spoil myself with amazing food. If I spend too many weeks away without coming in for a meal, he always let's me know that Christina and he missed me. I am known by name and order here, and he even knows my regular table. The only negative comment I have to say about this place is that they are not in my backyard!

Now that I have moved, it is worth the extra driving to get Christina's at least a few times a month (I wish every day, but you can't have everything you wish for sadly!). They are truly the epitome of an awesome small business and the American dream. I am proud to support their business and am happy that I could convert so many people to Christina's Mexican Food lovers over the years. 

Thank you all for your delicious food and I think I might come in for dinner tonight!
