FINALLY! 

I FINALLY found some amazing NM style mexican food! This is the real deal here.  There's only a few tables & nothing is pre-made so each order takes a bit of time so be prepared for a bit of a wait.  I ordered the beef green chile burrito smothered with green chile & a side of guacamole, husband ordered a bean burrito & chips & salsa.  I was floored when I saw the size of our burritos but even more stoked when I took my first bite...AMAZING! So flavorful & delicious. These are not your normal burritos that you can just eat out of the foil, these are more like "fork & knife on a plate" kind of burritos.  They are jam packed with filling & ooze out of both ends. The guacamole was the perfect side for my burrito. I can't wait to come back & try their chimichangas, they looked deeeelish.  Only downfall, the hours stink! 11-5 & closed on Sunday & Mondays...boo!
