My boyfriend, his roommate, and I went there last night around 1-2 am because my boyfriend's roommate saw the place on his way home and wanted to try it out.
Right when we got there, my boyfriend and his roommate immediately started joking around about the name and about how catchy it was. We went inside and only saw one guy working. I think he was the only one handling everything, such as cashier, drive-thru, cooking the food, etc. It took him a while to get back to us and get our order but I really think i's because he was the only one handling everything and there was someone in the drive-thru when we got there. Anyhow, he got back to us, my boyfriend and I ordered a chicken chimichanga, and about 10 minutes later, it came out. I should've taken a picture, but it was delicious. What was different was that the tortilla was like deep-fried or something I believe. It was crunchy and the chicken was so soft and moist. Really good food!
The environment was very friendly. The walls are painted bright green, bright orange, and bright yellow which made it much more welcoming. And a plus is that it was not cold in there, the temperature was perfect. (It is always cold in Roberto's and the people working there were always giving us looks like they didn't want to be there and they didn't want us to be there....) Here, though, he seemed to be the only worker, he was working late, and he was still friendly to us.
We really like this place and I'm sure we will definitely be back. :)
