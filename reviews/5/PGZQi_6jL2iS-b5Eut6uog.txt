Came on a Sunday evening for great Mexican food and quick service and they delivered -- Hostess and Server were both very attentive and drinks and chips came almost immediately. Then our Server made the guacamole at the table and it was delicious! I got the vegetarian tacos loaded with tender roasted vegetables, cilantro and onions topped with a tasty mild taco sauce. Steak fajitas were also good, impressively presented inside a carved out pineapple. Though we couldn't stay long, it was a fabulous dining experience and we will definitely be back!
