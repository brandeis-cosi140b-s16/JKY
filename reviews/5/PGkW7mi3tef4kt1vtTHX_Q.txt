First time there as I just got the birthday dinner coupon I ordered the two taco plate with a tilapia taco and the especial taco the tilapia was good but the especial was the star of the show,my wife ordered the street tacos carnitas she wants to go back again which is rare for her because she is a picky eater.Staff was very friendly and it was clean.
