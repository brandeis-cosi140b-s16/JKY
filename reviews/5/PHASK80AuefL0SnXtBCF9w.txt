La Barquita is THE BEST Mexican food I have had... EVER!  I ordered the Chile Verde and Horchata.  Here's the deal folks, you know you are in for an amazing experience when the waitress tells you "I just made the corn tortillas this morning... they are fresh".  If you want an Americanized Mexican food encounter, then pull up a chair at Macayo's or Rosita's and drive right past La Barquita.

I look forward to seeing some other folks chime in on this one!  A real local, hand made, mouthwatering time.

PS $3.50 Margaritas all the time... $2.00 during happy hour.  Beat that Rosita!!
