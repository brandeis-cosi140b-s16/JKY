This is a diamond... located where you may never find it if you didn't know it was there. A funky eclectic bar and restaurant. An open outdoor seating with furnishings that don't match. The most relaxing, home town friendly place. There are 2 pool tables. We were there on Wednesday Pizza and wing night. The wings and pizza are amazing. Someone else in our party had the enchiladas and said they were some of the best ever. The fish tacos are authentic and great. Soup was homemade.  It was evident that this is a "local" hangout" which to me just adds to the charm.  The owner came to our table and said hello.  We got our drinks fairly timely but it took 30+ mins. for our food to arrive...but we knew coming here that this would happen and this is not a issue for us as we like the whole dining visiting experience.  Our waitress was great and let us know that it would be a bit of a wait for our food...This is a great leisurely place, we were not in a hurry and it was evident that neither were the rest of the customers.  We were told there is a live band in the patio every Friday night, there are fire pits all over the outside that are lit at night.  We will definitely be back.  They have 12 beers on tap and too many different bottled beers to list.  We love this place, it will be our new go to spot.   It is a class act of a dive bar with just the right amount of funk!!!

If you like relaxing and no pretention then this is the place for you...oh take the time to take a tour of the "boneyard" where there are some old airstreams and other great pieces to look at...
