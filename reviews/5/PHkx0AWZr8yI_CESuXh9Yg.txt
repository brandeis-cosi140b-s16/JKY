I've been to Carefree Station three times now and loved it every time. I discovered it from a friend's raving recommendation. The first time we went in, we sat inside at the bar (it was a rainy day). Big baskets of tasty homemade chips greeted us at the bar. The bartender was friendly and funny we were given HUGE food and drink menus. We had the Nachito appetizer - fancy little nacho bites with delicious toppings. I enjoyed a Franziskaner beer and my boyfriend had a local seasonal brew. Based on this preview, we knew we'd be back. Plus my friend had said that we had to make sure to sit upstairs in "Bev Heaven". 

Fast forward a couple weeks later, we found our way to Bev Heaven. A rooftop set up with a bar and tables with panoramic views. Beautiful place to enjoy the sunset!

Per my friend's recommendation, we stuck to the "La Familia" menu - a great collection of authentic recipes from Mexico.Their chips and salsa are generous: 3 bottles of salsas (regular, avocado, and habanero). It was difficult to stop eating them to save room for dinner.  I've had the pork tacos and the machaca burrito (both excellent) and my boyfriend is enamored by their chicken tinga tacos. What really makes their food exceptional is their use of sauces/marinades/spices... great flavor! 

CF Station features great, albeit confusing summer drink specials (they have a massive book of beers, wines, cocktails and certain items are marked down for the summer). I've really enjoyed their margaritas. 

My recs: hit Bev Heaven on a nice evening/night and order from the La Familia menu. While we managed to be squeezed in without reservations on a Friday during the Spring, they do strongly recommend reservations, especially for good weather/weekend nights.
