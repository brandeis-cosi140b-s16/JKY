I was thinking "Yeah I'll give them a 4-star review!" but then I realized I have no experiences which led me to think they deserved less than five!

First of all I can't believe it took me so long to finally check this place out. Considering I live just around the corner and have basically commuted past it for over 4 years. When you come in you are typically greeted in Spanish with an "Hola" before being brought to a table. As with most Mexican restaurants they have what I would call a chip busboy. Basically a guy that is dedicated to running chips around to people that have just been seated. When you get your chips and salsa, don't forget to ask for pico as well. There is no additional charge and it is a bit spicier than the salsa. (I just dump the two together in one bowl and dig in.)

Probably the most notable thing here is the size of the plates. You're thinking "Sure, big plates with lots of garnish. Big whoop." And you're right, it's one thing to have a big plate and another to fill said plate. Azteca fills 'em so you can fill your guts. Edge to edge, 360 degrees. Ever heard the saying that empty space helps compliment the items in an area? No it doesn't, fill that spot with rice, refries, salad and cheese-enchilada sauce melted over the edges. That's right Bojangles, you can keep your tiny biscuit cheese-skirt. Azteca's is bigger, better and blankets an enchilada stuffed with delicious. (Yes, delicious is a noun now.) As far as enchiladas go, I can highly recommend the menu item Enchiladas Suizas. You will be happily plump on less than $10.

Round-out your filling meal with a few of those easy-to-drink Mexican beers. Last but not least you will receive a pie-like slice of crispy sopapilla topped with a sweet cinnamon glaze and whipped cream. You might even think you could eat a whole Azteca-sized plate of these. (Let's not push it though...)
