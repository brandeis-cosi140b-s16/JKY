Highly recommend! It was spotless/brand new inside.  The fish tacos are yummy (hand-dipped and fried fish nuggets) I love the topping bar - it's a great selection of cabbage and sauces and I liked adding as much as I wanted. The only thing missing was a side of tortilla chips and I found it strange that they offered French fries instead.
