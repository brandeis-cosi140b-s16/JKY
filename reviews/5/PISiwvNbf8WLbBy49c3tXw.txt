This is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant ! Whatever you order make sure it has the shredded chicken in it . I seriously crave this food constantly ... We have eaten here for lunch and dinner , and we have been on weekdays and weekends . The consistency is impressive . They have a special for every day (except Sunday's, they are closed that day) . They also have a happy hour , and if you eat in the bar you can get anything off their appetizer menu 1/2 off.  I highly recommend the cheese crisp topped w/ shredded chicken . They also offer a 10% off discount with AAA.
