Man oh man!

Stopped by after many times of driving by and saying "One of these days".  I had the classic cheesesteak ~ it was fantastic!  The Boyfriend had the ribs ~ they literally fell off the bone.  No kidding.  Price was more than reasonable.

The [new in January I believe] owner DJ took our order & brought it to us; nice guy!  At one point while the ribs were being devoured, he came to see how we were doing and said "Oh, do those ribs keep falling off the bone?  Yeah, sorry about that" *wink, wink*  Customer service is rare, so this is most appreciated!

We ended up getting two orders to go for the kiddos too.  

Annnnd we got a punch card.  Since it turns out we live just inside their delivery zone, pretty sure that means we're going to be 'regulars'.
