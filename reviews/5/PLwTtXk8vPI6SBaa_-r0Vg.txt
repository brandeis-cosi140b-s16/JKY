I really wish that they had chosen another location for Carolina's as my office shares the same parking lot and it is way too easy for me to walk across the parking lot and grab some of the best grub around.  Very hard to keep in marathon shape when eating there 4 times a week-I am weak with the discipline. 
Their tortillas are the best in town hands down.  I had never tried a buttered or cheese tortilla until a co-worker ordered a few...very addicting.  They only have one salsa which is not fiery but has a kick, and their chicken burritos are just that, chicken and a tortilla.  No Chipotle style faire here.
There is ample parking but seating can be a problem for those who don't work next door.

Hit 'em up if in the area!
