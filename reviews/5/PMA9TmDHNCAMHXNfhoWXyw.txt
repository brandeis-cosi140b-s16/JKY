Wonderful experience and great homemade authentic Mexican food. Prices are very reasonable with lots and lots of tasty options. Wasn't sure if we'd feel out of place here, but the staff was friendly and service was excellent. Our server took the time to explain the menu and made recommendations for dishes. Plus for the homemade salsa varieties that offered a very hot habanero option that I really enjoy sometimes. The food came out fresh and hot and was cooked perfectly. This isn't a high dinning experience or refined cuisine, but it is fantastically good authentic food. This is a must try for everyone, and I look forward to returning to sample more of the menu. 

Notes: This is a cash only restaurant.
Soda is served by the can. 

Two things your won't think twice about after your meal.
