This place is amazing, people is so polite, place is clean, the food is amazing, service is awesome. We're from California and as soon as my husband knew we were coming the first thing he said was "we have to go to TORTAS LOS REYES" we've been here since Saturday, today is Monday we're going back home and before we go we had to visit and we weren't disappointed, we are definitely coming back whenever we visit Phoenix. Keep like this and I might move here (mmmmm no I don't think so)
But yeah out visit was great I'll never forget the great service we got. Our friend is very picky with everything specially food and he said he's coming back at least twice a month, so this place is definitely great. Good job guys. I'm very proud of my people, we're very hard working people
