Hands down the BEST Mexican restaurant I've been too. Everything came out fresh. Our server was amazing (can't remember name). The fajitas for two, which was shared by my mother and I, was a lot and we had some to bring home as well. All of the staff was very friendly and smiled at us. I will be bringing friends and family here from now on.
