This place has some of the tastiest tacos and caramelos hands down. The place looks sketchy because of the area it's located in but trust me you just can't go wrong. Just try it once and I guarantee you'll be hooked. They only have 3 items on the menu, very limited parking, very small place and next door to a porn shop but you'll look passed all that once you taste the tacos. Guaranteed!!
