It's a little tough to find this place but I'm certainly glad I did!! It shares the parking lot with Rosatis.  Taste: authentic, kick, delicious!! I got the machaca burrito with green sauce. WOW! I will never go to a chain place again for this dish. It was sooo good. And price: it was the same if not better priced than a chain so of course I'd rather something homemade! I got an order of chicken nachos for the kids which was huge. The picture doesn't do it justice--great taste, portion and price. Lastly, the place felt really clean. There is tasty chips and salsa if you dine in. We were there around 3:30 on a Sunday . It was quiet but still 3 or 4 customers came in within 30 minutes. I will definitely go back here!!
