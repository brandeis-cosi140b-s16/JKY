I drove across town while visiting the area just to go to the most highly rated taqueria in Phoenix and was not disappointment. Fun and updated decor, very friendly taqueria taco maker, and very friendly tacos. The chicken street tacos were very distinctive tasting, dry in an excellent way.  The nachos were good, and burrito very good.

They need to put a wresting ring in, and have Friday night fights where anyone can create a wrestling mask and sign up to fight.  Although, I guess there could be insurance problems with this.
