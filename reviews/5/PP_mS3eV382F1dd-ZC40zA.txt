What a great place! The vibe was fabulous with great seating (indoor and outside), the decor is vintage fab! Servers are attentive and friendly and the food (my God!), devine!!! I ate until my stomach was uncomfortable, but I couldn't stop! The portions are generous and ordering the Mexican street corn is a must!!! This has been one of the best eating experiences I've had in a long time. An over all ten!
