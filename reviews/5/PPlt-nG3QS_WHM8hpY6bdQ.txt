I almost didn't go due to the poor reviews, but I received a coupon in the mail. I'm glad I gave them a try I was very happy. I made sure to go before the rush, 11:45am. I ordered a bowl, beef with everything on it (including the green chiles for an extra .50/.60 cents) and thought it was delicious, the ladies behind the counter were extremely helpful and friendly. 

Will be going back for sure!
