Kyle H's review below is spot-on. Jim's Burros is Queen Creek's best kept secret. Or maybe not so secret since it's busy most of the time.

The food is always good. I love their enchiladas and chimichangas. I recently discovered their pancakes - best I've ever had. My favorite breakfast is a pancake (it's big) with a fresh egg on top. Fantastic. The biscuits and gravy plate is awesome too, but once I tasted the pancakes...

Everyone is friendly at Jim's. It's a family business, and comfortably homey. It's not fancy, but it is clean and again, has great Mexican food (and pancakes).

The prices are very low, and there are 99 cent specials during the week. My husband and I can eat a full meal for well under $10 (with tip).
