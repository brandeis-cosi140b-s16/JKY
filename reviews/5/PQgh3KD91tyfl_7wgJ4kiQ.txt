Wonderful.

I was a fan of Mucho Gusto even though the food was never amazing.  It was just a fun place and great location.  Now, it's even better.

We started with the Sweet Potato Croquettes which were insanely good.  Hot, sweet, tasty - so good.  My Mom had the black bean soup to start which I tasted and was delicious.  So much flavor.

For entr√©es my Dad had the salmon which he said was delicious.  My Mom had I both had the Gypsy salad which is: Seared halloumi with spring mix, mascerated figs, bleu cheese, candied pecans, red onion, bulgur wheat, fried chickpea and balsamic vinaigrette. It.was.so.grood.  Sweet and spicy and the bleu cheese was amazing as was the halloumi and everything just tasted delicious.

My Dad (of course) ordered the strawberry shortcake bread pudding (I MEAN SHUT UP) for dessert and I had one bite only (I was really proud of myself) and it was insanely delicious.

I am SO excited this place is in Tempe now and can't wait to go back!
