The menudo here is awesome just like mom's makes, and prices are dirt cheap. It's a bakery so you get fresh bread to dip in the broth for just 50 cents more. You get all the condiments oregano,chopped onions,limes, and chile if you want it spicier. The outside looks like a bland brick bldg, but don't judge a book by its cover, there's great mexican food inside.
