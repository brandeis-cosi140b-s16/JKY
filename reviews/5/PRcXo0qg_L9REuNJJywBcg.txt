Ajo Al's is the best. The food is great every time, and the environment is super cozy. The staff is really friendly and the service is fast. Last week I picked up a catering order and they carried it out to my car for me, helped me load it, and were super friendly and nice during the whole process.

When you stop in, I recommend the chicken tacos morongo and a margarita :)
