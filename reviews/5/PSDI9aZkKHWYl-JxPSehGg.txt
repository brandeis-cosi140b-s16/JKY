Never have I ever dated a Mexican restaurant so highly before but boy can I say that Tacos El Gordo deserves it. 

The prices are incredibly cheap! $2 per taco and $2 for fries. Specialty fries are around $10 and quesadillas are $4 with meat ($2 without). The sign is in Spanish and the workers speak Spanish and English so if you are not a native speaker like myself they can easily take care of you. 

The tacos are small BUT they pack on the sauces and meat like no other! NOT TO MENTION GUAC IS INCLUDED!!! At least for the tacos de asada it was. And man did they give me a generous portion! 

I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving authentic Mexican food while in vegas. It may be off strip but I would easily make this drive again just to eat some amazing Mexican food at an incredibly low price.
