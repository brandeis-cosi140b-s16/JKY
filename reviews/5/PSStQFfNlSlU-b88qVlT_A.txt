100% amazing.

As I made an early morning leave from Phoenix we popped in here for a breakfast burrito which was AMAZING, and some tamales that were absolutely perfect. The big winner here though.. the homemade tortillas I purchased and took home. I can't even begin to tell you how GOOD they were. I even had people in LA freaking out at how delicious they are and I must find out if they will ship me a bag or 2.

The place is pretty bustling in the morning and I would easily, EASILY go back here for more. Staff is great and the food is authentic.

but seriously.. buy their tortillas. I'm not even kidding.
