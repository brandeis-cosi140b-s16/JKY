I enjoyed this.  When I came in, the owner educated me on the food.  Now I have some experience with the food.  Well In the last year I have ate at probably a dozen taquerias in town and had home cooked Mexican food (perks of dating a Mexican).  I wanted to just hear the speel to see where their heart was at.  It's in the food!  

Tortilla lightly cooked for that texture you need.  Street tacos are simple enough, meat onions and cilantro.  The carne was well seasoned and marinated.  Adoba was great.  Even some of the sweetness was still in it.  Nice and blackened for that crunch.  They use lard which does make a difference.  That is an important quality in any Mexican kitchen.  Only thing to say is the red sauce was amazingly hot... Manny did not lie.  It is a straight chili sauce so don't pour it everywhere thinking it's Taco Bell.  

Closest to eating my fianc√©e cooking without asking her to do so.  Keep it up.  Mr. Roberto will be happy to see the legacy continue.
