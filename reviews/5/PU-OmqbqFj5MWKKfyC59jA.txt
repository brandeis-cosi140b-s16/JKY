Awesome food! Great atmosphere! Will definitely be back! We were given samples of the meat before ordering, which was great for our kids so they didn't end up ordering something they wouldn't like. The portions are huge! Five wee tacos or three large ones, humongous burritos, giant sodas. The only down side is they don't have a location in the west valley.
