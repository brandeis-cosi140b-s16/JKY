I wanted good Mexican food so I did a little Yelping and found this restaurant. Wowser!!! What a find! This restaurant serves gourmet Mexican food and it is fabulous! It is semi-expensive so come here only if you have the time to savor every morsel of a fine meal!

Also - the dress code is higher than T-shirts and jeans. This would be a great place for a first dinner date, special date night or evening with friends.

The ambiance is lounge-sexy with a touch of modern. They have a fireplace and outdoor seating and their bar is colorfully lit.

The food was out-of-this-world spectacular! The place was immaculate and the service was friendly and efficient. I will be back!

A solid 5 stars!
