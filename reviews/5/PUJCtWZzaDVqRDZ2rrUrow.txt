This was my families favorite spot for dinner. 
Graduation? Julio Gs
Family in Town? Julio Gs
Meet the new Boyfriend? Julio Gs

The Polli Magnifico was to DIE for. I got it almost every single time. 
There are multiple places who try to capture the magic, and fall short. 

Every single time I drive by their old location, I feel a little sad inside. 
There "To Go" Julio 2's just isn't the same. 
Nor is their location in Paradise Valley. 

RIP Scottsdale Julio G's
