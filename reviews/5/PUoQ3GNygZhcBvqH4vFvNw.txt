I've died and gone to Fajita heaven this place is amazing. You can't get enough of the Tortillas homemade and fresh  the flavors of the beef and chicken are very tasty and the SHRIMP AMAZING.. was there for a dear friends birthday and the waiters kept up on chips and drinks for us and when our food came out they made sure we had everything. It was a great experience. I love this place. Just wish there was one in the east valley
