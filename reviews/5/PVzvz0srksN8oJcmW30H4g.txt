I absolutely love this place! Chris, Elizabeth and House have all given us great service every time! Such personable people! Love the food and the atmosphere! There's only one thing I wish was different, and that is the happy hour time! I would definitely come by more than I do if it was maybe 8pm-close! I mean 1 hour just ISNT ENOUGH!! Let's change that guys! Make this place even better than it is! :)
