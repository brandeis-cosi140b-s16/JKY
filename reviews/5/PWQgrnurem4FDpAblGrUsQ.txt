Ate here for the first time, and was absolutely impressed. The staff was courtesy and welcoming. We were greeted immediately, and seated swiftly. Our server, Shea, was friendly and knowledgeable. She recommended the cheese crisp to start and we took her word for it. It is sooooo crispy- not blackened, and it was perfect. Try it with the chilaquiles or beef! Yum.

We tried an assortment of entrée items, and each was better than the last. Despite being a busy Friday night, the kitchen put our order out quickly, and everything looked as delicious as it tasted. I had the two item combo, with a cheese enchilada and carnitas burro (enchilada style) with the rice and beans. It was the best cheese enchilada I've EVER had- so gooey and creamy, and the sauce was on point! The burro was surprisingly simple, so as to showcase the quality pork inside- no need to fuss with stewed tomatoes and chiles, which I love, but  it's straightforward, and the pork is GOOD.

My husband had the Pollo Especiàl: chicken, stewed tomatoes, onions, chiles (did I mention I love those?), deep fried in a flour tortilla, then slathered with jalapeño cream cheese and smothered in their amazing Norteño salsa. This was magnificent.

Overall, it was some of the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. I grew up in PHX, and have tried Mexican food in S. CA, NM, and TX, and no one seems to do it the way we do it here. Definitely worth your time.
