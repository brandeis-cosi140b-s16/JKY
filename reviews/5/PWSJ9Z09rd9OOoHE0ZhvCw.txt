This place is super old, in their original building downtown since the 1940s, so they get 2 stars for that already (I love downtown). As you might expect, the inside is pretty divey, with worn out booths and menus with tons of typos underneath the table glass. 
The chile verde is delicious, as advertised, and so are the sopapillas. 2 more stars.
Best of all, we came in with our 4-month old daughter and the waitress/manager/owner said, "Let me hold her while you eat," and proceeded to walk our baby around the restaurant to visit the other patrons. Free babysitter?? That's worth an extra star right there!
Prices are not as cheap as you might expect - $10 for a lunch special or ~$12 for the dinner special.
