This is one of those places where I go a long time without visiting... probably because I over-ate and decided I didn't want to do that to myself again....

Then someone visits and I suggest this place.  We go... and as soon as I take that first, messy bite of a torta (any of their tortas... they're all delicious!), I can't stop myself from finishing the whole thing.  No leftovers.... regardless of how big the sucker is.  

And the drinks!  they come in these massive cups and they're so tasty!  

And then I hate myself afterwards because I'm so full and I gorged myself like a pig.  

Until next time!  After a few weeks of working out....
