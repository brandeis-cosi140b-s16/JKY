I've always wanted to eat at Richardson's and I finally did-

My family of three walked in on a Saturday night (around 5:30) without a reservation and we were sat in a corner booth full of pillows. I loved that it was dark and private with the Red Hot Chili Peppers playing softly over the speakers. The bar was packed and so was the dining room. 

When you are an Arizona native you know that salsa is important - three salsa's were served: habanero, spicy pico and a mild (for the kid!). I ordered the blackened scallops with three dipping sauces, rice and beans. 2 thumbs up! My husband ordered the tasty Santa Fe chicken - lot's of flavor! The buttermilk ranch dressing is heavenly if you like that sort of thing. 

Nice beer and wine list. They also have top dollar margarita that I plan to partake in after my pregnancy. We will be back! Maybe for breakfast?
