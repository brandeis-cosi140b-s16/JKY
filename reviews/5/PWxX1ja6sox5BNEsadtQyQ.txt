I really love this restaurant.  They have the best refried beans.  The shrimps taste sooooo delicious.  The enchiladas have a green sauce instead of red which is ok, I do prefer red though.  Service was great.  The margaritas were soooo delicious, don't miss their happy hour.  I also like that all restaurants at Aliante are never packed.  Wait time was under five to ten minutes.
