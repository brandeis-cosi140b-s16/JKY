This was such a great place!!! We came for brunch on Sunday.  The food was incredible - we had the breakfast burrito and the egg white omelette along with the bottomless mimosas.   We didn't like the mix for the Bloody Mary.  The mimosas were huge and had a nice WOW factor.  The decor is cool and inviting and they have a nice outside patio.  The service was really good and we will for sure be back ... As soon as possible!!!!

And our friends liked theirs too.

Happy New Year!!!!
