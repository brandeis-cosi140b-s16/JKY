I flew into Phoenix on a very early flight--arriving around 8:30am, but with the time change, I was ready for lunch. I was so pleased to find this place, not far from the airport, and open early on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised to see how full it was at 9:30am on a Sunday--a good sign! And I definitely wasn't disappointed--the pastor tacos were wonderful. I wish I lived closer....
