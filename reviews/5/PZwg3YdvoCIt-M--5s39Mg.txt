Best fish tacos I've ever had!!!  Anytime I get a craving for fish tacos, this is the only place that I will go.  The wife and I ate here before heading out of town. 

The original fish taco is awesome.  The fish is fresh and the batter is so good, not to mention the great salsa, white sauce, and cabbage.  You just can't beat it.  You can also get a fish taco especial which has avocado added to the original.  It was also good, my wife's favorite. 

We also ordered a couple shrimp tacos.  My wife ordered one with salsa verde and avocado.  The shrimp was fresh and flavor was good.  I ordered the one with bacon and red sauce, delicious. 

Going back soon.
