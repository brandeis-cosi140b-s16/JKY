Great service!  As soon as I walked in I was greeted with an "ALOHA" (as a kama'aina I really appreciated that) Great food!  The Kalua Pig wasn't dry, perfectly cooked and delicious.  The seaweed rice was delicious and the corn was ONO!  I like how they played Hawaiian music in the restaurant, brings me back home.  I love this place!
