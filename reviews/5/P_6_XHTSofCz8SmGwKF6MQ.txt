One needs to understand that this is a jumping restaurant with a young clientele; the ambience is okay - lively and cute - but we would not choose this restaurant for its ambience as we prefer a bit more upscale environment.  With that said, the food is really excellent.  Everything is made from scratch.  Everything including the chips (homemade), salsa, cocktails, guacamole, salad (we had the chopped and a split portion was still gigantic) and tacos (the smoked brisket ones were fabulous) was excellent.  Great flavors.  It happens to also be very reasonable for the quality and wonderful service that they provide.  We have a lot of appreciation for the amount of labor that goes into this kind of food.
