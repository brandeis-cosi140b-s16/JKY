We love this Rubio's. The food is quick, awesome and have yet to encounter a mean or unhappy staff member. We went last night and somehow our order was lost in the back. My husband and I were enjoying our time together waiting for our food when we realized we had been waiting 30 minutes and people behind us had been served. I asked the manager and she was so kind and apologetic. She made sure our food was made ASAP and gave us coupons for 2 free meals. She really didn't need to but it was so nice!
