I'm worried about this place - the last couple of times I have been here, it was almost completely empty.  The food is the best - daring combinations of flavors make the specialty tacos out of this world!  The bison meatballs are really wonderful.  During the summer months, the corn on the cob offerings are scrumptious, and the tuna taco is perfectly yummy.  Also, the specialty cocktails are all great.  You have to try this place.
