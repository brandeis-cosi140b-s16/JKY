the fact that this Chipotle has been open for at least 5 months now (I think it opened right around Thanksgiving) & only has 3 reviews kind of shows why I'm giving this location 5 stars. 

I guess it might not be considered a "good" thing on some levels, but it's never busy. Seriously, it almost feels like a "secret" Chipotle. I'm used to other locations having lines out the door. 

I'd give most Chipotles four or five stars to begin with. They all have good, consistent food & friendly employees. This one is no different. The (very) quick wait time for a burrito bowl is an added bonus.
