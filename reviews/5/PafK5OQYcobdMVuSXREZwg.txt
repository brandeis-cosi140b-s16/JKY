I saw this place had some iffy reviews so I thought I would add mine. 

We've been going here for at least four years and this place never disappoints. Their food is always great, the portions are huge, and the price is amazing. You can beat a breakfast burrito or a California burrito for $4. 

My favorites here are all breakfast burritos, the California burrito, the carne asada fries or nachos, fish tacos, and tortas. My husband really likes the menudo and my son loves the quesadillas or rolled tacos.

Those are the only items I've tried so I can't really comment on anything else. 

The salsa bar is always fresh and clean. On the weekends they usually have some kind of sweet treat out. 

I'd recommend it over Robertos (which gave us food poisoning).
