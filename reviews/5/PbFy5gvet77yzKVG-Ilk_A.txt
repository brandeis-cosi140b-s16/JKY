This place was beautifully put together...for the most part!  Lounge seating is very neat, but a few extra pillows for your back may be needed.

The service was great! Bartender was really trying to keep up, but the waitress was checking in on us often.

The huarache was delicious! Great masa with just enough beans and a beautiful presentation.  The side sauce was excellent.  The selection of drinks was appealing.  And the strawberry margarita was very refreshing and tasty.

Excited to go back with more friends!
