This is the place to go for cheap, delicious, and authentically fresh Mexican food in the CU area. From tacos to chimichangas, everything I've had at this place has met my expectations. 

And the chips and salsa: wow. Seriously, for $4 you can get two tacos along with the bottomless chips and salsa and leave very satisfied.

The place isn't huge, but I think that works to the restaurant's advantage as servers are always nearby and ready to refill drinks or chips. However I haven't been during peak dinner hours, so I don't know if the size is really an issue.

Highly recommended. El Toro, Burrito King, etc. have nothing on Mas Amigos.
