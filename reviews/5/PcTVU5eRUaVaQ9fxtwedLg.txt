Best Mexican Restaurant in South Side, easily.  Less expensive then Emiliano's,  better quality food, and even larger portions.   Tried the Enchiladas Mexicana and their Chili Relleno.  Both were outstanding.  Free chips and salsa that were pretty good too.  I will be back many times to try the rest of the menu.
