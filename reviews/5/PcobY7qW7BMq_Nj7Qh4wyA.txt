After driving to its location on Las Vegas Blvd and seeing that it was closed, we yelped this location and quickly drove over to get our taco fix.

Now, there were separate lines depending on what kind of meat you wanted when we went so our line for the adobado (marinated pork) was the longest. When we were finally at the front, yes, Tacos Al Pastor were ordered. Before Tacos El Gordo, I didn't even like tacos and now I love them.

Fun Al Pastor trivia: The vertical rotisserie that the meat is spun on is called the trompo and the meat is thinly sliced off from the spit.

After you collect your goodies then go pay the cashier (you can also choose your drink now) and try to find a table to sit at. 

What made this location my favorite: We had been looking around for tables while we stood in line, but man, some people definitely wanted those seats. After we paid and walked around to see if a table would free up, an employee came by and asked if it was just the two of us. We said yes, and she said to follow her to a different section and they made us our own table to sit at. Thank you for this!
