absolutely FANTASTIC. service was great. food was amazing (and we have a lot of good mexican food in my town). we were asking at our hotel when we were in vegas about a good local mexican place, and were referred here, she said she hadn't \been but it was always packed when she drove by it, so that is usually a good sign. Sure enough, it was packed when we found it, but as luck would have it, we got there at the tail end of the lunch rush and most of the people were clearing out. We didnt' have to wait at all. 
I had the trio of tacos, the carnitas, OMG to die for!!! the tortillas, mmmm.
I don't remember what hubby had but his verdict was "it reminds me of my grandma's food" which is high praise in his book, as she was old school abuelita who always had a pot of frijoles simmering for them. 
all in all, one of the best mexican restaurants i have ever been to, hands down
