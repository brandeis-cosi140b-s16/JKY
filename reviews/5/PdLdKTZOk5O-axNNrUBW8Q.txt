Great food really fresh. Possibly the best fried chicken I've had in town. Great waffle. Amazing country gravy. The atmosphere is nice. Good patio. Great bar. Friendly service. Ignore the few low reviews- those are probably from the first couple of weeks when they were getting started. This place is great.
