The absolute BEST MEXICAN I have EVER had!!! That's a raging endorsement too bc I'm usually not a fan of the food genre. The staff is incredibly efficient and the manager here is on his game so you don't have to worry about mediocre service. The drinks are exactly what you're craving and the atmosphere is hip without being hipster. I highly recommend this hidden gem.
