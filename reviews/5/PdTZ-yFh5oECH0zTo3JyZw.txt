All the reviews here are true. For $2.50 I challenge anyone to find a better tasting and more filling hot dog. I eat a Sonoran dog here every couple of weeks and I haven't been disappointed yet. Also the horchata and caramelos are really good too. I've had Sonoran dogs from the famous El Guero Canelo and a few other spots in Tucson and this place makes them better than EGC in my opinion. For the best Sonoran dog I'd go to "Aqui Con El Nene" in Tucson. Their place is a homemade shack on the side of the road but their food is no joke.
