Ah, the old adage, "if you see a [insert ethnic minority] eating in a [same ethnic minority] restaurant, then you KNOW it must be good."

While this is true, and especially in the case of Vaqueros, this burrito joint is the type of place that can dissolve racial discrimination and bring all the colors of the planet together under one orange and yellow striped world, where the rivers flow with beans and cheese, the mountains are  heaps of carne asada, the trees harvested as flautas, and the raindrops on your tongue taste like freshly made red salsa.

Seriously.  Their asada burritos are filled with insanely large portions of meat and guac.  Their rolled tacos have a heap of cheese and guac and their red sauce is perfect for dipping.  I've even had their breakfast burritos which are PACKED with eggs, bacon, and cheese.  If they could put it in a can, it could be packaged as a hangover cure and possibly the antidote for bird flu.

I also dig on their churros, which are not made in-house, but dammit, they are delicious anyway.  I usually get the strawberry-filled and afterwards I feel like i have violated the Geneva Convention for war crimes against my body.

Oh, they also mention on their signage that they are open 24 horas, but I'll never know because I'd never jaunt down here to this part of hood armed with only a lengua burrito.
