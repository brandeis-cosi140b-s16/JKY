I lived in Albuquerque and traveled all over New Mexico daily for 4 years. After moving to Arizona I realized how much I missed New Mexican food. This restaurant is the best New Mexican food in all of Arizona  The food is hot and spicy. It is a family owned and operated business. John is the best.  The makes the best margaritas ever also.
