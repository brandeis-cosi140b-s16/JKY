Hidden Gem! 

I cant imagine a better combination....Kick butt burger, some of the best french fries around, short rib tacos and FRESH squeezed lemonade. 

First of all the place is adorable, pretty much every simple detail has been thought out down to the vintage coke cooler built into the order counter filled with crushed ice and mexican bottled sodas. 

I am not sure how you stand out in todays fancy burger crazy.....Well the folks at THE STAND figured it out. Its all about the details in the food....Nimans Ranch Bacon, quality meat, grilled peppers and onions. 

Do yourself a favor, make time for this joint!
