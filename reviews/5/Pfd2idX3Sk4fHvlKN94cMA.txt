I am always looking for authentic Mexican food, especially on Scottsdale Rd. I found it! Great service, friendly, clean and tasty.  I had the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and they were the right kind of spicy. I look forward to exploring their other menu items. Don't let the strip mall dissuade you; the inside of the restaurant is beautiful and welcoming. Full bar and tvs inside. This is a family owned business and it's exactly what is needed in a world of chain restaurants.
