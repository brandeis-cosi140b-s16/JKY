First off I have to say, great location and I love that on Friday night at 7pm there is plenty of seating! The atmosphere is fantastic and very authentic. Lights and decor that definitely match the food you're eating.

The staff are very friendly and it would appear perhaps the manager is right in the line making food with the rest of the employees which is a good sign of a well run place.

The kitchen is immaculate, I mean, very clean. Which is hugely impressive for a fast food place.

The prices are very reasonable and they make their tortillas fresh, on the spot! Very cool. I had a chicken burrito enchilada style and it was fantastic!

Great experience, I'll be back for sure!
