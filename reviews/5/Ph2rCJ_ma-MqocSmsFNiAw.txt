well, i have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for burritos, and this place is like heaven for me.

these GIANT burros comes wrapped in a huge, steamy tortilla, with your choice of black or pinto beans, grilled veggies, rice, chicken (or go all veg) and fixin's like sour cream and pico. it's a long counter ordering/instruction process...like subway.

they conveniently wrap it all in foil so you can eat it with your hands (it takes two).
