This place was on my to do list during my visit to Arizona recently. I had seen the restaurant on Diners, Dive-ins, and Drives and knew I had to try it. Its a blend of Mexican/Asian food. I had the jade red chicken with white rice, AWESOME. You also get a cookie with your order :) Very unique place to have a meal. I highly recommend it if you're ever in the Glendale/Phoenix area.
