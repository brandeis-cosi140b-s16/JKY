I have been coming to this place for about 7 years, back when it had a different name. All I can say is WOW!! this place is absolutely incredible. I am a native to vegas and have tried just about every mexican restaurant in town and this place beats them all.  I am a meat lover at heart, but when I come here all I order are their veggie tacos and burritos. I have tried other things on the menu and have never been disappointed. Everything is just so fresh. This place is always busy with a line of people, but I never mind the wait, its part of the experience. Ok im done now, go to los tacos.
