I went in on my lunch break and the waiter seated me right away. I knew I wanted to be quick so I didn't ask for the menu. Told him, before I even sat down, that I'd like one chicken taco with a glass of water. Shortly after he seated two other families he brought free chips and salsa while I waited. When my food arrived it was beautiful and I used the salsa from my chips to put on the taco. He brought my check and the taco was reasonably priced. I left cash and a sizable tip. In and out in 15 minutes. Very happy customer! The taco was delicious and I will be returning again and again!
