Usually I don't go giving reviews to fast food places, because I don't see a reason to do so, people would still eat there regardless of what I write.  But....this place is worthy of writing a good review for. 

We were coming home from Vegas, I Yelped this place and saw the amazing reviews not realizing it was Rubios. The food was fantastic, I was really surprised. They were also so nice and friendly and they gave us better service than some of these 5 star restaurants
