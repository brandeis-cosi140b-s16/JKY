My co-workers and I decided to give it a try for lunch today. Great experience through out the visit. I ordered the fish tacos and boy was I in for a treat, each bite was full of flavor. Good portion of fish with the usual choice of toppings you'd find at chipotle or cafe rio and a few that were new to me. For the most part it may seem like you're in chipotle but I like the way Zabas serves their portions and mix it up a bit. They also have a loyalty program as well!
