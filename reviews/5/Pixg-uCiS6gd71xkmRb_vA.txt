We were on our way to a hockey game tonight, and wanted to grab a bite to eat. Using the nearby feature I found this gem. I had a ground beef street taco, and C had the carne asada. Excellent! Fry bread was flaky and crispy, meat was flavorful, and the beans were delicious. Would definitely come here again!
