I'm from California where you can find The best Mexican outside of Mexico of course. Once in a while I have to travel to AZ for work and I make it a point to eat at Los Picos. I love their shrimp with garlic! everything I've had here is good. I read some of the comments about there not being good Mex food in AZ, well NOW you DO!
Try it out, don't be intimidated by the locale, these folks are authentic. Provecho!!
