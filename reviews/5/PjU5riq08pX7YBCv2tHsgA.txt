It's the small places that surprise you and this is one of those places.  If you are looking for REAL authentic Mexican food then you have come to the right place.  Yes, it's in a dingy strip mall along busy South Blvd., but don't let that stop you from coming here.  They are really friendly here, laid back, the service is fast, and most of all - the food is awesome.  Love the various salsa dips they serve with the tortilla chips.  There are some vegetarian options on their menu.  My favorite is the spinach wet burrito.  One unusual thing in this restaurant that I like is the wash sink that is outside the bathrooms.  It makes it hassle free to wash your hands.  I wish they had an outdoor patio, but in its current location that probably wouldn't work.
