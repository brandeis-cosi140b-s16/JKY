Smart way to take the formula that is Chipotle and find new grounds. Service (Kristie-anne)  was pleasant and accommodating. Asked if it was my first time and happily offered me samples of all their proteins. Great ingredients, interesting salsas, dressings and love the fresh jalapenos, cilantro and lime. 

Check in gets a delicious sample of their "bunny" bark (most operators would have just thrown the crumbs away...) 

I love smart operators, friendly service and delicious fresh ingredients. I'm just sorry I've missed 6 months of opportunity to enjoy it.

Perfect fit for a college campus.
