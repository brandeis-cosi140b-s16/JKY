Since I tell everyone to go and try this place.. I guess it is only appropriate I write a review! The food here is AMAZING! We have been here a few times now and I have had the table side guac, chicken fajitas, and chicken tacquitos and all are some of the best I have ever had!! The chef is awesome and even does table visits to ensure that people are enjoying his food. They also have a special where it's 50% off your entire bill on Mondays for LV locals!! Go eat some of the most Bomb Mexican food you will find in this city!!
