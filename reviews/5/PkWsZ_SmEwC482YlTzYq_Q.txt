Stopped in at Mesa's Top Shelf Mexican Restaurant. I have to say, it was the BEST EXPERIENCE received at a spot to eat yet. A couple of minor dips hit on the part of the kitchen, but what we wanted we got. Service was "TOP SHELF" to say the least. Cameron, our server out-did himself. I suggest you ask to sit in his station if you visit anytime soon. For a party of six, the price was real nice. We are full and fully satisfied. *FYI. It sounded like they knew how to throw one mean party upstairs as well. Check it out.
