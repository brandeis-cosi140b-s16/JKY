This is a really awesome Mexican food joint with a specialty in seafood.  I've never failed to be impressed by any dish they make.  Some are unique and tasty, like the shrimp in cream sauce soup.  I've never had anything like it, and it's super-creamy and awesome.

They have an appetizer/side that is shrimp inside a chile wrapped with bacon.  Sure, go ahead and read that again, it's as good as it sounds.  The chile isn't very hot so it should be within almost anyone's spice range.

Along with your meal you get a half dozen sauces/salsas to pour on to your taste.  The creamy chipotle sauce is really really good.  Ask for it with your chips, it's that good.
