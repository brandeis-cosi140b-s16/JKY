It's Chipotle man. For quick Mexican food, pretty delish, great friendly service all round too. It's not fancy shmancy but for food it borders on having a restaurant feel.  I had taco Barbacoa with guac, sour cream etc. Prices are really reasonable for what you get. My Margarita is working just fine for $4.70,lol.
