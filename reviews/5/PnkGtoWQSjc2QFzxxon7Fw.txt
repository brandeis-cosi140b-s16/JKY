Our party of 3 started with the black bean soup, the mussels, & taquitos. The flavors on all three were outstanding. The main courses short ribs, ossobuco, and fish tacos. Best way to put it, good plate cleaners club. Two had desert they both polished it off. We sat outside. They had live music it was very nice. We always try to pick who had the winning dish. I think the mussels. The person who had them was hoping for more bread to clean the plate dry.
