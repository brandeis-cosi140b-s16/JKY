This is the best Chipotle in the Tempe area. Fast, friendly service. Very clean establishment. Fresh, delicious food. They would rather have me wait a minute for the freshest, just-off-the-grill food then scrape the bottom of a tray. If you get Rachel as a server, you get great conversation with your speedy service. It's a fun experience.
