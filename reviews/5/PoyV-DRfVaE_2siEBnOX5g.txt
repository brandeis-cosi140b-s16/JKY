I love the hot tri colored chips, taco Tuesday! Karaoke Thursday, Happy Hour from 3-6 and brunch on Sunday! Killer homeade margarita and my new favorite bartender, Vincanto, "Vinny" made up the best Dulce de Leche martini. We loved the mahi mahi tacos, the carnitas and the guacamole! The place is so comfy, swanky, and very welcoming. I'm so happy that it's right across the street from home. Sorry Lindo!!!! Chinita's wins!!!
