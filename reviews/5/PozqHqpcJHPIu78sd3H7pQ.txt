Can't you give a 6th Star?  This is the old Chuy's reborn.  We have been coming to this neighborhood bar/grill for over two decades, including with our children when they were in elementary school.  What a great place for Kids of all ages, including those over 50.  When Chuy's went to the dark side, we stopped going, but now that our favorite manager has bought the place, we are back all the time.  The food is great and inexpensive.  the 5 * margaritas also deserve a 6th star and the staff is like family.
