If you want to have a yummy drinks and food stop by anytime.  The bulldog beer-garitas are giant and delicious.  The pork tacos are my favorite but you can never go wrong with carne or chicken.  If you've never tried duck tacos, try them here.  

If you want to party make sure you come by Friday night, Saturday night, or Sunday day. Make sure you put your party pants on cause you'll need em.  It gets wild and crazy.  WIth bottomless mimosa's on the weekends & great brunch specials you'll be glad you came.  It's always super crowded but the DJ keeps everyone moving.

Highly recommended.
