First time and it was awesome thanks to our server Christina. Not only did she give us good service but she had such a good vibe and personality. I had the fish tacos and they were so good. And the beans tasted like my grandma made them. Let's not forget about the michelada to top off a great meal. We will definitely be coming back next trip out here. Thanks Christina, you were awesome!!
