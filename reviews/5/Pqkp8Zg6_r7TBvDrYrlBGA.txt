We decided to throw my son's 1st communion reception at this Komex location and it was the best experience. You wouldn't think to throw a big group party here, but Linda and the staff made hosting my party of 40 people a breeze. Linda made the reservation and ordering process so simple. She answered EVERY question I had and made sure I was well taken care of throughout the whole party. The staff was so helpful and the food was fresh and ready to serve when I requested. They split my appetizers of bulgogi fries into proportionate servings so that I could spread it out amongst my guests and they set up a buffet-style area to serve the main dishes. They even allowed my to drop off my cake to hang on to until serving time and provided a knife and plates for that as well. I was worried about the expenses of drinks since they only sell by the can or bottle but they provided pitchers (actually fancy serving bottles) of filtered water to offset that cost tremendously and I just ordered non-water beverages for whoever wanted it. They set up the tables in rows so my party can all sit together, and they also covered the tables with tableclothes for a more elegant appeal. I also appreciated the complimentary salsa and chips to feed my guests until everyone arrived. Thank you all so much for such an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!
