Really solid food, very clean restaurant. It's not too greasy like some other fast food Mexican places that can leave you feeling not so great afterwards. This building has struggled keeping restaurants in here even though they've all been good. Come support this place so we don't lose another small business fast food joint!!
On the flip side, prices might be a tad high. Wouldn't mind some daily deals or coupons.
