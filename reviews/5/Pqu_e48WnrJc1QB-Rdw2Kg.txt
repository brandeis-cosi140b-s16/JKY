Pros: outrageously delicious burgers

Cons: I don't live here

My sister took me here because she said they had the best burgers. She was right. Their double party burgers were to die for and cooked perfectly. They have a sort of saut√©ed onions (and I don't even like onions that much) that make it even better. 

The fries and sauce need a paragraph of their own. The fries were cut small (my favorite) and not over done or too soggy. It was a mixture of both textures at the perfect level. The sauce could seriously be eaten by itself. But I just really like sauce, good sauce, mind you. It wasn't just mayo and ketchup, there were spices from another world. 

Go here. The coke is huge too and comes in a glass bottle, and made with real cane sugar.
