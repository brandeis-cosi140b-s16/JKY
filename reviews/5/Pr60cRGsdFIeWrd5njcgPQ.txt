Gods Holy place for true New Mexican food.  

My resume:  Born Portales NM. 1969, Raised Grants N.M. 1972 to 1987.  Devout follower of the stuffed sopapilla craze of the 70's and early 80's.  Frequent trips to all the mecca's in Albuquerque, Pajuaqe, Espanola, Las Vegas, Taos, Santa Fe, Grants.  I have eaten red chile con carne in some form on a bi-weekly basis from birth to the unfortunate relocation out of state in 1987.  

HOWEVER, Los Dos Molinos has now taken the game to a new level.  I have never had such consistent, high-quality, intoxicating red chile as I have at this location in my life.  The newly relocated site is charming and warm.  The commitment to Red Chile Greatness is moving and gives me hope for the planet.

  It is important to note that although they will not discuss it openly, there is no love lost between the locations and they do not function as a single corporate unit.  Down South Phx is the original and still very good, Mesa is a joke.  

The Central/Arcadia/Biltmore area location is poised for greatness.  Do not be afraid, I have taken traveling business associates from coast to coast (one from Panama, and two from Germany) and as a result now find myself constantly shipping dry chile pods to the four corners of the earth so that an attempt at having some more of "that magical food" can be made.

  On a recent trip I had the first Green Chile Relleno I have had in 15 years,(the AZ style is a heathen salsa covered mess) this Relleno renewed an entire entree for me.  Split one with the wife tonight and had the Adovado Enchilada with a pitcher of Margaritas and could barely function for endorphin stimulated bliss.  Good lord!  Eat HERE.  SOON!
