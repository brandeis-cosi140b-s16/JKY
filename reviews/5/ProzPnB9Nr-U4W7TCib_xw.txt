I  visited Cafe Carumba this past Saturday for what could only be described as a delightful brunch. This restaurant seriously blew me away. Not only did it offer a varietal menu the wait staff are personable and made me want to spend the afternoon in the restaurant, in fact  I did. After finishing my breakfast while relaxed and comfortable on my cozy "sofa"-like" chair I relocated to the spacious outdoor patio (don't worry with the mister system you will never feel like your in the heat of phoenix). I switched to nice cold Stella Artois beer which you can get on draft and also sampled the cevici, FYI if you like cevici like real cevici...you wont be disappointed it was so authentic I thought i was on the streets of Mexico with a little spicy flare!! To polish off the day we delighted our sweet tooth with the drumstick dessert...mm...mm...mm..mm...mmm!  Brownie, Ice cream, chocolate and caramel!!! MMMMMMM. 

Okay so to wrap it up delicious food, great service, good atmosphere and the staff will totally let you hang out all afternoon without bother. Manager Scott....GGTK!! Chef Cyn is doing great things for this restaurant...ask for her home-made Sangria......MMM!
