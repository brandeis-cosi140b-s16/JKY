I used to live in San Diego back in the early 2000s and couldn't get enough of this place, so when I found out there had a couple in Vegas...we had to stop by and get our fill! It might not be the Cali air that I'm used to but this spot in Vegas does this grill justice!!! - You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu unless you don't order anything off the menu! haha!
