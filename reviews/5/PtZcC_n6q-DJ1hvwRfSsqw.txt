Open for lunch!  Trendy and comfortable, it is a great experience with awesome service.  The owner, Lenny, even came to the table to ask how we were doing.  Fresh chips and salsa's started our lunch with a yummy taco and bean/rice sides.  Wish we could have enjoyed an adult beverage at the beautiful bar but work calls.  Next time!
