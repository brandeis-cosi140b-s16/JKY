When I want fresh and healthy fast food, I go to El Pollo Loco.  The chicken is served piping hot, having been taken right off the grill.

El Pollo's chicken is flavorful - deeply marinated in citrus and herbs, then flame grilled - just love that crispy skin!  Another plus for me is their chicken is farm-raised, and hormone-free. 

For about 5 or 6 dollars, I get the 2 piece chicken combo that includes tortillas, 2 sides and a fountain drink.  (Look/ask for a coupon.)  My favorite sides are the spicy tortilla chicken soup and the crunchy coleslaw, but there are lots of sides - rice, fries, beans and salads.  Some other chicken dishes are the tacos, burritos. and bowls.    

It is a bright, clean restaurant with fast, friendly servers - I love it!
