Are you piss drunk? Is your stomach churning? Do you want to make sure you don't wake up tomorrow morning feeling like shit? Then you MUST go to Wadaa Street Tacos!

I stumbled over to this literal hole in the wall after a night out in Scottsdale during my Spring Training trip. This is as close as it gets to authentic Mexican street tacos stateside. Only chicken or steak tacos and that's fine-I don't need a damn quesarito with a bunch of processed bullshit in it! 

Service is great-these guys are literally shoulder to shoulder in a couple hundred square feet of space busting their asses off serving a bunch of drunk assholes, and they always do it with a smile on their face. There's always a line, but it moves FAST. These guys definitely know how to hustle. 

$3 a taco and they have a full section of sauces, salsas, and other add-ons off to the side. This place is a MUST. No chairs or tables, but it's probably for the best, because I'm betting if you sit down you'll get the spins anyway.
