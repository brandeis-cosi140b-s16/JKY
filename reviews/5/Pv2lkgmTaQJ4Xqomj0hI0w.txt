We love to come here everytime we are in Vegas.  My favorite entree are the tacos.  I love the spices they use.  Plus I like the decor and open air vibe and lighting. They play a mix of music as well.  I tried the shrimp ceviche appetizer this time which was just ok.  The top shelf margaritas are yummy.  
I did come for Sunday brunch once and I do recommend it.  They have mariachis during the brunch.
