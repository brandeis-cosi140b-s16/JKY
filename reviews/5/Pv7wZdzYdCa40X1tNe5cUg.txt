We went to this little gem last night. We have a favorite up here and we hadn't been anywhere else that could top it. And we were wrong. This place is awesome. 

The staff were super nice and attentive. Perfect time for coming here is later when there's no crowd. This place is tiny. So I'm sure it's packed for lunch and dinner. 

My first thing to try is always the carnitas. They were out of the brisket (carne). So that was a bummer. But the waiter recommended the Flank steak. So that is what I tried. It was awesome. So tender, well marinated and their flour tortillas are amazing. I love fresh flour tortillas. I could eat them for a meal by themselves. I'm pretty sure I have plenty of times.

My bf had the taco platter with chorizo, shrimp and carne asada. Super good. I'm not sure if the chicken enchilada came with my dish or his but holy shit, it was the best enchilada we've ever had. Their green gacamillo sauce is very very tasty. 

We also shared the Queso. I wanted to rub it all over myself. 

The only downside is they don't have their liquor license. I know it's so pricey in Vegas, but it really is an overall winner for us alcoholics that live in Vegas. 
They made us margaritas with white wine. It was okay. Pretty sweet and we don't drink sweet drinks. They said they're known for their sangria's, so we'll have to try that instead next time. 

Amazing Mexican and it's a must try in Las Vegas.
