I came here on a work excursion and there were several scared and skeptical folks in the group when surveying the surroundings. Short end of the story is everyone LOVED every dish! I ordered the lengue taco and barabacoa taco. The lengue was savory, tender, and perfectly cooked. The barabacoa was worth killing a diet for seconds and thirds. I ordered a side of the beans and couldn't stop talking about how happy my taste buds were, and then their sadness upon being done. Service was very friendly and efficient, and our party of 11 was able to get in and out in under the hour we needed to meet our appointments. Best street tacos I've had in such a long time! How I didn't discover this place sooner is a regret and loss for me. Yum!
