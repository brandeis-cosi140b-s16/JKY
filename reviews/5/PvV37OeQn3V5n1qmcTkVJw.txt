I issued a challenge to my ex-pro baseball player buddy: Find me the best spot in the area for Southwestern cuisine. NOT Tex-Mex, but true Southwestern. Oh, and it needs to be a "spot I've not tried". He knows I camp out at The Mission and absolutely love the food, so getting close was a challenge. 

Richardson's Cusine of New Mexico is a unique dining spot with an "Old Phoenix" ambiance. It helps that it's also located in "Old Phoenix" and is dark and cozy. I had a special called the Taos Trio or combo. It consisted of Carne Adovado, Bacon wrapped Shrimp and home made spicy sausage with green chili potatoes. Incredible food! Several people ordered the Chilean seabass which I tried and this was also wonderful.

Service was excellent and we really enjoyed dining for 4. Apparently, this place takes no reservations, but uses a call-ahead approach up to about 6:45. We were in Paradise Valley and gave the 10 minute warning and they greeted us as we came in.

Excellent food and really nice people!
