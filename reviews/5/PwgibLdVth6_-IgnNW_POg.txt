Chips and Salsa were delicious!

Enchiladas were fantastic.

I am so happy to have found this little gem. I work down the street and am definitely looking forward to coming here again. The owner was so nice. 

We have been there several times now. Each time the service has been wonderful. There are a few TVs for watching sports. I haven't had a chance to try any of their margaritas, but I'm looking forward to my next trip there.
