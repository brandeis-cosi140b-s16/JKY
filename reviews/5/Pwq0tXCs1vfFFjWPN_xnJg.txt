We accidently found this place while sitting in traffic and starving. I have to say, they have the best soft corn tacos around! We always order the Al Pastor tacos and they are ALWAYS AMAZING! For under $7, you get a basket of chips with salsa, three soft corn tortillas al pastor tacos, rice, hot sauce and great service! Their flan is also homemade and very, very good!
