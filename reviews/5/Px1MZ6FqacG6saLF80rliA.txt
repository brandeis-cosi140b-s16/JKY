Seriously one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in awhile.  This place has been here forever.  Seems like an older husband and wife.  He takes the orders and rings it up at the counter.  He didn't have a cash register or a calculator... .did it all on paper with pencil.  The wife was in the background answering questions- very helpful with the gluten free and vegetarian questions.  Once our order was placed you could hear her beating eggs (for my chili relleno) and the butter melting for cooking.  The food was EXCELLENT.  My husband got a taco and a tamale.  Rice was better than Mexican rice usually is, IMO.  I want to order a dozen tamales for Christmas eve ($20) and they have blue corn that are vegetarian. MMMMM... I will be back!
