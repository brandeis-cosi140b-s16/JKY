It was by accident we ended up here last Saturday night.  It was no accident that we have been back for a total of 3 times in 5 days.  

There is nothing better in LA than getting Carne Asada tacos off the Taco Truck.  And FINALLY we found a place who serves them up right just like em, if not better!  Street tacos are supposed to be small so the smaller size was not a surprise to us.  it was LOADED with meat.  They didn't cheapen it at all!  

Loved the HOT chips and salsa.  It is soo fresh and full of yum!  

The staff is SOOOOO personable.  If anything... the friendliness of this place is worth it.  

The ambiance is what drew us in there.  I love the music and atmospere.

We will be back!  Hold the 2 end spots for us!  ;)
