I have been reading reviews for Pitic for some time now, but have always ended up elsewhere; what a shame!  This place has excellent food and everything is fresh.

The chips and salsa were great!  Chips were fresh out of the fryer and made from handmade tortillas.  The salsas were both very fresh and tasty.  The spicier salsa had just the right amount of kick!

We ordered a combo plate with a taco, tostada and cheese enchilada.  All were wonderful and tasty.  The rice and beans are excellent too (especially the beans!).  Our other order was a carne asada chimichanga, also excellent.  The tortillas they use are wonderful and the chimi was cooked to perfection with a nice outer crust and light crispness on the inside.  The carne asada was seasoned and cooked to perfection.

It is located in an old strip mall that looks like it has seen better days for sure, but don't judge by looks alone!  It is in very close proximity to Carolina's if you are familiar with them.

Give it a try, I bet you will wonder why you didn't sooner like I did!
