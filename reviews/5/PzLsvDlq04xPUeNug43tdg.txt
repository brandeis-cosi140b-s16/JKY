If your ever in Chandler and Happen to notice this little Mexican Restaurant on the SE Corner of McClintock and Chandler Blvd, please try them out.  This place was recommended to me today and we tried them out and its Fantastic!  It may not look like one of these corporate chain restaurants on the outside or inside, but what they serve Taste Really Great with lots of Flavor!  You can dine inside or out on their Patio.  I noticed they recently applied for a Liquor License (sign posted), so I'm not sure if they served now or not.
