Mark us down as more California expats who have been confused for years why it's so hard to find a restaurant-style Mexican food in this valley that lives up to our standards. Not cheapie take-out chains, not little specialty places, and not restaurants that need you to be tipsy before you taste. We've had very good sit-down meals in CA, AZ, UT and CO, but NV has let us down pretty consistently over the past ten years.

El Mescal lives up, though. We'll be back again and again.
