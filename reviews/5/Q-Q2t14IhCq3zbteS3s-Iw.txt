Wow what a dining experience. My husband and I have lunch and dinner at the Commissary Friday. We are still talking about the food, but much more incredible the  staff and our new favorite Chef, Chef Chris! We thought we would check out this new celebrity Chef offering by Richard Sandoval's Commissary. We walked in and where very impressed with the vibe the Commissary has. We looked around for a couple minutes before we went to the window to order some food. We where greeted by a very nice young girl who took our order, she couldn't have been nicer. My husband ordered the Cuban, and I had the soup. O my goodness that was the most incredible soup I have ever eaten. We where waiting on our order that's when we where greeted by Chef Chris, he was a very nice young man. He asked us where we lived and how long we have been in town, he spoke to us as if we where old friends, before we knew it our food was ready, we where told he would check on us before we left. We found our seats, my husband told me to taste his sandwich it was delicious. I'm not a big pork fan but I will say it was to die for, my soup was so balanced in flavor  it was spicy tomato bisque!  It was the best soup ever! Chef came over to see how our meal was. We told him how great everything was. We chatted for a few minutes he asked us to come back anytime and ask for him, it's service like this that makes a dining experience so much more then a meal. Chef Sandoval you have a great Chef at the Commissary, we are so happy we ate at the Commissary. We came in for dinner that night, Chris was there greeted us by name, needless to say our dinner was just as impressive as our lunch Chef send us over Gelato at no charge. We thanked him, told him we would see him soon! We have a new place we will make our new hang out. Chef Chris thank you for making us more than just guest you treated us like old friends...
