I gotta say that it's hard to find authentic Mexican food in Madison, or in midwest in general. Most ethnic restaurants here are forced to adapt to American liking, i.e. salty meat, over-powering sauce, smothering amount of cheese, etc.

If you like how food is served in Mexico, try this place. Marinating meat is not a common practice--not to mention the non-existence of Burritos!  (that's totally a western thing! although they do have it on the menu.) Not only that they are generous with quality ingredients, they are not stingy about giving you more rice if you ask for it. The atmosphere is pretty chill. For meals at the price of street food stand, this is as good as it can ever be. So stop complaining about the casual atmosphere and learn to appreciate how other culture run their restaurants.

Their salsa bar had incredible selection of salsa with good punch of spiciness. (not the lame toned-down mild salsa typical for midwest appetite) The flavors are incredible.

FYI: We had lengua en salsa verde and bistec mexicana.
