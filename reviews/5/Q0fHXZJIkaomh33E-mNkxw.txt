I was just expecting an average mexican meal due to the looks of the outside.  It is very nice but this place has been so many restaurants like Ned Kelly's and other steakhouses.  Once inside the decor was very nice and the service was great throughout the entire meal.  Warm chips and homemade salsa was served immediately!  Both meals were delicious and very high quality ingredients were used.  My mom raved on the tacos and  the beef and chicken used was so tender and juicy.  I even dreamed about my meal that night it was so good....from the chile relleno to the seasoning in the hamburger on the taco....it was rock star.  I can't wait to go back!
