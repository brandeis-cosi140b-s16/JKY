The food here was excellent.  I went with a coworker for lunch.  The La Tradicion plates (there are about 6-8 of them) are $6.99 for the lunch special.  I had the Chilaquiles con Pollo, which I can best describe as enchilada nachos, and my coworker had the Chimichanga.  The portion sizes were excellent for the lunch special and the food was amazing, we left full and very happy.  The chips are fresh and very tasty as well as the tomatillo salsa, not too spicy, although they do have a red salsa by request that has a little more heat. 

I would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but like another reviewer stated in December, the whole restaurant isn't used.  The food came out fast and service was good.

Don't let the bare parking lot turn you away, they were not busy during lunch, only 4-5 tables, but the food is definitely worth coming for.
