Super nice experience over all, the place really nice,clean, the service really good, she was always checking on us making sure our drinks where always full, but the way the jamaica was delicious it was obviously the real thing not the fake stuff that they always give you other places, I have the chance to try the lobster, shrimp and fish tacos and it was Delicious the fish my favorite,shrimp really good lobster to but a little bit over priced for a person who will eat 5 tacos ( me) lol.... And of course They have a lot more to choose from but definitely is going to be my place to go for fish tacos and real good Jamaica.... Oh and don't forget the dessert you will not be disappointed
