Yummo. Had the all-you-can eat brunch here on a Saturday morning. Between two of us, we ordered about eight or nine of the dishes of the 21 options available. The high points were definitely the steak and eggs, chilaquiles, the frittata, pbj & bacon sandwich and the giant fruit plate (with passionfruit sauce!) that they brought out initially. Everything is made to order, so you get the variety of going to say, a buffet, but also the freshness of eating in a regular restaurant. The service was very friendly as well, so no complaints there. At $35 per person, you definitely need to bring your appetite, but I still would highly recommend.
