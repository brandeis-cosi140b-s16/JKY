The food was very authentic just what my dad and I were looking for. The chorizo cheese fondue is an amazing appetizer! I definitely recommend giving that a try. I had the cheese enchiladas and the sauce was very tasty. For desert I tried the flan which was so delicious, it had a very unique taste! The chef Paco came out to see how our food was, and even talked about some of his recipes that were passed on from his Grandma. Give this place a try you won't be disappointed!
