Absolutely amazing! Pretty much take a guess and pray they are open.. Tried several different weekends and they were on siesta.

Worth the wait! The drive! Whatever sacrifice you need to make, do it.

To give you an idea of how much my honey and I love this place... I am 6 months prego with our first child, you would think he has pictures of me on his phone. Kid you not it is a picture of his burrito at Ritos!
