This place is new, incredibly friendly and not to mention delicious!! I only got to try their sopes dish with carne adobada.. The green guacamole salsa is delish! Would recommend it if you're looking for something that'll "hit the spot" as far mexican food goes!! If I lived here, I'd come see them every day!
