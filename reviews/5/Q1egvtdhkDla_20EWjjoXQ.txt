The only reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because I can't give it 6. I tried Rito's today for the first time and I am extremely impressed.  I got a chimichanga with a side of rice and beans. The beans are hands down the best restaurant refried beans I've ever had. The rice was nice and flavorful and the chimichanga....oh the chimichanga...so delicious that I couldn't stop eating it even when my tummy said no more please. Luckily I live a bit of a distance away from this place or else I'd spend way too much money here. The prices are a little steep to me, but definitely worth it.
