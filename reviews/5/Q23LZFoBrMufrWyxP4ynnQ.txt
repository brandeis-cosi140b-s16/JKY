So so good! We were wandering through the Centennial area and found this awesome restaurant near the freeway exit. We didn't know what to get but our server Rigelio was very very helpful. We got the enchiladas and that you build your own burrito. The cream sauce and the Tinga chicken burrito was delish! I also got the burrito half mole and half cheese cream sauce, enchilada style which was good so I could try two sauces. I live in central Las Vegas but believe me I will be back with more people to try this place :)
