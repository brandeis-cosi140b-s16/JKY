I don't normally rate fast food places, because really, aren't they all kinda the same.  But I was super impressed with them and feel they deserve a good word.  It is a hike if you're coming off the interstate (about 2 miles), but the location was new, fast, friendly, and damn near perfect.  It was also the freshest tasting Taco Bell food I've ever tasted, if that's possible.  If you have to do fast food, it's worth a stop.
