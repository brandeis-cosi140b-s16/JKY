After the previous review,  I was contacted by the owner. I was very impressed by how genially he seemed to care to find out the reason behind the low star rating and eager to fix the issues. This convinced me enough to give this place another shot.

This time I brought my boyfriend with me as well as another couple, the girl of which was there with me on my original trip to this place. 

The reason behind the stars increase was the service. Our server  was very attentive and knowledgeable. He brought me a wine list!!! It turns out they do have one! I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and the rest of the party got margaritas which were delicious!

The food was brought out quickly and was very yummy. We got appetizer trio, I ordered the fish again. This time it was actually grilled and tasted good. The rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food as well. The meal was finished off with Sopapillas!! Although if I could do anything different is add ice cream to dessert, Sopapillas were still great! All this and our bill was very reasonable!

I am a bit baffled by how different my two visits were! Will def go back. Great place and great prices.
