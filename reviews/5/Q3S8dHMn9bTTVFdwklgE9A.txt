Yes, yes, yessssssssssss!!!!

Went with my friends J, M and Z, and we ate it up!  We started with their chips and salsa, and the most amazing squirt bottles of avocado crema that HAD to have jalapeno in there because the spice was utter perfection.  We practically squirted this stuff directly into our mouths (I think Z may have put a bottle in his pocket - kidding, but just barely because this stuff was the shit).

Most of my friends had the steak tacos.  I had one too, but I mixed it up a bit by also getting one chorizo and one lengua taco to break up the steak monotony.  All were so good, with the perfect corn tortillas and the perfect amount of diced onion and cilantro.

Deceivingly large place inside for what it looks like on the outside.  Excellent service.

I will return.  I know my friends will too, if they haven't already, because they're local (and I'm jealous).
