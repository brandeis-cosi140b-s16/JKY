A new favorite! I lived in rural southern Oregon for many years, and mourned the absence of real, home-cooked Mexican food in Pittsburgh when I came here 14 years ago. Things have improved somewhat since then, but I still hadn't found a place that filled that hole - until I came here. 

My significant other and I brought my daughter here for dinner to celebrate her birthday, and relished every bite that was laid in front of us. We started with chips and guacamole - warm out-of-the-fryer chips, not too salty, and fresh guac. Heaven. I had the special - tilapia stuffed with spinach with tequila sauce, a fresh, light sauce with chopped tomatoes that was delectable. S.O. had the seafood stew, which he devoured and said contained the best mussels he'd ever eaten. My daughter chose the fajitas, which she also raved about.

The seating area is small, but we got right in even on a Saturday night, and the staff were super-friendly. We will definitely be back!
