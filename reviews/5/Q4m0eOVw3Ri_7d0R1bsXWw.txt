This place is fantastic if you prefer Mexican food and you are around the university area. The location makes it really convenient to stop by and have lunch with coworkers or colleagues. 

The staff is really friendly but a lot of times they seem to not understand English really well. I think it's a nice touch to a Mexican restaurant and it brings a lot of authentic value. 

I've always been pleased with the food I've received. My favorite dish is the Chicken Ranchero. You get a steaming dish with chicken and ranch covered in generous amount of melted cheese and mushrooms. Alongside it you get another plate with rice and what is suppose to be a salad. It's just some lettuce with a tablespoon of guacamole sauce on it. I would recommend the dish to anyone. 

The outdoor seating is also very nice and quite especially during the day. It could make for a romantic lunch date. 

Prices are very reasonable, you get really generous amounts of food. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the water. Last time I had water it tasted like it was tap water and had a very distinct taste of chlorine. 

This place is great regardless the minor incidences. You should definitely give it a try.
