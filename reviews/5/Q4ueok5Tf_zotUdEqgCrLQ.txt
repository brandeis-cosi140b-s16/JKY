I went recently with a friend after having passed it a few times. We both tried the three taco special and had nothing bad to say about any of them. Their prices are extremely fair, and their churros (2 per order for 2 dollars) are delicious.  

The service was wonderful as well,  as soon as we walked in we were asked if we had been there before,  having not,  she explained the menu and answered all of the questions  we have.  

It was clean and even had some pretty great music playing. 

Our only mild complaint is that the food is very mild.  However,  this isn't an issue as they also have a huge (around 10) array of hot sauces. We will be back for sure.
