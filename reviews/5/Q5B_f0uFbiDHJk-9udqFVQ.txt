Can't even begin to describe how crazy-awesome this place is! It should seriously be considered a controlled substance, cuz I'm completely addicted. The sweet pork (barbacoa) salad is what I would order for a last meal. The tortillas are melt-in-your-mouth fantastic, always freshly cooked & warm. I'm not trying to exaggerate...it's really that yummy. 

When dieting, I go for the grilled salmon salad or the grilled mahi salad...both great options (sans the tortilla, with a very heavy heart). It doesn't taste like diet food at all.

I could eat at Cafe Rio 7 days a week.
