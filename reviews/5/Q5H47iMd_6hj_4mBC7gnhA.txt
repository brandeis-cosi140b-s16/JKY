Im not going to waste anytime with this review. This place is my new favortie Mexican restaurant, period.

Everything was great

I had the Enchilada, Taco and Tamale plate. Excellent! The atmosphere? Excellent! The service? Friendly and..........Thats right. Excellent!

Wife had the steak fajitas and they were great as well.

Extremely spacious parking lot.

Plain and simple, If you dont come and eat here, your missing out!
