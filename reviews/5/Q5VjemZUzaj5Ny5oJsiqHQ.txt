I loved this place!  The waitress was so nice and helpful.  The food was amazing.  The best nachos I've ever  had.  The owner came over to see how everything was.  He seemed very excited about the recent changes and was genuinely interested in our feedback.  I wish I lived closer, but will definitely be back the next time I'm in the area.
