Love this place . I have not ever been disappointed  by the  food . The service here  is top notch ! I had ordered chicken soup with  some rice and it totally  kicked my colds ass!  Weeks back i had ordered  chicken with rice and beans. The beans were something I've never had before ,super delicious! Rice fluffy and flavorful. The chicken was very juicy and tender. If you want good food and great service , come here you will not be let down!
