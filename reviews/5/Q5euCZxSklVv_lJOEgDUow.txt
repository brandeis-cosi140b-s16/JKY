It is always difficult to find a legitimate Mexican food place. I've been to various places, and they have all let me down. There was another restaurant, 'Los Reyes De La Torta', that came close, but this is by far the most authentic Mexican food I have ever eaten (in the States).

The tacos are good. Really good. My absolute favorite, and most often messed up at other establishments, are the cabeza tacos. They really stand out. If you're like tortas, their Cubana is really good too.

Couple that with cheap fold up tables and a nearby Laundromat and you'd swear you're in Mexico (it sure felt that way for me). You can take the experience a step further by drinking from the glass bottle sodas that they have.

I will definitely be back!
