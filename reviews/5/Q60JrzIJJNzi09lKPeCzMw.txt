Azteca has the most giant plates I've ever seen. They are the size of semi truck tires. It's spectacular.

In addition to piling on the food like they're feeding wild animals, it's good quality stuff. There are tons of vegetarian options, and the margaritas are big and cold and sweet and salty...yum!

I've been to Azteca several times, but I'm always surprised by the little sopapillas they bring at the end as a complimentary dessert. Isn't that a wonderful little customer service bonus? You get used to the free nachos at Mexican spots, but the free dessert pushes Azteca over the line from a 4 star to a 5 star for me.

The latest time I went there, I was with a group of about 15 people. We didn't have a reservation, but the staff set us up in the middle of the restaurant with a huge table, and they weren't even grumpy about having to split all our checks. The food is fresh and good, and the staff is friendly and accommodating. It's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, and you can always count on bringing home leftovers for lunch the next day!
