After reading some of the reviews of Cinco, I was very pleasantly surprised on my recent visit for dinner last Saturday night.  I agree with some of the reviews that this place looks more like a bar than a fancy restaurant due to the central bar, and that the seating is not "intimate," but overall I thought it was a nice family-type venue.  Our waitress, Nikki, was friendly and efficient, with an excellent knowledge of the menu items.  Since everything is made to order, she suggested various ways to customize our meals, too, which was greatly appreciated by my very picky dining companion.  Nikki checked back with us frequently, refilled drinks and chips without having to be asked, and went out of her way to see to it that we enjoyed our meal.  The homemade chips and salsa we ordered were very good, not like the pre-packaged kind you get for free at most Mexican restaurants, and well worth the additional small cost, especially since they were refilled.  The menu is diverse, leaning toward Mexican cuisine instead of tourist food, the chef obviously well-versed in various regional foods and quite adept at producing unusual and flavorful combinations.  Even the refried beans were exceptionally good.  Our meals were artfully plated, the food of excellent quality, came quickly, and the portion sizes were large.  The prices are appropriate for the amount and quality of the food.  There were so many fascinating, unusual choices on the menu that I can't wait for another visit to try out additional entrees. Overall, Cinco was a very pleasant dining experience that I would recommend to anyone.  I hope it builds a clientele and stays around for a long time to come.
