I grew up in Southern California, so the majority of southern "Mexican" restaurants have been AWFUL. Sabor, however, is bucking that trend. 

One can judge a Mexican restaurant by their tacos alone. If you order tacos and they come out like a nicer version of Taco Bell, run! This is where Sabor shines, their tacos autenticos are just like the street tacos I ordered in TJ (Tijuana) as a kid. AMAZING. 

This is our go to Mexican joint in Charlotte. PERIOD.
