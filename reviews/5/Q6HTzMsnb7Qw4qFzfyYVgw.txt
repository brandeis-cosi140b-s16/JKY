Ive been here a number of times now and can safely say its one of my favorite tex mex restaurants in town. To me its Mexican with a texas kick. its not your traditional Mexican menu. I like that! 
Mixed drinks are great, Ive tried a couple and im not a mixed drink kinda guy. but ill do it here.
I don't know why manzettis (if that's how you spell it) didn't make it. the layout of this place is perfect in my book. 
Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. if they tell you its good it is.
