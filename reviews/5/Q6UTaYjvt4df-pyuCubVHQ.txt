We are never in Phoenix for more than 24 hours without stopping at this world class Mexican restaurant. Where to start? Cheese crisps - for some reason they don't seem to exist outside of Arizona. Green corn tamales to die for. Chimichanga the size of a football. Guacamole is absolutely the best. We've been coming here since the 1970's. There was a time in the 1980s when they showed up in a guidebook and became too trendy, so we'd just have to take out. Now they're back to being a fine neighborhood spot.
