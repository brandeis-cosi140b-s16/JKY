The owner/chef is very friendly! The tacos are absolutely bomb especially their Al pastor and tripa. They make it really crispy and juicy so you could taste the full flavor. They have a mini food cart every Wednesday to Saturday and it makes it more authentic. Inside, they have homemade ice cream with tons of flavors! Our favorite in the office is the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE ice cream. It's a definitely must try.
