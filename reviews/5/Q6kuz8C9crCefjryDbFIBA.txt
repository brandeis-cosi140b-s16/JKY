This is my second visit to this place.   Both times were well above average.   The service is top notch.   Several employees would asked if I was Ok.   My server was Jose.   He works in the bar area.   Jose kept my soda full.   The food proportions are just right,  and tasty.   This restaurant is fully renovated.   I understand that they have only been open for a few weeks.  I would really recommend stopping by if you are looking for something a little different.
