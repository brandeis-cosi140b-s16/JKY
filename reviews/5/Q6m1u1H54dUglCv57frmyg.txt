AMAZING!!! I am a native from Guadalajara and this place has the food down to the spice!! Very flavorful and very spicy!! Just the way it should be. I had the chilaquiles verdes, just the right amount of spice. The salsa that comes with the chips is also delicious. If you like spicy you'll love this place. Will bring my friends here definitely...Ai Jalisco no te rajes!!
