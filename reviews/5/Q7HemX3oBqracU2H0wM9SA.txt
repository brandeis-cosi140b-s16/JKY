This is my 5th time here and I am a huge fan. I always get the "create your own" on soy paper with spicy tuna. OMG it is amazing lol to me, but I'm sure it sound plain and boring to you ha ha ha but don't worry they have a lot of other yummy things to choose from. 

I really enjoy the concept of this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and over all always have a great experience here. 

Heads up, be prepared to wait in a line for your yummy order because it does get busy BUT don't worry... it will be all worth it. We did come here a couple of time with 16 of our basketball players and boyyyyyyyyyyyyy we take up the whole restaurant. So if you're coming with a big party, plan ahead.   

Location is in a dark area but I'm glad it's near Tarkanian Basketball gym. Great place to grab a bite before and after my games. 

Enjoy!!!
