THE BEST TACO PLACE IN VEGAS. THE ONLY PLACE BETTER IS GOING TO MEXICO!!!!

I discovered this place on Saturday and I have been there 3 times already (it's only Tuesday). I drove from my job at Town Square to the one behind Encore just to have lunch. Took 3 co-workers with me and they all agree.

You can bring your own beer. They dont sell beer. Security will simply hand you a brown bag for your drink!

The only thing missing is a big pot of home made beans.
