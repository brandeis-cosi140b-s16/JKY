The original El Molino was established like 80 years ago in downtown Phoenix near 22nd St. & Jefferson.  Grandson Richard Carbajal, Jr. carries on the family recipes and tradition: authentic food at very reasonable prices.  The machaca is always great and I've asked them to ship their award-winning tamales to friends in the far reaches of the known universe.  Their standard hot sauce is of the thin persuasion but very satisfying and their salsa fresca will clear out your sinuses in a hurry!

Grab a couple dozen tamales on your way to that holiday pot luck, and you'll be the center of attention!  Heck, Richard will cater the whole event at a price you can brag about.
