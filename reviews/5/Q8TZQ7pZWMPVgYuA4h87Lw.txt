Well worth the wait. Been talking about coming to this place since it opened. Stepped in in today with my wife and were seated immediately. The waitress Brenda was an absolute doll. Very sweet. The food was excellent. The margaritas we ordered were very potent. Needless to say, we will be coming back here. Thursday's are half price margaritas which sounds like a dangerous invitation to me. See you there yelpers!!
