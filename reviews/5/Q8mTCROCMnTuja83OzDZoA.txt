This place really impressed me. I was not expecting a whole lot but wow! I love the margarita menu...had the blood orange and the guava which were both sooo good! Also, love that they had a bunch of vegan options!!! The service in the bar (by Chelsea) was really great! She even went out of her way to wright what we had and the date on our to go containers!!! Honestly we go out to eat a lot, and this was the best service we have had in Vegas, including trips to the strip! Thanks Chelsea! We will be back. Loved the food, loved the service!!!
