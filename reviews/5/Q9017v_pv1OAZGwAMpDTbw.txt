Paco's tacos , what can I say , let me start with staff , very attentive without being intrusive for example  they replace the chips even though we were not done with it and gave us a fresh batch hot out of the oven , speaking of chips , they very crispy and well seasoned . appetizers and entr√©e's  were delicious . I would go . 2 thumbs up.
