My husband and I just went here tonight, for our first night away from our baby in a year and a half!! We're industry locals and we're pleasantly surprised to know that we would be receiving half off of our bill because of that... the food, service and drinks were all excellent! We sat at the bar.. I can't remember our bartenders name, but she was a pretty girl with short brown hair.. excellent
