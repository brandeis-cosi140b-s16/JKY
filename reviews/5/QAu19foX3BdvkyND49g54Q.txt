This place is so awesome. They have taco bell prices (maybe even cheaper), but real quality, flavorful Mexican food. It could be from a restaurant and I wouldn't know the difference. You can get a taco plate with two tacos (soft), beans and rice for 2.99 and it tastes amazing. NOT like fast food at all. Last night I got a chile rellano and a tostada for $3. For the prices here and the food quality, I can't give it less than 5 stars. Boyfriend and I go several times a week. Anyone who doesn't like this place is nuts. Real Mexican food, amazing flavors and the prices are as low as it gets.
