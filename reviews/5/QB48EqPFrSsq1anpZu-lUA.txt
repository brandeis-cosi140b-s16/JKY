This place has always given me great food, great drinks and great customer service! Tonight I indulged in an appetizer that is just as good for a meal, the Queso Guillermo. I get it with the Machomos, the seasoned crispy beef, squeeze a few limes on the meat and smother it with the bubbly cheese and pico de gallo. Sooo Good! 

Our waitress this evening even brought me an extra helping of the seasoned beef at no extra charge because I mentioned how the first time I ordered it to split with a friend that they piled it on the dish. That was because the first time we were sharing the appetizer as a meal.

The restaurant always looks clean, I wouldn't eat anywhere that was unsanitary and I've eaten next to the pond during the day and in the evening and I have never smelled any duck poop smell!
