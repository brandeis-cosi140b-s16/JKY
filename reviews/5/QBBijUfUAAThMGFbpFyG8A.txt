The food from this place is just fantastic.  I should preface this by saying that I have never been to the restaurant itself, and have just been the happy recipient of takeout.  Some of my fellow coworkers made it fairly clear that unless you're Mexican, you shouldn't be showing your face here, so they'd go pick up food for everyone and bring it back.  Just very simple and delicious Mexican food, great stuff.
