Yumm, yumm, yummy !!!!

 This place is right downt he street from me, and last night i finally stopped for a bite after i got off work.  And im sooo glad i did.

This place is amazing and super authentic, which sometimes is hard to find.  

I got a bean and cheese burrito (extra cheese) and my mom got 5 carne asada tacos.  So good and fresh and hot.  

I will def. go back.  Highly recomend :)
