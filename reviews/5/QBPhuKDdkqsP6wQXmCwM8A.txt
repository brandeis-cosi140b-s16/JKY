So far, the best Mexican food I have had in Las Vegas.  I go to Casa Don Juan's whenever I get the chance, which is not often as it is located in very seedy downtown.  In an area of less than sightly individuals and bail bonds offices (which should tell you something) this place is a gem.  I have had numerous items on the menu and I keep coming back to the Carnitas, not only because I am a huge pork fan, but they do it right here.  The pork is always very flavorful and fork tender; it comes served with rice, beans, pico de gallo and guacamole.  The tortillas and guacamole are made in house, as well as the salsa and they are all excellent.  I thoroughly enjoy the food at Casa Don Juan and the only thing I would change is the location.
