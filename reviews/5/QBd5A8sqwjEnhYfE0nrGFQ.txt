Came here at 2am and for $13 I got a fried chicken breast with gravy, jalepeño coleslaw,  a brick sized piece of jalepeño cornbread, and a sweet potato waffle. The portion was huge and everything was delicious, I felt the coleslaw could have used more dressing. The manager, Josue, was polite, and very friendly. They have a full bar, which I have nothing to say about since it was after 2am. Working in bars, this will definitely be my post 2am go to spot. The food, both in portion and quality, is worth way more than $13. Don't pass this place up.
