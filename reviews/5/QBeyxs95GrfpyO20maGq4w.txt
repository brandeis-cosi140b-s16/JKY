I work in the arcadia area from time to time and do not have much time for lunch... This place has the very best street tacos carne asada. Only one server in the joint and she busts her hump(literally she is pregnant) working in there... the tacos are to die for.. always crunchy meat and perfect onions & cilantro... the price is unbeatable and food is prepared very fast so you are not late getting back to work... I wish there was a Tortas El Rey in Mesa!!!    yumm!
