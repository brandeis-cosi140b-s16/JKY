I think most people are to hard on Macayo's.  The great thing about Phoenix is that there is so many great mexican food places, so sometimes Macayos gets the shaft.  The thing is they are good.  The salsa and chips are very good, in fact by the end of dinner we usually go through 2 bowls.  My favorite appitizers are the Red Corn Chicken Taquitos.  These are fantastic!  They are chicken taquitos topped with Baja sauce.  I really like most of their dishes, but my favorite is the chicken poblano.  It is a poblano stuffed with shredded chicken, fried and topped with relleno sauce and baja sauce.  I highly recommend it.  I live in California, where the mexican food is sub par at best.  I can't wait to go back to Macayo's and stuff myself.
