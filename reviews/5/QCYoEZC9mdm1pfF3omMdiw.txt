I've eaten at the Javier's in Newport, Irvine, Cabo San Lucas and now Vegas!!!!

Javier's is by far my favorite upscale Mexican restaurant!!! Anything and everything you order is excellent and you can't go wrong!

The decor is beautiful with the dark wood and thick rope draping across the restaurant. 

Margaritas are on point, my favorite being the Pepino (cucumber) Margarita!

I seriously LOVE this restaurant!!!!
