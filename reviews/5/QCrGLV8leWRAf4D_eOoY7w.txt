We decided to go to this place when the other place we were going to hit was closed.  But boy were we happy we did!!!  This little Mom & Pop joint (maybe grandparents is a better description) has AMAZING food!!!  My friend and I were hungry and everything looked so good!  I had a chimichanga and a chili relleno and my friend had a combo with an enchilada, taco and a tostada.  Everything was soooooo good!  The relleno was AMAZING;  so was everything else!  The rice and beans were also EXCELLENT!!!  The rice is not red, super yummy and flavorful.  I don't even usually eat beans at other places, but they were SO good here!!!  I just can't get over how good the food was!

The cute couple that run this place is super nice and inviting.  And they remember you.  A younger guy was there picking up a to-go order and the 'mom' told him she put in extra tortillas and salsa cuz his Dad always wants that, but it wasn't asked for in the order.  SO NICE!!!!  There is not a lot of room inside, and it was stuffy, so we went outside.  They told us they would tap on the window when our food was ready!  :)  The only drawback was they don't serve alcohol, but when the food was that good, I didn't even miss it!  If you want a beer, take the food to go! Its totally worth it!!!  I wish I didn't live in CO; will definately come back when I visit again!!!
