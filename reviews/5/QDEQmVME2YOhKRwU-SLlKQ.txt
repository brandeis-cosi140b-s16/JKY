We jumped right on the bandwagon and visited OTB on National Margarita Day.  This location had a 45 minute wait, but we saw friends and coworkers also waiting or table so time flew by.  Because the margaritas were $1 one server was running drinks to support the entire waitstaff, and I don't recall waiting more than a few minutes for another margarita.  

I couldn't post the review without complimenting OTB's salsa; two varieties to please most and both rich in flavors.  MMMM MMMM!
