Love their food. I come here for cheap birria with rice on the weekends. Their tacos are really good. My favorite is their tripa tacos because they make it crispy. As for their desserts, they have a wide variety of ice cream, paletas, and sherbets. Their agua fresas are homemade and if you dine in, they will give you a refill. Their food is seasoned well from costillas, to the carne asada, to their homemade quesadillas. They have the friendliest employees that are eager to help you!
