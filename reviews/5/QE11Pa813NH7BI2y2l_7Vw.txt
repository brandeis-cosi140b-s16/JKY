Went back a second time and still yummo!
We'd forgotten that they make you fresh chips when you get there. That was such a great surprise. I hope I forget every time we go! :)
This time I had the Chilli Rellenos. They were good, a little bland, but there are lots of salsa options to help spice it up.

We're going back. For sure.
