WOW. You know when you just keep repeating, "WOW. WOW. WOW," and got nothing much else to say while you're eating. That was me. This place is HANDS DOWN the BEST Mexican I've had EVER. 

That's a super bold statement. I am crowning this place as the spot that beats all the "fancy" or "sit-down" Mexican restaurants in California. And you know, California does it damn good. 

Tortilla chips with trio of salsa- 5 star. Chips were fresh, didn't have the nasty oil smell or favor, and the red/habanero salsa was delicious. 

Steak and Shrimp fajita plate- 7 stars. Yeah, that good, that it's beyond the 5 star scale. The steak was marinated in this AMAAAAZING flavor. Shrimp was the "good" kind, that's big, and not the frozen stuff that you buy with the tail already off. 

Chorizo Queso Fundido- 7 stars. OH MY GOD. SO FREAKING GOOD. 

Buffalo Wings - 3.5 star. Who gets buffalo wings at a Mexican restaurant? Yeah, losers like myself who are on a no carb diet. Uh, yeah, I did cheat on the chips a tad bit. I was impressed that they managed to keep the crunch of the wings despite the plenty buffalo sauce. It was a bit dry and on the small side hence the knockdown of stars. 

Ambiance- 5 star. WHO GIVES A CRAP if it's next to a strip club. The decor inside is so beautiful and well done. I think it's a great date spot. 

I'll be coming back more when I can stuff my face with carbs, aka, beans, rice, tortilla, enchilada, burritos, etc.
