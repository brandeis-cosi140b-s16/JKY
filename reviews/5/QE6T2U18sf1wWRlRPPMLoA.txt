Being a native Californian (Los Angeles area) I'm always on the hunt for decent hole in the wall Mexican. I now live in TN where the mexicam is sad. Polibertos - I feel like I have come home!

I primarily judge a place on its carne asada burritos. I ordered one specifically basic to taste the quality of each component. Meat,  beans, rice, cheese. I must say I was impressed when I saw my roll waiting for my pickup at the counter. The tortilla was fresh and perfectly cooked. The carne asada was seasoned and chopped to perfection. The beans were real refried beans and the cheese was straight forward cheddar (which I expect). Even though this roll was sizable I actually contemplated getting another one because my taste buds were in heaven. 

Everything about this place met and exceeded my expectations for a hole in the wall,  walk up counter joint. The salsa bar had great selection and all 4 salsas I tried were delish! 

Take a pass on other trendy or restaurant places of you are craving some real tasty food!

I'll be back the next time I'm in town!
