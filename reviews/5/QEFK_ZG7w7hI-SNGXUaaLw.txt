Delicious and my go-to when only a good Mexican meal will do.  The atomosphere is friendly and lively without being boisterous and annoying.  The servers and staff are always friendly.  I love their flautas and their beans!  My only complaint....the salsa is so spicy!!  But I still eat it cuz it's so good!!!
