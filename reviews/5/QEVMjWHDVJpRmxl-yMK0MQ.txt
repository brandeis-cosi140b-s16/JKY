GREAT food, legit fresh flavor.  Funky hole-in-the-wall locale.

Pretty much ToGo type of place.  Likely the host restaurant for the mobile Taco Hut that is parked out front.

Hard to find / easy to miss, unless you know what you're looking for.  

The new OPEN sign caught my mind, so I said "what the heck?"

Limited menu, but it's all prepared freshly.  English is clearly a second language, but have some fun and roll with it.

Prices could be a little lower, especially given the Spartan conditions; but, I'd go back.

Given the dearth of decent restaurants on Wilkinson, truly stands out.  

Parking doesn't seem to be a problem.
