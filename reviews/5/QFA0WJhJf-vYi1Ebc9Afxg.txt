If Chino's had a location in Los Angeles, it would make a killing.  Styrofoam casual, inexpensive, and packed with flavor.  I don't know if fusion food can be said to be "authentic," but the menu here is so personal and potent, it tastes like an undiscovered national cuisine.  I no longer live in Phoenix but make a special effort to eat here anytime I visit.
