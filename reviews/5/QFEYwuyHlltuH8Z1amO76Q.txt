A few months ago, I was fortunate to be in the valley of the sun for a visit. 

I live in this cold place up north now. I am cold and I complain about the temperature and the food.

La Barquita is the food that most represents what I miss the most in Arizona. Warm, unpretentious, inexpensive, honest and good.

In September I noticed that they painted the walls and got new linoleum and I thought back a few years before and remember Lupe dreaming about new linoleum, since the floor was stained by the previous owner. The new linoleum is a victory for all who love really good food.

Oh? And Rosita's? Someone I read actually wrote a review saying Rosita's was better? Are you high honey? Rosita's is a 3* uses store bought tortillas and microwaved a few of my taco plates too many. They have a big empty bar with a couple of coyote looking guys and one of my friends likes the shrimp tacos so I went there a few times but the microwave thing and the atmosphere are a bit rough.
La Barquita is a MUCH better restaurant if you have taste buds or some understanding. 
Where else in town can you get Huevos Divorciados or Birria or gordonoz fritz? This is the place.

I want a La Barquita  red chili pork plate! I can't get it here -they always make it with beef and only a few places I have discovered actually make tortillas from scratch, all of them a cold train ride away.
