I'm a huge fan of Zaba's and a firm believer that it is far superior to Chipotle, Cafe Rio or any other similar restaurant for several reasons: 

- There's WAY more options - white AND brown rice, yellow AND sweet potatoes, shrimp AND fish tacos, steak AND shredded beef, quesadillas AND nachos, wheat AND flour tortillas.
- The owners are friendly locals. This isn't part of a national franchise, so support your community! 
- Lastly: the cilantro-walnut pesto. It's refreshing, rich and one of the best things I've added to a taco.
