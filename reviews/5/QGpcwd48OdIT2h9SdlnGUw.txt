We were shopping at Lowe's and needed lunch and found Señor Taco in the same parking lot. I wasn't excited for another 'berto experience but it was convenient enough. The wife got carne asada fries and I got the California Surfing burrito (surf and turf) because of the mentions of it in the Yelp reviews. Holy wow, was it delicious, and way to big, even for this big appetite. Very tasty combination with quality fresh shrimp, carne asada, guac and a chipotle sauce. Oh and fries! Yup, there were fries in it too and they were a great addition. Señor Taco isn't close to my home in the Tuke, but we'll be back to try more dishes. 
Ps, the wife's carne asada fries were really good too. Huge portion that required a to go box.
