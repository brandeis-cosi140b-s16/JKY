Dang. I've never been to a chipotle as fun as this one. The clerks have fun behind the counter and are super nice to talk to. Service was quick, and they provide niiiiice sized portions.

Staff has personality. They want to hear about your day, so if you're an antisocial cretin, go to another Chipotle.

A+
