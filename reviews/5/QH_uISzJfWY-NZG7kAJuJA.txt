This is by far the best Mexican Food restaurant in the Phoenix area. I have a gluten intolerance and chef Carlos ALWAYS takes wonderful care of me and my family when we're in. This is more than a restaurant, it's a dining experience! I suggest ordering the Chavez Enchilada next time! It's a gluten free, extra spicy green enchilada. Also, the corn tamales are to die for!
