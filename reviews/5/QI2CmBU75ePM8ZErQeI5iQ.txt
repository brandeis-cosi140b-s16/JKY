This place is incredible! Truly a hidden gem!!! You definitely can't judge a book by its cover... although the exterior may not be easy on the eyes the inside of this place you can tell is very well maintained and clean. I been here a few times and must say no complaints the staff is amazing and super friendly! I've tried many dishes and have yet to be disappointed! Chicken enchiladas with rice and beans are my go to but the super chicken sandwich w/French fries is also one of my top favs!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place to everyone and their mothers!
