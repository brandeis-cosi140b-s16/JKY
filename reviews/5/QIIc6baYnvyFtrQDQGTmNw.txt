WOW...  El Magnifico!!!

Best new place I've experienced in years...  Staff was very courteous & friendly.   

The food was very very good, fresh & delivered exactly shown on the menu...  Which I've never experienced.

The staff was attentive but never overly intruding!  

A must experience for yourself.... We'll be driving back again from Summerlin to this great find on Yelp!!!
