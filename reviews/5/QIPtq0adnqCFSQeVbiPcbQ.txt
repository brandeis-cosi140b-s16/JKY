Came here last night, but i have visted this location many times.   Friendly Place with very quick service. Chips and salsa and bean dip are served before the meal..     The bean dip is excellent!                   Salsa is good, just a little too much cilantro.  Our meals very very good. We even ate everything. Though it was a lot of food for sure.   Sauses are nice and spicy but, not overwhelming.                                            FIsh and shrimp very good. The enchilada was light, almost like a  crepe. We will difinitely go back. Lots of parking. Open late on Sunday till 9pm/
