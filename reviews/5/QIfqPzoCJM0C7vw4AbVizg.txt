It's a chain, so if you've been to one you've been to them all. This one in particular involves a higher than usual wait time is the only thing that would differentiate it from other Rubio's. If you are familiar with Rubio's don't read on: it's a good one, though you have to wait for it. If you haven't been to Rubio's read on.

Forget everything you think you know about chains, Rubio's defies every myth. These are the bomb-diggity of the fish taco market. I'm serious, if you're eating fish tacos at a taco truck right now becaue you think coming to Rubio's isn't "authentic" or "selling out" you're missing out. I love taco trucks in Arizona, my favorite Mexican restaurant in the world is a taco truck in Tucson (Nene's), but for fish tacos I will say that I have yet to come across one that I would take over Rubio's-- honestly.

These babies are fresh, they're flavorful, and no they're not del taco price, but they're not breaking the bank either. On a budget? Just get a burrito, same fish tacoey goodness in a titan-sized package. Their salsas taste like the real deal, I recommedn the tomatillo, but try them all. I prefer flour tortillas, but the corn is good here. Unlike your taco trucks, you have choices, and the best news? They're all good choices. 

Still skeptical? Come on a Tuesday, try them for just 1.50 each, and thank me later when you're coming back here on a Wednesday just because. 

And yes, all this from a chain!
