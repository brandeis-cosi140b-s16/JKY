Pulling out of Home Depot, Habaneros caught my eye. Pulling up I commented to my wife how clean the place looked. Reading the menu I liked all the choices and the prices. However, the best part of the whole experience was the food. Not overly sodium laden like the other taco chain that you see everywhere. Definitely going to make this a permanent spot on my list of places to eat.
