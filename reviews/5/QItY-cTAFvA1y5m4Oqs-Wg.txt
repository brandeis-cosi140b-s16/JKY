I am an AVID chipotle lover and this one is one of my favorites. The food is always cooked to perfection, the staff is fast, friendly and clean. I have gone into a couple of chipotles where I felt like they don't clean their station and the food is all mixed together. This is not one of them. I have never had a bad experience with this chipotle and we are there at least once a week.  Awesome job Indian Bend Chipotle! You know what you are doing!
