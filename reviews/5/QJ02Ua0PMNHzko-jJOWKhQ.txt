Like a 4.47 rounded all the way up because the Lakers are on a 4-game winning streak. 

I came to China Poblano during its opening week. A couple feet ahead of me, at the front of the restaurant, was Big Papi himself: Jose Andres. Wearing baby blue, tweeting from his Blackberry, eating what looked like every single dish on the menu, teaching his three daughters (who were sitting in descending order by height) how to use chopsticks - how cute.     

Anyway, the food. The bottom-line for me at any restaurant is the final product. The flavors, the textures, the temperature contrasts, all the good shit, working in unison to evoke memories or tell new stories. Value, ambiance, service - that stuff's nice, too - but I'm not going to knock off stars from any restaurant if the waitress didn't fill my cup of coffee six times, or if I couldn't understand the gibberish coming out of the Filipino waitress' mouth. Notably, the ambiance and service at this restaurant were super-chill (like, 5/5 chill). 

Having said that, the food here was generally very good, too. (We ordered the guacamole, fried potatoes with XO, chicken mole tacos, the lemon-tree shrimp, and some other stuff I can't remember right now. The ocean nest was fine, too.) The dessert menu didn't excite me, but the drinks made up for it (salt air margarita and the sal de gusano margarita). Also, Jose was gangster enough to get out of his seat (during his meal!) to make sure I had a good time. Check it out.
