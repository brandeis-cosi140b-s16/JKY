GREAT PLACE!  We ate here last weekend and the food was delicious and service was amazing!  And I feel horrible because I can't quite remember our servers name, I think it was Chris, last name started with a G.  He was great!  We gave our compliments to the manager and she was just as nice.  I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back!
