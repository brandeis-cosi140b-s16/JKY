After five visits, we are convinced that Don Jose's has the best value in Mexican food in the Sun City area.  Today we enjoyed a taco salad with pork, cheese & onion enchiladas, and rice. All were hot, delicious, and with ample portions. Free salsa bar with good selection of seasonings. 
Wide selection of regular and adult beverages. 
The owner is usually present to ensure quality food and service. 
We'll continue to come back. 
Sincerely,
Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ
