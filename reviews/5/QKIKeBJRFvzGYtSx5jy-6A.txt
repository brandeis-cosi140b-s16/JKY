My parents take me here when I come to visit, quality has been consistently good and food is the same as the location on Main that just closed. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. My parents go there so often they know everyone there and the chips & salsa keep flowing. I order 2 soft beef taco combo, the meat is ground, although i think you can order shredded. Food is Tex-Mex, not to be confused or compared to authentic Mexican.
