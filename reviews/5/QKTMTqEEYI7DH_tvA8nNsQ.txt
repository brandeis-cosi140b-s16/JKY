First timers. I enjoyed the food and the service was great. Girl at the register asked how everything was when we were done : ) 

I indulged in the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Chicken was fresh and the black beans were good too. Wasn't a huge fan of the rice. Just lacked a certain flavor for me. 

My husband got the chicken street tacos which were really good too. He added extra salsa from the salad bar because he loves his salsa. The tomatillo salsa was my absolute favorite. I added it to my enchiladas. It was perfect. I'll definitely eat here again : )
