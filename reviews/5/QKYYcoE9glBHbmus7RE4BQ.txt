I love Roberto's! The fact that they are open 24 hours makes it my number 1 choice after a night out. The California burrito, rolled tacos and carne asana burrito are my favorites. Very fast service and such a great value! I will probably never go to chipotle or qdoba again after discovering Roberto's.
