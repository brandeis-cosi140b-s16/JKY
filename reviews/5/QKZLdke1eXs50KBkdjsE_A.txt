Comparing to "other" Taco Bells, this is one of the best I have been too.  The store is clean, the menu offers all the usual Taco Bell foods, and the staff is generally friendly.  From the items I have ordered from the menu, I haven't had any issue where portions were less than expected.  Likewise with special orders made like "easy onion" or "no red sauce," I have yet to return an item to the counter to have it fixed.  So overall I give it five stars.
