I first read all of these reviews before I came here and I was quite nervous. But what I don't understand is WHY does this restaurant have these bad reviews. We had the sweetest waitress who greeted us almost immediately and was able to tell us about all their specials. We started off with just classic margaritas, and for being just "house" they were fantastic. Next we went with the queso dip and coconut shrimp for appetizers- WOW. all the food we tried that night was phenomenal. Tacos were 2$ all night long, so we tried many. The atmosphere was very inviting and fun for all ages during the evening. And as it got later the dj started and it turned into almost like a club. I had a blast and would recommend anyone in the Scottsdale area to visit.
