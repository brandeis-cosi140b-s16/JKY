I have eaten at various Chuy's locations for about 20 years.
I will eat at Chuy's about 5 times in the next 7 days.

Street Tacos are awesome.  
I like to order 2 Street Fish and 2 Street Pork tacos.
I love the Street Shrimp, but they come with nasty lettuce so I order cabbage instead.

The Chicken Fajitas rock, Margy's rock.


Its just a great place to eat. Day or Nite.
