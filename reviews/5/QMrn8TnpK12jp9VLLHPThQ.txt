Best Mexican food that I have enjoyed in a long time. Chips and salsa are fresh. Margaritas are strong, delicious, and 3$! The plates are filling and flavorful, the specialties are always a winner. Service is great, but I also don't expect servers to kiss my  bum. Feels like your in Mexico, without the drug lords, food is always good when I come! Mmmm good, that's all I can say.
