Best Sunday Brunch in Scottsdale! What a fun atmosphere!! Unlimited bottomless mimosas add to the fun too!
Jose makes the best Omelets! We are from California & eat super healthy & it was SO COOL that Jose was able to make our egg white Omelets with No oil, made them super lean & yet... Still best omelette anywhere!

Try the blueberry barbecue square Also. Never heard if this before & now can't live without it ;) thanks guys!

Thanks Destiny for being super fun as out waitress today!! Xo
