This is brand new restaurant in the master plan of Vistancia in Peoria,  AZ and is touted as mexican comfort food.  Today was my first visit to the Blu Agave and WOW! I was very impressed.  I had the Grilled Chicken Torta and it was yummy :).  Great mix of flavors and the bun was super fresh and super delish.  For dessert my collegues and I tried the Tres Leches Creme Brulee and it was also incredible.  Looking forward to my next visit and plan on bringing a group of my foodie friends.  Thanks Blu Agave!!
