I'm so HAPPY that North Scottsdale finally has a GREAT mexican restaurant!!!!
Everything I have had here, I love!  A list of items we have ordered:
Arizona Burrito, Chicken and beef tacos, bean and cheese burritos, cheese enchiladas, chicken soft tacos.... EVERYTHING is tasty and perfect! Flavor in every bite! We eat here all the time. 
The employees are friendly and the owner Freddie is such a great, caring, friendly guy!!!!
