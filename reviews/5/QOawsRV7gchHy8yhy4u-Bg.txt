I concur with Michael J. Found this place about a year ago and we are addicted. THERE IS NO PLACE BETTER FOR "AL PASTOR"! NONE. We have tried a few other things on the menu, and have not been disappointed. But frankly, thats what we go there for: Tacos al pastor.  We have even moved out of the area and come up with every excuse in the book to come back. It is well worth the hike if you are not close. Authentic. Rich. Flavorful.
