The food was great. We had Asada fries and carnitas burrito. The guacamole was perfect just as I love it giving my fries a kick and making me not get my hands off the chips. I had the BCC Margarita it was highly delicious, I am a beer girl and also loved there were good beer options (mainly local, always a plus in my book). But better than the food and drinks? The service. The owner of the place made sure we felt welcome and continuously checked on us. I will definitely come back again when in town. And recommend this place to everyone.
