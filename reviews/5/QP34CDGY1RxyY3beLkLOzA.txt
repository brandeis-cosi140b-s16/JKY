Bottom line - Best place to see live music in the Valley.  Why?  Excellent booking of both old and new artists.  Places to sit and stand. Food and drinks are great.  Prices are reasonable. Sound is excellent.   As a former New Yorker who used to traverse the rock clubs of NYC on a weekly basis for many years, this is the only club in the Valley that comes close to anything like a real big city music venue. Obviously many others feel the same way.
