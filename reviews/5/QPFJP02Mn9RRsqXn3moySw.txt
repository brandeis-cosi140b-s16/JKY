Visited Vegas this last weekend.  I had to stop into Yolo's, as it is my place to go while I'm there.  Of course they didn't disappoint.  Not only do they make me feel welcome while I'm there, but they were doing it for all the other customers at the bar.  It has a very positive atmosphere and the staff is very inviting.  My group enjoyed margaritas, shots, and some food.  We were well taken care of and our drinks were never left empty.  It happened to be Karaoke night, so it was truly a sight to see.  I want to give a special shout out to Chris, Memo and Bryan.  Thanks for taking care of my family and I.  They had a great time!
