this could be the best mexican in phoenix.  ironically its New Mexico style.  last time I went it was sat night and we got great service which amazed me because it was so busy.  I LOVE this place.  I always eat too much when I go so I try not to go too often.  The green chili is the best I have ever had.  They have weird hours. seem to close early and very limited hours on sunday twice I think I tried to go but they where close so just remember to check the hours before you head over.
