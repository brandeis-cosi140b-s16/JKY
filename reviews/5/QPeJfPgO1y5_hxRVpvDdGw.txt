This place is actually really good. They are "Tex Mex" Style and are better than most I have tried in the Valley. We spent about $15 the first time around and received quite a bit of food. The rolled taco were really good and tasted like real meat. The burritos are gigantic and their meals seem robust and diverse. 

I think the toughest challenge for this place will be its location. If you are travelling east on Ray road it is very difficult to get to and get out of. 

Make the U-turn, its worth it. 

They are open super late too which is pretty cool for drunk munchies.
