I really enjoy the food from chipotle, but this food is a lot better than any other chipotles I have been to. You can really tell the difference in quality, taste and texture. The food is made with love and care. Yes the service is quite slow but this is a new location and I am pretty sure they will pick up speed. Every time I go ( which is three times a week) it is packed full of people, the workers are consistently smiling and being kind to me and the other customers. Would highly recommend this chipotle over others!
