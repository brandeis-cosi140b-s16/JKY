We went here because Shannon N. said it was the best mexicanfood ever and boy was she right. By far this was the best mexican meal and the best meal we've had in Phoenix area.

The hostess was great reseating us when we didn't like the back room for our group of 6 but she found us a great spot for a great night.

Chicken enchiladas, chicken chimichanga, soft shelled tacos ( ground beef) chili rellenos and 3 baskets of fresh chips and salsa, proved to be one of the best meals since we've been on vacation here in Phoenix!
Shannon was right this will be a favorite of ours for healed to come.
