Chipotle is always my jam. I love the chicken bowls, burritos, and tortilla chips. The only drawback to this location is the parking. It's terrible. If you go anywhere near prime hours you are crossing your fingers for a spot. Every time I've stopped in (probably 25+ times) the employees are very personable and check on us in the dining area. I prefer this location to the other two locations that are nearby. Last time I was in I asked to get a sample of the Sofritas and they happily obliged. I don't even like tofu but I can say with all honesty that it tasted good enough that I would eat it again.
