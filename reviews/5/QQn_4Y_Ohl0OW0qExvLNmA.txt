I was just in Vegas for a girl's trip and after seeing reviews on yelp, decided that I had to come here.  Let me tell you that me and my friend fell in love with this place.  If you come to Vegas, you have to eat here.  It was divine.  We were promptly seat and sat in a comfy booth/chair set up.  We had a very friendly waitress who brought us the most fantastic thing:  a huge bowl of delicious chips with 3 different salsas above it.  Then we had very yummy chicken enchiladas in this creamy chipotle sauce with our strawberry margaritas.  The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was great.
