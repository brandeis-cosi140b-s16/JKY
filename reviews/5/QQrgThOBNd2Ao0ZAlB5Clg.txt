3rd taco place I've tried on this brief trip to Phoenix and the best. The carne asada is special (cooked over mesquite) and the service was really friendly and clearly valued the business. I worked in a corner for a few hours and there was a steady stream of regulars and newcomers coming in. Good vibe, food, and value.
