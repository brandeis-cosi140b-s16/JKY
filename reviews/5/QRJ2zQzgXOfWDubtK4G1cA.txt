I've been going to this place since I was little. It was my mother's and step father's favortie mexican restaurant and over time has become mine. Everything on the menu is great but what has been my favorite all these years is the mole poblano. Everyone is always nice and the owner has never forgotten us and always takes time to say hi. To me this is the best mexican restaurant in vegas and even though they have multiple locations nothing beats the original. However make sure you are prepared to wait because from the time it opens to the time it closes this place is busy and something that has been that busy all these years has to be good.
