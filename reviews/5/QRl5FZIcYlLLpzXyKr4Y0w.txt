I went to Casa De Mina on Monday September 8th, otherwise known as the day that flooded the San Tan Valley. Upon arriving at the restaurant, it was so empty that we were not even sure if it was open, but I am so happy that it was. The atmosphere was incredibly warm, and the people smiled and were welcoming even while business was extremely slow. The waiters were quick and the drinks came fast too.
  The chips and salsa were perfect on the heat index. My sister had an enchilada and it came packed full of yummy ingredients, not just meat with a dollop of sour cream on top. She is a picky eater though, so my dad and I helped her out with the things that she didn't have a taste for. I had an appetizer because I wanted to keep room for dessert. My papas fritas were muy deliciosas. They came with queso to dip in which was phenomenal, but I eventually Americanized it with a little bit of ketchup afterwards.
  My favorite Mexican dessert of all time is fried ice cream and Casa De Mina did not disappoint. The scoop of ice cream was served in a sundae cup and drizzled with berries. Hands down my favorite part of the night. I am very grateful that they let us eat, considering that they were thinking of closing for the night. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys authentic Mexican food and friendly service.
