My favorite Mexican foods downtown! I really love the fried Chilean sea bass tacos, their mole is absolutely delicious, the sangria is always fresh tasty and cold. I even enjoy their desserts! The last time I went, I tried the ceviche for the first time and was pleasantly surprised it was served with plantain chips which were so crispy fresh delicious.. I couldn't stop eating them! The flautas were the only thing that were somewhat disappointing, but perhaps only compared to how fabulous everything else really was. I always enjoy a place downtown that has very fresh ingredients made with obvious love and attention. They even offer Mexican Coca Cola in a glass bottle. Always super cold for this Las Vegas heat!
