I love this place. I've been here a few times and every time is amazing. The owner is always very friendly and makes you feel welcome when you're there. I think I've had just about everything on the menu, and the off-menu items are always very good, but I usually end up wishing that they were regular menu items! The tofu and egg taco is probably my favorite menu item. You wouldn't think that it would work out, but it does. He definitely knows what he's doing! Definitely 5-stars. Everyone should check this place out! It's not even 7am and I wish they were open right now!!
