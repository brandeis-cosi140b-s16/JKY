Great food, two of us shared the 1/2 paradilla made up of carne asada, barbacoa and al pastor. Yummy. Came with 7 tortillas and definately more than enough for 2 people.
Barbacoa was tender and juicy and flavorful and so was the al pastor. Carne asada wasnt' as nice as the barbacoa but still great. 
Horchata was creamy and nice but wasn't the best one in Phoenix but the barbacoa was definately the star of the lunch.
