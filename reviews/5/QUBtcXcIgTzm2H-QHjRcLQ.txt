Zabas is a fast food joint leaning towards the more American Mexican food. I am never disappointed when I go here because they are quick making your food and they have more of a variety to choose from. For instance, they have tacos and not just chicken or steak but shrimp or fish. Not only that but you can make it into a Zaba bowl. A Zaba bowl is your choice of meat with white or brown rice, beans (pinto or black), salsa (mild, medium or hot), sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Sounds a lot like a bowl at Chipotle, which yes they are very similar but Zaba's has more to choose from which is a plus. 
The prices are cheap ranging from a $1 something to $7 something. 
I highly recommend the bowls, fish tacos, and nachos. Might I add that the nachos is with white cheese sauce, it's really different from any queso I've tried and your choice of meat.
