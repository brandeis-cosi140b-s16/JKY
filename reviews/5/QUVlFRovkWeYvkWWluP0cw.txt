Great Steak!!! 

I was excited to try it out and it didn't dissapoint, I got four nice sized tacos with plain flour tortilla and carne... you gotta prepare it yourself and get everything you need which I DIG! The flavor in the steak rivals someplace you pay $$ for but its a little cut place off Buckeye and its hard to see if your not paying attention lol. 

I will be back, cuz I owe the nice miss at the cashier $0.25 since i didn't have change to break even on my purchase. Mucho Amor!
