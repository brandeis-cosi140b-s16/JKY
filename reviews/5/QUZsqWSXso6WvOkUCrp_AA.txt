Wednesday night is dollar taco night.  Can't go wrong.  Best darn tacos and burritos I've ever had.  And the Super Nachos (carne asada) will hit the spot.
Nice and clean.  I've seen a couple other Robertos that were a little "tired" looking.  The Aliante shop is very clean and the folks there are genuinely pleasant.
