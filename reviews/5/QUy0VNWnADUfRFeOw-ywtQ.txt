I have been Chipotle faithful for about 2 years now, and it wasn't very difficult.  Restaurants such as Rubio's and the Blue Burrito just didn't stack up to a Chipotle burrito.  Then came Qdoba.

This restaurant is pretty much a carbon copy of Chipotle (2 of the employees on duty actually worked at my former Chipotle of choice).  I had a chicken burrito (my Chipotle norm) so I could make as direct of a comparison as possible.  

The food was great, and afterwards I didn't get that "punched in the stomach" feeling that Chipotle gives me for some time after I eat it (I am convinced their rice expands in your stomach, but it tastes good so I suffer through it).  

I also picked up their frequent customer swipe card (buy 10 burritos get one free + free chips and salsa after activation).  This place is closer to my place than any Chipotle, so I will be coming very often! 

P.S. If anyone if privy to the correct pronunciation let me know!
