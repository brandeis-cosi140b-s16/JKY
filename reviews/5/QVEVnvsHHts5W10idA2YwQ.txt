When a place gets voted as having the best tortillas in Phoenix, it is worth a visit. When it delivers this well, it's worth every possible chance to eat there.  

So the graduation and assorted flyer mile and affinity point programs coordinated to have us in Carolina's area for a week. That's probably why we went four times. Even if we had been staying closer to the family (about an hour away) we would have gone at least twice. If I lived in metro Phoenix I'd probably go  as often as I could get there.

IT IS THAT GOOD. OK, there are a lot of things on the menu I didn't try. But the machaca and anything on those tortillas make being in Arizona worth it.
