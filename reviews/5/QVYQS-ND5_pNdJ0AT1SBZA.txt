Found this diamond in the rough while working in the area.  I will definitely be returning often.

I recommend the number 7 but swap out the beef burrito and replace it with a "chevos" burrito.  Very tasty!

The restaurant is clean and the food is fresh and served hot (temp).  The soda machine dispenses good soda (not flat or too syrupy)

Brush up on your Spanish if you want bonus points with the staff.
