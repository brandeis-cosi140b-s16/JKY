A friend introduced me to this spot and I'm so glad he did. Ever since I moved from LA about a year ago I have not been able to find anything close to the Mexican food I grew up on. And now ever since I've found this spot I'm not sure if I miss it! The one thing I've never had is an adobada taco.  And man it is amazing. The spicy pork with the salsa and sauce they add to it is just perfect. Every bite literally pulls you into the next one. I wish I had gotten 10 of them but I only got 2 so I could try other things. The carne asada tacos were good. We also had the carne asada fries which were also pretty good. But I kept on yearning for more of that Adobada. I'm hooked and plan on hooking as many other people too so that I can enjoy again and again with them. The service was cool. It was counter order and pick up but none of that matters because the 5 stars was for the food. And when the food is that good, it trumps any other reasoning.
