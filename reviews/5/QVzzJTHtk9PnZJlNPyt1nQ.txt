Tried this new hot little spot today since there's been som hype about it on the social networks and I can say that it did not disappoint! Staff was friendly and the kitchen was open concept so you could easily see the cleanliness in the back. I had the Chili Relleno Burrito, a first time experience to eat a CR that way, and it was fantastic. The tortilla was clearly made from scratch and the cheese was piping hot and delicious. My friend ordered the Barbacoa Burrito and reported that it was very tasty- the meat being seasoned well. 
I will be back for more and was slightly disappointed that I had eaten a snack before I came here as I would have tried the RBC! Go check this place out!!
