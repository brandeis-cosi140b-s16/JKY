I've tried several items on the menu, Pozole, cemita, birria but my personal favorite is the Lengua burrito. This is the only place I eat it because they know how to prepare  the meat right. The food is amazing and as close as it gets to REAL Mexican Food. We've been coming here for years and the flavor hasn't change a bit. They used to be cash only but now they also take credit cards! I forgot my phone here and I thought I lost it, almost 2 weeks later we came back and they gave it to me. We are regulars and they knew we'd  come back.
