This is a new addition to my neighborhood  replacing a chicken and fish joint. For those who do not know a huarache is like a large version of a taco with handmade corn tortilla. The food I have tried there so far has been great!  Love pineapple on my tacos! The owners are very helpfull if you are confused about what to order and are willing to customize your  dinner any way you like.  Note, no credit cards yet.  But I am sure that will change. Definitely going back soon!   New note,  just heard that the grand opening special for Monday  the19th will be 99 cent tacos,   Better stay outa my way!
