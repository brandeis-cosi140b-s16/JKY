Ok the food here is not that great really but the atmosphere was really fun and the drinks were great! People were dancing (including the staff). The music was great and up beat. The staff seemed to enjoy their job laughing and talking with everyone whether they were their customer or not. It was very fun and comfortable. Our food came very timely despite all the activity, we were not neglected at all by our waiter who was very busy with other customers and entertaining at the bar. 

I would totally recommend this place for a fun couple shots and snacks.
