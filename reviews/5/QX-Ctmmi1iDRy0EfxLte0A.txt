Green chili burrito smothered in green sauce and melted cheese, rice and beans - time and time again - one of my fav meals anywhere.  I have tried green burros everywhere - Rositas is always the best.  Chips and salsa (and hot sauce) are the best around -and margaritas are great!  Sit at the bar and Mando always is the best bartender around.  I love Rosita's!!!
