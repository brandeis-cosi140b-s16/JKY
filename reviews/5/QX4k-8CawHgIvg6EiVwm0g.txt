I have been here a few times and it is always excellent. I went today with my Dad for his birthday. We always get the guac. Get the guac!! it's so good... it's sweet with pomegranate seeds (i think), spicy with jalapeno, and just delicious.... it also has cilantro, avocado (duh), salt, onion.... it's great! So I usually get the pollo poblano which is delicious chicken with goat cheese and tomatillo sauce.... yum. But today we wanted to try something else so we tried the cochinita pibil at the waiter's recommendation. I am so glad we did! It is slow roasted pork that is roasted for 12 hours.... it just fall apart and yet is so juicy.... It was delicious. It came with spicy mashed potatoes and zucchini. It was all delicious. The pork came with little tortillas to wrap it in and then I put the guac on top.... whoa. Delicious. I will continue to go to this restaurant because although it is expensive... it is so worth it!
