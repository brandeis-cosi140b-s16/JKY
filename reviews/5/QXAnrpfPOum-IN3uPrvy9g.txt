AMAZING!!!!!

I have lived in the valley for 25 years and have always struggled to find great Mexican food until now. This is a charming southeast valley authentic joint that must be on your list of places to go! 

The green chili is some of the best I have had on either side of the boarder and now with the recent addition of top notch Mexican beers it even tastes better. Their fresh chips and salsa is spicy goodness, I could have just had that for dinner!

Go out of your way and make sure you stop by this well done Mexican delight!!

Great job Espos!!
