Today was my first time trying this place. I actually used yelp reviews to find a good Mexican spot for lunch, and the reviews were right on. 

I got the beef nachos, the lunch fajitas (steak) and the lunch burrito. The portion sizes are excellent and the quality is good too. They have flour AND corn tortillas, so my husband could share with me (he's got the gluten thingy). Of course there was the standards that come with Mexican food; beans and rice, chips and salsa. I love the extras! Three adults had more food than we could eat for $20 (including guacamole!).
