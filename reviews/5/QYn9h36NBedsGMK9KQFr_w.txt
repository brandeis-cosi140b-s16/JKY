Absolutely the BEST Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas!!  A diamond in the rough!!  Authentic, real Mexican food. Reminds me of my childhood. No, it's better than that!! Hope my moms not reading this. Best Mexican food I've ever had in my life!!! Don't pass this up. 

Family owned and operated quaint little spot to catch some real homegrown Mexican food. Every time I'm in Vegas its a must stop for me and my whole family. We love it. Definitely one of the high points of any of our trips to Vegas! We love this place!!!

Don't believe me, you have to experience it to believe it. Order anything on he menu, from Mariscos(Seafood) to Burritos to Chile Rellenos to menudo and Pozole, and be prepared to be WOW'ED!!!! Give it a try. You won't regret it.
