This place is awesome!! Best place to eat in the Luxor! The food is absolutely delicious, the drinks are fun, and nothing is overpriced which is very rare in Vegas! Our server, Angel, was so great and made our experience fun! He even wrote down the name of the DJ whose mix they were playing so we could look it up online because we loved the music so much! We had a blast here and will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas!
