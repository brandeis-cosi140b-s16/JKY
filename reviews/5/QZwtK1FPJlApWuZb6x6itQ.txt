What could I add to what has already been said of this weirdly located 16th and Thomas area restaurant?  On the way out, I went and thanked the bartender for mixing "the perfect" margarita.  I mean it was just their regular margarita, but it was spectacular.

This place is small.  This place has great art (sometimes a bad sign).  But, from the guacamole made table side...with pomegranate...(who woulda thunk it, right?) to each of the tasty desserts, the meal was a complete treat for our entire party of four.

If a Mexican place can't do enchiladas why would I trust any of the other dishes on this expansive menu.  The enchiladas were a delicious blend of scallops and shrimp, blue and white corn tortillas, cheesy goodness served with a side of grilled veggies.  The plate was licked clean.  Looking around at my guests' plates, they were equally impressed.  My wife had the poblano stuffed with chicken and walnuts and apricots and other deliciousness.

Now, for the desserts....think goat's milk caramel...stuffed in a churro.  Think of think crepes, again with the same caramel.  Now, a chocolate cake with the necessary hints of cinnamon and cayenne.  Yes, they have a traditional flan too, but it fell to forth place on this list.  The goat's milk caramel is as good a taste as I have had in a dessert.  Couple this with French pressed coffee at the table and the meal completes with aplomb.

Sure, the small nature of the place will scare some folks away.  No, I wouldn't do a business lunch or dinner here.  But, my wife and I will save nickels and dimes to come again.  It's not inexpensive, but it is worthwhile on value and ambiance.
