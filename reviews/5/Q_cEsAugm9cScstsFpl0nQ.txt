Thumbs up! The best Ive ever tried in Vegas (in Mexican food)yummy, can't wait to go back to Vegas and try their food. Nothing fancy. But you feel like if you were at a real taco shop in Mexico. Love it!. The personnel was very friendly. Thank you! Oh and it was cheap! I've never paid that amount in Vegas for two entrees!!! Lol
