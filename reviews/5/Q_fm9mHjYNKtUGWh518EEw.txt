I had the chicken fajita rice bowl with creamy white rice. The food was EXCELLENT! Chips have a bit of a lime zest to them and very fresh taste! The chef even came out to ask us how our food was!! The place is very modern inside staff is very friendly and although they were busy we got our food rather quickly! Looks like a great place to come for happy hour! We will be back!
