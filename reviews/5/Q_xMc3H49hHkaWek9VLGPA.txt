I am not a huge fan of 'fast food' Mexican food, but this place is different. From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted with a very hearty hello and welcome. There hasn't been a time that I have been in here that they haven't offered to let me try something before I decide.  All their items are fresh and made in the local stores. (other than the tortillas) and it tastes like it.  

The cheese sauce is the bomb and the grilled chicken will make you question trying any other of the meat choices. So far I has have the soft tacos, the nachos, the naked burro (in a bowl no tortilla) and each one is as good as the last.  My best fried goes for the burrito and even as a big eater this kicks his rear.  

Great food, good value, a really nice place to kick back, eat and relax.
