I totally agree with Jonathan W's post back from 08/12/2008.  I have eaten here 40 times over 8 years.  I work in the area, stop in for lunch, grab a breakfast burrito often.  The very best machaca burrito in Phx, hands down.  Great red salsa.  The place is an old  dive but mostly clean... the food is outstanding, steaming hot, always quick and a very good value!  Exactly what you'd expect from a perfect dive mom and pop Mexican food place!  Never had a bad experience!
