This is my favorite Mexican food place in the state. I am a very picky Mexican food snob (having lived in Mexico for six years). They're famous for their green chile which is amazing but their salsa is incredible as well. I asked the owners and they told me they use an ingredient called espasote in their salsa that gives it its unique flavor. Delicious. Do yourself a favor and make the trip.
