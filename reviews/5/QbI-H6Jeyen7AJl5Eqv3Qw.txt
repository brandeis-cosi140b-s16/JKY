My absolute favorite Raspados place. So underrated, they deserve more attention for the quality, taste, and love they put in their raspados :) every flavor is good. Wont disappoint. He carefully layers and packs the ice, syrup, fruit, etc for you. It's not the typical Raspados that taste like snowcones. Each syrup flavor has been cooked perfectly with real bits and chunks of whatever fruit/nut flavor you get. Clean environment, great hosts; will never get tored of this place.
