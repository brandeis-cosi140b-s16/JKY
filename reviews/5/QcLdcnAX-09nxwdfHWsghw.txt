The chips and salsa are worth the trip to aunt chilada's alone. I love the flour tortillas that have neem fried instead of the harder corn tortillas you normally see. I also love how they will grill you jalapeños on the side if you request it instead of just regular pickled jalapeños from a jar like most places. Fantastic place for happy hour or dinner or Sunday brunch. Love this place.
