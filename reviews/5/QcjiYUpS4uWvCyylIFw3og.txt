I found this random place through Yelp while staying in Old town Vegas.   Their $10 fries are sooooo friggin good and it'll feed a whole gang...  I tried their pork taco (carved from a huge skewer), and their langua taco... If you're not afraid to eat a cow's tongue, try it!!! cus meat is too boring nowadays.. lol I like watching them make my tacos in front of me... 5 stars for taste, cleanliness, and all you can drink orange BANG!
