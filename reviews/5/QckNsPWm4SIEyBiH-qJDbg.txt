I don't know where to start but I might as well start from the beginning. The salsa and chips were good. However the salsa could have been thicker even though it had excellent flavor. I also ordered a blanco cheese sauce with jalape√±os, which was perfect. The main dish was an off menu item, fish taco's with a corn tortilla and a side of special salsa with lime and avocado which to me was hands down the best fish taco I have ever had. It's a must try for anyone who stops by. 
Aside from the great food, the server was great as well. Made some good suggestions and made sure we were completely satisfied.
