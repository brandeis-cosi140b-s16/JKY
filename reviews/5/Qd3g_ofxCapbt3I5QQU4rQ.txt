This is a great addition to the Buckeye area. I've read a few reviews and first of all this is not the drive-thru place, its the sports bar next door. I am not the owner or an employee as one mentioned, and I have had every single item on the menu at least once and love their food. I frequent this establishment frequently. I own a local business and have recommended this restaurant to my customers and have only had good feedback from those that have been there. Give it a try!  Good job!
