Absolutely delicious. Great service. Nice hole in the wall Mexican Food place, easy to pass by but hard to leave. The special breakfast burrito is delicious. The chilequiles are amazing. Best horchata I have had. I would come back every day, if I could. Will be recommending to all my friends and family!
