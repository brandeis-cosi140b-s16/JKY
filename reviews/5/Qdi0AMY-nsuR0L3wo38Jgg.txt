Stopped by to grab my daughter a quick dinner and asked about a new nacho item. I asked the guy if he knew if the cheese sauce was gluten free (highly unlikely but it never hurts to ask), he didn't know so he asked the manager. The manager went above and beyond finding and reading the ingredients list for me!! Turns out they are not gluten free but I appreciated that they went so far to find out.
