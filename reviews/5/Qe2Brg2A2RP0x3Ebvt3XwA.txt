Really like this place. I always get the carnitas but have recently become a fan of the chicken quesadilla for my kids. I can feed my family of four with just those two items (unless we really want to pig out). Pretty quick service. We've both eaten there and taken it to go. Nothing fancy if you are sitting down there but it does the trick if you are really hungry. We've also heated up the food as leftovers and it is still delicious.
