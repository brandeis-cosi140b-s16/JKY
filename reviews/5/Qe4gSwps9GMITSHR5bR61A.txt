My experience at Sumo Maya was beyond satisfactory. Matter of fact, the food, the service, and the environment in general was incredible. We ordered pomegranate guacamole dip for a starter, then continued on with some sushi rolls, duck (phenomenal), and chicken tacos. Also, we were constantly being checked on by not only our server but other staff members as well. Our server's name was Austin and it is obvious that he takes his job serious and is very professional with going about things; we were all more than pleased with his service. All in all, great food, great environment, incredible service, and good vibes. I will most definitely be back in very soon!
