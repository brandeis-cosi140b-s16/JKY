Our family ate at Dos Caminos last night, slightly nervous after reading the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised at every turn. The white Sangria was fantastic, as were the chips, salsa and guacamole. Our family is pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food and we thought this was wonderful. Service was excellent.
