We got carne asada burritos.  My first impression was 4.5 stars because of not many salsa options, but by the end of the burrito I realized it wasn't necessry. The meat has a ton of flavor and the tortillas are amazing. The staff  is also very friendly. I'll definitely be back any time I'm in the area.
