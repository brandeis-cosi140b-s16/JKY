I may have eaten here 50 times and can say that i have ever gotten a bad burrito. The grilled chicken or ham breakfast burrito are fantastic and worth getting at any time of the day - which they are open for you. Not a pretty place - but pretty enough to get you some fantastic burritos - 5 stars no question.

Update: Oh no - they changed their grilled chicken burro - NOOOOO.  4 starts until they bring the old direction back!

Update: The have remodeled - and brought the old grilled chicken back!
