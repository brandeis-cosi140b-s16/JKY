Stopped in for a quick take out order last night, and this location did not disappoint me at all.

They didn't make fun of me, or give me a dirty look when I have them my ridiculous special order of salad with chicken, steak, no cheese, black beans on the side, red salsa, a dash of corn salsa. 

Thanks for cooperating.

In other news, the restaurant was clean, the beverage bar was wiped down, and the tabasco bottles were all wiped down and clean too. I hate when people steal those tabasco bottles though...there seemed to be some of the good flavors missing. Boo.
