Today Chipotle was the office lunch order. Thank goodness they have that fax order system (please don't ever stop that) because this location is always busy! I arrived and it took a little longer to get my order finished but I wasn't upset at all. They offered me a drink while I wait and apologized more than a few times. I got my order and went back to work. Then they call to make sure everything turned out correctly and that we were happy with the food. Of course we were, Chipotle is delicious!! That made me want to leave a review. Ivan, five stars to your (and everyone else's) customer service.
