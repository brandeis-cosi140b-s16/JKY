*The BEST Fideo soup. Ever. 

My favorite Mexican Food place in town, hands down. Better than Viva Zapta's, Roberto's and some of the more expensive places. They give you free chips, salsa and bean dip from the get go. If you order an entree they bring the tomato/noodle (fideo) soup out pre-meal as well. The enchiladas are fluffy and cheesey and the enchilada sauce isn't so strong or greasy it gives you heartburn. The 'Mexican Pizza' appetizer is awesome, very crunchy with light fluffy chicken (or beef if you choose) on top. They'll make guacamole right at your table for like $7. It can get a little chunky if you put everything in it, but it's a big amount you can take home. I enjoy everything I order here and have heard rave reviews about the Steak Ranchero as well. Haven't had anything bad yet. I'd like to save room for once to try their fried icecream, it looks like they give a generous portion!
