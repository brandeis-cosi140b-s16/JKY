Went today for lunch.  Found this place in the book "Eating Las Vegas" along side Michelin star restaurants.  Small, clean place with pictures of their plates and hand written specials on the wall. I'm not a mexican food guy so I was a little intimidated but the guy who took my order was very nice, spoke English and was able to make helpful suggestions.  I tried their Mole de pollo as recommended by fellow yelpers. Wow! Though I never had mole before, good food is good food and the mole was delicious. Chicken was tender and moist. I mopped the plate clean with the steaming hot tortillas that come with the plate. They had a drink called "Mango water". Amazing. So good. Refreshing and not too sweet. I complimented the mole as I was leaving and as we talked about the food I could tell that he took a lot of pride in his food. I will definitely be back. Viva la Mexico!
