Been coming here for years. This place is definitely a step above a Roberto's but not exactly the best mexican food. Though in the area it is probably the best bang for your buck. My husband is from San Diego so he's tasted enough mexican fast food that are not chains. He has frequently said this offers pretty good food and easily rivals SD mexican fast food. 

We always get nachos, al pastor plate, and/or cali burrito. Our nachos have always came out pretty good. Sometimes they do put too much cheese but at least they always put a generous amount of meats.
