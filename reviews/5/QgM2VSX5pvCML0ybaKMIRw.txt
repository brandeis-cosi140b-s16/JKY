So what would happen if Hawaiian food and Chipotle conceived a love child? You guessed it, Frank Stallone!, oh, I mean Braddah's Island Style!! There is nothing that I've had here that I didn't like. It's definitely worth checking out for the great casual food.

I've heard lots of good things about this place but never tried it for various reasons. But hey, guess what? My little homie, you know him, his name is Groupon was like "hey mike, I got this great deal for you.." I was like "oh yea? What you got for me on this bright and beautiful day?" And he was like "listen to this, you gotta check out this place, it's called Braddah's Island Style, and I'll give you $12 bucks of food for only $6. What do you say?" I was like, "ok, you twisted my arm, but be a little bit more gentle next time because that kinda hurt, I shall take you up on your offer." And so our journey began.

It's really similar to Chipotle. You can either order a burrito, 3 tacos, a bowl, and a salad (just make sure it's not a tossed one). Then you order your meats and toppings. Go for the steak, it's worth it. Hey! Not really a steak eater? Well then young sir, there are also other options available such as pork, chicken, and fish. Oh, so now you don't eat animals. No problem my friend, because Braddah's has that base covered too. You can get some tofu. There you go.

These guys don't skimp on the toppings. I was so moved by their generosity that the tears almost, sorta, kinda, maybe decided to think that they were going to fall, but it wasn't the case.

I see you coconut bark, giving me the eye with your deliciousness. Looking all sexy in the corner over there. Oh, I'm heading your way soon enough. Just give me some time to get things situated with my situations, then we'll talk.

So go here. Now! J/k whenever you're up for it.
