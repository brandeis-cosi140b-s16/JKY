I grew up In Los Angeles and spent the better part of 25 years enjoying authentic Mexican food. The tacos at Las Palmas are the real deal! The salsas are excellent. They also have onions, cilantro, guacamole, lime and roasted jalapenos. They don't advertise it, but they have cuts of ribeye hidden under the steak! It's hard to believe you can get a delicious ribeye taco for $2.50!  The store is great too! They have a meat deli with marinated fajita mix, fresh chorizo, skirt steak, ribeye and pork. The prices are very reasonable. If you are a fan of Mexican food and authentic street tacos, you have to try Las Palmas.
