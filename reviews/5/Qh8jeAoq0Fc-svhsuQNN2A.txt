So I'm updating my review to 5 stars because to me it's about value and quality and this store his both. I fly weekly and visit this restaurant nearly every week I don't always get to leave a review but today I will. To the nards that have left reviews prior to me, you have missed the mark. I have yet to experience anything that you are talking about and trust me if I didn't like this restaurant I would have said so. So far my experience has been the complete opposite of yours and I'm very happy with this restaurant. I will continue to go here and go out of my way find their other locations in the Phoenix area. I'm a very happy customer.
