I am so happy they opened a permanent location!  No more waiting until Fridays if I don't want to. Their All Thai'd Up is my favorite quesadilla in the world. The mix of cilantro salsa and chili sweet Thai sauce is amazing. I usually don't like onions in any food but they add so much flavor to the chicken and cheese. Their luncharitas are also something to look forward to. So refreshing and icy cold.
