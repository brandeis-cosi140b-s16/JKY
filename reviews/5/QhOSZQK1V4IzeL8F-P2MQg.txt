Came here twice for brunch while staying at Mandalay Bay because we enjoyed it so much.  You cannot beat the price for the amount and quality of food.  $25 unlimited brunch tapas, our faces were cinn apple pancakes, green corn tamales and steak and eggs.  Coc French toast was delish too.  Loved the passionfruit bottomless mimosas for $5 extra!  You can even take one to go.  Overall great spot for the price, quality food and great service!
