Great food great price medium heat. The tacos al pastor had great flavor. Simple corn or flour shell hard or soft. The quality is homemade. The salsas and extra topping bar is self serve. They have a variety of heat on the bar. The nachos with guacamole were a nice side item. Good portions and fast counter service. I would recommend this to anyone anytime of day. They even have great breakfast options.
