I hosted a private event with Sal's last week and in doing so, had a chance to scarf a piece of their signature Tomato Pie while running around. I ended up back at the shop two days later because I couldn't stop thinking about it.

Their humble pie looks beautiful but packs a punch you wouldn't expect from such a simple dish. The crust is perfect and chewy. The cheese is flavorful and plentiful without that stringy, will choke you if you swallow funny consistency. And then, topping it all in a beautiful swirl, there is the sauce. Bow down, y'all. The sauce is so fresh and flavorful that you'll give a side eye to canned sauces from here on out. Making things from local ingredients truly makes a difference - you're not going to find something that tastes this good without getting local.

To sum up, I asked if "pizza marriage" was legal after my first slice - I think I could be happy with this beauty for the rest of my life.
