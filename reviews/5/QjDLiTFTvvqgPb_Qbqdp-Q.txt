I am hooked! Tried it once on a whim and have been back at least 3 times since (a two-week span of time, mind you). The decor an ambiance here are just so-so. It's a very casual spot, and not romantic, but is great for a low-key meal or dinner with a group. Most everything served here is local and prepared fresh daily. You can definitely tell!

The Inca salad is wonderful; so many unexpected flavors. Add shrimp for a healthy and satisfying lunch. If you are ready to splurge-- the BLT & A is a MUST! It's huge though, so consider sharing it with a friend.
