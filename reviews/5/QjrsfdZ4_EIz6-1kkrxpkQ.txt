... Words cannot describe how impressed I am with this amazing Mexican fusion cuisine. Came here with my sister, boyfriend, and a close friend of ours. We spent the first 20 minutes fighting over what to order because everything looked so good. The mussels are BOMB!!! Chef kelly is brilliant and the definition of hospitable. Tempe may not be ready for this level of deliciousness. Thank you REVIVAL!!
