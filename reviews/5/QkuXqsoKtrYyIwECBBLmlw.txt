OmiGOD their tacos are freaking insane.  They're better than those I'd had when I was in California, seriously.  Great.  Tacos.  

Also they have pretty cheap produce inside and it's not bad!  I generally wait to get my onions so that I can pick them up here.  Potatoes are cheap too.  

lololol one time I went there for graham crackers and I was trying to explain to the lovely and friendly cashier who does NOT speak English what I wanted.  She called another guy over and I tried to explain to him what I was looking for.  Then he told me that if I made "sweet chicken" it wouldn't taste good.  LOL.  

I found cinnamon cookies and ran out of there, slightly embarrassed, slightly amused.
