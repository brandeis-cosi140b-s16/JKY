I am impressed!! Hands down the BEST mexican food in the Valley!! The servers are very courteous and informative. They were more than happy to explain items on the menu that I could not understand. I would describe La Barquita as a family restaurant. It is quiet, friendly, and priced fairly on portions. OMG!! The Molcajetes a la mexicana is to die for!! I can't stop thinking about it. It includes a piece of grilled cactus. Never having cactus before, I never knew it was so yummy! What really makes me feel good about the restaurant is its employees. We were there on a Sunday. I saw the cook take time to sit down with his children and enjoy a family lunch together. I also saw a couple of children come in and give the waitress kisses and hugs. My enjoyable experience with food and atmosphere definitely makes me want to be a regular. YUMMO!
