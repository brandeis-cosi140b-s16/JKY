I'm not really active in the whole "write reviews online" thing because I feel most are negative but after my experience at Ricky's I decided I had to because it was that dang good! 
My first experience with Ricky's was after my late night shift in old town. They had a limited menu but that's ok. At that hour I'm just hungry and am not exactly looking for 5 star cuisine. I will be shocked the day you can order food at 3am and actually be impressed! But my actual dine-in experience was for from mediocre. It was great!
My boyfriend had been in a couple times beforehand and was excited to find out it was a Packers bar. He absolutely loved it and so this Sunday I tagged along. 
We were greeted right away by one of the owners and an old friend at the bar. 
After deciding on a table, we started out with wings. Shockingly they were amazing!  
 We ordered a chicken enchilada and chile relleno along with a carne asada burrito. All were above the par of what we expected.
After watching the game for about an hour we decided we wanted dessert and decided on the churros!! My goodness were these things amazing! They're made to order and you can definitely tell with every bite. 
Needles to say everything was delicious and the service was very personable. 
Definitely our new Sunday packers spot!
