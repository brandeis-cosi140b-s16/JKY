We have eaten here 5 times and every time the food has been fantastic.  They offer 4 different kinds of meat for the tacos and each one is delicious.  The flour tortillas they use come from Mexico and are excellent.  Their beans and rice are very tasty as is their different salsas.  The prices are inexpensive and each combo includes a drink.  The owners are very friendly and we always get our food quickly.  I am so glad we found this place.  Give it a try.  You will be glad you did.
