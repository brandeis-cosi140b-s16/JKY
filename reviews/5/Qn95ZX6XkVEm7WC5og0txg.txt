Amazing food for a fairly inexpensive, sit down style restaurant. We take our 2 kids (ages 5 & 7) at least a couple times a month. I usually get a bean & cheese burro and a chicken taco. My wife loves the chimis, and the kids get a kids meal..usually the chicken taquitos. After dinner we almost always walk over and do a little shopping at Trader Joe's. Always clean, good prices, great food, what more can you ask for.
