I can't believe I haven't written a review for La Condesa yet.  I have never been disappointed here.  Ever.  

Here is the deal:  

-you start with a side of chips.  And then you get to feast on the humongous salsa bar.  My favorites are the pecan (creamy, thick, and with a kick at the end), cilantro (thinner but delicious), and the tamarindo (sweet and spicy).  Sadly, the tamarindo one seems to be quite elusive and is not always available.  You could spend hours trying all the different salsas.  I agree though with Iain, the peanut was the weak link.

-next comes the real food.  I have only had the tacos, but I imagine everything to be of the same quality.  So these tacos come with double tortillas to hold all the ingredients.  These aren't skimpy by any means.  Two should be sufficient for most people.  The Cabo Shrimp is amazing.  Huge shrimp beer battered with a creamy sauce on top.  The chicken mole taco was also great with that special chocolately flavor to it.  Today, I tried to Mayan Cochinita taco and it was stuffed to the brim with tender as can be pork.  I have had the rice and beans before with a combo and I would say the beans are better than the rice.  Though in my opinion after four or so visits, it's best to come enjoy the chips and salsa and then indulge in two tacos.

This place is really hard to find, but if you find Palm and McDowell, it's right there with a few parking spots along the street.

If you like tacos, you need to come here.  It's just that simple.
