First had to find the place!  After driving in circles - I saw the address on the door. There is NO SIGN. Look for the beat up brown wooden door. Ordered take out- New Mexico enchiladas with green chile pork, shrimp & chicken with green chile.  Yummy!!!!  Served with beans, rice and a tortilla.  Ate about 1/3rd of my entree. Large portion.  Looking forward to leftovers.  Worth locating. Looking forward to returning to try other menu items.
