BEST TACOS IN LAS VEGAS!!!

This is my favorite taco place, I haven't tasted tacos this good since I lived in Baja California, Mexico. These are truly the most authentic Mexican Tacos I have had in Las Vegas and nothing else compares to them.  I have taken at least 5 people to go eat Tacos with me and ALL 5 LOVE this place as well. 

There are 2 locations, and I will drive across town just for these tacos.  The employees are also very friendly, I went so many times that the employees started to recognize me among the hundreds of people that go eat tacos! 

I guarantee these will be the BEST tacos you will ever have!
