Stopped in Sunday night for the second time becouse We came here during NAB and it was great. Saw the billboard saying Organic and no GMO.... Food was amazing and the manager Shaun is friendly and helpfull, he talked to us about the food and the healthy eating concept. I definitely recommend this place and will be back
