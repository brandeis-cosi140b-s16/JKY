Basically the best Mexican restaurant I ever been to hands down. The reason why is because of the nice customer service, the ease of reading the menu, and the authentic Mexican / Latin dishes. I love this place, it's very cheap and definitely worth every penny. The drinks of one of the best tasting. Sangrias are my favorite!
