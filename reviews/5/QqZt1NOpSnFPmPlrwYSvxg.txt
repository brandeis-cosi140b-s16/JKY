I recently just moved across the street from the hidden away "dive" style bar, so I knew, just for the fact that it was across the street, it was going to become my regular place to go for a drink.

The first time I went there it was pretty dead, maybe only a few people. The bartender was super friendly, and even the other patrons were quick to say hello. My girlfriend and I order some of their tacos that I have heard about they definitely did not disappoint. They were those typical style street tacos, but the carnitas were amazing. Even they steak and chicken tacos were good, but the carnita tacos were an instant favorite.

However, it takes more than that to give a bar like this 5 stars. The reason I did is their staff. One night I had a film gig that was gonna keep me out late. I called the place up about 9ish and asked if the grill was still open. The bartender stated that it was pretty dead and he was going to be closing it up soon, however, then he asked what time I planned on coming in. I said I was working and it wouldn't be till after 11. Then to my surprise, he said "ok, I'll keep it on for you." Now maybe it's just me, but for a bar to leave on a grill for a random patron is not something that I see happening all the time. So of course, I showed up about 11, reminded him that i called earlier, and he said "I've been waiting for you". This was the point when I knew this was going to be my go to neighborhood bar for a long time.

I always enjoy this bar during the dead times. The people that are there during these times are always willing to have a conversation with you and even buy you drinks, which I have had multiple times.

Sometimes on the weekends they have dancing, comedy nights, or other events that pack this place and make you pay a $5 cover. I tend to not go during these times, but thats not a con in my opinion. The place needs to make money so they can stay open and provide me with cheap drinks and delicious tacos.
