So mother freaking good! i am basing this almost entirely off the breakfasts. During the 5 days i was there, i think i tried almost everything on the breakfast menu between what i ordered and what my buddy got. Firstly, the flaco torta is freaking amazing! best breakfast menu item for sure. also the el campo omlet is amazing also, they use goat cheese in it and it really makes a difference. 

The prices are very fair for the quality of the food and the service is filled with smiles. the only negative thing i have to say is that the service was extremely slow sometimes (40min once from when we sat down til we got our food) whether its due to being short staffed or whatever, it happened. though they were nice about it and apologized. 

The burgers are great and the few things i tried from the dinner menu was very good. Definitely definitely give this place a try.
