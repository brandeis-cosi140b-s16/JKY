When it was suggested to go to Garcia's today for lunch I was a bit apprehensive, mainly based on their location. I am however glad I went, I was wrong. First and foremost, service was great. Every person working the restaurant was friendly and helpful. Fantastic team! I ordered green corn tamales and my lunch partner cheese enchiladas. I was especially appreciative as a vegetarian that our waitress let me know the rice was not vegetarian and suggested black beans. The rice is cooked in chicken stock. Our food was better than expected and filled my craving for tamales. Overall food rating 4 stars, service 5 star + so I'm giving this place a 5 star for overall experience, service and food. Will be back.
