Boy am I glad I went here!

Don't let the modest store front fool you. Not only was the feel inside the seven-table dining room intimate, but it also made you feel like a local who was in-the know. It's one of those places that feels like a hidden secret from the never ending rush of the city. 

Our waitress was very sweet and greeted us promptly as we entered through the glass door. We sat right up front, and were brought simple paper menus displaying the myriad of authentic Mexican dishes available at El Napolito. The highly affordable, and seemingly endless choices between 'a-la carte' tacos and burritos, and combination dishes could be smelt cooking in the tucked away kitchen as we perused the menu. 

We started with something to drink. I ordered the Apple Soda which is imported from Mexico and was absolutely AMAZING. I wasn't in the mood for an alcoholic beverage, but there was a variety of  bottled beers that I could see in the stand up cooler behind the cash-wrap for those wishing to imbibe. 

I ordered the Rolled Taco combination plate. I had three rolled tacos (basically chimichangas). They were filled with shredded chicken and deep-fried, then covered with cheese sauce, and lettuce. Rice and re-fried beans were served as sides, and a slice of avocado was the garnish. It was an amazing, authentic meal for a truly outstanding price. 

The waitress was very attentive throughout our whole meal, and made us feel as if we were in her family kitchen. 

I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Truly a five star experience!
