i have been here for about 2 years now and had pretty much given up on authentic mexican food. One day i was driving and did a search and based on the rating decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed,unpretentious location,simple menu,delicious food. This place reminds me of the places i fell in love with mexican food. All i can say is that i enjoyed it very much,it was funny they call all the numbers in spainish and i was counting in my head ,i am a little rusty on my numbers then I realized it was me ! lol friendly hard working people I will return every chance i get :)
