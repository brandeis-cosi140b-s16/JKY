I've been to this place many times.  It's one of my favorite places to get food, hands down.  Unique blends of flavors - not your typical south of the border fare.  
The mojitos are probably the best I've ever had.  They have one called the premier mojito - or is it the ultimate? - that is so smooth you question whether there's alcohol in it.  Then you stand up and realize how potent it is.  Two thumbs up.
Try the turkey tostada.  Deeeeeeeeeelicious.
