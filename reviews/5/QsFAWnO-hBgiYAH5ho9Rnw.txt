This has to be my all time favorite restaurant EVER.  I go at least once per month, but would go every week if I had the chance. The food is creative and full of  flavor and depending on what is ordered the portions are generous.

I have had just about everything on the menu but my favorite item is the Chipolte Shrimp Tamales.  The well seasoned shrimp are more like prawns, the tamale is sweet and the it's a pleasant contrast to the spicy sauce. The presentation, flavor and texture combination of this dish have made it my families favorite item to order.

The ala carte sides are unique and tasty and the desserts are designed to share. 

The service has always been great, but every once in a while the staff seems frazzled (but still friendly and professional).
