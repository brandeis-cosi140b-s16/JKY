AMAZING Guacamole del Barrio is a signature dish and worth the trip in and of itself! The Guac is made table-side, ultra fresh and unique. Also highly recommend Esquites (small buttered and roasted corn dip) that was fantastic! Small, intimate atmosphere that is very enjoyable. Most of our party ordered a version of the Taco dishes and were quite pleased. I ordered the Pescado del Mar - absolutely fantastic! It's rich and filling, so I ended up sharing with table mates ... and they were thankful!
Barrio Cafe is on my must return list, likely every time I'm in Phoenix. WOW.
