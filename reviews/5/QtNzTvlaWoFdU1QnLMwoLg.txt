I've been to Gallo Blanco twice and had great experiences both times. The first time was for dinner and I tried the elote and tacos. The elote callejero was fantastic and a departure from usual Mexican fare. I loved the cojita cheese on it. The tacos are not the standard large tacos, but are smaller and are more like street tacos. They're also very reasonably priced, so two or three can make for a great main course.

The second time I ate at Gallo Blanco was for brunch with a large group (20+ people) and the food and service was excellent once again. Our server was very patient and accommodating, splitting checks in various ways and dealing with late arrivals. The food was also great; I had huevos rancheros with over-medium eggs and I was pleased. The eggs were cooked just right and I loved the thicker tortillas. Combined with a flavorful chili sauce, the huevos rancheros made for a great start to my day.

Finally, I'm really thrilled with Gallo Blanco's focus on using local vendors, especially Cartel Coffee Lab's coffee. I'm a big fan of Cartel, and I'm happy that I can get a great cup of coffee with my breakfast.
