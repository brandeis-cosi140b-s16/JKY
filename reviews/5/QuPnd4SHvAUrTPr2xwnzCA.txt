This is a hidden gem in Scottsdale!  The atmosphere is amazing...beautifully decorated, rustic and relaxing all at the same time.  The service was impeccable...they were attentive, but not bothersome.  The margaritas were delicious...I love a prickly pear margarita like nobody's business and this one definitely delivered.  The enchiladas were flavorful and just right.  All in all, a great meal with great service in a great location!
