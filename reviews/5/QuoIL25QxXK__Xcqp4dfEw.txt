This place has great table side guacamole and the salsa is good. We order the house margarita with there homemade mix which are some of the best margaritas I have had. I will come back here just because of those. My wife order a salad and she said it was great. I ordered the faita chimichanga which was also delicious. The servers are always great. I would recommend people to come eat here.
