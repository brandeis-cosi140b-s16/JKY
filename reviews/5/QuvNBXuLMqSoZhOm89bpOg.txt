My boyfriend and I visited this place for the first time today. It was fabulous! My boyfriend is a VERY picky eater. Well, he finished everything on his plate. I had the fajitas and I loved it. The owners are wonderful, friendly people. We enjoyed the food and talking to them. I never write reviews but this little hidden gem has great authentic Mexican food! Check it out for yourself. The owners, Mark and Maria, will make you feel right at home.
