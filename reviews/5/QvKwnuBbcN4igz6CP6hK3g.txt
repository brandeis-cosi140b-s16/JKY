We found this place last weekend!  I had the Carne Asada burrito and a melon water. The burrito was excellent.  The melon water was fresh. By fresh I mean they sliced up the melon just for me. :-)

It's really nice to have a non-chain Mexican restaurant in Queen Creek. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food they definitely have some interesting options. The food is fresh. The kitchen and dining area are clean. This is a great place to grab a quick bite or sit down for dinner.
