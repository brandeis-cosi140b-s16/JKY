Delicious tacos!! Small carniceria that makes food inside such as, tacos, tortas, quesadillas and burritos. They also have some bomb guacamole salsa and another delicious red salsa.  At night they bring everything outside and have a taco stan in front of the building in the parking lot. Probably some of the best tacos in Phoenix! A hidden gem for sure.
