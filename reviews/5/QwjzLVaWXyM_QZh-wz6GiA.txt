Blanca was a pleasure. When we came in we had no idea about the new menu we normally get the $5 taco Al Carbon meal.. She was knowledgeable and also professional! It was FRESH&FAST! We enjoyed our dinner! I will recommend this location to all friends and family thanks Blanca for making it a great experience!
