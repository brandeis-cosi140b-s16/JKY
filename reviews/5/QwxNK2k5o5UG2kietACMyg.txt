Holy Crap!  This place is proof that you do not judge a book by it's cover.

When my boyfriend suggested it for dinner I did some research and was a little scared of the pictures.  But, I figured why the heck not, taco joints are supposed to be divey.  I eat from roadside vendors while in Mexico.

I ordered 3 carne asada tacos and the carne asada quesadilla.  I was tempted to get a fish taco but I decided to hold off until another time.  The tacos were street vendor size.  The meat was tender and delicious and before I knew it they were completely gone and I wish I had ordered three more.

My absolute favorite was the quesadilla.  Cheesy, meaty, warm goodness.  It must have been laced with something illegal because I immediately craved more. I suggest you head there now...well not as I write this as they are closed Sunday and Monday, but as soon as they open again.

Also the owner is not what you would expect.  He's a bald headed white guy with tons of tattoos.  He was extremely friendly and helpful.  Turns out he knows a friend of mine who comes in to eat as well.

Don't blink or you'll miss the place.  But trust me, you need to try it.  You'll thank me.
