Came to the hard rock for a show at the joint and stopped in here in between sets. They had us in and out in time to catch the next band. It was about 1030 and the place wasn't busy,  Two of us sat at the bar and we're served very fast the staff was great I would definitely recommend this place the service and food are fantastic.
