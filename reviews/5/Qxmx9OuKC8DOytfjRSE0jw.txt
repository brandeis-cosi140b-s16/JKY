When researching the best Bloody Mary in the Phoenix area, Dick's Hideaway kept coming up on a variety of lists, so we made it a point to stop in.

With a name like Dick's Hideaway, what you get when you go there is not what you'd expect. Yes, it is a hideaway, a tiny hidden gem of a restaurant. But it serves authentic, traditional New Mexican cuisine, treasures from the Santa Fe Trail--not pub or island cuisine as I was guessing.

Looking over their menu then, you also wouldn't expect them to have a decent Bloody Mary... but boy do they ever. Like many of their dishes, the bloody at Dick's is made with a homemade mix containing a hefty dose of spice, Pinnacle vodka and garnished with lime, pickled asparagus, celery.... AND A CHASER!

We agree with many of the write-ups...Surprisingly, Dick's has a great Bloody Mary and one of the best we've tasted in AZ. Along with the tasty drink, we enjoyed the Carne Adovada and left happy. This is all not so surprising, however, when you find out that Dick's sister restaurant is Rokerij, a fabulous establishment we visited last year. Be sure to stop here and at Rokerij next time you're in the area!
