Being from Hermosillo, Sonora myself, this is the closest to true Sonoran carne asada tacos you can get.  The tacos are al carbon style, so they use real charcoal.  Ask for flour tortillas with yours.

The place is very small with only a few things on the menu.  But their carne asada tacos are absolutely the best thing on the menu.   4 will fill you up and they're only $1.50 each!

Also, great friendly service and nice selection of salsas at the salsa bar.  My favorite is the roasted salsa.

 I've hunted all over Phoenix trying to find a great Sonoran carne asada taco.  I guess I found my place.
