So... I hear a lot of people compare this place to Qdoba and to that I say, "ARE YOU CRAZY." Yes yes they can be quite similar in some ways but I disagree completely that the two are THAT close. I love this chipotle because they always seem to have the freshest ingredients and more-so than other locations. The bang-for-your-buck at Chipotle is much better than any other fast-food restaurant like it. The thing I like about this location is, well, its location. It is easy to get to in a small strip-mall type area and its right next to some other excellent stores. #1 most enjoyable aspect about this location is the employees. 

They have always been extremely energetic outrageously polite, and attentive. Ive never experienced a messed up order or poor quality. It has always been great for me. They are always excited to see the next person it seems like. They are also very efficient. I have been in here with a line of 7-10 ahead of me but have always been in and out within 30 mins.
