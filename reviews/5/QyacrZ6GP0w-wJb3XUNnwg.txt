Love this place! Everything is so fresh.  I think they should be up for best tacos in the valley.  I would give everything I've tried so far a 4 or 5 star except for their carne asada, while not bad just okay.  Also, not a fan of ordering at the counter but that's just a small knock.  The warm fresh  chips are excellent (what ever happened to warm chips at most places?) The mild sauce is wonderful but their hot sauce is awesome!  The enchilada sauce has a very light and homemade taste, the beans are creamy and flavorful.    We will keep coming back.
