Ate at the outside bar. Season was our bartender and if you are lucky enough to have her be your bartender you are in for a treat. She is great!!!
We not only had a pitcher of margaritas but also lunch. I had the cilantro  jalapeÃ±o chicken breast and it was the best meal we have had in Vegas.

Updated: Season is no longer at Cabo Wabo Las Vegas
