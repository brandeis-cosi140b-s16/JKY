Oh My Gosh!!! I don't know where to begin...
We had my daughter's quinceanera here and it was beyond amazing!!! The owner/manager Lucia went above and beyond to make this the most amazing party ever. Her professionalism and attention to detail was second to none. I had people coming to me all night telling me how delicious the food was. Their food is always great so I had no doubt it would be good. But we had a buffet and the food was fresh and replenished and the wait staff were friendly and attentive to all of my guests. Even though they had another large party in the other part of the restaurant, our service was not in the least bit lacking.
Now...about the DJ! DJ Crazy was OFF THE HOOK!!! The mix kept everyone from the 15 year olds to the 50+ year olds dancing and partying the night away. He took my pictures that I had incorrectly formatted and turned them into a beautiful presentation that did not leave a dry eye in the house. 
I literally had someone tell me it was the most amazing and fun party she had ever attended.
If you are looking for the best venue in town with the best entertainment, the most delicious food and the highest professional and friendly staff in town, do yourself a favor and go see Lucia at Havana Grill.
Thank you for making my daughter's special day go off without a hitch.
