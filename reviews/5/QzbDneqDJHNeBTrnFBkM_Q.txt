With 2 teenage boys we eat a lot of burritos. We are closer to Pancheros and frequent Qdoba because of location but hands down Chipotle is the best. No comparison. The ingredients are just better and in over 100 visits we have been disappointed once on an overcooked quesadilla that they redid. Whole grain rice has been a nice addition.
