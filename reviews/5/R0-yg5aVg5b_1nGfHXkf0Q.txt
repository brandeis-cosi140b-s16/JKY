The food is a great experience in your mouth. The unique flavors and taste combine to give your taste buds a welcome change from the normal restaurants. The desserts with churros was great and adding the fresh strawberries made a combination that tasted great. 

Also this is a great place to bring family or just have fun and play the games here. A very welcome change. Try and you will learn that it is a fun experience.
