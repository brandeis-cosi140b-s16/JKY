I came here for lunch with my boyfriend on a whim; neither of us had been here before, and he thought it looked good, so I agreed. WOW, was I impressed!! Super nice service, very speedy and efficient. For lunch, I had their spinach enchilada plate with refried or pinto beans and 2 chicken taquitos. The taquitos were pretty good, although not distinguishable from taquitos I have had at other Mexican restaurants. What really blew me away, however, were the beans and the enchilada. SO tasty and fresh, and the flavours can't be beat! I will most definitely be back sometime.
