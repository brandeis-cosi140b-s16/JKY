My wife and I live nearby, and noticed this place opened up recently. The other day we decided to drop in and see if it was worth coming back to.  It's a cute little place nestled in a strip mall amongst other eateries.
A quick chat with the girl at the counter informed us that this was a family run business with authentic family recipes from Mexico City.
I ended up trying the Al Pastor(pork) and the Carne Asada(steak) La Gringa tacos, and my wife went with the Surf and Turf Shrimp and steak burrito.
The smells coming from the kitchen were making us salivate....and when the food came up it looked as good as it smelled. The flour shells  had just enough char on them to let you know that they had been kissed by an open flame. The meats were tender, juicy, and so full of flavor, with a deliciously sweet salsa! Each bite had me wanting more, and when my  wife asked to try a bite of mine, I was a little hesitant as the greed of a starved dog came over me. I did give her a bite though...lol!
She was equally impressed with her burrito and we will definitely be back!
Easily the best tacos I've ever eaten!
