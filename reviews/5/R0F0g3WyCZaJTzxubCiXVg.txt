It's a bit of a hole in the wall type experience. Nothing spectacular to see from the inside or out. Graffiti on the parking lot walls. There is a lack of decor on the interior, but it is very clean. The staff are always very friendly. I've never had bad customer service, which I think is very impressive. They recently raised their prices, but overall still a bargain. The food is DELISH!!! Try the shredded beef chimichanga.
