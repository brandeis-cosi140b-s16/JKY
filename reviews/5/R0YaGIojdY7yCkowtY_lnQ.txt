I enjoyed Cabo Wabo. The food was good and so was my drink. The drink was a little pricey but it is on the strip. The chips and salsa was really good. The chips were fresh and so was the salsa. We sat outside and it was nice to see the strip. The outside area is a little tight for space but it's not that bad.
