I've lived in Mexico for an extended period of time, so I can pretty easily identify authentic ingredients and atmospheres. This place has both, and I will definitely be coming back.

Me and my date went there in the early afternoon on a weekday, so we were the only ones there. We shared chips and guacamole, which was fantastic. I'm not usually one for gimmicks like guac made in front of you, but it was tasty. The tortillas used in the chips are made fresh in a glass room next to the restaurant, which is great to watch.

I had the chilaquiles with steak (tortillas with red sauce), and she had the carne en chile verde (braised pork in green tomatillo sauce). She was really happy with it, especially with the refried beans and rice. I've had better beans (they were blended, not my favorite texture), but overall both dishes were a success.

The atmosphere is great. It's in the basement of a great little Mexican grocery. I've bought mole sauce from them before, but had no idea there was a restaurant in the basement. Little touches, like the wood furnishings and lighting, really brought me back to Ensenada in Baja.

I've been dying for authentic Mexican since I moved here two and a half years ago. I'm glad that I have finally found it. We were very pleased, and I'm sure we'll be back.
