WOW.  excellent service and food.  our waitress was on the ball, even on a busy Saturday night.  we got more free chips/salsa without hesitation.  food was above average mexican, but good portioned.  easy to locate just off west sahara...big ol' building.  we would be back...and very much enjoyed our experience.  hubby ordered some big combo plate -- and he ate it up pretty fast.  i got a veggie quesadilla, yum!
