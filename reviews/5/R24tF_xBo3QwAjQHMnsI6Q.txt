Best Mexican food I've had since moving to Phoenix five years ago.   I had the menudo. mmmm.  It was subtly spiced and perfectly cooked. The handmade tortillas were served warm and thick.  My husband loved the carne asada burrito that he got, and he usually makes a face because he thinks everything is under-spiced...but not today!  We also shared a pastor taco and the pork was delicious.
