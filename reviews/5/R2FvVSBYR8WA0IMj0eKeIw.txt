Oh man, best place to get late night food ever!!  So many choices, and unlike most other cheapo mexican food places, this one does not make me sick after i eat there!  I absolutely LOVE the chimichangas and the california burrito with potatoes in it.  The enchiladas are awesome too, and you can see them prepare your food!  THe staff has always been friendly and the place is super clean, it does take a while to go through the drive through though. Also you get a ridiculous amount of food for your buck.  THe most i spend there is maybe $8 and i have at least two meals from it!
