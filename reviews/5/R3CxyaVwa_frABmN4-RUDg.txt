A friend of mine, who happens to be Hispanic, brought me tacos from this place...they were stone cold by the time they arrived but I was at work and starving so I didn't bother to heat them...they were foot stomping, mouth watering, DELICIOUS.  I was so impressed I immediately sent my husband a text and told him "ROAD TRIP this weekend!"

The restaurant is in Plaza Fiesta, a market place located right across from Carowinds.  It's nothing fancy...you walk up to a counter and order.  The menu is totally authentic...and in both Spanish and English.

Because we're total gluttons, my familiy of four ordered a taco assortment (four tacos---with assorted meats, onions, and cilantro), an enchilada platter, two different tamales, chips and queso and three different drinks (one melon and one pineapple).  We ate it all...every last bite...and it was FABULOUS.  

There's no real "service"...you order at the counter, are given a number and you pick it up when your number is called.  It's a no frills little joint but none of that really matters...the food is so rockin' good you won't want to be interrupted.

If you love Mexican food,  you owe it to yourself to try this place.
