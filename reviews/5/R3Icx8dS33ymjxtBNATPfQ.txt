We literally stumbled into this place after taking the tram from Mandalay Bay to the Strip! I saw the devil girl logo and had to go in for a drink! Happy Hour was underway and downed 3 tecate drafts for $3 each and my wife had 2 huge skinny girl margaritas! The chips and salsa although $4 were great. We were there long enough for them to spin the wheel and give a free jager shot to the girl who spun the wheel. As all the reviews say and the wife agrees the waitress were gorgeous and the bar tender we got was great! 

Diablo's is our new favorite kick-back bar on the Strip and we will definitely be back to try the food!!!
