These guys are one of the very few places that offer hot green chili, and they don't use jalape√±os to make it hot like lots of places do. If you're a chili head then you'll love the food here. The other nice thing is the sopapilla after the meal. Who doesn't like sopapillas? The best part was lunch for 2 was only $15.
