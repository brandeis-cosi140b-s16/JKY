My wife and I try a new restaurant almost monthly.  This was our first outdoor meal this year and a very pleasant surprise.  We ate under a palapa (grass umbrella) next to realistic looking palm trees.  Not your stereotypical Mexican restaurant, this place is really about seafood.  I have always loved the fresh seafood when we are in Mexico and these people do a great job.  The staff was prompt and courteous, bringing complimentary whole fried corn tortillas (tostada), green chile salsa, and ceviche that was refreshingly different and quite good.  The menu is extensive and varies widely in price (fish tacos to a platter of raw oysters, scallops, shrimp, abalone, crab legs etc).  The waitress was very helpful and told us which items were also designed to serve a party of 4 or more people (fun idea for future outing with friends).  The menu is Spanish with English subtitle ingredient summaries and there are pictures of most dishes on the menus and also above the windows.  At least I could read it without my glasses, I guess if you want a completely English menu, stick to Taco Bell.  The portions were more than we could eat.  I had Pulpo Diablo (Octopus in devil sauce) that had a some tang but not hot for the sake of hot.  Seafood is often overpowered and this was complimentary and delicious.  The presentation was nice with a lettuce, cucumber tomato salad , an orange slice and really good bread (see photo).  I found french fries a bit out of place, but I didn't have room to eat them anyway.  All in all a great experience and I can't wait to return and try other menu items.  I hope we can keep this unique seafood restaurant in the Madison area.
