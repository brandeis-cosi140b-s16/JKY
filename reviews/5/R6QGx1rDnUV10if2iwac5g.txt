WOW!  Is Henderson, NV lucky!  Sabor is the best Mexican Restaurant I have ever experienced.  The "chips and salsa" (sopas, chips, and extraordinary dips) started us off with a fiesta in our mouths.  We had traditional margaritas and they were tasty and powerful.  My wife had Tacos de Arracheta and I had Camarones Diablo.  The flank steak in her dish was so tender and yummy.  I must rave about the Camarones Diablo.  They are spicey, which I love, but all the flavor is there too.  The most delicious Mexican dish I have ever had.  I grew up near, and now live in, San Jose, CA so I have eaten a ton of Mexican food.  I pleaded with the owner, Scott Sousa, to come out to the Bay Area because we need Sabor and people would line up to pay and eat at his restaurant.  Henderson, NV doesn't know what a gem it has.  Big loss for us in California.  We will dine at Sabor as many times as we make it out to Las Vegas.  Hopefully Scott will open a Sabor in San Francisco or San Jose someday.  Until then, I will enjoy the memories and get out there as much as possible.
