Wonderful authentic Cuban cuisine and it is in the most surprising location in (near) Las Vegas.  We found it through our Garmin and picked it as we are familiar with Cuban cuisine. We love Cuban food!  We missed the Cuban entertainment, as we were traveling through and just wanted an interesting meal.  But it was not crowded and we were seated right away, a big plus when you are driving through.

I had the "Sandwich Cubano", and it was no ordinary sandwich.  The flavors were great.  Wife had the "Arroz Con Pollo" and since she is a great fan of chicken she reported it to be great.  BIL and SIL were with us, and they had no complaints.  They are picky eaters and shy away from "foreign" food, but it was a successful dinner and did not cost us an arm and a leg.

I would recommend this place and I gave it four stars +, and rounded up to 5 because they are doing such a good job.
