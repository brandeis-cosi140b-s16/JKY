I stopped in for a couple of beers one evening with my brother. Guedo s is a pretty cool place. The patios are big and have a tropical theme. Nice tropical bar and good happy hour specials.  I hear they have really good steak tacos and will be checking them out in the next week. The owner was bar tending that evening and he was a nice fellow. 

This place is really close to downtown Chandler and would be a great place to bring a group of friends.
