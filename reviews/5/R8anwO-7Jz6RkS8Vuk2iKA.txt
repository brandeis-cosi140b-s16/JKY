Uniquely prepared daily...sweet, tarty, sour, and spicy all combined to give just the right taste with every bite....my favorite were the moist juicy carnitas with dots of freshly made habanero sauce! It made my mouth water and my eyes tear....washed down with a Mexican sugar cane glass coke bottle!!
Great food at reasonable prices... Check it out!!!
