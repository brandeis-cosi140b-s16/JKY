I live in So Cal and there are a lot of Korean/Mexican style food trucks. I really like the fusion blend and I think that the flavors go together well. KoMex has really found a way to not only mix the flavors, but I think that they do it better than the others. Their food is less greasy and they have a big menu. 

The tacos are really good. I can easily motor down 5-6 of them. The wanton chips are a nice touch and they go great with the fusion theme. Everyone in our group liked the fried rice. Just be aware of the huge portion and the smell of kimchee that will ooze from your pores. 

Overall this is good food at a great price. You can easily stuff your face and keep that hard earned money at the same time. I think that the food is 4 star quality but the owner was so nice and she will not oversell you on the food. If you order too much she will tell you. For those reasons alone they get a bonus star.
