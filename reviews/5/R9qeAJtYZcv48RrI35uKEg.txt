I actually really like this place. You get a lot of bang for your buck here, most items are under $10 and are generously portioned.

The food is not excessively greasy or used with a lot of lard like most fast-food style Mexican tends to be. The meat is also very flavorful. 

The salsa bar is amazing. I am particularly picky about salsa and am typically disappointed by the salsa most joints offer, but Serrano's has such a wide variety of flavorful and spicy salsa that it has become half the reason I go there! 

I definitely recommend this place over any Roberto's or the like- the food quality here is much better and it has a better variety of menu options and flavors.

I highly recommend trying their tortas!
