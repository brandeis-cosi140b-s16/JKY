Absolutely the BEST!!!! I Seriously come here all the time, at least twice a week. This is in no way a hit-or-miss kind of place, there food is consistently delicious. 

Being from Mexico (Baja), I am incredibly picky when it comes to tacos... I moved here back in the summer of '05 and this is the only place in all of Arizona where the tacos, from the taste of the meat to the wonderful salsas, taste just like the ones from back home. 

When you dine in, they always bring you some free chips, and there salsa bar has a great variety of yummy topping to throw on their already yummy food. 

And guess what? If you're a sushi fan, I have had two different rolls so far and they are both AMAZING! 

Besides all the culinary masterpieces, the family that owns this small business are the most kindhearted and hard-working people I have ever met. Go and you will not be disappointed. 

A mis amigos hispanos: Si quieren unos tacos como los de casa, las mejores salsas, y el mejor servicio, TIENEN QUE IR! Despues de comer en Tacos Kissi, preparense para los antojos todos los dias!! Jajaja...
