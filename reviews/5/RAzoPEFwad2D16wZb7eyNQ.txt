This was, quite literally, everything I expected. Did we wait a bit for our food? Yes, but it's a popular spot on a Saturday night - I'd have been suspicious if there was no wait. Also, it was worth it. The burgers were tasty, they had plenty of topping choices and they made our burgers protein-style no questions asked. We'll be back for sure!
