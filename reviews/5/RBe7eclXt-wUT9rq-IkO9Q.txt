This place is thebomb.com. Favorite quick lunch spot in the southside, super vibrant and pleasant on the inside, and their food specials are incredible, especially with how little you pay. Everything on their set menu is excellent, as well. All of the employees are super friendly and passionate, too. A place like this has been needed in this neighborhood for years now, and I'm so glad a place like this exists here now.
