Quite possibly the nicest staff at any fast food place I have ever seen.  They are soooo nice and cheery.  Seriously, I want to call corporate and tell them to give these people raises or something.  My order is always right, extra sauce is always in bag, and when I order whoever is on the other end is super chipper.  Not fake, genuinely happy.  It's just refreshing.  Nachos bell grande, extra cheese, no tomato pls.  thank you.
