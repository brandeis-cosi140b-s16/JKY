Took the wifey there for her first time and it was nothing short of spectacular as usual. My co-workers and I eat there frequently and I kept telling my wife that I was going to take her there. The waitress was super nice, the food was absolutely amazing, and the first time experience for my wife was awesome. We will for sure be going back and taking the kiddos next time. You won't be disappointed when you eat at this place.
