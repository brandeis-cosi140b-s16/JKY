There are few places that miss you when you are gone, and this place did. I came in after a long hiatus from tortillas as I was dieting and when the lady at the counter took my credit card, she realized it was me.  She called to the back and couldn't believe I was there.  The kitchen staff said that we missed having you here during lunch and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with everything. Well I am.  Its just food this good needs to be taken in moderation, because it is easy to get carried away here.  Everything is good. I have crossed up and down the menu several times and when it come to cabeza and cachete(cheek) tacos and burritos, this is the PHX spot hands down.  Plus they let you load up your burritos with plenty of fixings before they fold it up perfectly for you. 

Its proximity to the State Capitol makes it my favorite quick taco between committee meetings or a great place to sit and debate policy over some tacos and horchata. 

So thank you to a place that makes you feel like you been away from home too long.
