This place is simply awesome. You can tell this restaurant is a labor of love. First off, you aren't going to find a fancy atmosphere here and honestly it's better that way, I wouldn't have it any other way. Secondly, the food is just insane, from the carne asada to the fish tacos to the lengua. It is all on point. All I need is a few tacos and a Jarritos and I am set! So glad to have a gem like this in Phoenix and it's worth a bit of a drive if you don't live super close. Honestly, I live for places like this. A++
