What a gem discovered thanks to Phoenix New Times naming it one of the Best Ten Tacos in Phoenix. Couldn't have been more correct.

Did exactly as New Times suggested and had THREE "Taco al Pastor!" Ambrosia! Waitress service, in spite of my not speaking Spanish, confirmed that I had made a great choice and also suggested I try the Coca Cola Mexico. (More on it later)

When the Tacos arrive they are quite lovely and just as described. Beautiful red-orange thinly sliced pork, obviously well marinated on perfect corn tortillas (my choice) topped with onion and cilantro. Homemade salsa, fresh lime and cilantro as well as some beans in a fabulous pungent liquid finish off the Presentation.

Don't let the barebones dining room turn you away and I can promise you won't be sorry.  My rule of thumb is that I won't do good Review unless I visit twice (will do a bad one after only one horrible visit) but I have taken that rule way too far with these Tacos from heaven. Let's just say my car can find Asadero Norte de Sonora on its own!  Check the hours because they are a bit strange but GO.

Now for the Coca Cola from Mexico. I am a former Coca Cola addict (NOT Diet), but hadn't had one in several years, because the last was absolutely awful and made me wonder what I ever liked about Coca Cola! Never had Coca Cola from Mexico. Different? AMBROSIA! I could become addicted to it, as well as this very special "hole in the wall" and its Taco al Pastor!
