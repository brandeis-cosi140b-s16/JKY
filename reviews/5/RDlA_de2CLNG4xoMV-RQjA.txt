First time at this Roberto's location. First off, the food is absolute delicious here. I ordered beef machaca burrito for breakfast and it was delicious. The flour tortillia was thin and  not caky like here in TX. I wish they make these types of burritos here in TX. If they do, I have not found that taqueria yet. I only seen this on the menu at IHOP around here. Roberto's makes good tacos and it's always my destination when I am in Las Vegas. Can't wait to come back again. I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves good authentic Mexican food. You will not r disappointed.
