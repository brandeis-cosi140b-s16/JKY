I've been a long-time fan of House of Tricks and Chef Kelly's work there, so it's no surprise that he's bringing it to the waltz, so to speak, just a few blocks away at The Revival. 

We swung by for lunch today and I had a fantastic short rib sandwich with great fries, while my lunchmates thoroughly enjoyed their grilled cheese, duck sliders, and reuben sandwich. The host and server were quick and took care of things, and while they're still getting their build-out situated, the food was completely fantastic. I'm excited to try out dinner.
