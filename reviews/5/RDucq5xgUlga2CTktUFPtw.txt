We strolled toward Marianas after dinner at the Crab Corner, and are very glad we had the nerve to come in.  English was spoken by the workers but it was definitely Mexican in clientele.  There is an outdoor taco stand on the sidewalk in front of it.

Great exotic ice cream flavors: corn, dragon fruit, cheese, rose petals.  I had a fruit ice called sepote that was delicious.  

Look at the pictures that somebody took and posted here on Yelp, come in and order something you've never had before.  

My wife had butter pecan, which they called nuez, and it was great.  Very rich and creamy.

The scoops are $2.50, $3.50 & $4.50, and the prepared dessert plates called funny cake, banana hawaiiana and banana split, etc., all pictured on the wall behind the counter, are $5.75. 

There are also a selection inside of pelotas, which appear to be exotic, handmade popsicles, but with textures. 

Delicious!
