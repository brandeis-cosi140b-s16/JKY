My girlfriend and I just recently moved here from the west coast and have been searching for burritos like home! Factory burrito has the best burritos in the whole Charlotte area! Sam, the owner stayed open an extra 30minutes just so we could get from Concord to Charlotte an enjoy burritos for dinner. Amazing owner, amazing staff, an amazing food!! My girlfriend and I recommend the wet California burrito you can not go wrong! Thank you Sam we will see you again soon!!!!
