Fantastic! I don't understand how this place isn't bangin' with a line out the door. Sushi, great flavors but I really got to agree with the other reviewer when she said she hasn't had tacos this good out of Mexico. Neither have I, and man have I been chasing that flavor. Carne Asada baby, with a side of sushi. Sounds gross? Oh no, its sooooo good. Damn!
