Always love trying new Mexican food joints. This one hit the spot with me. In a fan of a good fish consisting of 3 tacos and chips. Simple, and they do it great! 

The prices are great. . You won't find better street style tacos in this area. 

The hot sauces the have are incredible. . Red , Green (I think) and my absolute favorite their Habanero sauce!!! 

Give Rodolfos a chance, you'll enjoy it.
