Hands down, THE best shredded beef crunchy tacos I've ever eaten!  The tacos come fresh, they haven't been pre-cooked and warmed up when you order them.  The shredded beef has just the amount of spice and it's very moist.  I can't get enough of these things!

Their standard salsa is also very good.  The service is very attentive once you sit down.  They could use some decor & the chairs make the little hashmarks if you're wearing shorts, but you won't even notice because the food is THAT good.
