Thanks to a high "Yelpage" factor/rating we went to Don Pancho on a Saturday mid afternoon.  We were immediately greeted by great aromas and a very charming and amiable fellow who turned  out to the Nephew of the owner(s).  He gave us a great overview of the menu and exuded pride in what their food consists of and how it is prepared.  They have a great salsa bar and their chips are as good as any we have had.  All of our food was excellent and was brought out to all four of us at pretty much the same time.   What a great place!  We will be frequently returning.
