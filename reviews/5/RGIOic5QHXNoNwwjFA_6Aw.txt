My husband & I have been loyal customers at the Tatum & Shea location for twenty plus years! We absolutely love the atmosphere, food & of course stellar service! We always order our favorite Queso dip & yummy salsa appetizers or tostada bites & our usual entrees are the delicious jerk chicken salad & the amazing filet (medium rare) with Gorgonzola and we love to indulge on the yummy desserts also! Our favorite go to servers are Mike, Bubba, Angela, Stephanie, & Bailey! We truly feel our experience is based on the great management that has been in place over the years! Way to go Amedeo & Mike!
