We love, love, love, this place!!!!!!  When ever our family comes in from Orange County this is the first place they want to hit!!  The food is great and the service is great!  We never have to wait long to get seated, order, or for our food.  Make sure you order flour tortilla they are AWESOME!! We always go though a few orders of those.  Also the pina colada is served in a real pineapple.
