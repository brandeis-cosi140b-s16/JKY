ugHHhhhhh just had the spinach enchiladas and some really good maragaritas and I'm so satisfied. If you don't like spinach, their flautas are pretty O worthy. Anyways I could walk to this place, but being on the broke side a little can't afford to eat here too much SOOOOO THANK GOD FOR THEIR BUY ONE GET ONE 1/2 OFF....I went through like a ton of new times and ripped out some of them lol. 

Was there last thursday for my birthday. My friend and I drank all day at work and rolled in around 8 and sat at the bar...filled up on chips and salsa(which are yummy) had peach margaritas and ordered food to-go for a little later when we'd be craving it. Bartender was way cool, bought us some shots for my birthday. Had a thing called a DOgma which I regret because I felt it bad the next day. OOOO how i regret it :)
