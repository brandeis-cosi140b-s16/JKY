By far the best Mexican fast food spot in Las Vegas. I seriously drive out of my way to get some great eats when the fam wants Mexican. I have not been disappointed by anything here as of yet. 

Anything carne asada based from Fausto's is seriously over the top. I have ordered their nachos on multiple occasions and they fill me up every time. The rest of the menu is pretty standard until you taste it. Once you bite into anything that you've ordered from Fausto's for the first time you will ask yourself what took you so long to try it. 

The store is usually full of high school kids just hanging out having a good time. But they are respectful and of no bother to me. Compared to the rest Fausto's is genuinely the best. hahaha kinda corny but oh so true.
