I absolutely love this place. I usually avoid restaurants that are owned by celebrities. 

The chips are made fresh. My boys have made their way through most of the menu and have not been disappointed by any. I enjoy the seafood guacamole. Also, the fried plantains are to die for. They remind me of being in Belize.

We have introduced several friends and they have their new favorite spot.
