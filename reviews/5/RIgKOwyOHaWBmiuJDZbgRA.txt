I just tried this place with two friends of mine for lunch and it was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. I wish I would have taken a pic but before I knew it, it was gone.  One friend ordered Carne asada fries and they were good as well. I'll be back for sure and I'm sure my friends will as well.
