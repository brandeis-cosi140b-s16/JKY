Don't you just love it when...
You walk into a restaurant and you're treated like family.

Let me explain...
Was introduced to this place by my boyfriend who had frequented this marvelous place in the past. SO happy to have found a solid mexican restaurant. 
It's tucked away and doesn't look like much on the outside but the service is always so friendly and they always go above and beyond, plus it just feels like home. 

Tip: Ask for a side of enchilada sauce with your meal then proceed to drizzle that on everything, amazing stuff, I seriously wish I had the recipe!
