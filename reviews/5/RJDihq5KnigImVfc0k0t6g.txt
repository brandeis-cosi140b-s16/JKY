Tonight was the second visit for me and my wife since we moved to Matthews in early February. I am a big Mexican food fan and I think it's pretty hard to find a good Mexican place in North Carolina. I guess I've been spoiled since I lived in Arizona for a couple of months and have had it in California and Texas.

Nonetheless... out of all of the Mexican restaurants I have been to in NC, this one is my favorite. 

The first night we went, they had a guacamole cart and someone making it fresh in front of us. It was very good. In fact, it was the first time that my wife tried it - and she is a pretty picky eater - but she liked it. I didn't find it overly salty and the flavors all balanced each other out. 

I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the salsa. I personally like spicy stuff, so when the salsa is bland, I can pretty much count on the meal being bland. And that's NOT what Mexican food is supposed to be! That's what American food is. :-)
The salsa here is very good - cilantro, diced tomatoes, onion, and of course - tomato. It was decently spicy too but not overly spicy. 

I have had tacos, an enchilada, a chile relleno, and an avocado tostada. The tacos were really good, pretty standard but they had good flavor. I usually don't like enchiladas, but I liked the one I had here. I wasn't a huge fan of the chile relleno because it wasn't just a pepper with meat and cheese... it had some sort of batter that it was cooked in. I guess that's the style down here since the other places I have been had it the same way. 

The avocado tostada (my meal for tonight) was very delicious. I hadn't ever had that before, so I was being a little adventurous. It had a corn tortilla on the bottom, and was topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, and salsa. Everything was very good.

I will definitely be back and I hope that they stick around for a while!
