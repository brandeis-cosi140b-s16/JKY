I love this place. They've got a lot of unique grocery items that you can't find in a grocery store, but the best feature is their made-to-order tacos. On weekends, they have steak tacos. My husband says he prefers the pork tacos, and I say I prefer the steak tacos (we usually order 3 of each "with everything" and take them home), but truthfully, neither of us is smart enough to know which ones are beef and which ones are pork, but it doesn't matter, because every taco is delicious. I've ordered their burritos (take-out), and while they're fantastic, they're too big for me to eat. If you can eat a lot, order a burrito. If you'd prefer to take your meal in smaller increments, order yourself a few tacos, and buy some sour cream to go with them.
