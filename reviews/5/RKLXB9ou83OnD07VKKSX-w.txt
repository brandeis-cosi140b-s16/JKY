It was a wonderful experience and will definitely try again the food was fresh hot and made just like the authenticity it should be.  The presentation was wonderful and they definitely take that extra step to make sure that you enjoyed the food as well as the service. Even by the cook coming out to ask how everything is is a great touch of customer service. Now if they can have a margarita that matches the quality of the food I will be in trouble.
