I hardly ever get past their carne adovada. It's simply amazing. Add a couple of extra homemade tortillas to it? Can't be beat! I have had their pecan crusted sea bass also, along with lamb chops (chipotle?) both very, very good. Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff...a winning combination. Get there early! Long waits after 6:00pm!!
