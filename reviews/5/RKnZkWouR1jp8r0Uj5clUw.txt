Man, I love tacos. One day I decided that in order to find the best tacos in Las Vegas, I needed to eat at every highly-reviewed taco place in town. I started off at Los Tacos on Sahara, as it's closer to my side of town and consistently the best place to get delicious food. I love it there, but we're not talking about that right now...

I finally made my way to Tacos El Gordo after hearing increasingly good reviews about this place. I'd love to tell you not to listen to the hype, but LISTEN TO THE HYPE! THIS PLACE IS GOOD!

First of all, you should know this place is called Tacos El Gordo for a reason: it's pretty much just tacos. Don't come in here expecting a Taco Bell-like menu of made-up "Mexican" meals... nonsense! It's just tacos here, and great ones, at that! (It's not really "just tacos"... they have like three other things on the menu, but that's just because they're based on a taco-like construction)

I come here and always order the same thing: "Hola, me puede dar cuatro tacos de asada?" Yes, I ask for four carne asada tacos, and I always have to talk myself out of getting 5 or 6 or 14. The tacos are amazing here. Plus, you can watch the lady make fresh tortillas right in front of you! It's awesome! It really just ups the ante here!

Again, the food here is good, quick, and cheap ($2/taco). And it's extra cool because you can grab your food, then go up and pay for it after. It was confusing at first, but it works. 

My only gripe with this place? It's right next to the classic Los Tacos. I feel that Los Tacos has better carne asada, and their menu is a lot more varied, but it's in a different category. Los Tacos is a lot more bare-bones deliciousness, where Los Tacos. It isn't really a weakness as much as it highlights how basic this place is.
