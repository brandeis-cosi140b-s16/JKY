This place is just awesome.   Nachos are the best I've ever had .   Tacos are great and even better on taco Tuesdays  when the are just a dollar each.  Salsa bar has 6 or 7 different homemade salsas.  Very reasonable prices.  Spent twenty bucks for food, drink and tip for 2 people.  Could not even finish the nachos.
