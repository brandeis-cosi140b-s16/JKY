Incredible, authentic flavors. MUST try the adobada mulas style (animal style) on corn tortillas...it comes with salty Mexican cheese, salsa, cilantro, fresh lime and creamy avocado sauce. This is by far the best taco I have ever eaten! Corn tortillas are homemade, flavors of the meat, salsas, and cilantro combined are such a vibrant taste. Reasonable prices and an absolute must stop!
