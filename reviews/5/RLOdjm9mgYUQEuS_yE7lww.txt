OMG......We have always liked the Barrio Cafe, so we thought we'd try this as well. The Tuesday Tacos were individual and beyond mouth watering......3 would have been a meal. However, I ordered Pozole too, and it was the BEST I have ever tasted!!! It was a lot of food, but worth the experience for my taste buds,,,,,TRY THIS PLACE......you'll love it!!!!
