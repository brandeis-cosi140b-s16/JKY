Enchiladas and mimosas. Burritos and bloody Mary's. Tostadas and Martinis. These are all Mexican food and alcohol combinations that you're not going to be eating here, because when a place is called tacos and beer then you better order some tacos and beer. Capiche? Now when I hear tacos and beer, I was expecting a tiny little place with 3 types of tacos and some cervezas. I walk into this place and was immediately taco slapped in the nostrils with some sweet sweet smells. Me and my crew had tacos going up..on a Tuesday and these tacos so good, we ain't choosy. These tacos here are well made you can tell they pay attention to detail. My two favorites were the chicken tinga and the al pastor. I also got to try the shrimp, the fish and carne Asada. All sorts of delicious and I can honestly say this was the first time I've had mashed potatoes in a burrito, so I tip my sombrero to you. 
As you, my astute reader, have noticed, I haven't mentioned the beer part of tacos and beer. Worry not, because they hold it down. I expected a few beers, but this place had a whole book for beers, I only got to down a few IPAs and some tequila shots, because when life hands you lemons, pretend they're limes and do tequila shots. If you're a beer nerd then come right on down
They have a few other menu items like tamales and enchiladas, and they offer margaritas. I didn't get to try them and I'm not bothered because if you come to a place named tacos and beer then you damn well better order some tacos and beer
