Found this place thanks to Yelp!  Go Yelp!  These two guys are the real deal.  Making great Mexican food and taking care of business.  The portions are huge and the meats are outstanding.  I had two tacos and they were both wonderful (carne asada and al pastor).  We had the fresh guacamole and it was so good.  Coke comes in bottles.  Still have the World Cup brackets posted with Alemania winning it all.  (Mexico, maybe next time?)  It is very close to the big mall, and a much better choice.  It's back from the main road, in a strip mall behind the frontage businesses.  Way worth the stop!
