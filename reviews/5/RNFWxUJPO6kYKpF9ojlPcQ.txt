Went here for happy hour after work (5:00pm) on a Friday night and my party (of 2) was able to be seated right away.  I really liked some of the artwork hanging in the restaurant.  We ordered several types of tacos and loved them all.  Even more impressive was the well stocked salsa bar ranging from cheese causes and mild salsas to some that really make your mouth burn.  I had a great time here and will definitely go back.
