I love this place for breakfast . I'm sorry to post this that I will shoot myself in the foot by this place is going be packed for MY BREAKFAST Time. The food is american with a Mexican twist. Plan on putting in some sit down time to talk to your people, the service is a little slow but it is worth the time. On a big party, good luck and have patience.
The food is Great, Don't  play around with the cooks.
Plus to and to this, Great job to the COOKS
