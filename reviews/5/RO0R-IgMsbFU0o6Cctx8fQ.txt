Best lunch spot in all of NW Vegas.  My absolute fave item on the menu is the blackened salmon burrito. In my humble opinion this is the most yummy-licious item they offer.  Bonus - every entree item comes with chips.  And while you wait for your order there is a salsa bar that you can help yourself to.
