Went in for some late afternoon eats with few expectations for we were unfamiliar  but we were pleasantly surprised.  Enjoyed the everything guacamole, chorizo fries, four assorted tacos and some NV beer.  Christian (owner/chef) was super hospitable and gave us many insights into his 'waste not want not' style of cooking, using whole local goat and pig for his prep. Highly recommend and will return.
