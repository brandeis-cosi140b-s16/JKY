Wow. Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. Sure, it's not a hole in the wall, and the menu is pretty standard. But, the quality is fantastic. I had the chimichanga, nachos, and taquitos. Wow. The guacamole is on point as well. Our server did a great job with us (party of 12). He was quick to refill drinks and explain various menu items. Highly recommended.
