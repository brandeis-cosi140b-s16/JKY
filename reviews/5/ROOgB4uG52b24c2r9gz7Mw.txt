I've never used the cumulative points system to review a place, not until now. 
Here goes nothing.

Three stars for the ample parking in front of their plate glass front window, allowing you to watch as a group of bangers eyeball your car. 

Minus three for the multiple magazine racks blocking the entrance, all of which advertising pretty, young, Latina escorts who will change your life. (not in a good way).

One for the salsa bar. 

Three for the food. I had number eleven, the Machaca plate. Seven bucks...pretty tasty and a ton of it.

Minus five for the men's bathroom..where it appears that at some point in its bathroom lifetime, death went in there and died.

Add two more for the server, whose Sharpie'd eyebrows resembling a surprised clown make you chuckle to yourself. 
Another for her tits.

A star for your bravery, coming to South Phoenix in the first place.

Another for the 19" tv in the corner broadcasting Mexican soccer.

Minus three for the loud Mexican tunes blaring from what sounds like car speakers.

And five for the tres leche cake dessert. A must try.

Oddly, that somehow adds up to six. 
Something is seriously wrong with this method.
