My favorite Mexican restaurant!  They have the best enchiladas I've ever had!  I've had enchiladas at just about every Mexican restaurant in town as well as in many in other cities and none comes even close. The service is always good. Some have complained here that they get to choose their own place to sit. I wouldn't complain about that--I think that is a plus!  I also agree with those who like Amy. She's a great waiter.
