Finally stopped here for lunch after reading about them and their great food in every local magazine.  I ordered the carnitas taco and the carbon taco with a side of rice and beans and horchata to drink.  It was a great meal all around.  The tacos are cooked to order and both were very flavorful, probably some of the best carnitas I have had.  The black beans had great flavor to them as well as the rice.  The horchata was great and not overly sweet like many places serve.  Will definitely be going back here.
