Don't be fooled by the casual atmosphere and fair prices, the food here is soooo good! The girl who helped us was really nice and patient, as I probably asked her about everything on the menu before deciding on carne asada tacos. They were really delicious, and I loved the chips and salsa bar. This was some of the best Mexican food that I have ever had, and other places at the same price point do not even compare To Garnachas. I wish that we had one of these where I live, because I would be eating here on a weekly basis if that were the case. Local people are lucky to have a gem like Garnachas. I will make sure to visit every time I'm visiting in Vegas.
