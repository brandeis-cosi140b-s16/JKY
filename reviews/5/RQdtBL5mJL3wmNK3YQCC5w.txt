This place deserves more than 5 stars. This is how homemade Mexican food is suppose to taste like. My mom told me about this place and ever since then we go there every time there's a special occasion. We would go every weekend if this place was a lil closer than home. I always order their shredded beef enchilada plate that includes bean and rice. Absolutely amazing. The sauce was the perfect hint of spicy to it. The meat was fresh as well. Bean and rice is my favorite. Also! This place has a great price for how much food you get. It's delicious and I will recommend anyone there for Mexican food. Love it!
