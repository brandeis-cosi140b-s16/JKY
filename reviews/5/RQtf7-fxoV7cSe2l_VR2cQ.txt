Feeling like GOOD Mexican food for dinner I had the idea of eating at Leticia's. We loved it so much the time we ate here before despite the ordeal we went through (see my previous review for details) that I knew it wouldn't be long before I had some of this yummy food in my tummy.

I was so pleased with the "Happy Hour Menu". It runs Mon-Fri from 3-6 pm. You can get margaritas 50% off! They have other food items starting at $2.50. We tried the "Cheese Quesadilla" and "Chorizo Taco". Both were well worth the regular menu price but getting them and just a great discount is just a bonus! They had other things like nachos, toastadas etc.

I tried the "Carnitas & Carne Asada Tacos" tonight and they were just so tasty. The rice that comes with it is good but the beans are the winner. The beans are thick and have great flavor.

The "Fried Ice Cream" is very yummy!

My experience as far as service and the food and restaurant are the same. Excellent.

I wanted to update my review to let others know about the happy hour menu and the quality and consistency of Leticia's.
