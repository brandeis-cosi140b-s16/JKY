Wifey and I have been dining here for 4 years now, and we really like it. Its too spicy for some, and we have tried nearly everything on their menu, with only one or two disappointments. Price is right, the salsa and chips are great, decor is funky and colorful, service is just OK sometimes. Best stuff on the menu- White sands Chimichanga is great! The Fundido cheese appetizer is fantastic as well. Chili Colorado is spicy and one of my favorites, as well as the Grande Nachos. Breakfast on weekends only is a killer bargain, and the New Mexican eggs benedict is a winner! Very, very cheap as well. I am not sure why this place has received such mediocre reviews, as its not generic & boring Mexican food such as Macayo's, Garduno's, Manuel's, or Garcias!
