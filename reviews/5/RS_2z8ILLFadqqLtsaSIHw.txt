If you're in the mood for some delicious New Mexican food, THIS is the place to go! The portion sizes seem small, but in reality, they're perfect; especially following a round of yummy chips and salsa. As an appetizer, we ordered a Mexican pizza with green chilis (not on the menu, but pretty much a staple anywhere), which was a great way to start off the meal. As an entree, I ordered the beef chimichanga. The beans and rice were fantastic; lots of flavor, and the chimichanga was amazing! It was nice and crisp, and the beef was shredded perfectly (no chunks, gross...). For a table of four, the prices were good, and the service was even better. We had a fantastic waiter who was very much on top of everything we needed, and was very fast. One recommendation: make sure to make a reservation. We didn't have a reservation and ended up waiting about an hour before being seated.
