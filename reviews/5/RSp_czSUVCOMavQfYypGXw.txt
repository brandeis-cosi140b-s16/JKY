I got the Beef Fajita tacos as that is what the guy Isaac recommended ($6.99). It was very good. Tender & seasoned beef, avocados, onions, veggies & jalape√±os in a soft shell. Food came out quick & fresh. And Isaac was very friendly. Thumbs up. Great place for something real quick to eat. They have a restaurant next door too which seems nice.
