This is the best sitdown Mexican restaurant we have found in the East Valley. We have never tried a bad dish here, and we can be quite the Mexican food snobs. The El Jefe f chimichanga always hits the spot, the flavor in the steak is amazing!  Plenty of flavor without the pitiful attempt to add taste  to the meat after cooking it with pico de gallo and other sauces, which other restaurants often try to pull off. Love this place!
