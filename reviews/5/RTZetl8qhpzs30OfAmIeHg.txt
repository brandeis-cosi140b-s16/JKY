If you're looking for authentic Honduran and Mexican food, this is one of the good ones. In an unassuming strip mall between Eastway Dr. and Sharon Amity Rd, this no frills, hole in the wall has some of the heartiest and comforting Central American food I crave.

Their hearty meals usually have ample portions and after eating there about five times, I've noticed everything I've tried is a little greasy and a tad salty. But the right kind of salty, more like tasty curly fries rather than cheap microwaved ramen.

It's the perfect place to treat yourself for lunch. Warning though, an afternoon siesta is mandatory post-meal. It happens whether you want to or not, just deal with it.

Highly recommended, it's the little things like the pickled onions and salad with a healthy slice of avocado that transport me to another place and get all the little pleasure neurons firing in the brain. Really the closest thing in Charlotte you'll get to the streets of Tegucigalpa.
