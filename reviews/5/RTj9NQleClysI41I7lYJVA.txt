OMG so I 1st tried it in California near Redondo beach...(I must say I'm a true Cali Girl) But this place in Phoenix is the best I got a huge salad with chicken and lots of toppings no extra charge! My son got a carnitas taco very nice not greasy it was crispy just the way they are supposed to be ,salsa was very authentic and spicy. I highly recommend Chronic tacos. Chipotle has nothing on these guys this is authentic Mexican Cool style food!!! The staff is awesome and very busy. Love it!
