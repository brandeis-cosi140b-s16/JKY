I am amused by the hilariously unclassy poster/sign they have on the right side of the building advertising beer with some stripper chick. But Taco Mich has the tastiest little tacos I've ever put in my mouth. I always order two fried pork tacos and two marinated pork tacos. They're tiny but wonderful. 

They speak Spanish. Really, I'm pretty much the only white guy, they call out order numbers in Spanish, I had to Google for a translation so I didn't stand there sputtering like an idiot gringo. 

Lots of bottled beers in the  customer-accessible fridge. Broad menu selection, too, they have burritos, chimichangas, and more. I also order rice and beans on the side, which tastes plain but not bland and still very good and not cheap or crap quality. Rice is a little dry. EDIT: The rice isn't so dry anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)

I also order horchata. Delicious, if over-sugared. EDIT: The horchata's not so over-sugared anymore, maybe they saw the review. ;)

This is one of my favorite taco joints! Mas por favor!
