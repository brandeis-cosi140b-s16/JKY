THE BEST Mexican food ever. I can't tell you how happy I am that this place is so close to me. Everything is always so fresh  - I've never been disappointed in the quality of the food here. I even enjoy the menudo here more than the one at Pepe's but the only downside to that is they only serve it on weekends and they're usually sold out :( I guess they only make a batch a day? I don't know. I just take it with a grain of salt and pray to the menudo gods that I'm lucky enough to have another bowl.

The worst experience I had was in the drive-thru. A woman with bright red hair forgot a COUPLE of times that we were outside waiting for our food. One time we waited 20 minutes. It was stupid, especially because we were the only ones in the drive-thru. Anyway, that's not enough to stop us LOL. My suggestion is go inside and get your food. And stock up at the salsa bar! They always have the freshest onions, cilantro, etc.
