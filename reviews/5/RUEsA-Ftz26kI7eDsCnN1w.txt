This place is always exceptional! The carne asada is amazing! I'm pretty sure it's family owned because it's always the same people running the place. The service is great and they are very nice. My boyfriend is super picky and they are always patient with him and make sure to verify the order. It's hard to eat in house because of the nail place next door, there is a smell but they do to-go. Seriously delicious food and salsa though!!
