I love this place. The Mexican rice is the best I've ever had. The Ahi tacos are my favorite item. All the ingredients are very fresh, and the flavors are perfectly balanced. The margaritas are a little pricey, but they are hand made not crappy sour mix that's been laying around all day. The margaritas are $5 at happy hour so go at that time if you want to save a couple bucks. The carne asada is very tender. It's not dry or rubbery at all. Try this place. You will be glad you did. The tortillas are the bomb and guac is awesome too.
