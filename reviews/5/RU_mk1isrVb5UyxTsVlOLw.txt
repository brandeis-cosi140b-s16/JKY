Best deal ever.  We stayed at the Wynn...but didn't want to pay Wynn prices for the late night munchies.  This place was crazy busy at 2am.  I ordered 2 carne asada tacos w/ everything.  Came with guacamole, too...for $2 each. They had a bar with radishes.  Only complaint is that I'd love to see a salsa bar.  At $2 a pop, I can't complain. They had plenty of seating outdoors. Super yummy and will be on my must do list from here on out.
