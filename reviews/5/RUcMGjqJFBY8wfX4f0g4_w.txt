We ended up here Saturday afternoon as we waited for the ASU tailgating scene to get going (which it never really did).  $2 Coronas on a game day + beer pong were still a winning recipe.  Sure you play the beer pong with water in the cups (state law?) but the drinks are still waiting tableside for the losers.  Random fact: if you win your beer pong game, you can sign the table.
