Flicka's is amazing!!! Flicka's couldn't have been a better setting for my 10 year high school reunion. Flicka helped with getting us all set up from food to drinks. I received so many compliments of the location, the setting, and the food. The food was perfect and all the guys were happy that they could go back for more. And of course our bartenders and waitresses were awesome! Thank you for making it a memorable night!
