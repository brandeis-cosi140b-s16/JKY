I am so excited to have a new go to place on the East side of Madison! We came in and sat at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender (Craig) & given menus. We were also told about their happy hour specials. We ordered half price margaritas, which were served in a pint glass and tasted fantastic. I must warn you, these are potent! We also ordered a 1/2 order of Nachos ($4), which came out heaping a large plate that was more than enough for 2 of us. No processed cheese in sight:) After polishing those of, we went for it and ordered some tacos off the street food section of the menu. We got a few with jerk chicken, that brought the heat and others that were packed with carnitas. At approx $2 each, these were a great deal and came out on warm corn tortillas with toppings such as pickled onions, chimichurri, fresh cilantro, etc. (As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about when I can stop by for more tacos) Each time that we ordered, our food was out in approx 10 minutes, which was fast considering how busy the bar was. I found the bartenders to be engaging and attentive. It's great to see the old Fyfe's come back to life and we will definitely be back!
