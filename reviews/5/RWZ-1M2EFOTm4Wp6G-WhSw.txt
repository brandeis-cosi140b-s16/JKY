I have to say this was a super experience although the he cashier was new and she had to ask for help it was a great experience. The new cashier is lacking personality but she is new and probably nervous. The manager on the other hand is super personable, upbeat attitude and attentive! He's doing a great job. The place is super clean and well maintained. My food  was good, it's Taco Bell and it didn't taste old like a lot of other taco bells Ive been too.
