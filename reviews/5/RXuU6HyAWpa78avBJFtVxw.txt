I saw this place in the corner of my eye when I went into the smoke shop nearby and I decided I wanted to give them a try since I'm always looking for good Mexican food. At first I was a little hesitant because I wasn't sure what to expect. I  am glad that I decided to walk in and try them! If you want home style Mexican food then you have to come here! This place reminds me of where I grew up (Globe, AZ). 

I went ahead and got me a simple red chili burro and I loved it! 

The place is clean, but it is small. 

I cannot wait to go back and try some more food!
