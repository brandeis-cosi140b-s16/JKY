You are probably already addicted to this healthy fast food choice with a great concept and pricing. If you traveled from cali, you are most certainly spoiled to find it wherever you go, but once you hit the strip, its damn hard to find a chip!

Until now Chipotle fanatics been hustling and constrained to the one location on strip, squeezed right in between Harrahs and Casino Royale. But time has come, a brand new location just opened in Miracle Mile Shops in Planet Hollywood where you can have your favorite meal in a brown recyclable paper bag. You can sit inside or at one of their tables in the shopping mall. Same old stories, no surprises.

So why would you go to Vegas and eat the usual stuff? 
First: Its fast and damn good (Time is vital in Vegas)
Secondly: Its a cheap meat with high quality food (Last longer)
Thirdly: Because you dont always have the mood to go fancy (Rough night?)
