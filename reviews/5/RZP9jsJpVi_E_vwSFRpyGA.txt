Love this place.  Menu is varied, but not overwhelming.  There's a kids' menu.  Drinks are great. Hostesses are always friendly and our waiters/waitresses have always been friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. They take their time with their customers.  Food has always been good or great with every visit and reservations are welcome. Restaurant is only noisy when there's a loud party. Of course we'll be back!  Very kid and group-friendly.
