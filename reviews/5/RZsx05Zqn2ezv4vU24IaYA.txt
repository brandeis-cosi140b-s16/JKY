We finally found our new favorite eatery!  This was a great place & if you check in you get this fantastic margarita for 1cent!  
The atmosphere is very nice, upscale & plenty of room. Lot's of outdoor seating. 
We were lucky to have Angel as our server. He was great!  Funny & informative & super knowledgable about the menu. 
The food is fantastic. Great flavors. Hubby had chili relleno. Fantastic. I had mushroom & spinach enchilada. Another fantastic. Tres leche for desert & super fantastic!  Our new favorite place. We used to be fans of Jalepeno Inferno, but this puts them to shame. Go to Hacienda. You will not be sorry.
