This place is awesome! I went here before with my boss and I had their Machaca tacos...and this is when I fell in love with Machaca. 

I went here again for breakfast this time with my boss. I had the Machaca con Huevos and oh my...it was amazingly delicious! The really cool thing about going here for breakfast was that they still serve chips and salsa right way. It was great! They have traditional chips, but they're chips are like wontons. It's really good!

Service has been great every single time I've been here. It's a definitely must-try place. Enjoy!
