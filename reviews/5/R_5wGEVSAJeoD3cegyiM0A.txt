My family and I love coming to Rosita's. I like most everything here. I am not spelling it right but i love the machaka burritos and tacos. Chips and salsa are the best. The only thing i stay clear of (and this is at all Mexican food restaurant's not just Rosita's)  is the shredded chicken because it tastes boiled and bland. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great Mexican food.
