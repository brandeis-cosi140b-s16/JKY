Had a coupon so ventured out to this newer Mexican restaurant. We were really glad we did. Happy hour prices are great. The grilled shrimp appetizer was so good that I had to stop my husband from buying a second serving. The entr√©es were fresh made and excellent. We are looking forward to going again.
