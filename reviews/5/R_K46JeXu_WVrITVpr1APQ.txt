As good as it gets. I've never had mole this good. Ever. 

The Tamal Oaxacaeno is absurd. The Tlayudas are unreal.

Next time someone tries to tell you that San Diego has better Mexican food than Phoenix, remind them that La 15 y Salsas exists, and end the argument. 

As good a meal as you'll ever eat.
