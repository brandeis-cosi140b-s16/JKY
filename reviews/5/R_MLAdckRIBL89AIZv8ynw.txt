For a whole in the wall place, I loved it! Honestly, I almost walked out to go try somewhere else. But I read the prior yelp reviews and hoped for the best. It was well worth it. I got a Shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combo with all rice, not a huge bean fan of any sorts. It was awesome served on a real plate restaurant style. Plenty of lettuce and tomato on the side as a sort of extra side. The enchilada sauce was delicious and very authentic, could tell it was home made and didn't have Cinnamon in it, if there was any there, I couldn't tell. Some homemade sauces have too much Cinnamon. I left wishing this was closer to where I lived but I will find an excuse to come back for sure. If you are craving Mexican food and are in the area, be sure to check this little gem out. It beats the pants off of Filberto's and even some nicer Mexican restaurants. They even serve coke in the bottle, yum!
