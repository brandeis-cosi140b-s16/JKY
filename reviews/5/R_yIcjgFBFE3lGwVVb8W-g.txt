I finally got to try this new neighborhood joint. It was GREAT. The staff was enthusiastic and gracious, the price was reasonable (even a bit low given the quality of the food), and the food was fantastic. Hand-crafted tortillas, custom-built, fire baked enchiladas with a multitude of fillings, amazing sauces, and killer soup means I will be back. 

I had 2 enchiladas with spinach-mushroom filling, the smoky red sauce, and topped with pickled onions, slaw, and 3-chile vinaigrette. I also had soup with no meat and added a dollop of super-flavorful mashed potatoes. 

If you go right at noon on a weekday, expect the lunch crowd crush to make parking and eating in a challenge. I got there at 11:45 and had no trouble. 

If I were trying to grab a quick lunch with a friend during work, I would probably be prepared to send one person in to place a to-go order while the other person drives around the block. 

Support this little gem. The building has been empty for so long, and I hear rumor that a Qdoba or ZTejas is being built right across the street. It is up to the locals to keep local options alive!

PS please consider adding packs of a dozen tortillas to go to your menu. I would definitely buy them to have at home.
