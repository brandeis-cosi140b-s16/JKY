Working in Charlotte for a month. Stayed very close to Azteca and we couldn't stay away from this place it was good the 4 times we visited! I have been to a good 25+ mexican restaurants back at home in NYC and plenty in Texas, this by far the best I've had. 

Would definitely recommend, come hungry they have combo diners that are huge plates. Will need to be rolled out when your done eating lol. A+
