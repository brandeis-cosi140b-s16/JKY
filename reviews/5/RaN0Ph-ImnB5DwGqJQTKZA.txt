This place was absolutely wonderful.  I had a lunch special, fajitas that had chicken and chorizo.  Everything was delicious and at $6.25 was a fantastic price. That price included a soda.  I would recommend all of my friends to go here everytime they are in Charlotte.  I will be back.  Can't wait to visit this place again. :)  The customer service was great as well, smiling and polite and brought my food out quickly.
