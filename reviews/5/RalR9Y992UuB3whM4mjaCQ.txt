Went to the Mission today for a nice Saturday brunch

Some old people relatives of mine were in town, so we made reservations and all together we were 10 people.

The server was super sweet, food came out quick, drinks were refilled, the manager stopped by multiple times to make sure we were taken care of.

And the food....
Oh sweet sweet brunch food with a Latin twist.

We got a couple orders of the tableside guacamole ($12 for a teeny bowl!  Yikes!).  The guacamole was absolutely delicious, and they can adjust the spiciness and ingredients to your liking.

For my main meal, I got the corn pancakes topped with crab and some creme chile sauce.  YUM YUM YUM.

My main squeeze got steak tacos, and holy crap were they good!

I can't wait to go back to this place.  I really, really, really liked it.
