My absolute FAVORITE Mexican food location in the ENTIRE valley. Most authentic you can get right here my friends. The best part, they make their tortillas fresh, yes. FRESH for every order. 

I'm usually just a Carne Asada fan but their incheladas are amazing. My friend has had the lengua and machaca. All yum! Along with their chimichangas! They even do menudo and chili rieno to die for! This place reminds me of home. 

3 Carne Asada tacos to go, please!
