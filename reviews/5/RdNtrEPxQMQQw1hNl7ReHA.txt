I love this place.

My partner and I live in Minneapolis, and while there is some decent Mexican food here recently, we crave the good stuff when we are traveling closer to the border.  

I think we saw Los Dos Molinos on a TV show about hot food, or something like that.  So when we were in town we drove out to the restaurant.  I can't really comment on crowds (as some reviewers have done) since we were there at a slow time of day.  

Service was attentive.  We ordered beer and enjoyed the chips & (hot!) salsa.  And then we got our food.  I think I went through several beers during the meal-- bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  Bite of (HOT!) food, sip of beer.  And so on.  But the (HOT!) food was so good (as was the beer) that I couldn't stop myself from finishing the whole (HOT!) meal.  I'm not always a spicy-food guy, but I loved it.  My face was sweating, the food was so spicy!  My partner was laughing at me about it; it was all good.

So, to sum up:  It was really, really tasty.  Hot and tasty.  It is absolutely like nothing in Minneapolis, and I miss it.  We will be visiting again, next time we're in town.
