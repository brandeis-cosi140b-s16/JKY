I've been to fuzzy's multiple times on mill. And it it amazing, witch is why I drive from central PHX all the way to Mill Ave in Tempe for more. But I wanted to try out there new location on 44th st. And Thomas , guess what.... Still amazing and great customer service . They came up consistently  asking if they could get me anything or if I was enjoying my food. Either way , I recommend going to either location!!!! A++ in my book!
