This place was very good!  The chips and salsa were served promptly.  Our server was very friendly.   I ordered the traditional chicken fajitas, and they were excellent!   This place earned my 5 star rating because my friend accidentally left his credit card there, and when he called the next day, one of the waitresses turned it in to the manager.
