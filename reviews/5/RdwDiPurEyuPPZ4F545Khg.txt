This is my favorite place for Mexican food and have been going here for years. I usually order the same thing, so haven't tried everything on the menu. I don't know why, but the newer Top Shelf in Peoria just doesn't taste the same. The lunch menu is very reasonable and there's always coupons to be found in the flyers in the mail...although I think the prices are reasonable.
