Call ahead for faster service.  #15 flauta special is very good.  Excellent salsa, tortillas, chips.  If you are feeling especially decadent, order the butter tortilla, heaven.  #9 crunchy tacos with beef are also a favorite.  This place is fortuanetly, or unfortuanetly, 2 minutes from my house.  It is addicting.  No fuss, just good authentic mexican food.
