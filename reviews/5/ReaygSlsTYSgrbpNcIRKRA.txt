I was visiting LV for a conference and coming from CA I'm used to good Mexican food. When the valet at my hotel told me the place was goooood and to bring him back a surprise I wasn't worried at all.  The place is divey for sure, but it's great! I had the chilaquiles (a personal favorite) and they didn't disappoint.  It was so good I brought 5 CA colleagues back with me for dinner the same day. They were pleased with their meals as well - we all cleaned our plates.  One person said the tortilla soups was "out of this world" and another said the beans were nice a light - it's so easy to make them heavy.  It's in a strip mall and easy to miss, but make the U-ie and try again - it's worth it!
