The first time I ended up here, it was because it was within walking distance of my hotel, and why not? It was so good that I rearranged my next cross-country trip to stay in the same hotel, so I could eat here again. I love it!

They're pretty proud of serving everything all day, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The variety is amazing, but everything my kids and I ordered was really good. I focused heavily on Mexican breakfast foods, but my sampling of other dishes that my kids ordered suggest everything is equally delicious.
