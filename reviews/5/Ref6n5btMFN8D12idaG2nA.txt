Cocina Oaxaqueña is a hidden gem in the strip mall just northeast of the intersection of 19th and Bethany. Since moving to the area, it was essential that we find a new local mexican food joint. C-Oax had been on my radar for some time before I finally stopped in. As most mexican joints are sonoran, it's always a nice change of pace to visit a restaurant that does things differently. Here, mole, black beans, and a delicious salsa verde headline my visits. The restaurant is clean and the service is always excellent. I'm thrilled to have Cocina Oaxaqueña as a neighborhood mexican dining option.
