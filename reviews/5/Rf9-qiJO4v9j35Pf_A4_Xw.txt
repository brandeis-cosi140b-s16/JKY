Ate here because I was craving tacos. The price was good for what it came with, Everything: Onions, Cilantro, Guacamole & Lettuce. The salsas are also very tasty, my favorite were the hotter ones. The employee at that moment was working alone, managing both taking orders and making the orders. She was very polite and professional also speaking fluent English & Spanish which is a big plus! Her name was Maria.
Sorry to hear it's going to close soon, I'll try to be back before that happens!
