Whenever I'm craving a quesadilla I come straight here. There's just something about them that makes it so delicious. Maybe it's the cheese? I also always order a bag of chips to dip in my guacamole/salsa. There's many burrito options here, you can make almost anything you want. One of my favorite little Mexican spots.
