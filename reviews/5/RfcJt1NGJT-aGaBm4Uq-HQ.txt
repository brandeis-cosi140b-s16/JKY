My husband and I tried Chronic Tacos located on W Peoria Ave shortly after they opened. I know this review is long overdue but better late than never. 
The tacos I ordered were fish and my husband had beef. They were really tasty, hot and delicious. The seasonings on both the fish and beef were really tasty. The owner came by our table and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. He was friendly and personable. The tortilla chips were crispy and the salsa was yummy with nice chunks of tomato and onion.
I would recommended this location for anyone looking for fresh, quality Mexican food.
