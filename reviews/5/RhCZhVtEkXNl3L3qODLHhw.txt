I rode my bike to PHX taco house on a sunny Saturday morning. It's located north of Indian school off 7th ave. I entered the establishment and noticed a pretty young Mexican girl working the counter.  I asked for a chorizo breakfast burrito, and she replied "would you like cheese?"  I declined. She got me a cup of water and I paid $5.96. I put the 4 pennies in the tip jar. I sat at a table and waited for my burrito. I got my burrito, which came with a fresh salsa. The man who brought me the food grabbed me a spoon and napkin too. Now to the burrito. The tortilla was nice and soft, the whole burrito was very warm. I took a bite; wow, I thought. It was delicious. I ate the whole thing in a matter of minutes. The salsa was just the right amount of spice and accompanied the burrito perfectly. Once I was done, I put my empty water cup, basket, and salsa bowl on the counter and headed toward the door. "Thank you! Have a great day!" Said the man and girl in unison. I got back on my bike and took off down the street toward home.
