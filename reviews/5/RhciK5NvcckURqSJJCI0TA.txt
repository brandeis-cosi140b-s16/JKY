The best Mexican food I've had since moving to Vegas 8 years ago. The prices are very reasonable. The food takes longer because it is made as you order instead of just being re-heated and scooped on to a plate like a lot of greasy taco shops. This is an instant favorite because this place cooks real Mexican food the right way and isn't afraid to serve spicy salsa.
