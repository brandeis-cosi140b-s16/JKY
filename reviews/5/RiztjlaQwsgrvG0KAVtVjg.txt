A huge shout out to Ivan and his staff for a wonderful reception night. Spot on! You guys went above and beyond what we asked for and accommodated everyone in our party. Of course the food was amazing! Not a single complaint from any one of us. We've gone to eat there a few times and each time your staff is on point and the food is perfect. Would be happy to recommend for any occasion. Thank you for making our wedding great!
