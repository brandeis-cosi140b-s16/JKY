Foreword:  You may see that all my reviews are 5 stars (with the exception of one really horrible experience (I won't mention any names....*cough-MATADOR-cough*) reason being you may ask...I only feel compelled to share the really good ones, or really bad as the case may be ;)

Ok, to the business at hand...TDJ is HOTT from the chips with the amazing red chile salsa to the check this place is ON IT!!

I have been addicted to this place here lately and I can't get enough, what can you ask for in a good nosh spot....consistency baby, this place nails it....always good, never a disappointment!

So far I have tried about 6 different menu items...everything from the machca plate to the cheese enchiladas...right on the money!  I would say about as authentic as you can find my friends....

Not sure....but everything is soooo gooood that I may just try the "lengua" here soon....still a bit freaky, but I have to assume the same high quality will grace my plate!

Please don't be fooled by the well, quite frankly scary exterior...this place has what it needs on the inside....cold beer, amazing chips, mind blowing salsas....consistent service (even when it's busy) and great food!!

Well, what are you doing still reading this?  Don't stand on ceremony here people...run don't walk to this one!!
