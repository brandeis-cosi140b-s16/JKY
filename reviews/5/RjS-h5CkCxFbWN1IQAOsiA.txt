A hidden gem who's exterior says "keep driving", but absolutely the best mexican food around.  The fajita's for two is fully loaded, and I have never found better.  The specials are good and cheap.  Their customers come from all over. Being near the airport, it is a great layover experience for travelers stuck in CLT.
