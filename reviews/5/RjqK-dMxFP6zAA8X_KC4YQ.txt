My fiance and I were on the hunt for some awesome margs & dinner.  Our dinner was amazing!  The food was hands down outstanding!  Their signature adovada is to die for and their sauces are extremely delish.  The house made margs were on point.  Owner was on the floor greeting guests-super nice btw.
Everything is made in house.  The place is a classic hole in the wall that clearly every local knows about.  We highly recommend this place & we are committed loyal customers from here forward.
