Tacos Kissi is owned and operated by the Kissi family.  Ruby is the cook and her son Hymen is the front of house.  Best mexican I have had in a long long time.  Damn it's good. Fresh salsa and amazing tripas, carne, al pastor, lengua, and everything else.  Haven't tried the sushi.  I have been here 10 times this week no joke.  The torts combo with fries is buy bueno.  I mean exceptionally good for $7 and change.  Love it.
