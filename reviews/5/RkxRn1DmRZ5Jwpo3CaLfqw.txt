This place is absolutely fantastic! I have only really tried their burritos, tacos, and their ceviche, but from just that I have experienced such a pure, delicious, and authentic flavor that not many other restaurants possess. I am eager to try more of their menu in the future and also see what their spirits selection is like. Especially the hand crafted margaritas! Yum! They are very courteous and take pride in all of the food that they make, and it shows.
