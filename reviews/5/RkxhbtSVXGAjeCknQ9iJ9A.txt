I go here for their chips and dips. Their green chili dip is out of this world amazing. I would order it by the gallon if I could. The taco salad is good, and comes with sour cream and guac, without being an additional charge. The enchiladas and flauta plates meet expectations. They serve a number of new mexican style hatch green chili plates. A favorite of mine. Avoid on Friday and Saturday nights, the line and wait is just ridiculous. It's not the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to, but few restaurants in the area have a variety of green chili dishes, let alone good ones. So for this, I give them 5 stars.
