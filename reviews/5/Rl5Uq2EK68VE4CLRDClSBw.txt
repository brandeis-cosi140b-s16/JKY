First time in! Mike the server was incredible. Full of great recommendations. The Amarillo pepper salsa (yellow) was like a creamy quest dip but all peppers-no cheese. I could have been fooled. Quest dip was just ok. Grits and short rib tacos were incredible!! Highly recommend you hit this eatery up for lunch, happy hour, or date night. Salsas were all incredible. 

Great decor, patio (dog friendly) and great atmosphere!!
