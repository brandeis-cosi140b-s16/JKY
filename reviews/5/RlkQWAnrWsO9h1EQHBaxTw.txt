We went to the Phoenix Public Market just to look around since we've never gone to a farmer's market. All kinds of awesome things there, but I think the best find was the stand the Tamale Store was set up in. Not only do they not use lard in their tamales AND not only do they have vegetarian tamales, but they also have vegan tamales! Just had our first ones for supper - I got the vegan southwest tamales - with a dollop of tofutti sour cream & salsa and they are the best tamales I've ever had! The only problem I had was little bits of the paper stuck to the tamale, but it wasn't inconvenient enough to dock a star.
