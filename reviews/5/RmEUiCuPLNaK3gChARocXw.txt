Oh, Rubio's! How I love thee! You must put crack in your fish tacos because I think I am addicted. I have no need to try anything else at your fine establishment because the sun rises and sets upon your glorious fishy goodness. Have I had better fish tacos? Almost certainly yes. But there is some indefinable feature of your tacos that draws me back again and again. I feel almost embarrassed by how much I care for you, Rubio's fish taco. But I don't care. I wish the whole world to know how great you are. You had me at first bite. So long for now Rubio's fish taco, but I will be there soon to enjoy your company once more.
