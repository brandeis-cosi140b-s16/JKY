I have only been here twice, but so far it is the best Mexican fare I've had in Las Vegas.  They had a good chicken mole taco, a satisfying consomm√©, and authentic Mexico City offerings like the huarache.   My only complaint was the limited and undersized chairs and tables.  I am not sure if their usual clientele are umpa lumpas or elementary school children, but some adult sized tables would be an improvement.
