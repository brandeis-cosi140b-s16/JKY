Heard about this place from my neighbor. I never would have stopped, but I am so glad I did. It's inside the Shell station on the SE corner of 7th Street and Union Hills. They have some tables for dining but also offer delivery service. I had the breakfast burrito and it was delicious! The gal at the register was very sweet and nice as well as the cook came out to make sure we were happy. I'm giving 5 stars for price, quality of food, and superb customer service. 

This is a great place to grab a weekend breakfast, work day lunch, or some take home dinner if you're not in the mood to cook. They are closed on Sundays.

They will see me frequently! :)
