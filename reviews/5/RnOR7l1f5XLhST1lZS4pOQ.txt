Me and my family have been going to Roberto's on a regular basis since we moved to Arizona 4 years ago. We keep going back, because it has by far the best Mexican food in the city. It's surprisingly difficult to find good Mexican restaurants in Arizona, and this is easily among the best. My favorite is the Chicken Chimichanga with a large Horchata to drink. Although we don't live in Anthem anymore, we still go back, because Roberto's has a special place in our hearts, and a special spot in our stomachs.
