The food was great as always. The house made tortilla chips were hot and light as air. Love the cochinitas and the lamb.  The complexity of flavor is outstanding. The simply described cebollitas were a pleasant surprise. I had never ordered them before, but I will always get them in the future. Madison is lucky to have a Mexican restaurant like La Mestiza.
