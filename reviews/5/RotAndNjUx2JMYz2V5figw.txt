I was completely overwhelmed by the friendly and excellent service we experienced here.  Everyone was so friendly and the service was so FAST!!!! I mean my hubbys glass was always full, food came out super fast and man was it GOOD!  I love Mexican Food and my hubby and I have been looking for a good sit down place to go.  Viva Zapatas delivered! We went on a Sunday and there was a nice gentleman playing guitar and singing traditional mexican songs. It was a great background and not too loud.  He was really really good! You can actually get fresh homemade tortillas here!!  Yummmm.  

If you are in the area or in the mood... this place is a MUST TRY!!
