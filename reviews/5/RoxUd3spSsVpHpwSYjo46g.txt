Before today, the very last time I came here was in 2008. I went with my best friend when school was over at Carl Hayden High School which is just down the street. I wasn't very pleased. An item we ordered was forgotten, the lady gave us the bill RIGHT after she gave us our food which I thought was quite tacky since I want to stuff my face first, then see the bill and pay. The food wasn't very hot and fresh. Decided I was to take my business elsewhere and Arriba Mexican Grill became our new go to place for a long time until they started serving food that was borderline frozen and hiring people who don't care. Well, for my Mom's birthday today she decided she wanted to go to this location. I have to say I was quite pleased with the food and service. I ordered the #2 dinner special which is a beef enchilada, beef taco, a tostada and beans and rice. It was so hot and delicious. Portions were very generous. Our server/waitress Christy was very nice and made sure we were all taken care of. Unlike the Garcia's that is somewhere near Metro Center, this place actually cranks up the air conditioning to ensure comport from the hot weather. I can say we are definable going to come back soon. I was very pleased.
