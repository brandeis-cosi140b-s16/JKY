The previous reviewer (Marianne) must have gone on a bad day. We just ate there two days ago and LOVED it!. The service was great and we only waited about 10 minutes for our entrees. Besides, we were eating there great chips and salsa in the mean time. 

We ordered the bean dip to go with the chips. It was wonderful. Loaded with beans and cheese, it actually stretched like pizza when you pulled the chip out. Sooo good. I ordered the Carne Asada and my wife had the Chili Verde. The beef was very tender and flavorful and the rice and beans was better than most Mexican restaurants I've been to. Everything tasted great and we will definitely be back. 

If there is a down side to Vega's, it would be the smaller menu than most. We didn't see any pork dishes (everything was beef or chicken) and their seafood selection was small. They also use the same menu for lunch and dinner, so you don't get a cheaper meal at lunch. But these are minor issues for such a high quality and wonderful meal.
