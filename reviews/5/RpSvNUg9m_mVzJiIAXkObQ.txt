FRESH food! The guacamole was phenomenal and the hint of lime really completes it. I ordered the blackened chicken burrito and it was delicious. You can taste the freshness in everything, from the tortillas to the jalape√±os to the tender, juicy chicken. 

Friendly staff and quick service. Will definitely come back again.
