We were looking for a nearby restaurant during a snow storm and stopped in here. With three kids, Mexican is usually a good option for us and this place did the trick. The server was very friendly and fast. 

Both my husband and I ordered the veggie burrito and it was fresh tasting and large. I ended taking half home! My oldest daughter ordered a quesadilla and said it wasn't too cheesy, which was a good thing.

While there isn't anything that sticks out as unique here, the food was good and we'll definitely be back.
