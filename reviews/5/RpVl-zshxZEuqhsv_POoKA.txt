I loved the description of this place from fellow yelpers so my wife and I decided to give it a try on a recent trip into Phoenix for a long weekend and a spring training game.  We got in late (10ish) and were quite famished having eaten nothing but SWA peanuts for dinner thus far. Thanks much to the reviewer who mentioned there was no sign and to just look for the address above the door. I don't think I would have found it otherwise.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a very nice bartender who promptly made us a couple of proper and tasty margaritas with fresh squeezed limejuice.  We asked him what he would his favorite app was and he recommended the seared scallops with four sauces. I don't think it was even on the menu.  They were very fresh and grilled perfectly and the accompanying sauces were SW influenced but nicely paired for the Smokey scallops.  We watched the chef deftly grill everything from chicken and steak to Mahi Mahi over a wicked hot pecan wood fire.  He was a true grill master. We had a couple of anchor steams with rest of dinner and were quite happy with the $65 bill. A great deal at an out of the way little bar with killer food.  Definitely Yelpy!
