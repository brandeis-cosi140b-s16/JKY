I just went here again after a 2 year hiatus due to a change in job, and I'm glad to report that it's just as incredible as it was 2 years ago! I brought a friend with me and he got a chile relleno combo and I got my go-to favorite - the Pollo Adobado burrito - and the grand total for both meals, including drinks, was a whopping $12! My friend said it was the best chile relleno he'd ever had, and my pollo adobado burrito was amazing as always. I was barely able to finish it all, and I was so full the rest of the day that I didn't even eat dinner! Next time I think I'll eat half there and take the other half home, it's really that huge (it must weight 2-3 lbs!). And their salsas - both the mild and hot - are delicious and freshly made each day. 

My only minor grip on this visit was that several of their sodas were out and they didn't have refills, however they did give me a few cans of soda instead since the diet pepsi and dr pepper that I wanted were both out. 

This is still one of the best kept Mexican food secrets in Tempe, and I hope it stays that way so they don't start having a line out the door!
