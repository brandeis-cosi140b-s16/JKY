Thank you for working with my gluten allergie without making it feel like I was a pain in the toosh. The server was awesome. Usually I have to ask to change glaves and explain cross contamination.  This server as soon as I told her she asked me what ingredients  I wanted so she could change utensils and changed her gloves. I realize I was still taking a chance with cross contamination,  but their attentiveness  was greatly  appreciated.
