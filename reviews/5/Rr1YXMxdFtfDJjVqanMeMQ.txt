WOW!! I love Mexican food well I just love good food period! and I must say I was totally impressed plus kids ate free that day I went!! the portions and Big the prices were low and the staff was friendly and polite.  I will say that this is by far the best restaurant I have found that offered a complete package.  Also, the restrooms were clean and smelling fresh a must where my family and I eat.  Bar was "OFF THE MEAT RACK!"   I LOVE THIS PLACE! every time we go to the mall, we will have lunch or dinner here.  A+++
