If you're never been to the Rokerij in North Central Phoenix, you're missing out. The tiny restaurant is housed in, literally, a cool old stone house. I hadn't been for a year or so and ventured over last weekend to visit their bar, which, it should be noted, is actually underneath the restaurant (read: basement bar; yes, I know finding a basement in Arizona is rare). The atmosphere couldn't be more charming - picture dark and cozy, a long bar, several couches, and a crackling fireplace with leather armchairs. 

Now to the best part - half off wine bottles on Sundays. For all of you wine lovers out there, you know that scoring a bottle for half price is a treat. To make things even better, there wasn't a bottle on the basic wine list over $50, meaning that you can buy a great bottle for less than the cost of a cheap pair of heels. Let's consider the options here - a pair of cheap shoes that will inevitably hurt and be worn twice, or a bottle of wine? Clearly the wine is the best choice. It should also be noted that the half off applies to the reserve wine list, another unusual perk of this hidden treasure.

The fabulous wine discounts are made even better by the Rokerij's $5 small plates. These are slightly larger than standard tapas, and you'll find everything from sweet and sour short ribs and bacon wrapped scallops to my favorite, king crab tostada bites. Order a few to share - you're sure to find something on their rather extensive menu of choices. 

The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, making a few recommendations and chatting as appropriate, but not excessively. This is truly a great local hang out. I made a note to myself, upon leaving, that I needed to head back sooner rather than later. I've been thinking about it all week, so perhaps another Sunday evening Rokerij adventure is on the horizon!
