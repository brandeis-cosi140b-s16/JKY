Warning - the food and salsa MAY seem bland to you, unless you customize your order.  But if you have a special diet they will take care of you.   

And the portions are Huge!

They add very little (if any?) spices / salt but have them handy for you.  Ask for it hot/spicy or ask for hot sauce or HOT salsa if you want to customize. Don't feel guilty about adding salt even to the hot salsa.  Normally salsa at a Mexican restaurant is WAY too salty for me but I add salt here.  

Only place i know that doesn't make me feel like a goof for asking for my chicken chimi with no beans.  Yum!
