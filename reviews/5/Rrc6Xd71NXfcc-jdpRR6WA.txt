Can I just say, thank you Yelp for finding me this restaurant! It's hard to find a good hole in the wall restaurant sometimes, because well, it's tucked away! I ordered a margarita and burrito enchilada style and it was to die for. I am very sensitive to spicy foods, so I will say the least spicy sauce was still pushing my taste buds. It was nice to have sauces full of flavor for a change and not just bland. They really know how to season food and I'll definitely be coming back!
