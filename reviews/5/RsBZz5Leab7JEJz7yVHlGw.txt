Over the top great service!  We received excellent service while eating dinner here on a Monday night.  The food was great and the drinks were outstanding.  

The service

It is nice to eat a restaurant and have a server who knows about the menu and what it tastes like.  We got great info when placing our drink order and then our food order.  We never waited a minute if we needed something.  The chips and salsa were replaced when they got low.    

The atmosphere 

We ate outside under the large mall entry way covering.  It was comfortable and was good for people watching in the background.  I did mention we ate here on a Monday night and the large screen television allowed us to watch some of the game(even though we both didn't like the teams playing LOL)  

The food

I went with a 3 taco plate and tried 3 different tacos.  It was served with beans and rice.  All three were good and my favorite was the diablo shrimp taco.  My wife had the grilled chicken enchilada flat.  We both thought the food was very great.  I was just able to "just' finish everything on my plate and my wife wasn't.  We both left full!  

Overall

Having been to the Tucson locations this new one in Chandler is on par with the others.  I had a great tasting margarita and enjoyed the chips and salsa while waiting for our food.  When the food arrived it tasted great.  The automotive garage theme they have going on works.  Outside dining and the ability to watch the game worked.  With the amount of quality food and drink we got the price worked.  If you find yourself wanting Mexican food while at the mall give it a try.  It will not be the typical mall fast food and the quality here will be much better!
