I was visiting from Long Beach, Ca and I came across this amazing vegan Mexican restaurant. First of, let me share that the owners r genuinely kind and inviting. They explained how their menus work, one is solely ALL VEGAN and the other is regular. We were also explained how the vegan food is cooked on separate sides of the grill. Overall, great food, fresh made salsas and welcoming staff. It was so darn delicious I had to buy 1/2 dozen of vegan tamales in order to bring them over to my home and share them with my family for these holidays :)  Try it you will not be discontent :)
