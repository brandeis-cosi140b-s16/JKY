This place was great! We knew the owner from a previous restaurant he used to own and when he sold it, we stopped going. I'm so glad we found him again. 
Food was authentic and greatly priced. Service was friendly and super fast! And their menu has a wide variety of options which is awesome! I am definitely will be a returning customer!
