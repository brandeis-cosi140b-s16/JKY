I personally love this little restaurant. They have great food. This is the only restaurant where I will order Culichi Shrimp, it's simply amazing. I have not had a single bad experience food wise. The owner is a bit awkward, he is always there and seems to be in a bad mood. The waitresses are super friendly and helpful.
