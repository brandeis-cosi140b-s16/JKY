The red and green chile here are some of the most comforting and tasty Ive had. The red chile for me is the wholly grail of red chile's which all are compared.. now take the red chile and put a couple of over easy eggs on top with a side of beans and hash browns and you get a Nana's Breakfast! Served all day Sunday coupled with their awesome chip bar, fantastic!!

When it comes to red and green chile, it doesn't get any better then this!
