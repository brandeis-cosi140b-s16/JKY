My family and I ate here the other night and it was AWESOME!!! I absolutely loved the shrimp tacos! The cheese with that mango salsa is to die for! Plus they put a ton of shrimp in the taco and the shrimp are huge!!! My wife had the rolled taquitos and would not even share because they were that good! My daughter just had a plain bean and cheese burrito but said it was amazing. The staff was helpful and friendly and the service was smooth and fast! We are planning on going back this weekend! Glad Rosas has a 2nd location. We absolutely love their green sauce!
