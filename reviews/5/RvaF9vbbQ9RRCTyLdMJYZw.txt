I was craving some red meat. Not just red meat...a juicy burger. Fortunately in my neighborhood there is this yumtastic burger joint. I previewed the menu online and theoretically could have called in my order since I was taking it to go but wanted to check it out a bit longer. I had the Beach house burger (roasted green chili, smoked mozarella, and pico de gallo) and a side of carnival corn.Well, I was pretty hungry so I actually took some nibbles of my corn on the car ride home-very tasty. It was seasoned splendidly and was delicious. My burger was great. I LOVED the grilled green chili. It was extremely tasty with just the right amount of spice. I guess I am used to green chilis being kind of soggy but this was darn near perfect and very fresh. The burger is served on a brioche bun (which I didn't eat because that is how I roll with burgers..I don't eat the bread..could have ordered it protein style with lettuce but I forgot..the bun looked tasty though!  :)
In addition to burgers they have sandwiches, tacos/taco salads, and some interesting sides. I definitely would like to try the sweet potato tots and a taco salad on my next visit. Next time my meat craving kicks in..I know just the place.
