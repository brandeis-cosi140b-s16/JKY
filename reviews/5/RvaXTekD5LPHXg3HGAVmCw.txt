New to town & was looking for a yummy Mexican food place nearby -- so glad we decided on Juan's! Everything was fresh & delicious. I had the pick 2 combo with a fish taco & pollo asada taco & my boyfriend had the seafood enchilada's. They were both cooked perfectly-- nothing overdone or too greasy. We both cleaned our plates. 
Service was awesome & friendly. Inside was clean & inviting. We will definitely be back for more. 
++ Happy Hour everyday from 3-7pm!
