Took the family out for my fathers birthday and he was recommended Blue Adobe Grille by some of his colleagues.  The food was simply amazing.  The New Mexico flavors were such a welcome relief from the standard Mexican food.  Food was spicy as well, which was a welcome surprise.

I would recommend to anyone who wants Mexican with a twist.
