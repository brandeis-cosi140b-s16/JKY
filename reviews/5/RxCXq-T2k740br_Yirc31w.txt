Had another great meal at Cafe Tranquilo (my 5th time there).  This time there were 5 of us for lunch.  Great service (attentive, prompt, accurate).  Great atmosphere.  Great food.  I'm partial to the carne asada torta, but have had the equally delicious pollo asado con mole (chicken breast w/ mole sauce) on other occasions.  My party devoured the yummy chilaquiles, the fried fish torta, and mango guacamole.  Order the tortilla chips & you'll get 4 totally different salsas (hard to pick a favorite).  Agua fresca & horchata drinks are refreshing.  When you add the guacamole & drinks to the meals, the bill came to $65 for 5 of us.  We would all return to Cafe Tranquilo again/soon.
