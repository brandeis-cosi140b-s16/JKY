Locally owned by a great family. The owners are almost always there-waiting on tables. The service is fast and courteous. Restaurant is clean and brightly colored with lots of traditional Mexican artwork and decorations. 

Well stocked bar with lots of kinds of tequila and great margaritas. Great happy hours

Food is good. You have to love the bottomless bowl of chips with salsa and escebeche carrots that comes to your table as soonas you sit down. My friend purchases extra carrots to take home. The salsa is great. We think that it is mild but our friends find it a little too hot. 

I have had more than half of the entrees but my favorite is Nopalitos con queso -  A mix of chicken & shrimp with nopalitos and a great red chile sauce served in a small iron skillet with choose of flour or corn tortillas. Outstanding and very filling. 

Another favorite is the Plato Cozumel - a chicken enchilada covered with red sauce and shrimp served along side a large piece of thin grilled skirt steak. Served with yellow rice & beans-almost everything comes with the duo-they are OK-not my favorite.

Great posole. With huge chunks of pork and hominy. A wide variety of seafood dishes-Pescado y Camarones en Tequila-is very good-shrimp and fish is a orange and tequilla sauce-great.

They have the expected like gringo enchiladas, chimis, burritos-these are good but not great-go to Pedro's for those-try the unique dishes that is what Casa De Lara does best.
