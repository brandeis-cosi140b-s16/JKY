One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. The taco bar was awesome...we went crazy over it! Special mention for cilantro, pecan, guacamole salsa. Th e main course was also really good. Tried the fish taco and I wasn't dissapointed and hubby was happy wi th his chicken taco. Portions are generous and best part about this place is that they have a lot of options for vegetarians.we will be coming back here for sure :)
