My friend was celebrating her birthday this past weekend and this was on my short list of locations to host her brunch.  Having eaten there a few times already, it was a perfect central location for our small group.

The brunch menu offers a great assortment of "small plates" options for the table to share.  They start off with some wonderful pastries including their guava empanada and a fresh fruit plate.

With larger groups, the server will bring out an assortment of items for you.   Alex was awesome and very accommodating.  We enjoyed quite an assortment from the menu - the huevos rancheros is always great, fried green tomatillos (which can be ordered without the bacon), steak and eggs, oysters rockefeller, and breakfast fries (also available vegetarian).  The back and jalapeno PBJ is a great way to end the meal!  Add on the unlimited mimosas for an additional $10 per person, and you are set for a great experience.  Yes, they are very attentive with beverages, too, so you won't get dry!

I LOVE this venue and encourage you to try it out.  For parking, there is a convenient valet off of the Strip near the Planet Hollywood Restaurant sign near Forum Shops.  You can also self park in the Colosseum Garage and walk across the Casino, out the doors between Fizz and the Colosseum to bypass the long trek through Forum Shops.

They get my "A" rating for terrific service (have yet to have a bad experience for six visits), consistently great food, and great value.

They also have a terrific happy hour and private space for larger groups.
