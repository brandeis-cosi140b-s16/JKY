Another tucked away little secret located in the Campus Commons building. 

As a regular to both Kaba Curry and Wing King i've asked several times about the 'mexican joint' as we call it as well as the 'italian joint' next to Jefe's. Usually i miss both of them as i tend to come in the late afternoon and early evenings and they pack up after the lunch crowds. So when i decided to stop by early for once Jefe's was open and i got a chance to try it out.

The daily special sounded good. 3 home made pork tamales and home made horchata as a drink. What sat at a table near by their spot was this

I was pretty damn impressed with what i saw and the horchata was HUGE.

First bite was the best. The end piece was crispy and really hard but the cheese melted and hardened and all the flavors concentrated. After a few more chews i realized that holy crap this is the best tamale i've ever had thanks to the end pieces. The owner came out to ask how everything was and i asked him about it. They fried up the tamales on the griddle or something to warm them up and a result of it is the crispy ends. 

Aside from the lovely end pieces the tamales were very good quite possibly the best i've had, then again i havent had a lot of tamales and i prefer enchiladas. What ever...moving on. 

Good seasonings, perfect balance of meat and cheese and the sauce and mayo they added on top create a harmony of flavors.

They plan on staying open later starting in a few weeks so hopefully i found a replacement for Roberto's.
