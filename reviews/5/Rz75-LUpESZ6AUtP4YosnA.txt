Decided to finally stop in.  I got the Filet Mignon Nachos and my wife got the pulled pork tacos and my  daughter got the street tacos. Food was great. Our server Saadia was outstanding. Very professional and polite. She checked on us but not to much. Always made sure our drinks were full ( my biggest pet peeve).  Will definitely go back on the weekend when she works again.  Definitely recommend this place if you love nachos. Drink menu was great!!
