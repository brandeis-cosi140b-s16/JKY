For some reason it is difficult to find good Mexican food in the Tempe/Scottsdale area, and even more so if you are looking for one that serves trippas (intestines), lengua (tongue), or cabeza (head meat).  So, I was really happy when I came to Huauchinango!  Their food is very tasty and fresh, and their salsas are addictive.  If you like a lot of heat, I recommend you try the habanero salsa (it's the orangey looking one).  It will not disappoint.  I am starting to crave some yummy trippas tacos as I write this.  My husband loves their quesadillas, which are not like all those other quesadillas that you usually get.  These are made with a thicker, I believe hand made, corn tortillas, stuffed with yummy cheese and served with a green sauce and shredded lettuce. Mmmmm. This is definitely my go to neighborhood stop for Mexican food.
