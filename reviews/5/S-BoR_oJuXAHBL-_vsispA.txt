Tried this place based off of all the positive reviews and all I can say is the fish tacos were outstanding as was the Tacos Al Pastor. Had some black beans and a Horchata with it and all was great.

Wish it was closer so I could visit more often but will definitely be back. It is a small place so if you go at a busy time it is hard to get a table.
