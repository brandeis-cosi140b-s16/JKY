Amazing food, amazing vibe, and great staff! Don't let the location steer you away this place has some of the best Mexican food in town. I've tried many items off the menu but what stands out are the beans and rice. The chef is on point here and so are the tacos! All the ingredients taste fresh and you can tell the chef takes pride in his food. I recommend this place for anyone looking for great Mexican food or just all around great food!!!
