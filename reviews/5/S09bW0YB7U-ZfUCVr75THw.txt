Awesome place, super friendly staff!!! We were greeted warmly by Obaselia and taken to our table.  She asked if we would like guacamole with our chips and salsa, then let us know Jose would be our waiter. Jose again greeted us warmly and took our drink order while we checked out the menu.  Great menu with lots of choices,  food came out quickly after we ordered.  Man, the food was great!!!!!! They hand make all of the tortillas for their dishes, boy, you sure can tell difference.  We have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant since leaving LA,  seven years ago, and I have finally found it,  in good old Summerlin. Casa Don Juan is a few months old, it's a must try place if you enjoy mexican food. If you're on the east side of Vegas it's worth the drive.  Thank you Casa Don Juan,  we will be back soon! !!!!!
