Trendy, contemporary dining room with amazing Mexican cuisine!! Although it has an ironic location, literally in the same building as the Sapphire strip club, the food was DELICIOUS!! The table side guacamole comes out in the cutest dish! It is definitely big enough for a party of 4. The chicken enchiladas and carne asada steak were flavorful and the flan for dessert was sweet with the perfect amount of chill! Super nice staff and the chef even greeted us at our table! =D
