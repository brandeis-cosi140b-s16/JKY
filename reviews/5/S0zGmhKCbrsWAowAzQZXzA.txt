Great Mexican food truck!  The owners specially made us a vegetable quesadilla (not on the menu).  It was delicious and definitely hit the spot.  The two sauces are also really good.   The green was super flavorful but not tart or sour!  The red sauce was pretty spicy.  Definitely will be going back again!
