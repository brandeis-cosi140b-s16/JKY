Came in on a busy convention day and was seated immediately. The food was fast and delicious and the wait staff was extremely friendly and professional. The management wasn't hard on the eyes either ;) 

HIGHLY recommend the tuna ceviche, yukatan pork (my favorite), and the pork burger. 

Save room for the tres leche or the pastel rufina dessert, you won't regret it!!! You can even do two half slices for a dollar more. 
Whaaattt??!!! Amazing!! 

So much flavor, so little time.
