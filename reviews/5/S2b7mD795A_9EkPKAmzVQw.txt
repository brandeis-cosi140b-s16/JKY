Hidaway is right!!!  Had to call to make sure "additional parking in the rear" was really the door.
Asked my husband if he wanted to go in?   Was a little scary for the moment had a sign posted for a liquor license.
We were both blown away by the aroma as we entered and time warped to the middle of Montana 1960's, maybe.  We sat at the bar and had an amazing appetizer dinner.  Was planning on getting a little something before we met our son for dinner at Houston's (sorry Houston's my husband ate all of his 6 scallops)  Yes, I said 6 blackened scallops which blows Eddie V's out of the water!

I can't wait to get back to Phoenix just to eat here!!!
