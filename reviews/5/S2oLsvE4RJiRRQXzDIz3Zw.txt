The wait staff was amazing. The food (stir fry quesadilla) was unbelievably greasy and soaked the tortilla to the point that it was unable to be picked up. The drinks were strong and prepared well, but priced highly for what they were. 

Slightly over-priced for the quality, but the staff makes up for the cons, and they enhance the meal experience greatly.
