This was my go-to spot for Tortas with my boyfriend when I lived on this part of town. 

The service is always so friendly every time we have been here. They give you chips and salsa immediately and keep your water topped off. 

I've tried a bunch of their different tortas, but tend to get the "mini" tortas since I can't eat that much. You get plenty of food for the money you pay, and it's quite yummy! 

I recommend this place if you're in the area!
