I absolutely LOVE this restaurant!  Their food is great with huge portions and LOW prices!  We delayed heading back to TX (where we have MANY) wonderful Mexican restaurants) just so we go eat lunch before leaving!!  Can't wait to come back to the Phoenix area so we can eat here again!
Tuesdays they have a BOGO for seniors, in case you are interested. (3-10PM)
