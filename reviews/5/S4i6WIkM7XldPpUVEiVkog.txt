Like every mexican joint, you start with chips and salsa.  Their salsa is a unique favor and color.  Not sure what they put in it, but it's delicious.  That's kind of my precursor to what I'm going to order.  

So the first time I went, I started with the a seafood bowl that was awesome.  The seafood was fresh, and tasted great.

We also ordered what is known as the Lava Bowl.  Served in a volcano rock bowl that stands tall, the dish was served boiling.  A liquid gold of cheese, mushrooms, onion, shrimp and spices.  Served with fresh, homemade tortillas, this dish is not one to miss.  

Beers served in cold, frosty mugs.  Loving this new place.
