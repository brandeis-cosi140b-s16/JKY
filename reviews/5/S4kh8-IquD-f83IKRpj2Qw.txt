Just had lunch and the only thing better than the Tacos was the service , Taylor was very good and helped with what to order . The manager was also very helpful and moved us when asked . Dishes are made from scratch with deliciously unexpected ingredients: grilled shrimp tacos are sweetened with coconut slaw and  pork a tacos are accented by grilled pineapple salsa and pickled chili sauce. 
I would totally come back for these gourmet taco creations. Well done to all !
