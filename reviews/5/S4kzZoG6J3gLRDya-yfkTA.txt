Can't say enough about this place...it's awesome! The staff is incredibly friendly and we absolutely love the margaritas and sangria. They have a great little patio area and the food NEVER disappoints. Also, I love their salsa bar, everything is so fresh! We come here all the time for the margaritas and friendly smiles, thanks!
