Boom! I loved this place. The chips and sals HAVE NO EQUAL! The prices are as advertised (online and in front of the restaurant). How do people expect high quality food with high quality ingredients with low quality prices. This is not Tex-Mex, So Cal, or street food garbage. This is the real deal incredible mexican food that Pittsburgh has been missing. 2 star and 3 star reviewers know this place because most people in Pittsburgh wouldn't know mexican food if it slapped them in the face.

I wish I could give it 6 stars!
