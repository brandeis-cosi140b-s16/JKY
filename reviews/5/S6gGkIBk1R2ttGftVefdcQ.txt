Amazing! Excellent customer service, great atmosphere, and the food was wonderful! I had the ensalada del inca : hands down the best salad I've ever eaten in my life! Add some chicken and orange slices to it, and you'll be in heaven. My boyfriend got the juevos rancheros and he said they were the best he's ever had. Definitely a recommended place to get some good Mexican food!
