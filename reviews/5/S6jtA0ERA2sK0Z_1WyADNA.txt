This local jewel of a Mexican restaurant is probably the best food that I've had in a very long time everything was perfect the shrimp were excellent--- taste the rice it was deadly and the beans were the best refried beans I've had since a vacation trip to Mexico a few years ago.  This isn't a fancy Mexican restaurant and this is the real deal and the steak was cooked perfectly not burned very soft and extremely flavorful .Try both tortillas I prefer the corn over the flower but both of them were excellent! This place is very reasonably priced and the service was fast and the staff was very loveable and did their best to make us feel right at home. I will be going back !
