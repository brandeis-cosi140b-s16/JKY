The staff is really nice, they rarely if ever mess up my orders which are usually complicated and require alterations or substitutions, they don't skimp on the hot sauce packets or napkins, the service is always really fast and friendly, and the food is very reasonably priced if you order a la carte. I've found that most combo meals aren't the greatest value (especially because there's a circle K right across the street, you can go get a drink there for 85 cents unless you want baja blast) other than maybe the taco box. But yeah, pretty much everything you could ask for from a taco bell. You should know what you're getting into. This taco bell meets expectations, and in a time where customer service can easily fall by the wayside, this a five-star in my book.
