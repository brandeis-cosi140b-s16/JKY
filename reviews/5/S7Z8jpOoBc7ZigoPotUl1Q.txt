I'm a long time fan of Richardson's and after finally visiting the new location I am head over heels again! I love that the new place looks just like the old place inside, except a bit bigger it seems. I love the food and the specials are amazing. I recently tried a green chile tilapia that was incredible! I have family in town soon and already know we are going to Richardson's for a meal.
