i agree with Steven T.'s review, in that there aren't many differences in locations of Chipotles. but i do enjoy this location much better than the location on State St here in Madison, but it is what it is. State St is full of ruckus college kids (it seems like it doesn't matter what time of the day or year it is), and this one is just much cleaner and more friendly.

as always, the food is always fresh, and i enjoy the ethical food-supply thing they have going on.

so, you like it or you don't. i'm not going to try to convince you that chipotle is better than Qdoba (but it is), nor am i going to get all drooly about how much better tasting it is than Panchero's (but it is), either way, i'll eat at a Chipotle any day, and i'll enjoy the hell out of it, thank you very much.
