I'm a pretty big snob when it comes to Mexican food since I was raised on the good stuff. 

The other day I had to have a burrito. I don't know why but NOTHING else would satisfy me. It had to be a bean burrito. 

I made myself fresh tortillas for this purpose alone but I realized we didn't have any beans!! Frantically I called my grandma to ask if she had some and she said she just ran out. I didn't have all day to make fresh beans. I wanted a burrito now!

So finally I sucked it up and drove down the road to fiesta burrito. I thought to myself that as long as it was better than Taco Bell, I'd be able to satisfy my craving.

FOUR BUCKS FOR A DRIVE THROUGH BEAN BURRITO!?

I thought to myself that this was kind of expensive but I got it anyways. After all, I needed a burrito. What I got was worth it's weight in mexican gold.

What I was given was the biggest burrito that I'd ever seen in my life. Seriously this burrito could have ended me if it chose to. It was the best bean burrito that I'd ever had. Maybe even more than my grandmas homemade ones. I can't even begin to describe the joy I felt while eating this thing. I couldn't even eat half of it in one sitting. It actually became THREE separate meals for me. Each time I reheated it, it was still just as good as the first. 

I know my mexican food, and this is probably the most authentic in the valley.
