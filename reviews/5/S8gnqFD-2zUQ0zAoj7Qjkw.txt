Had a three taco plate, carnitas, adobado chicken, and carne asada. Also got the homemade chips and guac. Everything was so fresh and delicious and the owner was super friendly and clearly passionate about his food. I would say the adobado chicken was the best taco, they're the only taco shop in the valley that smokes their chicken and pork. Really gives a nice smokiness to the meat. Great salsa too. Definitely will be heading back here.
