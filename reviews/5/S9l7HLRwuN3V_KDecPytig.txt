Love Love Love This Place.

We went on a Sunday afternoon and were able to take advantage of the Happy Hour that runs till 5pm all day every day. The guys stuck with the pitchers of beer, while us girls tried out a few of the "coctels" and "agua frescas" My favorite was the Mazatlan Mule.

We started with the nachos and found them to be amazing. Ordinary nachos just will not do it for me ever again.

It was hard to decide on what tacos to order, they all sounded great, and no one was disappointed in what was placed before us. The carnitas, short rib and shrimp were among the favorites. 

And don't forget to order a few sides....among the best were the mexican street corn and the heirloom anasazi beans

We cannot wait for much cooler weather so we can enjoy the great outdoor seating they have

So run to Joyride Taco House if you are in the area....
