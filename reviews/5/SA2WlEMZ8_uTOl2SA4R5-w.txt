Took the family here based off of previous reviews we had read. Let me be the first to say the reviews were right on, the location was very clean the staff was extremely friendly and the food was amazing. I have driven by this place so many times and never realized it was there. And extremely glad we went to check it out. If you have the time and looking for a great relaxing meal give them a try. We will definitely be going back. The salsa is also delicious bought some to take home with us.
