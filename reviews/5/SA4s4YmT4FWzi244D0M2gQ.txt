In addition to my favorite adobada tacos (originating from SD), I've also discovered the adobada fries! It's $5 for a small box and (I think) $10 for a large. You could easily share the large with 3-4 people, even though you may not want to because it's so good! Fries, adobada, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. YUM!
