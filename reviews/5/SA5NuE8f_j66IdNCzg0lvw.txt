This place gets real busy at lunch time but the food and the staff are excellent! I am all about the chicken. soft corn chicken taco and chicken salad. they never go east on the guacamole either and I could kiss them for that. The avocados, chicken, salsa..... heck EVERYTHING is fresh, healthy and delicious!
