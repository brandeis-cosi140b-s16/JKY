After being banished 3 1/2 years ago to Oklahoma, I made a return trip to Phoenix recently and had to go here. As you can imagine, the Southwestern/Mexican food anywhere in Oklahoma is... how do I put it? Best not eaten. So I gorged myself on Mexican while in town. I stopped in at Los Dos Molinos for lunch and the atmosphere alone made me feel more comfortable. They brought me the staple tortilla chips and salsa. I don't know that I can actually call it salsa though... it was more like an art: a palatable aesthetic. I had a problem here, in that I had so many restaurants to hit up while in town and only so much room in my stomach. Sadly, that meant I needed something to satiate my appetite and craving, so I opted for a simple bean burrito. It had a good blend of seasoning, plus a nice mix of refried and whole pinto beans. I ended up using all the salsa by dousing my burrito with it. The only downside to the place is the tight parking behind the restaurant, but all in all it was a great experience.
