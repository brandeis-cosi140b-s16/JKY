I've been to the majority of the big name taco shops in the valley  and man this place kills them all. Everything is very fresh, taco shells are magnificent, chips and salsa were perfect, and it's a very friendly place. 

They have a frozen take home selection which I think I'll take advantage of next time, because those frozen tamales were massive and looked delicious. 

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick lunch or just craving for a quick Mexican fix, it's amazing!
