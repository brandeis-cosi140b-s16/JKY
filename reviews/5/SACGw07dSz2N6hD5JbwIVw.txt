I'll start this review off with a little quote from my friend.
"Romero's and Filiberto's are for drunk-white people. That isn't real Mexican food."

Well... he wasn't joking! 
We started off just heading out for some lunch, and he decided that he wanted to take the whitest girl he knew for some real Mexican food... where only real Mexican food can be found, apparently... In Maryvale.
We got there, and I was blown away by how delicious everything looked. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to order my own food because I am hardly fluent in Spanish. 
Regardless, we both enjoyed the Mexicana, which consists of lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, avocado, onions, mushrooms, beans, cheese, and steak, all in between two delicious pieces freshly baked fbread. 

We finished our meal with the Strawberries and Cream which was also unbelievable. This sounds like it would be just-another-thing, but the cream is flavored with something and its amazing.
Also, the Horchata is incredible! This isn't your watered-down Filiberto's crap. 


TL;DR: Try everything, you will NOT be disappointed. This place will kick any other so-called Mexican restaurant's ass.
It's worth the drive.
