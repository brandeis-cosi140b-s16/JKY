This place was amazing. The food speaks for itself. The ingredients were fresh and made to order. I ordered two tacos, one with chorizo and one with carne asada. The chorizo one was so good, I could probably eat them everyday, for 3 meals a day, all week long!!! My BF got the burrito with chorizo. Amazing. 

One thing to note. The hot sauce. Holy moly, it is HOT. Mind you, I love hot sauce. I put Frank's and Cholula hot sauce on many food items all the time. But this hot sauce is not to be messed around with. Do not dump the entire cup on your meal without testing it haha. My BF and I were literally sweating and drowning ourselves with water. But I would gladly do it all over again :)
