This place is amazing! There are not many organic Mexican restaurants in San Francisco and I definitely didn't expect to find such a gem in Sin City! The food is great! Margaritas are huge! The flan is fantastic! And shrimp tacos and mahi mahi tacos are to die for!!! 
Highly recommended! If you like quality Mexican food and want to stay away from cancerous GMO's, pesticides, herbicides, hormones and antibiotics this is the place to go! :)
