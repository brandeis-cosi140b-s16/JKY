Another fantastic lunch at KoMex!  We had the bulgolgi tacos with KimChi, chicken fettucine, and bulgolgi fusion burrito. Service was prompt.  I watched as the waitress served everyone in the room and made sure to refill our water before we needed to ask.  Always worth a star for me!  Great experience!  Alot of regulars there which is always a great sign..  YUMM!
