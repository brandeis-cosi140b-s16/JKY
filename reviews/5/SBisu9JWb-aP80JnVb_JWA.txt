this is the food cart that run's out of charlies, the gay bar in phoenix.

charlie's always seems like a reasonable place to go for afterhours on friday and saturday nights, but i don't go to dance. i got to eat the supreme drunken binge snack offered in phoenix: the super mega nacho.

they load a snack box full of round yellow corn tortilla chips with gooey good nacho cheese, fresh carne asada, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and top it with a dumptruck's worth of jalepeno's.

their street tacos are only a dollar each and are bite-sized bits of mexican goodness. their quesadillas huge and generously loaded with either carne asada or chicken. everything is prepared from start to finish right in front of you. it's cash only and they even have sodas and water for you. you can either order inside the bar or outside around the corner (which i suggest, it's quicker) so you can get your drunk food fix without being caught in a gay cowboy bar by anyone that might suspect you're not all that straight..
