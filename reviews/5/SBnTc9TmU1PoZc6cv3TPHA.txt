Downtown Pittsburgh, PA. 
Even though Im not a big fan of Mexican food, I like this concept for business. Cutting down on bread is a great idea using the naked burrito concept. I have been in Qdoba before never ate because it reminded me of a salad and it wasn't what I wanted to eat then. So Mike S. tells me to try it. It was great because I get to add what I like and tasted fine. But I guess you are kind of your own chef here.
