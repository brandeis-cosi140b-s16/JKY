Thank you Yelpers for your help in finding this great place!  Great, authentic Mexican food that was served with a smile and very quickly.  We had the good fortune of sitting by the owner (or one of the owners).  What a great guy!  My son and I felt very welcome and we were invited back to celebrate Cinco de Mayo.  We live an hour away and really wished they had a location close to us (Anthem - hint, hint).  

Do not pass up the flour tortilla chips! They come out warm and are addicting.    I had the carnitas plate which was very good (and spicy!) and my son really enjoyed his taco burro.  

Will definitely visit Espo's again when we are back in the area.
