I've been to my fair share of taco shops, trucks, stands, etc. and this little gem of a place is quite amazing.  They use charcoal to cook the meat so it has the amazing grill flavor.  I once went a bit early and had to come back because the coals weren't at the right temperature yet. 

I usually go with the steak and chicken tacos which are flavorful and fresh.  Throw some pico and fresh chopped cabbage on it and you have a substantial little taco.  Oh, the spicy red sauce has a real kick to it.
