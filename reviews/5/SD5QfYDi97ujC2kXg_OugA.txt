Did you ever wonder why most Mexican food places taste the same? I mean, there's a range of flavors across American cuisine... why isn't it the same with Mexican food.

Turns out, there is some variety. It just tends to get glossed over and dumbed down. But not at Maria Maria.

I have no idea if this is authentic Mexican food or not. I only know that's damned tasty. Yes, you're going to encounter strange spices and flavors that you aren't used to. Yes, it's going to make you wonder exactly what it is you are eating. And yes, you're going to enjoy the experience.

My personal recommendations: chili rellenos. I'm a sort of connoisseur of this dish. I've found three places on the planet that make them the best: this is one. They take liberal poetic license with the dish. And gods, I love them for it.

The carnitas are also fantastic. Very rich and flavorful.  My wife always -- and I mean always -- gets the seafood guacamole and a side of plantains. She's happy for days after.

Go. Now.
