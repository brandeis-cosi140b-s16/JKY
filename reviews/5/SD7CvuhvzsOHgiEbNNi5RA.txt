You know you are getting good Mexican food when the restaurant's main dish is Pozole. This dish little known to the non-Mexican population is such a staple, along Mole, of authentic Mexican food. Those who know me are aware of how hard I am to please when it comes to Mexican food in the United States, however, this place is going on my must visit restaurants next time am in Phoenix. The service is excellent, the price could not be better and the spices they use give their dishes an authentic Mexican flavor that is hard to find in the US. Our waitress, Monica, was awesome. A little off the beaten path, but, worth the trip.
