Wow! Two awesome customer service experiences in a row at a fast food restaurant!? That's unheard of! They are over-the-top in their friendliness and it's a refreshing concept. They even try to have a conversation with you at the window!

I come here every once in a while for lunch because it's so close to work and have only tried a few things on the menu. So far, no complaints.

Thanks for being so cheery :D
