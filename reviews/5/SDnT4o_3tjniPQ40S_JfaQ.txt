I defy you to eat the following items and tell me this isn't really tasty Mexican food.
1.  Start with the hot and also the chunky salsa. Mix 50/50. 
Eat almost all of the salsa with a couple of bowls of chips. Save some to put on entree. 
2.  sandy's special with beans and rice. 
3.  1 Roberts taco on the side. Roberts tacos are better than the regular taco cuz they're made with shredded roast beef. 
Granted, I could be biased having grown up eating this practically my whole life. Still, if you don't love this, you may have a serious medical condition...might wanna see a doctor...
Did I mention I love the beans and rice?
Oh, and the chili relleno. 
Their flour tortillas are really good so include cheese crisps and burritos.
