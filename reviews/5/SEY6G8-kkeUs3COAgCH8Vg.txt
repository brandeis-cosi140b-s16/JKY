Pittsburgh just didn't have any good authentic Mexican restaurants. Enter El Milagro. Since we discovered it a few months ago we've been going at least twice a month. In fact, we're going to take my parents there tonight! 

It's not the most glamorous place, but I think the best food comes from non-assuming places. We've ordered a variety of things. My favorite is the chorizo & egg torta. It's morphed into my go to menu item. We've tried pretty much all the tacos and a variety of other menu items. 

My husband speaks enough Spanish to order with the waitress, but make sure to bring your phone and google translate some of the Spanish only menu items. 

We highly recommend El Milagro. Take all your friends and keep this excellent Mexican place in business!
