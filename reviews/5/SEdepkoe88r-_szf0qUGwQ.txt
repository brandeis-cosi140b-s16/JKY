I seriously can eat this everyday....  Only thing I ever eat here is the salad.  You can tell the meat her is different.  I believe they advertise that the meat was raise without antibiotic and cage free.  That really mean alot to me hahahah.. Honestly now days very often you go out and eat and the meat are like plastics and so fake..  

Food is very fresh and very refreshing after you ate it.
