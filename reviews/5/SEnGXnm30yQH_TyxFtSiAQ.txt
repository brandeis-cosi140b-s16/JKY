I appreciate great customer service and tonight through the drive-thru of this taco bell Erieyana displayed the best customer service I have ever had at a taco bell. I could tell she was overwhelmed with the fast paced Nature but she held on and worked her job with a smile... It gets easier over time trust me :)... I had to wait a little longer for my food but it was worth the wait my food was fresh and full of ingredients... I appreciate you for loving your job and doing it with a smile even though it can get heavy at times... Keep up the great work and your manager is a great associate, knowing when things need to be taken care of. Thank you for the great experience and like I told you work hard as keep it up! You will go far!
