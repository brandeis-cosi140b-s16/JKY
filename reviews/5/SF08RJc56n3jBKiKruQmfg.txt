I brought some friends for the first time to Carlito's last March.  They insisted on a return on this trip.  Another great visit.  We came on Sunday to use the 2 for 1 deal on breakfast burritos.  We love the crunchy hash browns in the burritos.  My favorite: chorizo with red sauce on the inside but drenched with green on the outside.  The place is a bit worn, with beat up chairs, but I'll overlook that.  The staff were very friendly and worked hard to keep us happy.  What a great treat!
