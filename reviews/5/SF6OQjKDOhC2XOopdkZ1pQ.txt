The best enchilda sauce and red chili con carne that I have ever had.   The flavors epitomize the Soronan Style of Mexican cuisine.  I recommend the red chili burrito - enchilada style.  As for the restaurant itself, it is a 'take out' restaurant with outdoor seating, only.   In short, words cannot expalin how delicious the food is.   You have to try it for yourself.
