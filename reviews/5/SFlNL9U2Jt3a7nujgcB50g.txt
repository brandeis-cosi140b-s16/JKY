The pastor tacos are absolutely the best around.  They put the pastor meat on a rotisserie and grill it throughout the day.  I highly recommend the pastor tacos.  They are open until 11pm  daily and until 1am on Friday and Saturday.  The tacos are $1.20 each and come with pineapple which is a surprisingly good match with the pastor.
