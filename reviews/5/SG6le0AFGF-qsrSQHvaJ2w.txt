I was raised in Tucson and my go to for breakfast burritos has been Nico's Taco Shop. I moved to Flagstaff for school and was unable to find an equal to Nico's. I then moved down to Phoenix after school and began my search again. It was ecstatic when I bit into that breakfast burrito jette and found that it was the replacement burrito I have been looking for.  Great food,  good salsa. 5 stars
