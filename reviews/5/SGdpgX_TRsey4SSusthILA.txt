I cannot believe this place is in such a weird area! The food is so fabulous and it is tucked far away from any sort of public recognition. I suppose that is better for me selfishly because then the line will stay down when dinner time arrives. I came here a few months ago so pardon my lack of memory on exact menu items. But I still remember that salsa was spicy and gorgeously amazing. I am a food adrenaline junky so any time a restaurant has a unique enough menu for me to even waste my time with is an amazing feat. I ordered some sort of lobster and seafood enchilada with a mango raspberry chipotle sauce. It was flavorful and  didn't make me feel like I was eating unhealthy and ridiculously rich.  When I go back to visit my grandparents in Mesa I certainly plan on going back here over and over and over again!
