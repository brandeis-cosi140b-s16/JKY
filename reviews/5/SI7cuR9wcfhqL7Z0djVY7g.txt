I am not a local, but during the week of Inside Bitcoin: Las Vegas - there was a group of 40-50 people that went here because Jalisco Cantina accepted Bitcoin! Everyone was extremely happy about it. 

The food was AMAZING, the Vegetable Fajitas were delicious. Service was phenomenal. Absolutely no complaints. 

If you like Mexican food, this place is a MUST.

Happy feasting. Cheers!
