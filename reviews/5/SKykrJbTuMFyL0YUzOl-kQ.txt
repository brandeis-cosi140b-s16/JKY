Love this place! 

Small location, but great food. 

Skip the tacos and grab a huarache (large oval tortilla friend and topped with meat, beans, lettuce,etc) 

Being from Mexico, there are few places in Charlotte that I've found with excellent tacos, but this is my favorite so far. 

Fresh tortillas are being made constantly! 

The staff does not speak excellent English, so be prepared for a language barrier. 

Take me out for some tacos and I'll help you out
