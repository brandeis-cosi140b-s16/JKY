Everything that we've eaten at Popo's has been very delish. Their salsa by far, is the best we've had.  My husband & I go through 2 bowls before our food arrives. With every visit, the staff has always been friendly & attentive to our time there. We went there by a recommendation and we've been going back ever since. I recommend you try this restaurant!
