I had never heard of this place, but after following my friend to Charlie's one night, this foodie friend of mine mentioned that a well-known local chef said this was one of his favorite places to go.  With his stamp of approval, I immediately jaywalked from the lightrail stop at 7th Ave over to this goofy looking van with a "CARNE ASADA" sign in the window.  Don't worry - the food is not actually served out of this van, of which I had accidentally given my mother the impression. There was a small line, but the small assembly line of taco-makers are very speedy, so the whole experience only took about 15 minutes.  We ordered the carne asada tacos, which were $1 a piece, with everything on them (salsa, cabbage, and sour cream).  I am always skeptical of hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints, as I got deathly ill after (my one and only) trip to Filiberto's, but I truly enjoyed these tacos (and my stomach did not reject them.. yay).  I think they are only open Thursday through Saturday, but I am not positive.  My boyfriend and I live down the street and went back the other night, and had another great experience.  There are a couple picnic benches for customers to eat at, but as we were not in the mood for this type of atmosphere, we took the tacos to-go and they were just as yummy to go!
