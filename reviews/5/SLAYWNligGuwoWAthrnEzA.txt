So all of the guys at work were raving about this place so I finally decided to give it a try. And let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised! It has such a quaint interior with some pretty high tech registers and it is really clean. The food is fresh and was delicious. You definitely have to try their salsa verde. It's KILLER. ;) I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you've been skeptical. It's definitely worth your while.
