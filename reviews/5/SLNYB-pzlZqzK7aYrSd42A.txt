I've been here a few times for lunch, and I have not been disappointed once! I went to the restaurant on a Friday afternoon with a few coworkers, and there were lines forming outside the door. The prices are really unbeatable, and portions are generous. The red tamale plate that I had was quite spicy, but I was able to balance it with the restaurant-made chips. For those who are checking out the restaurant for the first time, there is a self-serve area with corn/flour tortilla chips and salsa. Highly recommended!
