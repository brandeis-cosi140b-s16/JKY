LOVE this place! The decor alone is so cool - kind of "Dia de los muertos" meets Compton, Cali! Love the metal bike and Virgen de Guadalupe at the door - nice touch! Margaritas are tasty and it's been wall-to-wall people every time I've been there. I will go back again. Oh and be sure to go back to the chalkboard - they have oodles of custom shots w/hilarious names. ;)
