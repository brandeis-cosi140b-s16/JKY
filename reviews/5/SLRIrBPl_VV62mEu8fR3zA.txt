Visited with our 10 month old daughter when on vacation based on yelp reviews. Wasn't sure what to expect and we were PLEASANTLY surprised! service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! My husband got three different tacos and I got the Barbados burrito. Both were wonderful. We also got a cheese quesadilla for our daughter who powered through the whole thing. Clearly homemade tortillas. So yum! Only wish they had margaritas to wash it all down with!
