We went for brunch on a Sunday morning after reading about Border Grill in Vegas/Rated magazine.  For $24.99 you get an all-you-can-eat brunch - but this isn't your usual Vegas buffet - everything is made to order and served tapas style.  

We started with the fresh fruit plate and guava empanada.  The guava empanada was heavenly...the filling was almost like a guava cream cheese.  Next, we tried the chilaquiles and the green corn tamale.  The green corn tamale is sweet and delicious with just a little sour cream.  We followed this with the Yucatan eggs benedict - not as delicious as all of my fellow Yelpers let on - and the steak and eggs.  My husband was a huge fan of the steak and eggs...I think he only shared one bite.  The breakfast enchilada and the chorizo and egg taco were last.  I am not a huge chorizo fan so I did not enjoy the taco, but the breakfast enchilada was amazing.  The chicken was so flavorful and tender and I loved the cotija cheese.  For dessert, we ordered the coconut french toast, which was a perfect ending to a fabulous meal...just the right amount of sweet.  

Our server was tremendous - very sweet and always there with a refill for my all-you-can-drink mimosas (only $5!).  The passionfruit one is incredible - I may have overindulged!
