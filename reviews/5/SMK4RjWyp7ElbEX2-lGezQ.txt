For your basic cheeseburger I have never been so satisfied. This place sets the bar for your expectations. I highly suggest you eat it at the location, because there is something about that period fresh off the grill where the chilled condiments and dressing creates a moment of eye rolling pleasure with the out-of-this world patty and melty cheese.

The staff, as always, is fantastic.
