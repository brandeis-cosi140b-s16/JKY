Wow. Great food great servers. I went with my family. My son had fusion flautas and they tasted great. The salsa which seemed to have a bit of avocado tasted great with them. My wife had the wings. Those wings don't need ranch or blue cheese. We took a friend for his birthday and he had a bulgogi bowl. It look very very appealing and made me want to change. The Kim Chi fried rice was a plate I ordered for the table and we all enjoyed it immensely. I'll be back without a doubt.
