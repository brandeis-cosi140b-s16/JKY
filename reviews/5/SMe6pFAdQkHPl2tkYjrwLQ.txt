I love Senor Taco!!! I have been eating here since they opened and have never had a bad experience. The people that work here are friendly and the food is great. I really like their carnitas tacos and the special they have with a beef tamale, 3 rolled tacos and a drink for $6.95. They also have some good salsas in their salsa bar. I have heard they make great fish tacos and seafood burritos!! 

You also must try their cinnamon treats!!
