Great food, great atmosphere. All deserts are made in house. House margaritas are tasty, lacking a lil alcohol but still yummy. It's a rustic yet high quality product in the sleepy western town of cave creek, AZ. Carnitas are my recommendation, your local mexi resturants probably don't slow cook the pork like they should.
