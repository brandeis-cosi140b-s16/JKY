Before arriving in Phoenix, I did some quick research for an easy satisfying meal when I got there. I found Dick's on Yelp, and hastily made a quick decision to have my fellow out of townees join me for dinner when they picked me up at the airport.  Unsure of what we were in for, I kept my fingers crossed as we pulled up to the strip mall keeping our eyes peeled for this hidden treasure.  We just about gave up after circling the strip a few times... until we found the door marked 6008.  Thank goodness we found it!

We luckily got a table right away just as another party was leaving.  One of the guys reassured us of our choice.  He told us we'd love it, and that he comes here everytime he's in town.

The staff was super friendly, super helpful and super nice--always making sure we had everything we needed and that our margaritas were full.  YOU MUST GET THE MARGARITA!  One of the best I've had, probably because of the fresh squeezed lime juice that you can really taste.

The chips and salsa + guacamole is a must.  So fresh.  I could have eaten just this and would have been satisfied.  The recommended skewers appetizer was just as tasty as the bartender said it would be.  Between the three of us, we could have had just these two items and would have been fine, but we each ordered an enchilada entree that definitely put us over the top.  I got both the red and green sauce, but I would recommend just the green.

If we had more time on our trip, we would have come back for a second visit.  We'll definitely be back on our next trip!
