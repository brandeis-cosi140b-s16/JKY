Absolutely delighted we found this restaurant! We were spending one night in town and it happened to be my husband's birthday and our anniversary.  Based in Yelp reviews we chose El Ranchero.  

Honestly our meal was fantastic from start to finish. Loved the chips with 2 salsas and beans to start. My husband got a spicy shrimp platter with cole slaw and rice. I got the appetizer platter with a boatload of fried yumminess: tacos, taquitos, and flautas.  Both were delicious and the portions were huge. Our bill was, less than $25....unbelievable! 

Lastly, our server Candy was wonderful.  She was so friendly and communicative without being overbearing.  She seemed to love her job and that is infectious and made us happy!

Totally unexpected yet appreciated anniversary dinner in Wickenburg.  Thanks Candy and cooks!
