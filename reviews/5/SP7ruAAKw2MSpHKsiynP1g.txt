Huge breakfast Burrito!  7.64 but well worth it. Added cheese, bacon & potatoes to my sausage and egg!!  This hit the spot!  Already been there twice in the last 3 days!!!  They were also wearing gloves which is always a plus!  Very friendly staff!  Same girl helped me both times!  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!
