Just the best food ever and the environment is so relaxed and fun.  I always have to resist the urge to faceplant when I am here.  The Cabo rolls are excellent, the corn salsa is sweet and spicy and totally addictive.  The beer battered whitefish tacos are just wonderful.  While there, the special on 3$ bloody mary's was a welcome surprise....the best bloody mary I've ever had.  And our waitress Brittany was fabulous.....attentive but not overly and welcoming and sweet.  Can't wait to come back!
