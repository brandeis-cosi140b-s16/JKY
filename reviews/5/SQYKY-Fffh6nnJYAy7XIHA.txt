Simply awesome.  We ate there on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesday) and it was also during happy hour.  Before tax and tip, our family got the following for $26:

5 Tacos (4 chicken and 1 shredded beef)
4 Beers (2 Bud Lights and 2 Negra Modelos)
1 large side of Beans
1 large side of Rice
3 Tortillas
Bottomless chips and salsa

So, the price was right.  How about the food?  Well, these may have been the best tacos I have ever had.  The taco shells were perfectly cooked, crispy and flavorful.  Chicken was juicy and perfectly seasoned.  Outstanding.  Beans, rice, etc. were all good.  And the standard salsa is great.  Many restaurants can't get the salsa recipe quite right (and I'm sure this salsa won't be in everyone's taste), but this stuff is darn good.  Spicy, full of flavor, and never-ending.

Service was attentive and friendly, and the restaurant was 3/4 full.  As others have mentioned, you initially order at the window, but it is full service from that point on.  They have a patio that I'm sure would be sufficient when it's not 112 degrees outside.  Decor is understated, but very colorful and pleasant.

There was a severe lack of non-chain mexican restaurants in northwest Gilbert and the surrounding area.  No longer is this the case.  I really, really hope people give it a chance and that it can stick around for a long time to come.  It's that good, and a welcome addition to Gilbert dining options.  Highly recommended.
