I freaking love this place!! I loved the original location on Pecos, so now that this one opened up right down the street, I'm so excited! 

It's a fancier spot with a bar, a DJ and upstairs seating. They offer happy hour and Sunday brunch which I have yet to try. I freaking just love their tacos. I gave up beef and pork for Lent, so once Easter came around, this was the spot I chose to break my meat fast. 

They offer a variety of meats for tacos, burritos and bowl. My favorite is the al pastor tacos. You have to get them fully loaded with pineapple. Yes, I said pineapple. Salty and sweet amazingness! Their salsa bar is legit with about 10 different salsas to fulfill everyone's tastes. The salsa bar also has beans, grilled onions, cucumbers and radishes. Now that this location is closer, I'll definitely frequent more often!
