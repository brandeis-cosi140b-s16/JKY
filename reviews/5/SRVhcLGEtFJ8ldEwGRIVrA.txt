My Husband and I are here in Vegas for the week, both of us having work driven events. 

I am the Cooking/Food Network one of the family so I am very familiar with the "Two Hot Tamales". When I found out that Border Grill was here in the Mandalay Bay; it was a must go to while we are here. 

Last night I made reservations for 2 at 7:30pm and we were seated within minutes (they had to bus and set up the table) on the outside patio against the balcony. 
Great view, nice breeze and very comfortable. 

The Chips and 3 salsas came right away along with the water, our server Autumn throughout the entire evening was "Stellar"!  Appetizers and drinks were ordered after having the items described to us very clearly: Blood Orange Mojito and the White Sangria (I also tried their Cinnamon chipotle margarita! WOW that was soooo good!) 

Autumn (our outstanding server) explained many of the dishes to us; convinced my husband to the Tasting Small Bites Dinner ($45 pp) and I ordered the Chicken Mole Verde. What a Gastronomical Delight we BOTH had! I had fun watching the parade of "small bites" coming to our table as I was enjoying my free range chicken, pumpkin seed mole, watercress and the Peruvian corn.

Did we have room for desert? Sadly I have to admit that we "Topped" out. But what a great treat this dinner out was. 
 
Again I will state emphatically ... our server Autumn was an absolute treat! Helpful, fully knowledgeable of the menu, willing to banter with construction folk, etc. Kudos to you autumn! Border Grill is a place we will enjoy coming back to.
