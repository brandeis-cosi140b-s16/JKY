Way better than Fili B's.  I love the carne asada fries with a side tortilla and making my own monster burrito out of it, covered with red and green sauce and let it sit for a quick minute to soak in all that flavor.  Son gets the beef taco and cheese enchilada plate, which is also very good.  Sometimes I'll get the Chile Relleno plate with a side tortilla and make a burrito out of that.  Only if I'm eating it at home though, as I like to add two over easy eggs inside the Chile Relleno burrito.  If you have never had an over easy egg with your Chile Relleno or on top of your enchiladas, TRY IT!!
