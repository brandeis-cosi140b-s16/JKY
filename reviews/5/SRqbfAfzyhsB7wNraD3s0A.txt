Best darn Chipotle EVER!

Seriously. I have occasionally visited this place in the past couple months and was at first blown away by how nice the employees were and how clean everything was. Second time, same thing! I have been there about 5 times now and have never been let down.

I have been to quite a few Chipotles in my day and would consider most of them to be 3's, some 2's, a couple rare 4's, however the people here really make a difference. They deserve some sort of Chipotle award or other such accolades.
