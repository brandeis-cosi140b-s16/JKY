Best Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  I've been going there for, what, like 10 years?  Still perfect.  Still awesome.

I got two carne asada tacos and the carne asada burrito.  The meat is so good.  The burrito has the right mix of meat, beans, cilantro, and seasonings.

We'll go back for at least 10 more years!
