Food is AMAZING try the CC Sizzle sopapilla style, seriously FOODGASM! Fresh with tasty tortilla chips, meat, and sauce!!! So delicious, juicy, savory, and the sopapilla is soft yet crunchy. The food is SUPER filling!!! Be careful, your ass is going to be a fart bomb after eating this. Hahah!

Ohhh in addition they give 20 percent off teachers and first responders :) 

Service is fantastic, they gave us a sample of the cc sizzle on a nacho prior, which is VERY RARE in food places nowadays! So thank you for that, a few nacho samples and we bought 4 orders and a dessert! Sopapilla dessert is yummy I wish they had ice cream (it's coming soon)! The gentleman was so nice!!!! Plus they had a cute little helper. 

I recommend you to go here if you like good food. If you like bad food, go to Taco Bell or something. Haha
