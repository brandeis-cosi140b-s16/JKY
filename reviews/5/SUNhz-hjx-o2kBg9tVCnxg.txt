The best carne asada fries in town!! Every time I come here, I always order it. Never get disappointed coming here. My wife will usually get the carne asada  super burrito that is also bomb!! The price is worth it big time. My only complaint is the fact that  every time we go we get bombarded with hobos asking for something or wanting to clean my windows. Maybe be in a bad part of town but I can't penalize them for that. 5 stars quality all around!
