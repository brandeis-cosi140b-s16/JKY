Pretty good spot for Mexican. Food is good, prices are good, and it's really not too far out from where I'm at (Henderson/Green Valley area.) Compares pretty nicely against the food options at Sunset Station and some of the other "nicer" Henderson casinos, and the property itself is pretty legit. Definitely recommend.
