I cannot believe I did not review this place years ago when I first came here but I will now!

About 4 years ago I was in Vegas for a convention and my cousin took me to Lindo Michoacan for dinner one night and I was blown away.  It is the type of Mexican food that makes you want to sit at the restaurant for three hours just to not be full so you can start eating again.  

My wife and I were recently in vegas for the NASCAR race and when we met up with my cousin again we did have plans to go to a nice steakhouse but nope....we changed those to get some of the best Mexican food I have ever had...again.

My wife could believe the size of the burrito she ordered and everything....everything was just as good as it was 4 years ago.   Big time props to Lindo Michoacan and next time I am in Vegas you will see me again.
