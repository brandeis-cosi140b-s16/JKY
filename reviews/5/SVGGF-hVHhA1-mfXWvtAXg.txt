First let me say I am a fan!!! Whether you are a local or just visiting, this place is a must try!! Charming restaurant with excellent service... And the food!! Wow!! 
First it is non-GMO!! The quality is amazing.. And the food is authentic!! I I have visited this spot on two occasions and have tried The Super Fresco Max chicken burrito and the Chicken Torta. Let me say the flavor is on point.  The guacamole is equally amazing! And don't forget to finish with some deep fried ice cream!!  So close to the strip don't miss out on this Las Vegas Gem!
Can't wait for my next visit!!
