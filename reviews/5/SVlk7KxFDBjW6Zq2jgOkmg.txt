THIS PLACE IS CALLED PEPE'S TACOS!!!!!!!!
(There's a big hint as to what you should be ordering right there in the name...and it's not Pepe.)

Ordering a burrito at a taco stand is the same as ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant...This is not a Mexican RESTAURANT...it is a glorified taco stand and you should treat it as such. I have never ordered anything other than the breakfast plates or tacos here, nor will I ever! 

Some of you remind me of the girl I stood behind at IN-N-OUT who was asking them to make her a chicken sandwich.

I have not eaten at all of the taco places in town but of those I have tried Pepe's is the best. They have the most choices of meat for your tacos, the shells are always nice and soft but never fall apart like the stale ones I have run into other places. AND they always ask you if you want the extras (onions, cilantro, and salsa) on the taco. So if you think there is too much of these things on the taco just don't get it and add them all yourself from the salsa bar.

The lengua here is the best. I like mine finely chopped because it is a rubbery texture, and most places leave it in large cubes, the carnitas here are nice and moist, whereas when I've had it at Roberto's it is always dry and is not nearly chopped or shredded enough.

The star of the menu for me and for those of you who appreciate it, is the best cabeza tacos I've had in Vegas. It is perfectly oily and greasy and tasty just like head meat should be. 
 
Go on Tuesday or Thursday for the taco plate special: $6.95 for 4 tacos and a drink...and get at least 1 cabeza (if not all 4)
