We have been frequenting this place a few times a month since we first "discovered" it. I kid you not, he makes the best chili cheese fries. I can't even think of any other place after trying his chili cheese fries. 

My other favorite is the "country" cheese burger. not sure why it's called that but the richness of the thousand island balances well with the smokey flavor of the burger. The onion rings are lightly seasoned with some black pepper and paprika in the batter. My son and husband swear by the catfish, and they get the potato salad to go with it. 

Yes, the service can be a bit slow, but not in the way like they are ignoring you, but in the "there is only one guy manning the orders, grill and register" way. Which I appreciate and is often seen in these little neighborhood joints. 

I will also say, that the owner remembers me when I come in, which I find pretty amazing considering he must see more than a few people each day. 

Bring a few quarters with you, while I'm waiting I like to play "Black Rose, Queen of the Sea", good old fashioned pinball. He has other games too, but that one is my favorite.
