Amazed at how great the food is!! Right in the middle of Old Town with a great modern interior.  We have always sat at the large bar to eat, but they have a good sized dining room too; would be great to get tacos with a big group before the bar hopping begins.  

Chips and salsa comes with 2 delicious salsas, one a bit spicy and one with more of a roasted flavor.  Kicking myself now for not thinking to ask for a salsa container to-go! Now for the main event...Ricky's tacos!  First of all, all of there tortillas are freshly made.  There not doughy at all and have a great flavor for any of the tacos and/or burritos.  They fill each of their tacos with a cabbage slaw base, pile on a good portion of meat or seafood, and top with a pico de galo and mayonnaise cream drizzle.  The meat is very juicy and tender with great seasoning, while the seafood is all fried, but it has a good light fry batter that is used.  Also, all plates are served along with rice and black or refried beans.  

Service is very friendly, there is never really a wait to be seated, plus food comes out quick!  Excellent and plenty of food to enjoy at Rickys!  Already craving more!!
