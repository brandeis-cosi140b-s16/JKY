our first time here,sorry forgot to take pics. wife order the platter..  grill fish,octopus saut√©ed in red chili sauce,I order the simple carne asada burrito and sure enough..  i wish I ordered 2.. the size of the burritos were the size of a regular Taco Bell burrito supreme.

there was actually a lady in the back grilling all the carne asada as orders were coming in!!
