New favorite Mexican food place in Las Vegas. 
Amazing!
Started with homemade chips and salsa. Added Pico De Gallo. I had the special: shredded beef burrito enchilada style. 
Gf had three soft tacos (homemade tortillas with the tacos). Both came with rice and beans. One diet coke, two waters; entire bill $13.50. 
Good service, as cheap as Robertos and Faustos. 
Will for sure be back!
