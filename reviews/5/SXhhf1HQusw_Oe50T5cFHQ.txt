Authentic and delicious! Been here 3 times in 3 months and never been disappointed. The restaurant seats 40 at max, cozy and not tacky. To start,  their margaritas and sangria are possibly the best I've ever had. Whether you choose a specialty of the house, soup or other entree you won't be disappointed. Each meal is prepared in a manner that completely satisfies your palate. Their guacamole and cerviche appetizers are plentiful, tasty and a perfect way to start your meal. One of these next times in I'll have to save room for dessert. This place is definitely a hidden jewel in the East Valley. Go and then thank the chef for a wonderful meal.
