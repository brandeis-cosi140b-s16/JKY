If you haven't been then you've got to go! Just opening up right off Scottsdale and Lincoln. Serving up--Awesome Mexican Asian fusion! 

Lets paint the picture!
Open kitchen so you can see and interact with the cooks. Wood fired grill, seasonal produce, fresh seafood.. You name it Sumo Maya has it! Great concept, great location and even better team! The bright airy interior   ginormous tree and large frosted glass windows welcome you into food lovers utopia! 

Let's talk food! Sumo Maya roll to die for with its spicy tuna, crispy rice, fresh micro greens and wasabi cream drizzle! What's an Asian restaurant now a days without edamame? I'm sure that's what your thinking.. Wrong this edamame is unlike any around! They cook it on the wood fired grill gives it the smokey flavor, then lightly toss it in a miso butter! Delicious! Bacon guacamole, salmon ceviche, New York strip, muscles in a coconut lime broth!! I could go on for days but you'll never know till you try it yourself!   

Do us all a favor and go check out this hot spot! Yum! I'll be back soon! 

Cheers Foodies!
