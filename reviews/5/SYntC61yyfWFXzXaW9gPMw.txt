Fantastic little Mexican joint in the quiet little town of Charlotte MX... Seriously the outside screams Mexico! The food is amazing!! The beers are super cold! (Colder than Mexico) The carnitas tacos were fantastic! Fajitas were fantastic! The one and only thing I would say was so so was the guacamole, it was still good but could use a revamp on the recipe... Other than that,, I would NOT change a thing!! Can't wait till next time!
