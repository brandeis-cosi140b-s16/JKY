This is very warm and welcoming neighborhood Mexican place.  The atmosphere is delightful and so is the service and food.  The chips and salsa are so tasty.  The salsa is made in house and has a slight kick and scrumptious. My husband and I shared the enchiladas.  He had chicken and I had steak and we both had the green sauce.  Oh my!   The steak ones were hotter temperature wise but both were definitely worth a trip back.
