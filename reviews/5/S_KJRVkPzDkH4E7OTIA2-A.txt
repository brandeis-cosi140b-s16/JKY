Originally from Cali and now living on the East Coast, I crave delicious Mexican food. I eagerly await my annual trip out West! I was passing through Phoenix and read about this place. Well, Los Burritos did not disappoint! I ordered a carne asada burrito and a flan and my dad had huevos rancheros. First off, Fernando, the owner came out to welcome us. Him and his son run the place. He cooks everything fresh and right then, so he is able to easily add or change up your order to your liking. The food is simply delicious. The seasoning on the carne was perfect and the meat was tender. The flan was so good my dad had to get one for himself. The huevos rancheros were fantastic too with a flavorful sauce. Fernando came over to chat with us and you really get the sense that he is passionate about making you feel welcome and providing you a flavorful and delicious meal. The atmosphere could certainly use a little updating touch, but please don't let that stop you from eating here. It is the true "hole in the wall" find. The one you tell all your friends about if they want some delic Mexican grub. I can't wait to return next year! Do your tummy a favor and go support this family run spot...
