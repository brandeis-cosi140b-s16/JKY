We went for the first time last week and the food was fabulous! There were 10 of us and we ordered ceviche (fish and shrimp mixed), veggie quesadilla, carne asada burrito with enchilada sauce, carne asada fries, shrimp tacos, and fish tacos. Everything was delicious. My favorite was the ceviche and the fish tacos. The owner and his daughters were very attentive and nice. I will definitely eat here again.
