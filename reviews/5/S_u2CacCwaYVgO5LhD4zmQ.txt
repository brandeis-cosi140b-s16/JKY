I almost hate posting a review, this place is already busy , but this is one secret that is destined to be shared. Nestled in a strip mall on N. Tryon, just south of Eastway Dr. this little shop is sort of hard to see from the road, but worth finding. 

This is a latino butcher shop, actually more of a deli in this case. Get in line and order up a meat of your choice ( carnitas, barbacoa even beef tongue) and some queso fresco. Last but not least are the fresh made tortillas, if you have never had fresh made tortillas be warned, you will never be able to eat prepackaged ones again. The 
difference can best be compared to tasting a slice of white sandwich bread then a slice of fresh baked bread from your favorite bakery. Now here is this best part, this place is cheap... cheap... cheap, meats range from $6.50-$7.50 , tortillas are a $1.00 a pound. This place is addictive... you have been warned
