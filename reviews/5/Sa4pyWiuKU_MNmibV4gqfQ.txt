Usually when someone is visiting or when I am in the vicinity of Matthews and someone is craving some Mexican, this place always comes to mind.  Yes, it is non-traditional Mexican... more tex-mex than anything... but it is unique and they make some proper margaritas.

Recently I was able to try their Brunch offerings and it was delicious... on top of my brunch I was able to have a margarita before 12pm on a Saturday.  Made me super happy.

The other thing that I always love about PURE is their location, and the building itself.  With large industrial garage doors flanking the sides, the space can really open up and be a great hang out in the spring/summer months.  The funky decor inside... elementary style metal school chairs and a clean modern look definitely makes this place memorable.  

It has a special place in my heart and I will continue to frequent it to support this really unique Matthew's gem.
