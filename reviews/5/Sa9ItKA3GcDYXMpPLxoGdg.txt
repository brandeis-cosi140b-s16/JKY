If you're new in town or just visiting, you'll probably hear of "Filly B's" and, unless you're oblivious or don't actually get out on the town, you're bound to see at least one... no, two... er, three... well, let's just say with Valley-wide locations and knock-off variations of this restaurant you're prone to encounter it. Pretty much every Valley resident is familiar enough with this local chain that speaking its name conjures familiarity, it can be part of a joke locals understand and is a guilty pleasure for people with even the most refined tastes. It's more expensive than Taco Bell, but the quality and portions are bigger. Watch out after last call as the drive-through lines tend to back up. Most locations are open 24 hours and it's a great place to stop for cheap eats: more than likely there's one on the way home.
