This location (Dobson & Elliot) was one of the first Filiberto's to open in the valley.  I believe (not 100% sure) but it could be the original.  Anyways, this place has changed my life.  The first time I had it was 13 years ago, I was 13 yrs old and in junior high (Hendrix Jr. High stand up!!).  My buddies and I would save our lunch money and come here after school.  A good friend of mine asked me if I like guacamole....ignorant to what it was I replied "no."  Little did I know that this "guac" would change my palate forever. 

 I started off by eating carne asada.  steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese in a giant, light tortilla. what's not to like?

Then I moved on to the Arizona Burrito.  steak, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo.  Again, what's not to like?

I was later introduced to the Steak, Egg and Cheese burrito; really good, but now I always ask for this with potatoes.  Which would make it the ultimate breakfast burrito that you could eat anytime of the day.

whenever I need to switch things up, I'll order the chile relleno or the fish burrito.  I know, I know, fish burrito in AZ?  But trust me, the fish is fried to perfection and is really delicious.

If they opened up a fancy sit down restaurant and served their dishes on plates and bowls, they could easily be the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  I kid you not, I'm a Mexican food connoisseur.  I've lived in the southwest for over 20 years and I grew up with my latino brothers.  I got this...  Other than the carne asada here, the next best would be El Pollo Supremo in Tempe (another Yelp, another day).  

Since moving to Honolulu, I've been feeling so deprived of Mexican food.  People could hate on Filiberto's all day, but they are only fooling themselves...Filiberto's is KING in Mexican take out.
