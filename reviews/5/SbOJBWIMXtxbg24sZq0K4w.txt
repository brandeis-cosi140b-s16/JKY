Love me some Julio's Too! It isn't the best mexican food in the world but it is pretty darn good for a reasonable price. Friends and I like to come to this place the day after we've done some drinking and it always hits the spot. You go up to the counter and order, then stock up on chips and salsa from the salsa bar, and then have a seat and your food is brought to you. 

Pros: 
-The el pollo magnifico is amazing!
-Staff has always been friendly. 
-Decent portions. 
-Unlimited chips and salsa (3 or 4 different kinds).

Cons:
-Nothing really.
