Wow.  Heard about this place from a friend at my last job, but didn't go for a couple months.  Hit it on Friday with my girlfriend.  I'm angry at myself for waiting that long.
Let me start with the food.  They start you with chips and salsa.  Chips are good quality chips, cooked until perfectly crunchy.  The salsa on the other hand, is out of this world.  It is seriously some of the best salsa I've ever tasted.  I basically filled up on it before my food even came.  I regret this decision.
I ordered the Pollo Asada.  Chicken was perfectly grilled, veggies on it were delicious, and their Spanish Rice is great.  There were carrots in the veggie slaw they gave me.  I hate carrots.  The slaw was still delicious.  I do not quite comprehend this myself, but it was great.
Girlfriend went for the Veggie Burrito.  Not only did they remember no sourcream when she forgot (she asked about other dairy items, so they understood she didn't eat dairy), but they subbed the rice too since the rice that came with it standard had dairy.  She said it was absolutely delicious, and a truly unique vegetarian burrito.
The server was a truly nice happy guy, they were quick to refill my water, or ask if we wanted more chips (if you see above, maybe too quick), and again just all around nice no matter who went by the table.
Finally, we both ate for just over $20 before tip.  So, yeah, great value for your buck here.  I cannot recommend it enough.
