AMAZING! Authentic mexican food and decent prices. It's a match made in heaven. It's so authentic that there are murals on the walls. 

My 2-year old had the chicken nuggets with beans. She ate most of it, which is rare for a 2-yr old. My hubby and I split the nachos and each had a carnitas plate. The nachos had tender carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, and a good amount of white nacho cheese. Delicious! Then the carnitas plate came with unlimited homemade, yes homemade, flour tortillas. The meat was in big chunks which is preferred over the pre-shredded version we usually get from other places. On the side, was a little salad, rice, and beans. All of it tasted like something I would get from those great dives in LA. 

Can't wait to go back!
