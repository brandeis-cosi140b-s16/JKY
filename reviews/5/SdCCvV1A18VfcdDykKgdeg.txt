I stayed at the Monte Carlo this past weekend and knew it must be a sign from a higher being that it had a mexican eatery attached to it.  My boyfriend and I went to Diablo's the first day of our vacation.  We were seated quickly and our waitress was super-sweet and attentive.  She gave us her recommendations on the best margaritas they served and also let us know that most of their entrees are HUGE and meant for 2 people.  I ordered the large Dark Devil Cadillac marg and it was insanely gigantic but also strong and good.  For starters we got the guac and chips.  It tasted fresh and the chips were good.  For our meal we ordered the combo nachos, holy sh!t. They give you literally a mound of nachos that are delicious and quite filling.  I was in mexican food heaven.  Our bill was about $90 bucks, but that was to be expected - especially with the size of our monstrous drinks.  Eating in Vegas isn't cheap, but if you find the right restaurant it is worth it.  We went back to eat here one more time before we left and had the combo fajitas (they aren't meant for 2 but it's enough meat/sides for 2), and they were really good, as well.  I see in the other reviews about the service being crappy but we definitely didn't experience that!  Can't wait to go back to Vegas, AND Diablos!
