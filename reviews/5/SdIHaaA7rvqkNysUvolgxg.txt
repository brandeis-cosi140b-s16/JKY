I'm with Vegas for the first time with a few friends so we wanted to get some breakfast somewhere. Every where else was jammed except for here and boy am I glad they were. This place has a cool atmosphere and the bar was nice too. Our server was chad an he did an excellent job. He was very personable and checked up on us frequently. He also recommended us stuff to do that wasn't really overpriced because the strip can get really pricey. The food was great too. We split a plate between 3 people and couldn't finish it. The tequila flight was good as well. I highly recommend this joint to anyone visiting Vegas and in the mood for good tequila and great service.
