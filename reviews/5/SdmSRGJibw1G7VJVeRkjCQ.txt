Terrific Mexican eatery located inside South Point Casino. Greatly enjoyed the warm chips that were brought out to the table after we sat down. They come with salsa, bean dip, and guacamole at NO extra charge. All 3 condiments were very good and it was nice to have a variety. I chose the steak Tacos al Carbon as my entree and it was delicious and quite filling. Steak was quite tender and perfectly seasoned. It came with sides of beans and rice. I didn't get to try the margaritas, but the table next to us had them and they looked really good! I will definitely come back to try other dishes, and to enjoy those yummy chips and a margarita!
