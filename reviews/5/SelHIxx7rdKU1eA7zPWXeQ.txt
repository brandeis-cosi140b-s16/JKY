The Best Mexican Restaurant in Vegas. I am visiting North Las Vegas which is bit of a dump and has no good restaurants, then, I found VZ's a Gem of a place tonight. Great food, excellent service and some live but soft music. Couldn't believe the portions you get and the attention from the Waiters. Full meal at under $20.00.  I don't expect to be around this area much but I would go out my way to come here from downtown when I am.
Hard to find due to construction: across from Jack in the Box and next to Pilot. 10/10 for me
