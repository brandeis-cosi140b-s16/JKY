My very first review for an awesome place! 

Thanks yelpers for helping me find this gem. The first time I went there I asked the owner to recommend something new. He said I should try the pastor burrito enchilada style. I went with his recommendation and let me tell you it was one of the best burritos I have ever had. The meat was succulent the enchilada sauce and the sauce in the burrito was spot on. The chips which came with it were nice too but the salsa was good not great, I had higher expectations after eating the burrito I guess!

Next visit tried the smoked bacon wrapped jalapenos and let me tell you they were tasty but spicy in a good way. They came with dipping sauces which really helped with the taste and helped mellow out the spicyness of the jalape√±os. Also the owner has mentioned that if I check in I can get choice of 3 tacos or desert. I chose the tacos and I got 3 different meats pork, chicken & beef. I liked the pork the best.

Writing this review is making me crave their food, so I think I am going to try the crab nachos today!
