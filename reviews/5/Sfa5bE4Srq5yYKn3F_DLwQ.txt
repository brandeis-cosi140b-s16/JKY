Yippee!!!  Veggie tacos are back!!  How can you not love portobello and poblano grilled on a corn tortilla with grilled cheese and then add chipotle white sauce, rice and a squeeze of lime-sooooo goooood.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  I discovered Rubio's about 3 years ago and for about 2 years I was there every friday for lunch.  I could walk in and they would ring up my very specific order right down to the extra chipotle on the side.  It is very nice to see great service like this place.  Fish tacos are great,  guacamole is awesome!

People will say, "oh, it's like Baja Fresh," and I will kindly say "no, it's way better!"
