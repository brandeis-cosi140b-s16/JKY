Stopped by on a Friday, after the lunch rush, with a friend from Japan. We were the only customers in the place, lucky for us! The owner and her daughters were hospitable and the food was excellent and a great price. 
The restaurant is small, with about 6 tables, so expect to share your table and meet some new friends if you go during lunch.

I'll be back.
