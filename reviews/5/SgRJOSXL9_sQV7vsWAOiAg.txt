I went here craving real Mexican tacos. Then I saw the 15% off for a check in and I thought "why not try it out" I got the #5 2 any meat soft tacos with rice and beans. I was gonna take a picture but I was so Hungry I forgot. These tacos were soo good. They definitely satisfied my craving! This place in my opinion is better then Robertos. I highly recommend it. And I'm definitely going to be going back often.
