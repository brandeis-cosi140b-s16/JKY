I kept passing by this place when i'd go to Safeway and i finally decided to give it a try on wednesday. It was a wonderful decision, i ordered a carne asada burrito to go and it was pure perfection. The guac and salsa inside are real chunky guac not that watered down version of guac. The meat was tasty, the tortilla smelled amazing and tasted even better. Coming from someone who grew up 30 minutes from the Mexican border it makes me super happy to find hidden gem of REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food! I absolutely have become addicted to this place, i just finished my burrito, second time in this week. Its that good. I cant wait to try more of their food.
