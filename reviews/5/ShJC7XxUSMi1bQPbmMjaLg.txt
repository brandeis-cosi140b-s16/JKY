I love Rosati's pizza, which is located right next to Salsa Cabana, so I had driven by this place hundreds of times before trying it.  I have always been a lover of Mexican food, and I make it a point to try new places often.  I have tried dozens of Mexican restaurants throughout the Valley a number of times to get a feel for their various offerings, and Salsa Cabana makes the best fish tacos I have tasted yet, and their prices are unbeatable.  Taco Tuesdays are an especially good value.

Do yourself a favor and give this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant a chance.  If you like fish tacos or just tacos in general, the food will not disappoint.
