If you like tripas, this place is a freaking gold mine. I've tried tripas all over the place in Southern California, and this is the best place I've come across.  They deep fry them here and get them all extra crispy. A burrito with tripas, beans, cheese, and pico de gallo is perhaps the most satisfying thing ever.  

If you are wondering what tripas are, they are the small intestine of a cow.  It sounds gross, but it kinda tastes like bacon with a mild liver flavor, and when they are crispy it has such a satisfying texture.

Also, the way they grill their tortillas for their burritos here is fantastic.  Most restaurants don't put that attention to detail in their burritos.  In fact I'm gonna go there right now and order a tripas burrito now that I think about it.
