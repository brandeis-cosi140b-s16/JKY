Wait ... it can't be true ... I get to be the first one to review this great place?  Well, we'll see when this posts ...

Anyhow, if you are in Las Vegas for the museums, at some point you'll hit those on Industrial, like the Elvis-a-Rama -- what?  it's closed? don't let *that* stop you -- and the Erotic Heritage Museum (oh, not *your* heritage? okay ...); and when you are hungry, slide up just a bit further to the north (why is Downtown to the north?) and stop by this great restaurant.

I think it's Mexican.

Whatever, the food is really, really good.  Try the tacos.  Really, really good.  Everything reasonably priced.  Just head to the counter and order up.  They'll bring it up to you.  Yes, the place looks like a set from a Tarantino movie, but the people there are friendly and -- did I mention this already? -- the food is really, really good.  You'd imagine that it was made by a celebrity chef.  But you'd know it wasn't because you can afford it, and don't have to con yourself into thinking that you like small portions at high prices.

By the way, what's up with the little residential neighborhood between this place and, say, the Stratosphere?  The streets with all of the city names:  Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, New York ... until I came upon Cleveland, I figured it was the set of all cities pre-1953 with baseball teams in both the American and National Leagues.  Still, no Oakland or Atlanta or ....  no, I guess there is a Baltimore.  Never mind ....

Also, why get a so-so room for one night at, say, the Venetian, for $425, when for that money you can get a full month -- move in that day -- at the Boston Garden ... and take half your meals at Las Delicias.  You suppose they have a line-cutting card?
