Frickin love this place. Come here at least once a week. This plays is far superior to filibertos. Carne Asada is tops on my list. Wether it's in a burrito, on my nachos, or on fries..the carne Asada is the bomb!  My oldest son likes the bacon breakfast burrito regardless of the time of day. My youngest likes the quesedilla or bean/cheese burrito. Try this place. You won't be disappointed.
