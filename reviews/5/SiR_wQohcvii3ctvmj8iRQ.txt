This Texas girl has finally found great Mexican food in Vegas!  I grew up in central Texas, lived in the border for a couple of years - so yeah, I consider myself to be a pretty good judge.  This did not disappoint.  

Complimentary chips were not housemade, but were flavorful and the salsa was homemade and terrific!  Nice side of marinated cabbage to start also.

I had the combo plate - tamale was excellent, sopita was okay.  Didn't love the base, but the picadillo was top notch.  My soft chile relleno (egg battered, very traditional) was awesome!

My husband, who is from the northeast, cleaned his plate of cheese enchilada and ground beef/cheese tacos.

The best part of the meal was the house margaritas.  Large, strong, and great flavor.  $9.99 for 32 oz.  would come back for this alone.

They have some great lunch specials, and a happy hour worth trying, too.  If we could single-handedly keep them in business, we would.   We will definitely be back, often!
