This was a great place for unique take-out food. I am SO bummed out that it closed, but, in truth, I was always worried that it would happen. It was in such a TERRIBLE location. If I hadn't gone looking for it, determined to find it, I never would have known it existed. The place was big, but there were never more than a small handful of customers inside. You always got the sense that they might not be around for long. I am ABSOLUTELY SURE that the East Valley would support at least one Chino's if they could find a location on a main street, or at least in a strip mall where it could be seen from a main street. Please, Chino's, your restaurant rocks! Find a new location and try again. I am sure you can succeed - in Chandler, Ahwatukee, Mesa, Tempe, Gilbert, etc. Those of us to the south and east need access to your spicy, weird greatness
