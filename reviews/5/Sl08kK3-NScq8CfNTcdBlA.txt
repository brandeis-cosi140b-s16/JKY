I had not been to Yelp event yet, but if the rest of the events are anywhere close to this, I will definitely get to all of them that I can!
The Beautiful Carin and I got there about 5:45 and things were just heating up.
We met Gabi and Jared, and Gabi was great! She made us feel very welcome, and introduced to some of the people there, and the conversations began.
The venue was terrific, the people we met were universally nice, and the conversations really were a lot of fun...talking about food, restaurants, music, etc.
Just a great time...We were sorry when we had to leave to walk our dog (not a euphemism).
Thanks again Gabi and Yelp!
