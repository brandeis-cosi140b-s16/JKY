Total Awesomeness!!! Best tacos I've ever had. From the second you walk in the door the authentic aromas and d√©cor draw you closer, the friendly and engaging staff draw you closer and then the food...oh the food!!! 
If one passes this place up for a burger or some other quick meal they would truly be missing out on a little piece of heaven in a shell!
