They serve the best vegetarian burritos for just $5.75 that includes pico beans guacamole rice cheese sour cream.  usually when I go to other places its more  expensive. They sell chilaquiles for $4.75 before  tax
Includes a bunch of beans fried tortillas green jalape√±o  sauce cheese and eggs it is absolutely  delicious  and worth the buy
