Good service great food. The salsa is a little in the white side (made for white folk). But it's spicy and the chips are good. They have orange Fanta so that's a major plus. I always order the "Machaca" and it is perfect, I only wish they have me more than 2 tortillas. This is a perfect place for lunch or dinner, although I do prefer the original restaurant that's 10 miles south of this one.
