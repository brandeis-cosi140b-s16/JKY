Oh-my one of the best Green Chile Burritos I've had. If you like good Mexican food give Espos in Chandler a try. They've recently upgraded the building and made the atmosphere more comfortable and inviting. The price is on par with other Mexican food restaurants and the food is a bit more authentic. I definately recommend Espos!
