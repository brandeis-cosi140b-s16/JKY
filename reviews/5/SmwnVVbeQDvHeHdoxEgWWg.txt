This is my absolute favorite restaurant of all time. I grew up with it when I was little all the way through my first year of college. Every birthday my family use to get the burrito bandito party platter with the yellow sauce which I don't know the actual name of it but it is my favorite thing and I can no longer get it. This review is to remember the memories and great tasting yellow sauce I can never have again :(
