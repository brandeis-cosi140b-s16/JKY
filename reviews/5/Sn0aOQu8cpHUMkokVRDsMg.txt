This may not be the best place to just go to without reservations. My friend and I went at 5:15p on a Tuesday and waited 45 min just to sit at the bar because we were told that all tables were reserverd for that night. But Holy Moley! Everything from their cocktails, to our incredible hoisan glazed wings, and life-changing tacos (Pollo Asado and Korean) was AMAZING! I am very partial to Cephalopods and LOVED the tentacle decor everywhere! Great vibe, great food, great drinks, so please do yourself a favor and make the reservation already!
