I love Tradiciones. It has been my favorite sit-down Mexican restaurant in town since it opened.

The service can be a little spotty and sometimes there's a language barrier problem.  But with a little patience, everything works itself out. 

I've been impressed with just about everything I've tried.  The carnitas platter is excellent and so is the Lomo Azteca, which comes with a great chipotle sauce. The corn and flour tortillas are fresh and rival any competitor in town. There's a new tamale special every day, and they're usually pretty good. For lunch, I love the fish tacos--though I'd rather just go next door and order them from the fish counter.  The only thing that I thought was less than stellar was the chicken mole.  It wasn't bad, but just wasn't as great as others I've had.

The big airy dining room and festive courtyard/patio are a nice change from the standard hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.
