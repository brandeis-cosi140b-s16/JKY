Absolutely incredible food. Not once did I ever feel like I wasn't getting the best they had to offer. Staff is always friendly and fast and the cooks nail it every time. However, they do have one special person back there that takes the food to a whole new level. I haven't pin-pointed who it is yet, but someone is a magician back there. When they're at the helm, the first bite to the last is guaranteed to blow my mind. The level of delicious is obscene, and for the price, I can't believe how fresh and huge everything is. And try the red and green sauces, they're great.
