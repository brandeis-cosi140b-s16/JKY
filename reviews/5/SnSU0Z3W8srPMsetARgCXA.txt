Why did I only find out about this place on my last day!!  This place is legit and conveninetly located right outside the Wynn!!!  They are definitely doing tacos justice, served with care and attention to detail.  It looks like a place that was picked up right out of Tijuana so don't expect a classy place, but it doesn't matter because your their for the food.  Their pork tacos are phenomenal, moist and juicy, and I'm pretty sure the only place I've seen serve tacos from a rotating gyro-like spit, which are cut freshly as you order.  Also, don't forget to get the roasted peppers.
