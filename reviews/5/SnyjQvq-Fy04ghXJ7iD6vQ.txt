I found this place through Yelp after craving some Mexican hot dogs. I live in Los Angeles Ca so I know what a good Mexican hot dog taste like! Those Downtown LA dogs cant be beat but these hot dogs came very close! Dont listen to those negative reviews. They clearly dont know what theyre talking about. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food come here!!.
