OMG! I was travelling thru Arizona last weekend and found this totally by accident. So happy that we did. From the time that we walked in the door we were treated like family and made to feel very comfortable. Lydia's daughter (sorry. Forgot your name) waited on us and gave us a history lesson on the business and recommended some breakfast dishes. Three of us had machaca and one had chorizo and egg. We are all Mexican or lived in Mexican environments and we all agreed that this was unique and better than great! I tried to get the chili recipe but was told that it is a family secret. I told the girl that I would marry any unmarried women in the family just to get the recipe. Oh god, it was so good. Instead of the eggs being scrambled with the meat making the traditional machaca, the eggs were cooked separate and laid on top of the meat. The chorizo is all home made and The proof is on the pudding. The tortillas and salsa really compliment everything else on the plate. The other customers were all friendly as well. Hope I get back out there for some more. Thanks "Lydia" !!!
