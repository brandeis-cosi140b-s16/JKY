M3 and my girlfriend frequent this establishment occasionally.  We always sit in the bar.  There is this one Hispanic lady that bartends  and she always makes our night!  Not only is she friendly and pleasant,  she is very helpful with the menu and ordering new drinks!  I wish I knew her name but we do go a lot on Thursdays and Fridays and she's usually there.
