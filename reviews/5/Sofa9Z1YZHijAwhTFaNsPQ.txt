I really enjoyed this restaurant. The ambiance and decor were beautiful. I felt like I was in a town in Mexico. I loved all the ornate doors hanging throughout the place.

I started out with their sangria which was fruity and delicious. Next was my entree Cuente en Costrade Mole (Filet mignon with chipotle mayo) was full of so many flavors that made my stomach happy.

The desserts were quite memorable. Order the flan (pastel de crema de queso) and you will not be disappointed. We also ordered the Pan de Tres Leches and it was also a big hit at the table.
