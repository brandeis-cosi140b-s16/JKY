I just ate lunch at La Ristra and I LOVED it.  I had a Mexican pizza tapa, and WOW.  I know it wasn't chicken, it was either beef or pork, but whatever it was the meat was fantastic, the best part for me.  The service was outstanding, as is the atmosphere.  I can only imagine how much fun La Ristra must be on Fridays and Saturdays with the live music.  I had a great time with my whole experience and look forward to bringing my whole family next time.
