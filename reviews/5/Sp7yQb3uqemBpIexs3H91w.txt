We love Tia Rosa's and the fact that they built this one nearby! We go at least once a week and typically the service is great. I love the salmon and shrimp tacos- and the beans! This isn't "authentic" Mexican but different and very enjoyable.  I love the decor and all the beautiful plants on the patio.
