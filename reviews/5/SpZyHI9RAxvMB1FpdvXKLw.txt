Amigos tacos is the place to be when you want some mexican food any time of the day. I am still in love with their carne asada fries! Most of the time I order take out, so what I do is call them and place my order and in 15 min i go and pick it up! No fussing with lines and people just in and out!
Try thier breakfast burritos! So good!
