Gotta try the tamarind Margarita. Hands down one of the tastiest drinks I've had. 

Went with the ceviche to start off and it was a small portion and doesn't look like 20 dollars worth. But it's pretty good. I wouldn't buy it again.

We ordered the tablita with steak and chicken. With corn tortillas. The guy said it was a plate for 2. I would say more for 3. I was stuffed. Steak was really juicy and tender.

Server was cool and on point. You won't be disappointed to eat here.
