This place seriously is the best Mexican food in Arizona (of all the places I have tried)  I have been hearing about this place from my Father in Law, ranting and raving about it.  He was not wrong.  Huge portions and amazing fresh flavor.  I could have drank the salsa it was so good.  It was such good salsa I had them box up the left over salsa so I could take home and finish!!  hahah

I can't wait to go back and try more.  I had the taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans.  AMAZING.  Seriously can't wait to go back and try more.  Also was glad to hear they have a place in Mesa too (that's just a wee bit closer)

Check out the picture of my plate.  If that doesn't make your mouth water - you need to get checked out!  Go try this place - even if its a little bit of a drive.
