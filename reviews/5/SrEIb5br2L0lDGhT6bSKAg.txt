Yum!  Best carne asada I have had in a long time.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was friendly.  This place has been compared to Roberto's on occasions.  However.... The menu and prices may be the same but the food his so much better.  I would drive out of my way to visit this restaurant even if there was a Roberto's closer.
