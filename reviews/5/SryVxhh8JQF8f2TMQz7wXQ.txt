ALTO.
what you think is a damn good taqueria here in SF is all wrong.
It's OK. I was swayed into thinking SF had the real deal Mexican food when I moved here years ago, too. BUT, my tongue, saliva, taste buds, and mi estomago all agree that Big Burrito was the best I'd had since I left the Southwest- no doubt.

I pulled up to the double sided drive through one recent sunny Phoenician afternoon. I was on the lookout for a veggie burrito...
THEN IT HIT ME. 
El Duuuh!! It's California (especially SF) that has made a Veggie Burrito a wrapped up Mexican salad (a ton of veggies, some you really dont want + other junk)....Yes, it can be bueno, pero no autentico.

In my scenario, a veggie burrito translated to a bean & cheese burrito. Simple you say? Ohhhh it holds it's own. They just don't make it the same here. YES, and I'm referring to the Mission. You have to keep going South, my friends...Make a run for (or towards) the border.
