When I first heard about this place, I thought it sounded ridiculous.  It was presented to me as the "orange chicken burrito" place.  I assumed it was a bad Chinese restaurant trying to come up with some innovative (but really just lame) fusion idea. However, my coworkers who have been out to Phoenix all raved about it, so we decided to give it a try. 

I was blown away. 

It's one of those places where you shouldn't be expecting to eat anything "authentic".  You should just eat it as food.  It was delicious. 

I was here yesterday for my 'annual' visit and ordered the 2-item combo plate with jade chicken and emerald chicken and side of black beans and jerk fried rice.  So delicious.  Although I am not a huge fan of fried food, I actually liked the jade chicken more than the emerald chicken.  The jade chicken was tender, juicy and had the perfect flavored sauce.  It's not your ordinary orange chicken.  The emerald chicken was great with the ginger/green onion sauce (that is authentic), but it was just too much meat for me.  The beans and rice were SO good.  

I have recommended this place to all my friends/coworkers who travel to Phoenix and definitely will be coming back if I'm ever in the area.
