By far one of the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.  The Chicken Cilantro soup is a must have with every meal.  The service is quite friendly, the food tastes very fresh, and the menu has a great variety of traditional and Tex-Mex cuisine.  If you didn't know it was there, you would miss this gem of a restaurant.
