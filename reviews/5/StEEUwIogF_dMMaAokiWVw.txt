Good food and great price, i live in between 2 of the 3 stores and i like that they are always clean, fast and friendly service! I always get the torta cubana and  i also like the fresh bread that they have, not to mention the price is cents on the dollar! Also the drinks are great my favorite is Horchata which is always fresh and cold! I would recommend this place to any body! Great place for great price!
