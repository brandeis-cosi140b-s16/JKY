I give this a 5 star for a Mexican restaurant that you don't have to speak Spanish in order to eat here. Being part Latino, I'm used to a little more traditional style of cooking and  Azteca does not disappoint. 
As far as the Guacamole, let me just say that my boyfriend will not touch the stuff at other places or at home but LOVED Azteca's. I have to admit, it was better than my mothers, and that says a lot. It is pricey for Guacamole but well worth it. If all you eat here is this then you're far ahead of other Mexican restaurants. 
I usually eat Arroz con Pollo or Carnitas which are always great. On my most recent visit I had the Carne Asada. IT WAS HEAVEN! The carne was juicy and very flavorful and the mixed grilled vegetables were a nice surprise compared to what other places give you. 
The ambiance is great and I don't think they have a single unattractive waitress there. The bar is a good place to start as it's in the center of the back part of the restaurant and they make a frozen margarita that is Muy Deliciouso!!! 

Only gripe.......it's not close enough to my house!
