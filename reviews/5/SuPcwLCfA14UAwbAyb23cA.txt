WOW! Pleasantly surprised! A nice clean restaurant, with great service, and EXCELLENT food! 
We came here at the request of one of our friends. Gave it a second thought because of the surrounding area. But when we saw the clean new shopping center we were a little more comforted. Then completely surprised by the clean interior of the restaurant. We were then greeted with a smile by the friendly cashier who asked us clarifying questions (I guess it was pretty obvious I didn't speak Spanish). The food took a bit to come out, but not so long that it affected our lunch period. The food was nice, hot, and seemingly fresh! VERY GOOD! Would definitely come back
and recommend!
