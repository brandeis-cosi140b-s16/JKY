I think I'm the only white person who knows about this place.

Everything seems to be written in Spanish.

I don't understand the menu or what people are eating and saying, but the drinks they make are awesome.

I guess they are called "raspados?"  I still don't know what that means.

Anyway, I highly recommend you stop by for a visit.

I have been here multiple times.  The quality of their products and excellent customer service is always consistent.
