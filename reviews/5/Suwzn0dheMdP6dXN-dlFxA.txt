I can definitely see hubby and I coming here over and over again! We read all the great reviews on this place so that's why we decided to make the trip out here. Chips with salsa & guacamole was great! Their tacos were da bomb dot com :P Tried the bulgogi (beef) taco, Daeji-gogi (pork) taco, and pastor taco! All soooo yummy and cheap! Everyone should check this place out!!!
