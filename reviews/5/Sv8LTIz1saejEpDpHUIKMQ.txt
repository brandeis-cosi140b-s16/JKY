I went for lunch and arrived close to 1. The line was still out the door. The food was really good, and it was what I would expect from a sushi/burrito fusion. It was similar to a hand roll with guacamole and chipolte mayo. There is limited seating, and you should expect to wait in line. I'll definitely go back.
