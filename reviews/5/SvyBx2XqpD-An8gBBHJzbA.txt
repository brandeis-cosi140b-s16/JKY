I really enjoyed their chicken and beef enchiladas.  I've tried several Mexican restaurants in Vegas and these guys have a really good recipe and it was served very quickly. 
I  ordered Traditional Flan for desert and it was so yummy I almost ordered two!
My server, Susan was fun and exceptional.   She kept my tea full and was devoted to my every need.
The manager stopped by to say hello and I enjoyed chatting with Monica, the hostess, on the way to my table.
Reasonable prices, great good, good company.   I'll be back.
