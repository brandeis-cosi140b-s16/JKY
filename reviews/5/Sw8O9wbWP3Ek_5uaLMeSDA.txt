This place is the best, cheap, good and fast!  I know other Mexican chains are more common throughout the valley but this place is so good.  Just writing about it makes me want to get in the car right now and go get some.  I love all of their breakfast burritos but specifically like potato egg and cheese one.  The classic 2 taco meal is another good way to go.  It's open 24 hours and has a drive-through.  We've actually never been inside.  My only minor complaint is that the tea always kinda old tasting.  Everything else is super fresh and delicious, though!
