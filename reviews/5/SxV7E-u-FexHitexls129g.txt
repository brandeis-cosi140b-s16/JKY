I'm a South Texan by upbringing so I'm picky about my Tex Mex.  I'm so picky Cal Mex seems like a cheap imitation to me.  

But this place passes muster, and then some. Their Chili Relleno burrito is one of the best I've ever had, and their potato and egg burrito was also delicious. 

Their tortillas still aren't as good as Taco Cabana's - but then again, no one's are, so I don't knock them for this.  This place is the real deal.  Anyone telling you otherwise is probably a tourist.  Real Tex Mex places should be dive-like, and staffed by real Mexican-Americans. Trust nothing less.
