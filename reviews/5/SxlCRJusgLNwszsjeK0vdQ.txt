The hookah is the absolute best in the area and the service is exceptional.
I'm a huge sheesha (hookah) fan and critique, so I didn't know what to expect, but Green Dacha is the absolute definition of a perfect hookah place.
1-The location is convenient- 5 minutes from the strip.
2-The atmosphere is VERY friendly..  the hookah staff is extremely welcoming and friendly too.
3-The service is very fast and friendly. Coal is always coming around and they're constantly making sure that the hookah is not burning or getting weak.
4-The hookah itself is of very high quality. The hose isn't poor quality like other hookah places. The coal is very good and they're always making sure to change it every once in a while (that have small cubic ones and if you're a regular hookah smoker, you know that it's better to have about three cubic coals than one or two circular ones). The foil is thick which is a lot better than the flimsy single layers that other places put. The hookah tobacco itself is super fresh and its quality is high.. it doesn't burn out easily and it's really strong. My favorite flavors are orange-mint & Green Dacha  (which you won't regret at all if you're into fruity/minty tropical flavors)
5- The staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. the owner makes you feel right at home and always takes care of you so fun to be around and he's very entertaining.

If I could give this place a 10-star rating, I would. Definitely a 10/10 experience every single time. Come here and you're guaranteed to have a good time. On weekends they have a really nice night-life atmosphere and they play really nice upbeat music with amazing base sound-systems, so be ready for a hookah-infused adrenaline rush.

Go Green Dacha!!!
