Sneaked into Las Vegas last month (Lol! Many of you know why!) and indulged Roberto's! It's fresh and fast. I saw the three orders before, the Carne Asada fries, I had to try them. Delicious. So delicious that I had to take one of my chicken tacos back to my hotel. I had those carrots and peppers before and packed up almost a 1/2 pint! My only wish Roberto's was north of the boarder in San Francisco!
