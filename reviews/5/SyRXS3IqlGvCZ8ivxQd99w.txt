Not only were the spicy chicken tacos tasty, but the staff were a breath of fresh air. They gave us tasters of something not on their menu right now, they kept making sure I enjoyed the tacos. I will absolutely return and heavily recommend that you try the food! They will have you test the meat and almost anything you want to ensure you get what you want!
