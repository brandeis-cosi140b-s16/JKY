Another outstanding Phoenix find!  This place isn't much to look at but the food is fantastic.  I had the Filete Relleno de Mariscos.  It was a fish filet (tilapia I think) stuffed with octopus, shrimp, squid, and snails smothered with a spicy tomato based sauce - fabulous!  I must have looked like a Minnesotan, because when I asked the waitress about it, she warned me that it was very spicy!  I assured her that I like spicy and it was a perfect amount of heat.  My wife had fish tacos and loved em!  

They serve a salsa unlike any I've tasted.  It wasn't real tomatoey and was brown with just the right amount of spice.  I asked the waitress how it was made but her English wasn't too good and my Spanish is non-existent, so I'll never know.

The extent of seafood at most Mexican restaurants is confined to shrimp dishes.  The menu here is saturated with different seafood options.  If you like seafood Mexican style you must try Mariscos Acapulco.
