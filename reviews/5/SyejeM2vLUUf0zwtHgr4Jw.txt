Fresh and authentic Mexican food. I return here whenever I'm visiting Scottsdale because it's just that good.  This place is top 5 all time on my personal list of taco joints. 

Obligatory hole in the wall comment... 
I haven't had issues with service like some other reviewers, but I agree that it's nothing special. Everyone was friendly enough and I think a certain "gruff" comes with the territory. It's a small place that caters to locals (i.e. workers on lunch break and Mexican American families), not tourists or retirees. So I think for me that negates any concerns with location and service as expressed by others. 

In any event,  the food is what stands out here. When you first walk in there is a bar with various pickled veggies and salsas. Try the radishes! The menu is long enough to satisfy varied preferences but not so long as to overwhelm. I've had most things and everything is great! As mentioned,  carne asada is good, but I think you can do better. The tripa is great, lengua is good (crispy exterior, melt in your mouth interior), and the sweet pork is outstanding. Rice and beans are solid and the crema and Mexican mayo taste sooo homemade. I like salsa verde quite a bit and probably use it "improperly," but it's great on everything.

If you are the kind of person who looks beyond the surface and appreciates really good Mexican food, do yourself a favor and check this place out.
