Great service, great food.

The one thing I ask of my waiters is to keep my drink full! Twice here they continuously fill my drink, even after I paid he kept coming back. 

Chips and food are delicious, definetly most authentic I've found in cu. I use to be an el toro regular but finding myself wanting Mas amigos more and more.
