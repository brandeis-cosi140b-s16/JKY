There has been so much improvement in this location I no longer recognize the establishment from my previous review. Maybe when Chipotle did the mass hiring they got a wave of fresh energy? Maybe it is because I now sneak out of the office to take this thing called a "lunch break" and the afternoon crew is more chipper? Either way Chipotle - shut up and take my money.

Two major improvements have occurred in the last few months. First - they are no longer out of items. Perhaps my last review was the last of the supply chain issues because the delicious option bar has been well stocked since. Except for carnitas, but the news says no one in NC is servicing carnitas right now so they get a pass.

The second improvement is much more important to me - they strain the ingredients before packing up my burrito. That means NO MORE SOGGY BURRITOS. That's really all I ever want in life - a delicious fresh burrito without any liquid morphing the tortilla. 

The thing I truly love about Chipotle and why I will take them above all other burrito joints (and I have branched out and tried a few!) is that they season their ingredients. Something so simple yet so few places do it. I swear the competition boils the chicken and rice and stuffs it in a burrito. That cilantro lime rice is the best and I normally pass on rice. The chicken retains the fresh grilled taste. And when you put this and many other things in a soft tortilla it is absolute perfection.
