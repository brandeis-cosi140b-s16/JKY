The place is beautiful & the service/food are equally impressive.  I wouldn't change 1 thing to our dining experience.  There were 4 of us & we each got something different & traded bites.  All of thought we out-order the others.  Yes - it was that good.

If you have a chance to book the private - it's certainly beautiful & opulent.
