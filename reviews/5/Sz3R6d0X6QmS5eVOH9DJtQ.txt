Once again, thank you yelpers! Gallo Blanco, you made me so happy! First, driving up to the Clarendon Hotel (which houses GB) that night, was a nice surprise. What a cool looking place! A retro-style sign, colored lights beaming up the building, a trendy little lobby and a cascading waterfall wall by the pool. The cool factor continued on into the restaurant. They have a bar, spacious dining area and outdoor patio (with heat lamps). Our waiter was awesome and gave us some helpful and delicious recommendations. 

Here is what I loved about GB's food: 

*Their drinks are very fresh... they take a little while because they are made with fresh fruits/juices, but they are worth the wait. 

*The guacamole is probably some of the best I've ever had. It's kind of citrusy with small chunks of orange(?) in it. I want to try to make it at home. 

*The fish taco lived up to its expectations. It's small and simple and so well seasoned! 

*The pulled pork torta. Delicious pork sandwich, not overly bready like some tortas can be. 

*I think pretty much everything on the menu was under $10. 

The only thing I wouldn't order again was the steak burrito, the seasoning was too strong and overwhelming. 

Since trying GB I've been plotting a return visit and figuring out the lucky friends that will get to go with me!
