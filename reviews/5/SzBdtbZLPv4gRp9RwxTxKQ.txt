Fogon is fo-real! Everything was on point, the ambiance, the drinks, appetizers, entrees and service. We started with the guacamole, it was by far the most flavorful restaurant guac we've ever had and for $10 you get a hearty portion. Drinks: we had the Patron Jalisco Mule and Spicy Watermelon Margarita, both were unique and tasty! Entrees: The stacked veggie quesadilla was extremely flavorful and there's a reason the chef won an award for the green chile pork!

We'll be back to Fogon as soon as possible!
Do yourself a favor and give Fogon a try!
