I like the concept and think for $7 you get a very filling, tasty, unique lunch.

So many different options for fried rice and beans, also so many different ways you can have your meats. On a plate like panda express, or you can have them throw it into a small quesadilla or small burrito. 

Not somewhere I eat often. But definitely something I'll crave randomly, because the flavors are really good for fast food
