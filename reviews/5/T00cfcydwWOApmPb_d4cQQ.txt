The cleanest Mexican restaurant in Vegas! Food is amazing! As Mexican I have high standards regarding Mexican food and I must say this place taste like Mexico. Tortillas are hand made and the salsas are delicious. They have great dishes beyond the typical burritos and tacos. Tamales, chiles rellenos, entomatadas are amazing!
