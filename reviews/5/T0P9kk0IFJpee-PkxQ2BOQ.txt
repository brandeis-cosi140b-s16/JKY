This was the first restaurant I visited in Phoenix (on a recommendation of friends), and I was not disappointed! I had one of the best burritos I have ever had, and have been back multiple times! The pork and green chili burrito is amazing, the horchata is delicious, and the margaritas are on-point (especially during happy hour)! The food is delicious and affordable, and homemade! You can't go wrong!
