Went for lunch on a Friday.  Arrived at 11:30am and place was already filling up.  Service was fast and friendly.  Nice chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary.

Food was fresh and abundant.  I order the 3 soft taco lunch special.  This could easily be split between 2 people. 

I'll definitely be back.
