We enjoyed great service and good food here tonight.  Our group of three shared Sangria which was the best I have had in memory.  It was tasty, full bodied, and not watered down like others I have tried.  We ordered tamales, enchilada, burrito, and steak tacos and all were delicious.  Our waitress was pleasant, knowledgable, courteous, and attentive.  We will come here again.
