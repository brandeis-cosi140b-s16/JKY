Moved from NY four years ago and have eaten at this restaurant more than I can count....it is ALWAYS good!! The food is authentic and consistent. I always ask for the "special" salsa that you will not get unless you ask for it. It is very hot but probably the best salsa that I have tasted. My kids also really enjoy this place and I would consider it a nice family place to take them. Also, Sunday the kids eat for free!!!
