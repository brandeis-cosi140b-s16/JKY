A mexican taco shop with a vegan menu! We found our mexican food fix when we're in vegas. Very super friendly staff. Elena helped us out and explained the food items. Our first time experience was awesome. Definitely will be here when we visit my parents here every month! A must go for some great foods unique food as well.
