This place has the best carne asada. The meat is seasoned perfectly and tender and juicy. The corn tortilla I chose to have it on was delicious. They have a salsa bar that you take your food over to and choose toppings. I chose cilantro, pickled spicy onion and green salsa on my first one and pico on my second one (yes, I went and ordered seconds). I HIGHLY recommend making a stop to try a few tacos here. I also had the barbacoa pork taco. O.M.G. it was ah-ma-zing! Its juices were so flavorful and the meat was perfectly cooked and soft. I wanted to drink the drippings from my plate. But, that wouldn't have been lady like. The service was very pleasant. Everyone was kind and wished us a good night. Even the cook said good bye as we left.  I will be going back at every possible chance I get!!
