Came here on our recent road trip. The server was super energetic and made our experience fun! The food quality was great and I actually got to see it first hand due to the fact that the customer restroom is actually within the kitchen. Since I was back there, I saw one person doing some cooking. They seemed happy and the area was clean. 

If I'm ever in the area again, I will be stopping by!
