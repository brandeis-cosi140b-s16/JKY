I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food and I am always trying new places in hopes of finding my go to restaurant for authentic Mexican food. This place is it. I've finally found it. Their food is delicious! Most flavorful moist shredded beef.  The chile relleno is out of this world! They don't fry them which I love.  Everything is so fresh and the horchata is great. Also the servers are super friendly too. Believe me you will not be disappointed. It's a must try!
