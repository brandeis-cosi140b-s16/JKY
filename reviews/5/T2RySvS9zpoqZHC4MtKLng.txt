What can I say? Great food, great little 'patio' that overlooks the waterfall and daily water show in the atrium at Sam's Town. If you go for dinner, that is the best time to watch the light show. What really blew me away was the $9.99 Bottomless Margaritas and Endless Tacos! Yea, I wrote that right...$9.99...and they are great Margaritas and Tacos. Get off the strip and experience an awesome place!
