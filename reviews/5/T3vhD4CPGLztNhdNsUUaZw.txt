Mejico is phenomenal and deserving of all the praise I can heap upon it.  The service was absolutely top-notch.  The margaritas aren't the overly sweet swill you're accustomed to - the quality of the ingredients in their cocktails speak for themselves.

The dinner menu contains a lot of the finer ingredients that really distinguish this from standard Mexican fare, namely cotija cheese and some of the best green chile sauce I've had in Arizona.
