Quality atmosphere serving quality Southwestern cuisine.

From happy hour to brunch to wowing out-of-town clients and friends this is my go-to restaurant.  Please, whatever you do, start with the roasted garlic plate or bacon wrapped shrimp and a prickly pear margarita.  Follow up this five star opener with any other southwestern entree paired with an earthy red wine and the magic of the Rokerij will engulf you.

Secret Tip:  Sister restaurant Dick's Hideaway at 16th and Bethany Home for the same menu in a top-secret location.  Find me here for brunch every other Sunday (Carne Adovado and Eggs)
