This was my first visit to Gallo Blanco and I must say I was beyond impressed. 

Servcie was incredible, especially when you consider the party I was with. It was 20+ people that all wanted split checks (this does not happen anywhere I know of), arrived at different times and why were all chatting it up with everybody. Generally this leads to horrible service. But the crew at Gallo Blanco was stellar. We even got a stop by visit from Doug Robson who is the owner, he seen we were having a tweetup and just wanted to make sure we were ok. 

I had the Egg torta which was egg, chorizo, guacamole and some other ingredients on the typical torta bread. This was a perfect choice for my morning. I am not sure the names of what everybody else got but I heard no complaints. The mimosa with fresh squeezed OJ was very delicious. 

Great venue, great location, great service ~ A+ in my book.
