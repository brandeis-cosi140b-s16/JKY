Make sure you get the carne asada tacos with the corn tortillas and red sauce. They are just about the best damn tacos I've ever had anywhere. They are pretty small, even for street taco style, but I don't give a crap. I could pound 9 of those things in one sitting no problem and not have any issues. I also had a carnitas taco, which was good too but the carne asada is hands down the way to go. I also had a carne asada burrito, which was okay, but the flour tortilla was kinda bootsy. Stick with the tacos! Also, the staff here is SUPER friendly and the food comes out in a timely manner. 

Here's the kicker... I'm from California and was just in town for biz. I know Mexican food obviously so this stands up to any of the joints around here as well. I ACTUALLY ORDERED 6 TACOS TO GO AND TOOK THEM HOME WITH ME ON THE FLIGHT BACK TO CA. That's right, the tacos are that good. My girlfriend tried them, even a few hours old, and said they were delicious. Of course, getting them right off the grill with the tortillas with a light crisp is the best way to go!
