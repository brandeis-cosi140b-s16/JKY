Love 1900!
The location rocks!
The service is always amazing. We love sitting at the bar. Sean & Jose always take great care of us.  (we moved to another city and when we come to visit, the guys still remember our names and our drinks!)
The food is great! The salsa is spicy with great flavor. The black beans are wonderful. I love both the enchiladas verde and the mole!
1900 has more flavor than Vida and more character than Cantina!
