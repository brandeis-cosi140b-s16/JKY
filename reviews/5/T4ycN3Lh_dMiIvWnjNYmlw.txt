The Barbacoa Beef was so spicy and delicious!   

But that's not the best part of this place!  First off, the staff is so nice!  If its your first time, they will give you a thorough run through of what they offer complete with a taste test and description of each meat offered.  Every sample we had was delicious, moist, and of varying levels of spiciness. 

Want a burrito?  They have several different flavored tortillas to chose from: plain, wheat, spinach, tomato and chipotle!  

Once you know how you want your food presented (taco salad, burrito, torta, etc.) you get to choose the fillings: rice, pinto beans, black beans, cabbage, lettuce, tomato, cheese, chopped onion, pickled onion, cilantro...the list goes on!!!  AND they have a salsa bar with so many choices to try, I'm surprised I was able to leave!!

Bottom line:  the food is amazing, the prices are completely reasonable, and the signs out front saying '1 lb Burrito' are a total lie!!!  Those things are EASILY 3 lbs when they hand them to you!!  My husband ate a bit more than half of his and the part we brought home weighed in at 1.4 lbs!  Yum!!!
