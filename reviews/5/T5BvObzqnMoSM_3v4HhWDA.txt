Great tortas! I've missed tortas. On our first trip, won't be our last, we had the carne asada tortas. The meat was seasoned well and tender. The buns were soft and delicate. Avocado is always a must in a torta and they had plenty of avocado. The torta was so good it didn't even need the fries it came it with. The torta wasn't fancy, but it doesn't need to be. It was great how it was! They also have a nice salsa bar. I love avocado salsa, delicious. We also ordered a melon agua. It had been ages since we had aguas. (Being in Miami for so long, there is lack of good Mexican food lol). The melon agua was delicious as well. Nice, chilled and sweet. Nice little place to come check out. I recommend you guys try it. The employees there are super nice! Great customer service.
