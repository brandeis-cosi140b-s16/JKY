Went here today and this place was hella poppin on a monday night! I believe it jst opened a few days ago.  It is pretty, they have awesome service, and the tacos are AMAZING. I also had it to go and it only took maybe 5 minutes! Oh, and their prices are sooo reasonable. perhaps on the cheaper side.  My quick experience here was so perfect, and when I took the first bite of my tacos, it was even betta!  Will be back soon and as many times as I could!!!
Oh, it be inside the Golden Nugget btw.
