I really do not understand the reasons for the negative reviews.  Granted I did not go during a busy time but I will review this based on the food alone.  I would say that this place is by far the best food I have eaten.  I've been to the alma school location and I would say that this location will now be my go to spot.  The food is spicy and feels freshly cooked.  If its not on the specials board, ask for the chili relleno burrito.  Perfectly cooked, plenty spicy and worth the price.
