Fish taco- traditional with chips is so good- made hot and fresh per order.  Chips with the salsa bar is great. Also had the two enchilada dinner- you choose ( I had one cheese- one chicken) with rice and beans for just under $9.  Restaurant quality.  Tortilla soup thick with rice, chicken and seasoned nicely served with two tortillas- can be a meal in itself. For a fast quick meal at the resort or while gambling you can not beat the quality and the price. Highly recommend. they also serve breakfast burritos in the am but did not have a chance to try them
