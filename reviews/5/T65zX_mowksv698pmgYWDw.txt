Holy deliciousness!! We tried this place for the first time after I was having some serious cravings for Mexican food & this came up in the search & had decent reviews. Well I can tell you I'm SO glad we decided to try it. Seriously the best place for southwestern style Mexican food we have been to since we've lived in AZ (going on 3yrs now). 

I got the pork stew with green chile sauce & 3 rolled tacos. The stew was incredible & so filling I could only eat half. It's loaded with if chunks of pork, potatoes, corn & lots of other delicious things. The rolled tacos were so fresh & perfectly crispy but not overly greasy like some places. My husband had a #8 which was similar in taste to my stew but had smaller chunks of meat & no potatoes. It came with rice & beans which he said were the BEST rice & beans he's ever had which is saying a lot. We got a kids meal with a crispy chicken taco for our daughter & she loved it too & ate almost everything on her plate which is rare these days with her picky taste. 

All in all it was definitely 5 stars worth & we will be frequenting here often, even if it's just for takeout because the place is TINY & busy but well worth any wait. YUMMMMMM!
