Came to check this place out for the first time today... After watching the food network we had to try it! We got the jerk chicken and the red chicken.. Jerk rice and black beans ... It was sooo good! Everything was super flavorful and cooked perfectly! This is going to be my go to spot from now on! The only thing I would recommend is calling your order in before you go... If your not planning to eat there. They were really busy over the weekend... It's not the "nicest" looking place but the food is on POINT! I'll just take mine to go
