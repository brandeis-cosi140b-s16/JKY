My family and I have been coming here for years and we love this restaurant. Their food is delicious and the entire staff is very friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable and the chips and salsa are great. We have never had a bad experience here and it's wonderful everyone treats you like family. The owner, Steve is great, too! We are here pretty often and he always has a table set up and greets us so nicely. He is welcoming and is constantly helping out the staff. You should definitely try this place! Two thumbs up!!
