For the kind of place this is, they are top notch.  They are quick and the ingredients are good.  I always get the same thing, a chicken salad.  The one thing that brings me back is their Stevia sweetened strawberry lemonade.  I try to drink only drinks with no sugar.  You can never really find anything anywhere except unsweetned iced tea.  And now, Cafe Rio has satisified a huge craving I have and sometimes I want to go just for the drink.
