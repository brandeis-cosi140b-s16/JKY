I haven't been here in a while but love this spot. The super nachos are off the hook. I haven't had better nachos here in las vegas from one of these fast food type joints. They are HUGE, with chicken, shredded beef and carne asade. The Machaca burritto is awesome too. Everything is pretty good, even their friggin cheeseburger.. trust me.. they are good stuff. Like it much better than robertos.
