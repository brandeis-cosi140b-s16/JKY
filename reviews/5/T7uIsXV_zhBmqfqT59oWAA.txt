I make it a point to 'eat-in' at this location at least once a week simply because the manager here makes it his job to welcome you like this was the "CHEERS" bar and you are his most important customer! Friendly, it doesn't get better, and as for the food - FANTASTIC munchies at amazingly low prices for the great quality that you get. Piping hot when it should be and their 'Crunchtada/tostadas for a buck are a meal in themselves.
You won't find a better, cleaner, nicer and more friendly REALLY FAST food place in Las Vegas!!!
