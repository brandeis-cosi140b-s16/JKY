Delicious, fresh food, no dull tastes at Mundo. Typically quiet due to location in the trade center. A bit spicy overall, but it is a Latin Reataurant. Great bar with plenty of selections, healthy sized cocktails. Wish it was closer to SUMMERLIN. Awesome guacamole, rice with my scallops was the best I've EVER had. Very nice waiters, intimate setting!
A solid 5 stars.
