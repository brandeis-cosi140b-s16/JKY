Oh my! I am in love!!  The hole in this strip mall where amazing Mexican food used to be has made me sad for over a year.  I'm so glad that we locals can have amazing, authentic Mexican food again!  

We had carne asada burritos and tried one of each of the tacos - Fuego, Al Carbon and regular.  Deliciousness!!  The fresh guac and salsa was the icing on the cake!!  Sooo good!  

Welcome to the neighborhood, Al Fuego!!  We're so glad you're here!
