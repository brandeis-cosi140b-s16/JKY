Love it here ... Hector is the best bar tender and I don't always like to eat a lot of cheesy stuff as I eat as clean as I can... Well then I find out if you ask for the other menu (the picture menu) there are oysters and ceviche and numerous other options and they are incredible. I love the table side guacamole, make sure you tip these guys... I will only eat at very few Mexican restaurants in NC and this is one of them ... Highly recommend...
