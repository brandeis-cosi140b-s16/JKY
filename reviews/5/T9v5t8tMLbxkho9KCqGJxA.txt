No pretension. This taqueria has excellent carnitas, low prices, free chips, and a variety of salsa. For about $14 the two of us got more food than we could eat, two mini taco plates. They let us choose different kinds of meats for the three tacos and we found chicken, carnitas, and steak to all be tasty! The food took a little while, as other reviewers warned, but we got to munch on chips while we waited and were very happy with the experience overall!
