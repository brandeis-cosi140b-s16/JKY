This place was totally unexpected. After moving to Vegas two weeks ago, I was in the mood for some Mexican food and my husband was in the mood for some Texas Hold'Em. 

Anyhow, we were greeted and promptly seated despite it being 7pm on a Saturday night. A warm basket of chips with 3 salsas and refried beans for dipping and I was already a happy girl... but then when searching the drink menu for what type of margarita I wanted we saw a pink or blue cotton candy beverage, topped with cotton candy, that we had to try. We got the pink, and we were very pleased- delicious!

I asked the waitress for a entree recommendation and she said her favorite was the chicken suiza. OH MY GOD. I have never EVER had a dish so flavorful, chicken so moist and ultimately mind blowing. Mexican food is never this impressive! My husband ordered cheese enchiladas and was also pleased-- I would say though, that the portions were not as overwhelming-- it was enough but not as much as previous yelpers had mentioned. 

For dessert we had the "fried" ice cream. Basically, vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes with chocolate and caramel sauces- perfect! All desserts are only $2.50 and petite, but the perfect ending to the meal. 

Overall, an excellent meal and we will be back... as Red Rocks has quickly become our favorite casino. Also, if the weather is nice, the "patio" seating is well worth it. Gorgeous surroundings-- palm trees, water, etc. I would guess the ambience we had outside
