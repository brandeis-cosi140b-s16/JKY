How good can a cheese crisp be?! Come here and find out! All of the cheese crisps are delicious but my favorite one is the short rib and avacado. I've had a few of their tacos. None of them are mind blowing but they're good. I would reccommend the crispy shrimp taco and the fish taco. Margaritas are great. Everyone I bring to Blanco ends up loving it as much as I do. This is one of the few restaurants I will go to knowing I have to wait because it's that good!
