Azteca is my favorite restaurant!!! The food is always fresh and hot! The service is always excellent!!! The margaritas are on point!!! I use to Arroz Con Pollo for years at Azteca before the one near NorthLake Mall was built. I used to have to drive to the one on Woodlawn. But ever since the one near Northlake was built, I am a more frequent customer. Now I order Fiesta Jalisco. I am addicted.......you know I have to wash it down with a margarita or two!!!
