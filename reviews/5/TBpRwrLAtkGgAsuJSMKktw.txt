We had James as our server; he was outstanding! Excellent service, food, atmosphere, etc. James was very professional, was always one step ahead, knowing what we would need before we even thought of it. One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. I ordered a fajita burrito, my date couldn't decide so she just named a bunch of ingredients she wanted and James said "alright we'll make it happen." I love that! Next time I'm in the area I'll absolutely come back again. Oh! And the Avocado Fries are the best appetizer I've ever had!
