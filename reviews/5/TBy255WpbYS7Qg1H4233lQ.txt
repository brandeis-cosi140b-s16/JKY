I'm a sucker for Mexican food and this place is the best for me.  There chips and salsa are the BEST i've ever had in my life.  I've traveled to many South and Central American countries as well as been eating Mexican food my whole life.  If you're looking for mexican food that involves sour cream or cheese on your tacos then this is not the place for you.  This place serves authentic mexican dishes and the prices are reasonable. 

I LOVE their carne asada tacos.  They are served with the standard onions and cilantro with grilled green onions and peppers.  I always add the salsa rojo and a little Tapitio just to add some flavor.  Their enchiladas are great as well.  I prefer the salsa verde over the mole enchiladas and do not forget to wash it down with some jamacia drink.

It's family owned and you can tell by the way you are greeted when you walk in.  They are very friendly.  Try them out.  I've been going there twice a week for the past 8 months. lol
