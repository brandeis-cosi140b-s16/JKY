Wow!  What a find!  My good friend Rob was to drunk to drive after 5 free rum and cokes from the Embassy Suites Managers Reception...we used Yelp and found this place.  It was 0.1 miles from the hotel.  The food rocked!  Carne Asada, Guac, Beer and Flan...this is living!  Rob upset me though by eating my last bite of Chicken Encihlada...jerk!!!  That was so uncool!  I now have trust issues with Rob! If you are looking for good cheap Mexican and staying at the Embassy Suites this is the place to eat!
