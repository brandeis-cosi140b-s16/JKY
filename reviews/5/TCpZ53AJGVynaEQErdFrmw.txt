Love coming here for happy hour with my man.  They have HH prices until 7 and we can eat on the cheap with the yummy frozen Margaritas, guacamole and chips and the taco of the day. The vibe is great and the renovation is cool. Plus I went to preschool here when it was a church preschool years ago, so I have a sentimental connection.
