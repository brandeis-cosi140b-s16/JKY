Found this place this morning wanting some home made-style mexican breakfast.  Best chilaquiles in town. Big portion of chilaquiles, eggs, beans and steak. Also had carne asada burrito and taco de barbacoa. Tastes just like home. Price was reasonable,  paid $21for the whole meal including 2 drinks, horchata and pineapple.
