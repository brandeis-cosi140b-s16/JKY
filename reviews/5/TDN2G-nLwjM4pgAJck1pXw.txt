I went there for lunch.. the menu looked very good, it was on a Monday they were running a special with sizzling hot fajitas. It was for $7.99 w/ drink, I saw several customers with the steak or chicken fajitas. Since I've had fajitas at other restaurants Io decided to order the Pollo Con Queso ..mmmmm it was really good. The portion was big..total cost was $8.35 w/o a drink as I don't drink sodas or alcohol. The food was very flavorful I will come back to this place for lunch.
