Best taco salad in town!  Staff/owners are super friendly.  Their ingredients are so fresh and the prices are great.  We eat here regularly since we live nearby and never have been let down.  I'd like to see more gluten free options ...but that taco salad is so good, I'm happy to eat it over and over.
