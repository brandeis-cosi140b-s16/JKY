If I didn't think it would get me banned from Yelp, I would write this review in ALL CAPS because we liked the food so much.  The special Esposa margarita was delicious, but even the regular margarita was a cut above.  Frankly, nothing we had was even average (don't miss the Cochinita Pibil) - and you are wasting your life if you don't try their fish tacos.  We were a little worried that we had left Mexican food behind when we moved to Pittsburgh, but it's just waiting in Lawrenceville, for which I am very glad.
