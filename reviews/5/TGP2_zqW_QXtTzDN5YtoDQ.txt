Great specials for Happy Hour, and a lots of choices for appetizers. I have only been there for those. The cheese crisp is tasty and the margarita that I had with it was awesome. Looking forward to the next. Also on Wednesday nights is Dream Dealer poker so you get a two fer. Great food and drinks and good times with some good poker people.
