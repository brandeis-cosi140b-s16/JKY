Purchased my tamales today at the Gilbert Farmers Market! Quite simply the best tamales I have ever had. I purchased a half dozen plus one (chile relleno) and I can honestly say that I wished I had listened to the guy manning the booth and purchased a full dozen. The prices are a bit daunting @ $19 for a half dozen but trust me, the quality is worth it. Will definitely purchase again and again.
