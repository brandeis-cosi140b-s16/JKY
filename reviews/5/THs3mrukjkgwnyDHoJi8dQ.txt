Fantastic fresh fish & shrimp tacos! Go for the Full Taco the cheese stuffed yellow pepper mixed with the fish and shrimp was simple the best seafood taco I have ever eaten. The staff was friendly and quick to make delicious suggestion. Not a huge seating area, but clean and comfortable! Thanks Yelp! Reviewers for a great recommendation... We will making the 15 mile trip for these tacos often!
