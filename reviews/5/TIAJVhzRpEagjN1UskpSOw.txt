It seriously doesn't get much better than this when it comes to Mexican cuisine in North-Central Phoenix. 

After hearing about this place on Man Vs. Food (as I'm sure many others did), a bunch of us were inspired to try the Torta Del Rey during lunch one day. This thing is monstrous! The size is incredible, and the taste is out of this world! I ate half of it and had to take the rest with me to eat later in the day. 

Other than the epic Torta Del Rey, this little restaurant is just one of those great hole-in-wall places that has the best food in the area. If you're in SunnySlope for the artwalk, stop by this place before-hand and see how far you can get into the King of the Tortas!
