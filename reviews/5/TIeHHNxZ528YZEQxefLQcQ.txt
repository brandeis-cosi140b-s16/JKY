I LOVE Rock Taco Cantina!  They are so super friendly!  Last week my husband and I's "spot" at the bar was taken.  It was nice that the workers recognized that and all said something.  Super personable and I love being remembered when I walk in somewhere... in a city so big.  

The food is AWESOME!  I am finally venturing out to try something other than their DELICIOUS street tacos!  Their flat bread pizza was Also amazing!  my next visit might be Chicken and Waffles.  EVERYTHING looks so YUMMY on that menu!  

Shelly is amazing and knows what we want to drink as soon as she sees us!  I am lost when I go in there and she isn't working!  She is SUPERB!  

The owner is always there walking around too, LOVE IT!  I love how they are involved with their customers!  

I just might have to celebrate my birthday there this year.  =)
