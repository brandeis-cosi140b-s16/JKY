We come to this location at least 2-3 times per week. We love the food, and especially the queso fon due which is to die for. We always get great service and the food quality is always constantly good. I love their really hot sauce (which you must request). Bean dip is good and warn! Very good specials during the week. Love tuesdays tacos for a dollar. Love sitting in the bar area, watching the variety of tvs. 
You have to like hotter food to come here as they are the few that offer Hatch chili! Its similar to New Mexicos' resturants.
I can see how some would feel hit and miss with this location.
