Love this place! So far everything I've tried here is amazing. I've tried the shredded beef, chorizo, and shrimp burritos. Such great flavor with every one. Chips and salsa are very tasty as well. One great thing about this place is that everything is so fresh. They have some of the best tortillas! (I tend to be picky when it comes to the them. I hate when burritos taste like they use a Taco Bell tortilla.) The shredded beef is so incredibly flavorful. I notice that at other places it tends to be dry but it's so juicy at PHX Burrito House. I can't wait to try every burrito on the menu.
