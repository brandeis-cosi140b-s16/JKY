Everything was amazing. Burger had great flavor, moist, and the way the cheese was totally melted into the patties reminded me of in-n-out, except way better. 

BANANA MILKSHAKE. Had big chunks of real banana in there and I loved the fat straw they give you. 

The fries were absolute perfection. Small and very crispy, like a whole boat full of the yummy pieces you find in the bottom of your bag when you get fast food. 

Service was very friendly. When you dine in they stop by to see how everything tastes and to clear your trays and trash for you which I thought was a very nice touch. I will definitely be coming back here again, if not only to try out the Dulce De Leche salted caramel shake. YUM.
