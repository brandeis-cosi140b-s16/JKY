This place has the BEST bean and cheese burrito I've ever had at a casual dining/fast food restaurant. As soon as I tried this one I haven't gone back to any of the other bertos type restaurants. Deeelicious. Their breakfast burritos are very yummy too, the eggs and potatoes are seasoned really well. I'm vegetarian so I haven't had any of the meat, but my husband gets the Surf 'n' Turf burrito or the carne asada nachos all the time and loves it! Only thing is, sometimes they don't listen to everything you want in your burrito, so I would definitely recommend checking inside it before you drive off. 
Also if you're military ask for the discount! 10% :)
