First time here. Ordered the Mexican tacos: chorizo and carnitas. Wife had the verde chicken enchiladas. Very good chips and salsa and they also brought out a small chicken, rice, cilantro soup with the chips for free that was very delicious!  Very good service, and nice staff.  

All of the food was very good quality and fresh tasting.  This is now one of my 2 top places in Madison for tacos!
