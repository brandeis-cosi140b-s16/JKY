The BEST Roberto's in town!! We always bounce between our favorite of Roberto's menu items: Carne Asada Burrito, their Bacon Breakfast burrito, Carne Asada Fries (or Carne Asada Nachos) or their 3 rolled tacos, (which come LOADED with guacamole, cheese and sour cream) My husband and I always split a burrito between the 2 of us because their portion sizes are HUGE!

We had to get Roberto's once from another location once because we weren't near this one, and the carne asada burrito we ordered was about HALF the size of the ones they make at this location, so we vowed to always do business with this one! 

The cooks are always friendly and liberal. I'm starting to think that they know we are repeat customers.... We seriously have Roberto's about twice a week. And you should too! 

The staff is friendly, the location is clean and spacious, and the salsa bar is always freshly supplied and clean.

We've never had an issue with waiting too long, but then again we usually have (nay, CRAVE) Roberto's either early in the morning or late in the evening. And the fact that they are 24 hours is ALWAYS a plus. Whether you call your order in or place it when you're there, the wait is never more than about 10 minutes. 

Definitely a favorite food place of ours! 5 STARS!
