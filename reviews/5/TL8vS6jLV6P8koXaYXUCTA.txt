Tonight was my second time trying Mexx 32 since its remodel and transition from Revo.  It was outstanding.  I am so happy that they are up and running again and their remodel looks awesome.  The center bar concept that they have introduced is really unique.

First the service, top notch.  Tonight I was served by James who had an excellent personality, likes to make his customers laugh, is full of energy and had great interaction.  All too often wait staff disappears in the back to use their cell phones, not here.  Their staff and management is engaging their customers and making sure they are pleased.  It is obvious that they have handpicked the best of the best to serve here.  

I had the Chicken Fajita Bowl this evening which was HOT, fresh and full of flavor.  Try it with the creamy rice and ask them for some Tomatio (hope I spelled that right) salsa to go on top.  They made some minor changes (or should I say upgrades) to the bowl since its Revo version, like cheese on top, but I have to say that it is very good.   They are constantly tweaking the menu and I will say that tonight's bowl was even better than the one I had last week when they had just re-opened.

Overall, the whole team here is making a constant effort to exceed customer expectations.  During my visit tonight I had the opportunity to chat with Austin, Todd and Lenny and their devotion to listening to their customers suggestions and implementing them is appreciated and unprecedented for restaurants in this area.  It is obvious that their commitment to the location is strong and I wish them the best and can't wait to go back :)
