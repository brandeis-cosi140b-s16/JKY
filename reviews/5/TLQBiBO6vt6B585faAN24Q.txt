Was here Friday night.  Food is great.  The portions are huge.  And our waitress was so so nice.  I am from Minneapolis and we chatted some.  After our meal, we like the dip so much, we asked to pack the left over chips and dips on our table.  She instead packed a whole bagful of chips and dip.   We tipped her very handsomely.
