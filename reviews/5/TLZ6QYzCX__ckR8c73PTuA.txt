I'm always skeptical about going to Mexican places. Most of the times I leave disappointed. I ordered the torta ahogada de buche. Let me start off by saying the the salsa they put on it was on point not to thick with a good kick. The bread was soft and moist. It didn't get soggy even though it had the sauce on it. The bouche was delicious properly seasoned and cooked well. The flavor for the price is unbeatable.
