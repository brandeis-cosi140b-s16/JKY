I'm going to preface this review by saying I thought I didn't like tacos or Mexican food in general. Now I know I just didn't like bad/subpar tacos. Which shouldn't surprise anyone since I tend to be drawn to the finer things in life but that's a discussion for another day. The crazy thing is this place is cheap, I would easily pay more for what we order. 

My favorites are the carne asado vampiro which can be described as a crispy grilled taco. The barbacoa taco with all it's accompaniments and the mexican corn. It's bad for my waistline so I usually convince someone to share it with me. 
The burrito- hands down the best I have ever had. 

I love the location, music and overall vibe of the place.
