AYCE (buffet style) and AYCD (mimosas, champagne, midori, margaritas, horchata, and soft drinks) from 10am-3pm on Sundays.  All for only $13...that's stupid cheap!

And that's all you really need to know LOL.  If that doesn't sound like a deal, I dunno what you want!!

The food is good, but I never expect a buffet-like setup to wow me.  The drinks are pretty weak, but they taste good and are bottomless...so how can I complain?  :P

Service is pretty fast and friendly too.  We were here for 3hrs and never felt rushed.

Just hope you tip a few bucks extra if you hang out and drink as much as I did lol.
