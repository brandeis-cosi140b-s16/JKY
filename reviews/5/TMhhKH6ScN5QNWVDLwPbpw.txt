I go to this restaurant just about every week for lunch as I work just down the road.  It is definitely in the top 5 Mexican restaurants in Madison if not the top.  It's truly authentic, tasty, and cheap.  You definitely get more than you pay for.  

Maria, I think she is one of the owners if not the owner, knows what my fianc√© and I want every time we go in and greats us like family. 

The great food and superb service...and hopefully future liquor license (can't wait for their margaritas) gives this family friendly place 5 stars in my book.
