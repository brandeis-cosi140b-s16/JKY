This place is putting out some pretty tasty food.  It is located in a small outdoor strip mall and you might miss it as it is tucked away in the corner.  I have been here several times and each time the food is very good.  I usually order one of the fusion items, which is a nice mix of Korean and Mexican.  I have had the bulgogi  and spicy pork tacos which are loaded with meat and other ingredients; these are delicious.  I have also had the spicy pork fusion torta, which was huge and very tasty.  This was a great mixture of flavors.  The fusion (bulgogi) chimichanga was also great.  The dishes are very flavorful and loaded with ingredients.  All of the dishes I have tried thus far have a great mixture of texture, spice and complexity of flavor.  This is deffinitely one of my go to places when in that part of Las Vegas
