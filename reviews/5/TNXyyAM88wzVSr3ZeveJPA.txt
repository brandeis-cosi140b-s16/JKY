I cannot say enough about this place other than I really have nothing bad to say about it. I have eaten here probably around 10 times, and each time has been nothing short of fantastic. 

The hostesses are ALWAYS accommodating with or without a reservation. On the off chance you have to wait a little bit (depending on when you go), the bar usually has ample space. 

The service is spectacular. It honestly feels like the waiters/bus boys are watching your table constantly. I can honestly say they have never let our chip bowl even come close to empty before swapping it out with a fresh bowl...and they are endless. The chips come with salsa which is great, but if you're a regular you know to ask for ALL of their salsa options...they have a VERY spicy habenero and a mild tomatillo. They are also excellent at always making sure your water glasses are always full!

The food is unreal. I have never tried something I did not like. And, if they don't have something you want on the menu, they work with you to create it! My friend said he wanted the picture he saw on the strip which featured the chicken, beef, and veggie enchilada. That is not on the menu as an entree all together, and was only for picture purposes -but they made it happen. I have a few examples of this. If you have food sensitivities, or are gluten free you can easily find something you can eat, and if not, again - they will make it happen!

Some people are not a huge fan of the lighting - but I think the dimness pairs well with the decor and creates a sexy, intimate environment. 

It is a but pricey, but you get what you pay for and it is worth it!

The bathrooms should be a little bigger based on the size of the restaurant, but it is not that big of a deal!

Love, love, love this place.
