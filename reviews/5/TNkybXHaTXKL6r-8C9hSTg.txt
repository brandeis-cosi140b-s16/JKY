Good quality Mexican food at affordable prices. When I think of Mexican food, La Fonda Del Sol is what I think of. Excellent service as well, all around a really top of the line joint from the service and bar all the way down to stuff as simple as the chips and salsas. Will return to this hidden gem without a doubt.
