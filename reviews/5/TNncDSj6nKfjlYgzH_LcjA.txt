Five stars for an amazing brunch AND AMAZING SERVICE!

I went on a Sunday morning, unlimited brunch tapas AND MIMOSAS!

I didn't get to try a lot of the tapas because I wanted to try all the flavors of mimosas! Haha :) but the tapas I did get to try were all unique and delicious! 

Rachel was an amazing server, kept the mimosas coming and helped us pick the best tapas! :)
