I cannot say enough about this new remodeled look and feel! The environment is very unique and with plenty of character. The chef's menu cannot be duplicated. It is fantastic and everything I tried from the bean dip to the halibut was outstanding!

A must visit continuously from here on out! 
I would also recommend this as a great date place. Intimate and sexy!
