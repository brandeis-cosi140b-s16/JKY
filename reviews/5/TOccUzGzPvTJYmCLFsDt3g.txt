Our standard order is two whole chickens (dos pollos entero). We have nicknamed it Dos Pollos. For about $25, you get enough to feed 4-5 hungry men. There are lots of other things on the menu...but were sold on the chicken. We take out if town guests there and when they see how humble it is, they think we're joking. Then they go in, eat and know why we take them there. Go there. You'll love it.
