Since my first visit to Chipotle maybe six weeks ago, I have been numerous times.  Service is very fast and the food is freshly made the way you like it.  The wraps are huge and will fill you to capacity (not me, I could only eat ate half).  I love the salad as it is, again, made the way you like it.  I am anxiously awaiting a Chipotle restaurant in  the Northern part of Charlotte.  They just have not made it up this far as yet.  So, when I am near downtown or in South Charlotte, I am always up to eat at Chipotle.  Umm Umm good! It's like Salsarita's only better!
