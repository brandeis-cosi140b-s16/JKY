This was a good week for food.

Great Mexican food, I think I'm swayed by free salsa and chips. For a place that isn't really conducive to sitting down and eating (seems less like a restaurant and more like a takeout) I was surprised by the presentation of the food as well as the pleasant service.  It had all the benefits of being a quick to go restaurant and a proper sit down. 

+Speedy 
+Cheap
+Huge portions to last for days
+Pleasant staff 
+Complementary chips and salsa (really got me) 
+Relatively Clean and Quiet 
+Convenient 

Nothing to hate.
