So glad this location opened up in North Phoenix. Always simple low price quality food at all their locations. 
Best tortillas in town so always have to get a burrito. Green Chili Burrito is my favorite with the green machaca a close 1A. Red tamales are awesome and the kids love the chocolate chimis . 
No frills place but everything is a winner whether you eat in or take out, if you don't go it is your lost.
