To start, I'll say that we have a group of 6 that eats Mexican food in this area every week and have as a tradition for the last few years. We've tried several places in the past... Found places with great food but terrible service, some places with great service but pretty mediocre food. This place has the whole package. 

The staff is amazing and cares about making their customers happy. The first time we went, we ordered food to go and had margaritas at the bar while we waited... Based on the atmosphere and the drinks (which are amazing, Maria makes the best Vallarta drinks... They taste so fresh!) I stated the food literally had to taste like crap not to want to come back. 

Food is great! We've been back every week since for nearly two months and couldn't be happier! David and Ofelia are both amazing servers... You can't go wrong here.
