You'll walk in for two and end up having four. Incredibly delicious tacos at a great little shop found hidden among a slew of deep fried dives and bars. Just walking in is a breath of fresh air. Service is excellent and it's fun watching this guy rock out these tasty tacos. Loved it and will be back time and again.
