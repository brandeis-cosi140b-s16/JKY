I am sad to hear this place closed. I can understand it though. Victor was getting on in age. I liked the place but was never on that side of town enough. Even though I did not go there very often, The last time I went Victor still greeted me by name. 

I'm Sure Russ would be disappointed to find out they are closed, but he has since moved out of Arizona. He even had his own private menu item.
