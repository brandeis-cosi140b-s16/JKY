El chino taqueria is so hospitable! From the moment you walk in you feel like you are in a family home. The tacos were so good. It honestly doesn't matter what kind, just get some!  The owner, Raphael aka, the chino, was very helpful with recommendations and so friendly. The salsa bar was so fresh and had lots of options for toppings. Best taco experience yet!
