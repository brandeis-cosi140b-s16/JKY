This is one of those hidden gems that you'll want to take out-of-town guests to. It's located just off of the I-10, next to a tire shop, but when you step inside, you're transported to your favorite restaurant in Rocky Point. They have an extensive menu of REALLY good food and they'll let you order off the breakfast menu all day.   :)

This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!
