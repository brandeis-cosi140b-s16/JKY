Fusion you say? Of two of the most delicious types of foods known to man? Okay, I'll admit I've been here quite a few times, and love their magic mojitos, and ahi tuna pizza.... And also their guac with pomegranate or cranberries, whatever the hell it is, it's tasty. Their tacos are also killer. Super colorful and vibrant with good service!
