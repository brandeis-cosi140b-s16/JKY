Our trip to Abuelos Arrowhead was a VERY pleasant surprise. We live in Cave Creek, and were disappointed when the Mayo location closed. So, we trekked out to Arrowhead. The service upon arrival was fast, smooth, excellent. Our server very personable and helpful! George, the manager, went above and beyond the call of duty for our gluten-free daughter. And, he was very personable and professional! What a great lunch experience! Thank you, George!! We'll be back!
