Out of the way place that serves fresh flavorful food. The service is great and you can tell this is an authentic restaurant with pride of ownership. The chips were still warm from the oven and set the tone for the whole meal. My wife's fish tacos and my beef enchiladas were all amazing. The sauces were flavorful without being overly spicy. The guacamole was fresh and fabulous. The food is top quality and the preparation is perfect and for the price they are charging it is an amazing bargain. 

The comment from a reviewer that the place is a "hole-in-the-wall" is ridiculous. The decor is just fine and simple. Not campy like too many Mexican restaurants.
