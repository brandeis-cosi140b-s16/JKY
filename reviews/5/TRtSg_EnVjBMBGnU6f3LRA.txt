hold on, licking my fingers....
ok, im ready.  I expected this to be 2am bar closing food.  And, 10/10 would smash this after a club night.  However...its also perfect at 11:44-11:46 am.  4 Tacos down in two min.  Yum.  Grilled over Mesquite Wood.  Tried steak and Chicken and both corn and flour.  I suggest Steak on Corn.  Pico is fresh and really good.  Im impressed, best street tacos ive had in AZ so far.   Id love a buy 3 get one free @ $3 a piece...but that was a damn fine $12 lunch.  Will be back.
***I expect the pic below is not meant as an insult, not meant as a salute.  I think its merely a friendly reminder to lick your fingers clean of the deliciousness after your are done inhaling your order.
