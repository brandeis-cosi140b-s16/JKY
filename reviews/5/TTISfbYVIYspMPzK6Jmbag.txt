This place is fantastic!

So, staying at the Riviera has its drawbacks, including needing to hike a half mile just to get a cocktail on a patio. I had found this place on restaurant.com before heading out to LV on vacation and bought a gift certificate to use.

My friend and I hiked from the Riviera and were welcomed by misters on the patio and giant frozen margaritas! My friend had the mango marg and said only wonderful, glowing things about it. I stuck with PBR tall cans and bottomless chips & salsa (which came with 3 flavors of salsa). Fantastic!

This is just a really chill place to enjoy a cocktail and some mexican grub. The misters are a huge plus! The whole wait staff was nice and helpful. I'm so glad that we found this place. We will most definitely be back when in town!
