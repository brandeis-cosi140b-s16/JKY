I loveeeee Chipotle! omg soo good! I get the burrito bowl with rice, veggies, chicken and guac and it is amazing! I try to be alil bit more healthy so I dont get the tortilla. Anyways I love that and the chips with guac are absolutely wonderful! The guac is alil expensive and the meal can get alil pricey but I think it is well worth it. If my hips would allow it I would be here everyday ha ;)
