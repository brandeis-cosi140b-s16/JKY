My husband and I went here for dinner not too long ago, and the most impressive part of this place was the customer service.  Everything - from the valet guy to our server - was focused on us and our experience.  We asked where to find an ATM machine and the hotel staff member walked us over herself and struck up a conversation with us in the process.  Our server - I think his name was Keith - really took the time to talk to us and answer any questions we had.  I was particularly inspired by the decor, and he was very knowledgable about the designer and who made the lamps, etc.  It was a very pleasant surprise to see employees that were knowledgable - even passionate - about where they worked.  He told us that the chef was one of the "Iron Chefs".  And the food was very good too - we ordered the Queso Fundito with Duck (awesome), and the crispy fish tacos (coulda used a little heat/acid, but still very good), the corn something-or-other, chips and guar (very good and fresh) and the house margaritas.  Next time I think we'll try one of the margarita specials.  Bottom line - this place is totally worth trying, we'll be going back.
