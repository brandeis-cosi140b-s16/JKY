I feel that I need to share a story with you so that you understand why I love this place so much. Because you might just think "well, of course you like it here! You're a foodie, this place has great food, so, duh!" Well, yes, that's part of it. But there's more.

See, I AM a foodie. I love food. I love eating it, preparing it, and eating it when someone else has prepared it in exchange for money. But even though I am a foodie, my brother, alas, is not. My brother could not be pickier when it comes to food: burgers need to be plain, steaks need to be free of condiments, and the only acceptable beverage to consume is water. So you can imagine my dismay when it comes to my brother and I eating a meal together. He usually just wants lame food, and I want condiments galore. Enter Chipotle. 

The great thing about Chipotle, and also Subway, is that you can watch these guys assemble your meal right in front of you! And since everything is "custom made" at this place, you really only get what you want. My brother gets a plain steak burrito: steak, rice, beans, cheese. I get a steak burrito, too, but I have more stuff in it: steak, rice, beans, cheese, corn, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. This is really a place where we both get EXACTLY what we want, so we're both happy. 

Plus, it's a cool concept: pick how you wanna eat it (burrito, taco, bowl...), pick the protein (chicken, steak...) and then add the delicious plusses (lettuce, beans, rice...). 

I think one of the extra plusses of this place is that they have healthy options, too. If you opt for the chicken bowl with no cheese or guac or sour cream, it's pretty healthy. And, even better, it's still delicious! You can't beat that!
