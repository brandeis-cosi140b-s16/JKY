Wow!  Finally a great place to eat street tacos, homemade burros, and Menudo!  The staff is very friendly and full of life too. Today I noticed that the actually toast lol their burros. Pretty cool. This place is very busy but they process orders quickly and get the food right out. I see more of this place in my future.
