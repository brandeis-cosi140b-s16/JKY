Warning: If you are a baby about spicy food dont go there then write a lame review because you wanted to try something else besides Boston Market or JB's for once. This is not the place for your bland taste buds, move on.

Most people that have been to Los Dos on Central, Camelback, or Mesa know what to expect, sometimes good but sometimes sub par service but great green chili pork most of the time. What I have found with the location in Chandler is that they have great service every time and are the most consistent on the green sauce being spicy and actually have good rice unlike the others which have hard bland rice but good beans.

 My first interactions had me wanting to write of the Los Dos on Central. I had tried the tacos(they were in corn shells like taco bell yuck), the red chili( crazy hot but not in a tasty way) but it wasnt until I got what my friends were getting that I got the allure. The green chili pork in platter or burro form was amazingly good and I have been hooked since. 

 I see some of the reviews here and it makes my blood boil because I know the dorks that leave dismayed wrote a check their tongue couldn't cash as the area is predominately white and the surrounding mexican restaurants suck a big one(that is, the ones that manage to stay open). I live in central Phoenix and I make the trip there passing dozens of terrible mexican food along the way. The only thing wrong with this place is that it's location is in the middle of Blandsville, AZ and critiqued by people with no barometer for good food.
