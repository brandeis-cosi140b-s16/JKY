They're FINALLY open! We couldn't WAIT to get a Roberto's closer to our house. Now we have one. I know other reviewers had a little difficulty with wait times etc, but they're newly opened - give 'em a break!

Awesome food - same as every other location (except Durango and DI - hate that one) and great staff.

ONE SUGGESTION!!! -- Turn down the volume on your drive through speaker. The neighbors (houses behind you) are WAY too close for you to be that loud. If I lived there, your speaker would be missing by now. (kidding) (no I'm not)

Anyway - LOVE the drive through. LOVE the 24 hour service. LOVE Robertos.
