I been here a couple of times, and every visit keeps getting better and better.

On my last visit , I ordered the Fish Fillet  with white rice and a side salad. 

The fish was really tender and juicy, I got 2 big fillets over a bed of bell peppers and onions.
 
The prices are good for the amount of food that you are getting.

You get what you pay for, does not apply here.
