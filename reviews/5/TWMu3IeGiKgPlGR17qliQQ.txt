Closest to Los Angeles Mexican I have found in the Mid-West, Madison. Before the discovery of this gem, the closest I found was Taqueria Guadalajara on Park street. The Trio de Tacos are my constant go-to's. It's exactly what it's called- a trio of tacos, (pastor)pork, chicken and  carne asada steak tacos. The pork taco is my fave.
The flavors are exactly the taste of home- no cheese or extra stuff in it. Just good meat and cilantro and onions. Meat is cooked right, sauces are flavorful and authentic. The prices are cheap. The tortilla chips are really authentic and delicious. Service is excellent- everyone's friendly & acommodating. Give it a try and see what your face dish is, because other dishes like the enchiladas, quesadillas and mole are all good!
