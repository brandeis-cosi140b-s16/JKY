Made it to Desnudo Tacos today and we were not let down. It has been getting great reviews since it opened and it is well deserved. We ordered the Hongos Tacos, the mushroom are amazing and  some of the spicy sauce turns it into a five star taco.
The Chivo Taco...it's  goat meat what can I say, If its on the menu i need to order it.  .  Add a little of their amazing red sauce and you have the best thing you have ever tasted. We also did some guacamole and it was also very well done, not the cheap over mixed stuff you get in other places.  What is nice is that Desnudos keeps its vegetarian items separate from the meat items, that is nice that they take the time to consider there vegetarian customers. We will definitely be back and try all of the other items on the menu. Next on my list is the Chilaquilas!
