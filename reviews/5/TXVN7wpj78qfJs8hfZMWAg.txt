This place is one of a kind! Yea sure the drive thru takes forever but the price is great and quality is amazing everytime! Very consistent! I alwayyys get a breakfast burrito which is so delish n ginormous!! They have great $1 Tacos on tues..normal price I think is $2 maybe but they are stuffed with lettuce and what seems like extra cheese everytime! The carne asada fries are huge also! You will not go hungary eating here thats for sure! My office is always ordering from there so I know Im not the only one who loves this spot! And 24 hours is great! The lady with the bad experience should give it another shot....I really love the portions here and prices are so low.....U rock Felipito!!!!
