Don't; get me wrong, this is not a gourmet restaurant. But it's not supposed to be. If you want some of the cheapest, most delicious Mexican food in Pittsburgh, this is where you want to be. It's an unassuming, unattractive restaurant front on Forbes Ave, but do not let appearances fool you. This is one of the few places left I know of that can give you a delicious, filling meal for under 5 bucks. I've been eating the same thing (grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla) for almost two years now, and I will never get sick of it. They give you an automatic 10% discount if you look like a student, which you can't beat. Plenty of hot sauces to try on your food as well! My absolute favorite place to eat lunch quickly in Oakland.

If you don't know what to get, know that the grande grilled chicken chili quesadilla has a very good shot at changing your life.
