I am upgrading this to 5 stars are it has gotten even better since it opened.  The staff is on top of everything.  

The food is good, albeit not as authentic as I would like, but still good nonetheless.  

Only complaint is that the sopapillas have too much cinnamon sugar.  The cinnamon sugar should be an option, as I would prefer them plain.
