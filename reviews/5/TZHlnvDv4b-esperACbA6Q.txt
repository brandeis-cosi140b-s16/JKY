Really good dirty mex been goimg for years. Its not in the same class as Carlios Burritos but its very soild (Probably apples and oranges comparison though). Bottom line its way better than Robertos when your in the mood for some down and dirty mexican. Corezo Breakfast burrito is top notch especially with thier great red sauce.
