As a frequent Chipotle customer I was completely blown away by this location. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The steak burrito bowl that was made for me was outstanding. The steak was cooked perfectly and this location definitely did not skimp on the steak. I received two scoops and couldn't have been more happy.

The guac was excellent as usual. Thought I received a few less chips than I am used to but the extra steak more than made up for it. Will definitely be back!
