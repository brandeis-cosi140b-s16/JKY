We stumbled upon this place during one of the festival of the arts.  The atmosphere is quaint, very friendly, and has a nice down-home feel to it.  The hot dogs are the best, with a wide variety of toppings (try the Nana Tee dog), but if you like bratwurst, I highly recommend it.  We also tried Nana Tee's salsa, of which I was curious, having numerous awards displayed, but I'd have to say those awards were well deserved.  I will be coming back for some more.
