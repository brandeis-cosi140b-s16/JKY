I LOVE CHIPOTLE! I got in the door at 11:30am...no one was in line and the ladies working the counter were fabulous! My order didn't take too long and I never had to wait for the cooks to make anything...all the food was stocked pretty well! 

I got my usual...a bowl with white rice, black beans, grilled chicken, grilled bell peppers and onions, mild and hot salsa, corn, sour cream, guacamole and lettuce....that is how you put a bowl together lol! I never complain this stuff has never been bad to me at any chipotle! I got some chips and a drink on the side total $10.41...not too bad.

I'm glad I had an early lunch because as soon as I sat down the lunch rush crowd came in...The ladies and the gentleman working the counter handled that crowd with no sweat! They were fast and the cooks kept the food coming! THEY WORKED SO EFFICIENTLY! I was truly impressed Bravo Chipotle! 

There was one gentleman who kept the dining area clean for the crowd to find seats...he was definitely quick on his toes too! 

If you are in this area...YES...have some chipotle for lunch! 

P.S....they have MR. PIBB option at the fountain drinks!!! (Too bad I don't drink soda anymore )
