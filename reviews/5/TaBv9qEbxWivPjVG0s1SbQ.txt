La Fonda Del Sol - LOVE it! For us the best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.
It is authentic. I grew up in Calif enjoying the Calif /Mex food from local friends and this 
has that flavor. The FISH TACOS here are AMAZING! Fresh and NONE of that stupid sauce or added fat...these are GRILLED..they are light & tasty. The HOT chips are fantastic, mix the salsas they bring to the table & ask for a small bowl to enjoy. Really a great place...over 25 years in the same location...that tells you something especially in the Restaurant industry. When we are in Scottsdale we eat Mexican here. Good food, good value and good waitstaff. We never thought it would be hard to find good mexican food in Scottsdale, but it is...this is a great place!
