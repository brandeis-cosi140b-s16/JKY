I love this place. My friends and I usually stop here on Friday and Saturday nights after leaving old town. Excellent food that is way more authentic than all the "berto" chains on every other block. I've read some of the negative reviews and I have experienced long wait times as well during the day. But after years of going I know they are short staffed during the day because their busy times are only in the evening and especially at night; where the place gets packed. Super friendly and patient staff that has to deal with the loud, rowdy, and sometimes bratty Scottsdale crowd.
