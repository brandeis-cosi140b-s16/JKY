Let me start out by saying I have always loved Del Taco. This particular location that I stopped into today was very clean an the service is an A+ the gentleman behind the counter greeted me in a genuine way, took my order and thanked me. I walked over to the soda fountain filled my drink where everything was fully stocked and very clean. I sat down and the man who took my order brought my food to my table. It's nice to see the employees here going above and beyond for being a fast food joint. I will be. I will be visiting this particular location again.
