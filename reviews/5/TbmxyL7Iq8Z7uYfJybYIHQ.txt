I went with my family of 6 & we ordered 3 of the trio molcajete bowls. They were huge!! We got to two person ones so we paired up and two people shared a bowl. It was more than enough!! It was amazing! Best mariscos I've been to. I also ordered culichi (which wasn't on the menu but the chef still made it) and its a creamy green sauce served with shrimp and fries to dip! I highly recommend both dishes! The server was awesome and very helpful and cooperative especially since no one in my family spoke Spanish. Very clean place, live mariachi band, and such great food.
