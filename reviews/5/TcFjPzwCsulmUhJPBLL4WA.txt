Best and most authentic Mexican in C-U, some of the best Mexican I've ever had, period. (I love RIck Bayless's places in Chicago, I think he'd approve!) 

Love the Tlacoyo, sopes, and quesadillas. Tortillas are freshly made, with masa, not the prepackaged factory made ones. This is almost impossible to find these days, even in Mexico! CU is lucky!  Guac is good.. Queso fundido is fantastic. When asked grilled or fried, ask for fried. Trust me.

Cons: very small, always packed, only counter top/bar stool seating, which is hard if you have kids or want to go with a group.
