Took my wife and 4 kids to this place tonight. Food was very good..and the service was even better. My kids like buttered hot tortillas. When I ordered 2 buttered tortillas, the cashier said that they did not have butter. I told him that a hot tortilla without butter would be fine. When they brought us our food, the owner brought us a cube of butter and said he just went and picked it up at Sprouts. How impressive is that? I have been waiting for a food Mexican food place to come to Surprise for a while now. We will definitely be back!
