I'm a taco fanatic. I've been on Burrito/Taco Quest for the dankest Grindz in Vegas for a long, long time. I've read review after review and had this place bookmarked for quite some time. 

I found myself on the East side recently and stopped into this taqueria. Once I walked in I was shocked at how large and clean this place is. Usually taco shops in Vegas are dimly lot and kind of dirty. 

There are several different stations, all with different kinds of meats. TyT offered burritos, tacos, nachos, bowls, fries, and Mexican corn. The menu is much more limited than most taco shops around town, but I don't mind. Why do 50 things okay when you can do everything on the menu superbly? 

The Mexican street corn is a must! Fresh corn on the cob, lightly brushed with mayo, coated with cheese, and some spices. (It is not hot, just seasoning perfection!)

Next I ordered an al pastor taco and a lengua taco. Both were melt in your mouth goodness. The meat was perfectly seasoned and succulent. Tender and juicy. Topped with opinions and cilantro. 

Another stand out is the salsa bar. There are 8 salsas. All of which are tasty and fresh. Usually when I am at a Roberto's or the like, the salsa is just gross. Either red and fiery or green and watery and flavorless. There is a green creamy salsa here that is off the charts. No only are there the premium salsas, there are black beans and pinto beans, cucumbers, limes, the spicy carrots and onions, and grilled jalape√±os and onions.

My sister and I dined here for under $12 combined. This place is cheap! Too cheap in my opinion, but I can't complain.

Taco y Taco houses the best tacos I've had in Vegas to date. It's totally worth the trip across town for me. I can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this street flair.
