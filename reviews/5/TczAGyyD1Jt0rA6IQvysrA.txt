Friendly staff :)  been coming to this location for more than a year. There food is always tasty. Clean, and fast in and out. The portion of the meal is very big. Normally it will takes me 2 mean to finish 1 order. I recommend the salad bowl, it pretty much come with everything and no extra charge for guacamole. Steak and chicken are both very tender, I often order half and half. 
My husband always order a side of tortilla so he will wrap the salad inside the tortilla like a burritos
