UNCERTAIN WHY I HAVE NEVER ENTERED THE SANDBAR BEFORE....

But I know I will be rolling through on Thursdays a little more often..

So my boy gets a end of School year thank you gift of a Gift Card... Blessing that would help ease the pain....

We Park to see Mist Systems chilling the air and the outside bar...(we will check out later without the kids).. Walk in to 2 welcoming faces, the ladies showed us to a table, got our drink order, we were going to order our usual Mexican fair, but decided to hear what was on Happy Hour and Thursday Special.... Little did we know

They had a Chicken Chimichanga  that was normally $11.99 for $5.99 so I thought, sounds cheap i will order 2 one for now and one for Lunch tomorrow (Thank god tomorrow came, I will be brutalizing that Chimi like it was its first night in prison...lol)

But I digress, so we order the Chimi and notice we are just in time for Happy Hour to close out, Waitress Explains that its also Ladies Night and Ladies get drinks HALF OFF...! BOOYAH! so they have A Magical Margarita Machine .... Boy was it Magic... Nice stuff by the way, so we find out why they only have one size.... Cause its all you need.

Food gets delivered and presentation is nice, drinks are on hand and we all dive in... Then the surprise of the Spicy Smokey Chicken in the crispy hand made deep fried tortilla. Needless to say it was off the Chain and the guacamole was on-point, and I recommend ordering the extra at $0.50 per cup.

Needless to say i only needed water, cause the Tequila was working its magic.. 

diner was a hit and we will be back, the burgers were of the Rock Bottom of Arrowhead before they fell off...

And leftovers....wow........round two of Bring the Joy and Pain...lol
