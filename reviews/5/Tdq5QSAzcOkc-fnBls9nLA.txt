Stopped by for lunch on our way from the airport and was very pleased to find some great street tacos. I had lengua tacos and my coworker had carnitas. Both were delicious and the salsa was a nice topper. For the soda drinkers out there, they have Mexican Coke! The one with real cane sugar! Only disappointment is that I've been traveling to Phoenix for work for over two years and only just now found this place.
