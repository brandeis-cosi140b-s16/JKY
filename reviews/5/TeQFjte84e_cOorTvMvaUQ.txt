Very consistent at this location. 
I hadn't been here in years and a friend recommended we stop in. 
The place looked very clean and obviously well cared for and properly updated. I was pleased to see that the quality level was still very high. I frequent the one off of Camelback in Phoenix and that one is always solid too. 
Unfortunately cant say that for the one off of 92nd Street. Its almost like that one has a different owner.
Anyway, this location is a solid place to get good quality Mexican food with excellent service too. we arrived about 10 minutes till close on a slow night and they were very accommodating about staying open for us. Didn't even flinch when we walked in the door and asked if they were still serving. We even walked out with the staff and they were all 'thank you' and smiles. Very genuine. 
Highly recommended.
