What can I say?  I love this place!

All the food is wonderful and the staff is very attentive.

The salsa is very good as is the hot sauce and bean dip that come standard with your chips.  How can you not love that?

It is pretty standard fare with a few twists but it is all done very well and with careful attention to quality and detail.

I go every week and will continue to do so....

Plus....in this day and age, they close on Sunday's to give their employees a day for religious observance. I'm not remotely religious but appreciate a business that gives thought to their employees even if it cost them $$.  

Of course, I do like Mexican food on Sundays so.....that's problematic... ;)
