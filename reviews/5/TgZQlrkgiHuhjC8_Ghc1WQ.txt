I have been going here for literally years and honestly there isn't enough I can say about this place. For one. Get the Strips. They are magical.There is no other way to describe how something so simple can make people look like crack addicts getting their fix. 

When you walk in, you will see every table occupied by people shoving Strips into their mouths with complete satisfaction. For any Mexican food lover, this is place. Every person I have ever taken here is hooked for life. I have never met anyone who has eaten there and not been a fan for life. As for the location, it is not in the best of places.

 The building is older, and even though they keep it up, it is still a small and stuffy place. The best time to go is in the winter when the weather is cooler and you can enjoy your treats on the patio and watch the traffic roll by on Arizona Ave.

 The prices cannot be beat. I would go there with a group of 5, we will stuff our faces until we cant move for under $25 The staff is friendly and excellent. The same lady who served me 10 years ago for the first time still serves me. Phoenix is a cornucopia of Mexican cuisine. 

This is by far the best. You will be hooked for life.
