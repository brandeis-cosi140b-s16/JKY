Tempe seems to be the edge of our "travel for food  and drink zone".  It won't take much of an excuse to coax us back here!  Met some friends here for dinner.  Since it was happy hour, we toyed with the idea of sitting in the bar.  The happy hour menu and prices looked fantastic.  Unfortunately for us,  it was packed with people having a great time and taking advantage of said fantastic menu and prices.  No room for a party of four...off to the hostess for us.  The restaurant  has a cool lounge area in the middle and while we were offered a chance to eat out on the patio, we opted for a booth inside. 

We were tempted to order some margaritas, yet opted for the palomas instead. What a good call!  Our friends arrived soon after and they also ordered, and loved, them.

The menu offered up some tempting dishes and  Jeannie and I agreed that we were going to need a few trips back to try just about everything. In the end, the four of us ordered various tacos thinking that those were a safe bet. Blew safe bet out the water!  While these are more like street tacos compared to their big greasy Sonoran cousins, they had no problem curing our hunger.  More importantly, they pack so much flavor  in them that one is easily tempted to order some more, stuffed belly or not.

We are way over due for our second visit.  Just need that little excuse to get out to Tempe... 
Getting there for EARLY happy hour and get a seat in the bar area the next time.  It will happen!
