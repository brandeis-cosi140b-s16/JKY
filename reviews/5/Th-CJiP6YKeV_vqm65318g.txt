This is my 4th visit, and after eating four different dishes (all amazing), I have to say this restaurant has stolen my heart in concern to Mexican food and fast, courteous service. 

The authenticity of the food here is incredible, accurate and abounding with flavor. Two of the four times visiting this restaurant with family and friends I have asked the manager Edgar Michel what dish he would recommended or was his favorite. One of his recommendations was the Pollo Chipotle and the dish was better than expected and lick the plate clean delicious. Approach with a little caution as the dish has some heat, but not anything someone who likes a little spice can't handle. 

The other dishes meat was Tilapia that was fresh, flakey and tender. The fish was topped with fresh cilantro and had a balanced citrus flavor. The entire plate was very fresh and light with shrimp, white rice and a fresh salad with cucumber to mix together in your tortilla of choice. I chose their corn tortillas. 

Of the other two times eating here, once I had slew of different tacos, the other a mixed meat plate and as stated above every dish I have had was amazing. Every plate is enormous and filled from edge to edge with food. The tortilla chips are warm and the salsa is fresh. The Caso Dip was spot on and to have your Guacamole made to order and table side is a super bonus. 

I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for authentic, well prepared, delicious Mexican food, THIS IS THE PLACE!!!
