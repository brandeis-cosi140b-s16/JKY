My boyfriend and I come here all the time, and the service is always friendly.  One of my favorite things to get is the enchiladas con mole.  I always get one chicken, one bean, and one cheese.  All are great, and the sauce is delicious!  I have also recently been getting the fajitas, which are different than the standard fajitas that I'm used to.  The filling is mixed with a tasty tomato sauce that's a nice change.  Overall, this is one of my favorite places to go to in Squirrel Hill, and I heartily recommend it!
