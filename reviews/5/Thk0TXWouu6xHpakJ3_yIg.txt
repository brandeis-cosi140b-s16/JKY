This place is the very definition of whole in the wall but it is a fantastic lunch spot. 

A friend and I decided to have lunch here one day and we knew the moment we found it that it was either going to be really great or really bad. 

The restaurant itself is pretty much only open for lunch and is in a place that is not a typical place for a restaurant, meaning that it's probably a little sketchy there at night. It was an average size restaurant and maybe a little on the smaller side.  

This is a no frills down to the point Mexican food place. Our waitress really did not speak much English which for me is a good sign. We ordered the make your own Carne Asada plate that came with rice and beans. The tortillas were fresh and home made and the steak was seasoned amazingly. I had very few charred or chewy pieces. The beans were too die for and the rices was the standard Mexican rice that my grandma showed me to make. This place was a legit home made mexican food restaurant and the service as great but a little slow (which was understandable because the place was pretty packed). The prices were great for lunch. My friend and I got out of there with a little under $11 each. The chips were pretty standard and nothing special and the salsas were pretty generic but still very tasty.   I really enjoyed every bite of my meal and I would go back again and again if I had a lunch partner and had a little bit more lunch time!
