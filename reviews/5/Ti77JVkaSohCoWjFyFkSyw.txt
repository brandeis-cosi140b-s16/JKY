Move over trendy and overpriced taco shops (Backyard Taco, Joyride, etc.)! Taquitos Jalisco is here!

Taquitos Jalisco is the best Mexican food that I've had in the valley. I've lived here my entire life and this place beats all others hands down. It's authentic Jalisco-style Mexican food and it's melt-in-your-mouth incredible.

My favorites are the "al pastor", especially the tacos and tostadas. Yum! The price is very reasonable. Two people can eat heartily with drinks for between $10-15. It's really cheap for the taste.

It may look like a hole-in-the-wall taco joint, but it's worth it! Give this place a try.
