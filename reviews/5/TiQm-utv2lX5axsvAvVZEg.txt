If you like menudo, then this is the place you want to go in Vegas. You can tell its home made and not canned like other places around town. Neighborhood is a bit sketchy and its a bit of a drive, but the menudo is worth it.  The other food I've tried here was OK, but if you come here, only try the menudo.
