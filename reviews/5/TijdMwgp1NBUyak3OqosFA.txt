Best bean and cheese burrito. Ever. And it's vegetarian friendly. Please go try the burrito, I'm on the other side of the country and can't -- you can. Go right now. 

I literally drive straight to America's when I fly into Phoenix for business.

The newer site on 7th ave is less busy. If you're in a hurry, call ahead - they do carry-out fast!
