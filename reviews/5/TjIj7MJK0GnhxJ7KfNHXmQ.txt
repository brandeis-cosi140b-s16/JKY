Selection is great for someone who wants to eat somewhat healthy but feel like they are eating bad.  I customize the avocado bowl by adding chicken and asking for little oil and light on the seasoning. Love the lime yogurt sauce and always get extra. There is also a lot of gluten free and vegetarian options.  So glad this place is right around the corner from my house!
