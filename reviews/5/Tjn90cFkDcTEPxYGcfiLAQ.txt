This spot is closer than the original on the East Side. 
And just as good! Some might say the original spot is BETTER but I think both are delish! 
ADOBADA FTW!! NOTHING beats this!! We tried another spot, Taco Taco Mexican Eatery. We even did a side by side tasting! 
TACOS EL GORDO FTW!!! Yeaaaaaaaah! Cheap delicious eats! 

I wish they had ELOTE though!
