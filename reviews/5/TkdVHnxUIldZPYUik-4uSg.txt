The food is very creative, fresh, and simply delicious! The lamb ribs were perfectly smoked and just the right amount of tangy BBQ sauce. The chips and table side made guacamole is seasoned just right and will be made chunky or smooth. The beef short ribs are very meaty and tender. The churro is perfectly fried crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with 3 yummy dipping sauces. The carnitas and filet both had rave reviews from the table as did the ice cream sandwich dessert and plantain split.
