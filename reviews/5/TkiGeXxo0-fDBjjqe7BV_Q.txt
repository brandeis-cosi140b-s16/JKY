So 8/27/15 I was looking for a burrito shop and googled such. Not paying attention to the time I arrive at La Casanta and Ricky the owner said he was closed. I asked if he could recommend another shop and offered to a make green chilli burrito for me. As he told me his family history and how the chain of restaurants came to be, I noticed other ingredients I asked for a burrito of such he made me 2 more burritos from his secret reserves. Even hooked up some chips and salsa. Ricky.... amazing burritos and salsa! My brother and friend and I enjoyed them well! Trust me guy we'll be back with more peeps in tow. Thank you for going the extra mile to make the burritos and welcoming me into your kitchen. Definitely worth a try!!
