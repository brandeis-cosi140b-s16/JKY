Fast friendly service and food was good. Carne asada is lean (hate when it's gristley) tortillas are great but We don't like corn taco shells. Rolled tacos are the best and have been for many years. Carne Asada fries were good. Portions were big! Fish tacos were just ok. 
5 stars because nothing was horrible and people who give reviews need to remember how low stars can negatively impact a business. I just don't think anything was bad enough in any aspect to deduct.
