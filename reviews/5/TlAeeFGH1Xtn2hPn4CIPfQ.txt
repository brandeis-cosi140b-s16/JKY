Bomb. If your looking for a bomb pick up and go taco spot its hear. Customer service if excellent. When I seen the reviews I wanted to check it out when I got their I was a little like really, when I seen the prices I thought a little expensive for tacos and burritos. So I ordered the Asada burrito when it came out it was twice the size as a regular taco spot ( Roberto's- pepes) and the meat was cooked fresh haven't seen that before and it was perfect, taste was on point. This will definitely be my taco spot from now on. BOMB
