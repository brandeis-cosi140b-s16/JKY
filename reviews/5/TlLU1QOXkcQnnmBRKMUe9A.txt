My wife and I LOVE this place.  The salt air margaritas are fabulous and you can order them to go at the front window. The salsa is great. I love the Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles & a spicy peanut sauce. My wife usually has tacos which she really likes. We come here at least once for food when we are in Vegas and numerous times for the margaritas.
