Had a large party of 70 people and used Ajo Al's to cater the event.  The service was excellent from start to finish. I met with Frank (manager) at the Ajo Als on 90th St. in Scottsdale.  He helped me with the menu selection so that we didn't order too much or too little.  The food was excellent.  Frank himself delivered all the food set up all the chafing dishes as well. Excellent job Frank and Ajo Al's.  The price was very reasonable for the amount and quality of food.  We will definitely use these guys again for our parties.
