Visited this place in Tucson 3 weeks ago and have been craving it every since! So happy they brought it to Phoenix, I was ready to drive back for more! The food is delicious! The line was long but it moves pretty quickly, definitely worth the wait! Thoroughly enjoyed the Sonoran dog, the Sammy, beef and chicken tacos on flour tortillas. Be sure to get some onions, cheese, pico, and sauce cups to add even more flavor.
