My husband and I took my parents & brother to lunch at Rubio's and well basically I loved it!!!!!!!!!! Rubio's beats every other mexican or tex mew place in Texas. Everything was very fresh, the chips were perfect and the floor was so clean you could eat off it. Next time I'm back in Mesa, I can't wait to return.
