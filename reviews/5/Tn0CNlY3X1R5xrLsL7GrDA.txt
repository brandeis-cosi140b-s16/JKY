Absolutely, hands down, the coolest non-smoking bar in Lawrenceville. I live in the neighborhood, and frequent this place often. The food is reminiscent of the ten years I spent in Southern California. No where else in this city will you get pork belly tacos and tamales that melt in your mouth. The ceviche is quite good, the guacamole rocks, and the brie and caramelized onion quesadilla is always a hit. Their margaritas are made with fresh juice, no gross mix! They're fantastic! 

Cantina is not full of suburbanites or Shady-siders. it's a hip, cool, young, creative-class kind of scene, that isn't bothered by a crowded atmosphere. I've never once had a problem with the service, the bartenders are super friendly and fun. This place gets packed, so if you want a table in the back, get there early, or you will wait. But who cares, it's a great place to people watch, and the tunes on the jukebox spin with the likes of Metric, Phoenix, Passion Pit, Peter Gabriel and Tito Peunte, a very eclectic selection indeed, just like the scene at this bar.
