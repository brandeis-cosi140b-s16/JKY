came here because of the reviews and I have to admit that it's pretty damn good.  I've had the steak and shrimp fajita, which was pretty delicious.  carne asada tacos were awesome, probably the best I've had.  I don't know what they do to their steaks, but it's freakin good.  also had the mexican corn and i think i ate that in about 2 min.  I would get that every time i come here.  I highly recommend this place, it's open 24 hours and it's delicious food.  it's not the cheapest place in Vegas, but considering the quality of the food it's worth it.  way better than the overpriced food they serve you on the strip.  so come here and check it out for yourself.
