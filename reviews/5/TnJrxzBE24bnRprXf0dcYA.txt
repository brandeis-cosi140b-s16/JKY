I love Ztejas, I frequent the South Coast location a lot and decided to stop by while visiting family in AZ. I drove from the west side of town and was happy I didn't have to make the journey to Mill Ave or deal with Scottsdale Fashion square. The location is very open and quant. The middle of the dinning area has a glass ceiling and looked like it would be very nice for an event of some sort. The location also has sliding windows which is a nice concept until the family behind us asked to open them. I'm sure today was an average of 90 degrees so I had to suffer waves of hot air blowing at me. Luckily, we were getting ready to leave everyone their seemed very friendly and lie waitress was so enjoyable and very friendly. Our food came out fast and the difference I noticed from this location to the South Coast was the fact that they serve big portions. I always get the Mushroom enchiladas, they come with beans rice and mango salsa which goes perfect with the enchilada sauce. I couldn't even finish half and I was full. They offer happy hour, hours vary and it's totally worth it!!  They need to make more locations in North OC!!!
