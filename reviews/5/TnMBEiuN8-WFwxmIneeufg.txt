Coming from Southern CA, I am a HUGE fan of Mexican food, but I have so much good food in my life I am also very picky.  I had just started to believe there was no such thing as good Mexican food in Pittsburgh when I discovered this restaurant (the new one in the South Side).  While the atmosphere was weak, the food was so good it completely made me forget everything else.  I ate every morsel of my meal and couldn't stop even after I was stuffed to the brim.

Incredible, I will be back.
