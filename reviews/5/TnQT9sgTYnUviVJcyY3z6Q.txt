The place is so cute,, it's really open and you can see just about everywhere from anywhere.  The guacamole is to die for it was creamy not just chunky.  My fajitas were fresh and I like how they don't over cook the veggies like most places. They have these sauteed jalapenos that are super yum and taste like it would be perfect with a cold beer! Unfortunately I had to go back to work so the next time!   I need to come back for their happy hour!   And the bartender was pretty hot! Lol!
