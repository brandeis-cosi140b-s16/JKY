Las Islas Del Mar - the Islands of the Sea. I'm not sure why you would be surprised if your land based dishes were simply okay when you're going to a seafood place.

That said, I've been here a couple times now and it's been great. Service was friendly, though not the best with English. Food was great, though it is a little bit of a wait for food. They keep you occupied with fresh fried tortillas and cerviche as an appetizer.  The food.. that was consistently delicious. First time I got the fish tacos which were flavorful and had great texture. Not much to elaborate on, as they were textbook good fish tacos.

The second time I split the Molcajeta Nayarita, which was exceptional. It was a seafood bowl filled with prawns, shrimp crab, mussels, clams, a delicious sauce and awesome. You will make a mess, and you will leave satisfied.

Definitely worth coming back again.
