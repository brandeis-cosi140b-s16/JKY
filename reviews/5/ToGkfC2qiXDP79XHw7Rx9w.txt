We ate at Casa Layla today. It was absolutely delicious! The waitress was super nice and cheery. She kept our drinks refilled. The guacamole is super yummy. I ordered the carne asada taco meal (comes with rice and beans). The tacos were amazing. The beans were definitely some of the best Ive had. The rice..usually I do not even eat much of the rice at mexican places I go to but man Im glad I ate this! Best rice Ive ever had. Hands down. The restraunt colors and decor are very welcoming. The owner and family are also super friendly and wonderful. I highly recommend this restraunt to everyone!
