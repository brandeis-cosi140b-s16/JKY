My family frequents Rosita's and I can see why it's been a Tempe staple for so many years.  The chips and salsa are excellent and worth the trip alone.  I always get a black bean burrito enchilada style and it is the best black bean burrito in town.  The servers are really attentive and friendly as well.  I notice that many people seem to think it's overpriced, but I don't agree.  You can get a cheese crisp at happy hour (which is all day Sat/Sun) for $2.50.  My burrito on the lunch menu is around $6, less than most other similar places.  I do agree that the bathrooms are not the best, but I don't pass up good places simply because of the bathroom.  I'd miss many great dives in larger cities if I did that.  Overall, I think you'll be happy with your meal and the service provided at Rosita's.
