We've been extremely fortunate to have been on a great run with restaurants.  It seems that some restaurants understand that summer is the time to impress guests.  I've read the prior reviews but my experience is that Black Chile has really worked hard since opening to address early complaints.  I am thrilled that we went.  

The staff is stellar.  Since they just opened,  our server walked us through the menu and suggested that we start with the black olive and chorizo cheese crisp, and it was delicious.  Please request the avocado-tomatillo salsa and apply liberally to ALL food items - spicy and full of flavor.  

My friend ordered the fish tacos (snapper) and was thrilled with the flavor, also loved the rice and beans.  (Homemade tortillas).  I had the chicken enchiladas and highly recommend the green sauce.  So good.  

Too full for dessert, but definitely next time.  Gotta go again!!
