New Mexican Grill has the best Mexican style food in the East Valley...hands down.  My wife and I have lived in the Gilbert area for so long and have never been to any place that has the flavor, quality and genuine value that New Mexican Grill has.  We hope to make this a regular place for us as Gilbert is starving for great places like this.  The menu is fantastic with great meats from green chile pork to carne asada.  All of them with their own unique flavor.  The owners/management is friendly and truly cares to make their restaurant excellent in every aspect.  From breaklfast burritos, to fry bread, to great homemade salsas, everything about this place keeps me coming back for more.

Stop wasting your time at other places and make this your only stop in the East Valley for great food!
