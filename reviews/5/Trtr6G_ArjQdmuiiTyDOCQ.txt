This place very easily deserves my 5 stars
Their Tacos de Adobada tasted like sex in my mouth. Yup... if you don't believe me try one and try saying it doesn't taste that good. 

OMG if you are on vacation or even live here you have got to come try some of their tacos. I'm honestly not much of a taco guy. I usually stick to my burritos but I ordered 2 Adobada (spicy pork) tacos, 1 Lengua (tongue) , 1 Asada (beef ) and it more than filled me up. 

What makes this place special is their Tacos de Adobada
I know alot of places don't have this and thats why its awesome. 

Here is a tip though. It is confusing if it is your first time to order food here. You go up the counter to order what kind of meat you want with 4 or 5 people working behind the counter based on the meat of choice. Go all the way right say two Adobada tacos. The guy tacos up  right there and hands it to you. I asked for three types of tacos and he pointed down the line after I got the Adobada and so i moved to the next meat lady.
