I've been to this Monterrey location numerous times, and they consistently deliver solid Mexican food with good service. Fajitas are exceptional, and if you're REALLY hungry the "El Combo" meal is a pretty cheap deal for a ton of great food. Have never ordered anything from here that I didn't enjoy in 10-15 visits.
