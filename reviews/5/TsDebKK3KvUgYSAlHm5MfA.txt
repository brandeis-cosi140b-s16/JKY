This place earns it's stripes.

The food is fantastic. The service is wonderful. The staff actually remembers you if you come in a second time.

And if you like cheese, well, this is kind of a cheese nirvana.

The food is not boxed and quartered into the familiar bland Mexi of other Arizona digs and actually offers dishes that are interesting.
