Get a bucket of beer, maybe a few "muppet" shots, and their chicken burrito, and call it...the beginning of a night. Its a great place to listen to a jukebox and get crazy. Make sure you being an empty beer bottle outside with you if you plan to walk anywhere in the surrounding neighborhood. You may need to break it over an attacker's head.
