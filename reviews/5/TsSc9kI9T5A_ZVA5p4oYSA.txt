Immaculate bathrooms. Great GREAT Mexican food. My wife and I came after needing some Mexican food. We came on Sunday. Not very busy. Slow to get the food for a fast food resturant. The food was AMAZING. I had the green chilli burrito combo with rice and beans. My wife had quesadilla chicken. Both amazing. On our second visit I had the fajitas. Also amazing. Their beans are so wonderful. Everything we have had was seriously good. We have been at least 10 tomes since I started this review. Our go to place for Mexican food now.
