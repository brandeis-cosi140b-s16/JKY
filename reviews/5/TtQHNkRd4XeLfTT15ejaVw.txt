EATING BAD!!!  Just like eating at my favorite hang-outs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe or Los Alamos.  The BEST New Mexican place in town.  Wait..The ONLY true New Mexican place in town.  Eat there as often as I can, which is never enough.  If you are true fan of NM cooking, Carlito's is the place.

I love their Breakfast Burritos. I get sausage, fully loaded, smothered in Red sauce.  Muy bueno!  Their tacos al pastor are my favorite for lunches and the carne adovada enchiladas for dinner.  As good as you can find anywhere....all made on the spot.  I also will get their chicken enchiladas with Green, which are also excellent.

They even make their sopapillas the right way.  Not sprinkled with powdered sugar and choc syrup, but just served with honey, fresh, light, sooooo good.

Sign up for their email so you know when they grill ribs and tri-tip in their parking lot.

Staff is always great (keep it up Dave) and much success.

Oh...they are the only Green Chile roaster in town every August.  That little insult Whole Foods does is a joke.  Carlito's roasts by the sack at good prices.  Can't wait.
