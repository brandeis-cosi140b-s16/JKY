Omg. Busy? Fuck yes. Awesome food that's very delicious? Oh fuck yes. People need to shut the fuck up about how busy this place is. Be patient and get some good ass bowl and go home. Extra guacamole? Yes please, and I use their app and it is seriously awesome! Just order ahead and pick up. Can it be more amazing?
