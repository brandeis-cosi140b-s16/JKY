This place has great service! Kai was very helpful and attending the whole time we were here. I ordered the street tacos and they were very filling. The salsa that comes with the chips as an appetizer is very flavorful! There were 3 to choose from ranging from mild to very spicy. Perfect to meet everyone's needs. Chef Paco personally came out to speak to our table and introduced himself. This place has great staff and atmosphere. Highly recommend and I will definitely be coming back!
