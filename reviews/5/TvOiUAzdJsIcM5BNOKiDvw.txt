I lived in Vegas 9 years ago and frequented the Durango Zaba's as I worked in the same plaza. It was always amazing and the service was always wonderful. I also went to the Eastern and W. Flamingo locations on trips to visit. They were just as great. Now that we've moved back, that's all I can think about. People like to compare them to Q'doba and Chipolte... But there's no comparison for me. While in Michigan we frequented Q'doba because Chipolte does nothing for us. But now that we can eat at Zaba's, that will be our only option. Chicken bowl is wonderful and fish tacos amazing.
