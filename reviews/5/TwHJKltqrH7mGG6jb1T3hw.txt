Went for lunch at 12:30 on a Friday and there were quite a few people in front of me.  The staff behind the counter was quick and got us through within 5 minutes.

Food was good - exactly what I expect from Chipotle.  Staff came around and picked up my empty wrapers/trash.  They were very friendly and I enjoyed briefly visiting with them.

Glad I stopped for lunch at this location.
