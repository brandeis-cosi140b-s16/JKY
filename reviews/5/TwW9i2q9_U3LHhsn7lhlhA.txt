Still day dreaming about the pizza I ate here about 3 months ago! It was recently my friend's birthday and I posted a picture from Salvatore's, which is what reminded me to write this review. We ordered the Forza specialty pizza and OMG was it amazing! The ingredients were so fresh: tomatoes, fresh cloves of garlic piled atop smoked Gouda. And ricotta! It added a different texture and creamy flavor which was so refreshing compared to other basic greasy pizzas. This was 3 months ago, you're probably asking how do I remember this particular meal?? Because it was THAT good! Best pizza in Madison, hands down. If this review didn't convince you to go, please look at the pictures. And then go. You will not be disappointed!
