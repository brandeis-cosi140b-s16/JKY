Very good. Didn't know what to except, but it was close to where I was working so I decided to give it a try. I got the chimichanga beer lunch special with cheese, it was about the size of a Chipotle burrito, it was huge! Not only was it big, the shredded beef was moist and well seasoned. Very good meal, very friendly staff, I'll think I'll cone here again when I'm nearby.
