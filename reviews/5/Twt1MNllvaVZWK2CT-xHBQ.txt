I tried to give Taqueria Los Angeles a chance. And I definitely do not regret it at all. Everything there is pure quality and the food is full of flavor. The employees were super nice to me. Especially this 14-year old girl who works there she was the sweetest girl I've ever talked to. The one part I really liked about that restaurant was that when you walk in it smells like Home cooked meals. So if you are ever around Peoria and hungry come give this place a try. I know I will be coming back to Taqueria Los Angeles!
