We were visiting from Los Angeles stopped by to get some drinks at the liquor store but decided to try the food from sr pollo because there was a big line for his food so common sense tells me it has to be good but I didn't know it was out of this world delicious no really the chicken, the chicken wings and the burrito was so big it could not finish it all even thought it was exceptional and cheep to. I don't know if u happen to be in this area give sr pollo a try.
