Found out about The Revival after sifting through 17 pages of the same old Yelp results looking for a place for lunch - I live and work in Tempe and am running out of new places to eat, so I was stoked to find out that this place had opened just a few weeks ago. As soon as I read about the chef's association House of Tricks, I knew I had to go.

We got there around 11:40, which was perfect because it was right before the lunch rush started rolling in. Being a new restaurant, I wasn't sure if it would be busy, but it was once it hit noon. Clearly the word is spreading fast!

Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I decided to start by trying the Charred Korean Pork Belly sandwich, which was great. The flavors actually reminded me more of Banh Mi than Korean food, but being Vietnamese I can't complain. :)

The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. A great place for lunch, but I can also see myself coming here to unwind for dinner and drinks during happy hour.

Basically, I just left and I already can't wait to go back! It's definitely a place I can see myself frequenting in the future.
