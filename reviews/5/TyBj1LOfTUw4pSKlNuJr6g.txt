Its hard to find authentic mexican food in madison when everyone tells you Laredos is the place to go. La Mestiza fills that void. Vibrant flavors and great selection make up a vast array of authentic mexican dishes at La Mestiza. My favorite things on the menu are the Cochinta Pibil and the Chile Rellenos. The Nopales (grilled cactus) are to die for as well as a side. Overall i can't say i've ever had anything bad here but i usually stick to the waiters decision.
