I seriously LOVE this place! I went here for one of my friend's shows and decided to get some food while I was there, and I'm so glad I did! It's kind of a little hole in the wall place, you have to look out for the sign because it's small. The cool thing about Yayo is they let bands play shows, so you have some entertainment while you eat. Granted, the bands are sometimes not so great, but you still have fun watching. 

Now, the food. My favorite tacos are the veggie, pastor, and carne asada. The pastor is different because it's roasted pork with a pineapple-y kinda salsa on top, soo good! They're also not stingy with the meat, which is awesome. And they have deals for UNLV students, but if you're not a student, it's still pretty reasonable pricing. If you're vegan, they have a few vegan tacos and side options as well. I will say that I'm not crazy about the sides, nothing really stands out there for me. 

If you're in the area, definitely check this place out! You won't regret it.
