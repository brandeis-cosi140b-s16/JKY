This place has the best tacos I've had in Vegas so far. Finally a place that has real meat and authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for drinks and a Vegas scene then go to the strip. If you want great food with great service from a nice hole in the wall place then this is it. Everything tasted home made and this will be my Mexican food choice every time in Vegas.
