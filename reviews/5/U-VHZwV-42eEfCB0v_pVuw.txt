Seriously, trust these awesome reviews. There may only be 20 but they deserve to have 1000 more. It was a little hard to find because being brand new and all they still don't have a big lit up sign, but was worth the u-turns. I got the chorizo breakfast burrito and a quesadilla. Both were super delicious and not the slightest bit greasy (which was pleasantly surprising). As for the green mild sauce, I wish I could cover my life in it. The staff was super friendly and I will definitely be back.
