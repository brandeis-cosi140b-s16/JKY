Found this ace by accident and it's our favorite! Simple in appearance the food is Amazing!!! Better than Los Betos, Filibertos, Nicos- you get my drift! Steak burrito- quality meat, not filled with crap meat. Nachos are amazing, meat, real cheese fresh tomatoes. Fresh ingredients. Shrimp al Diablo .... the best. Again I am stressing the quality of the meat, fresh ingredients - surpassed the other places listed. the quality is amazing and the flavor the best.
