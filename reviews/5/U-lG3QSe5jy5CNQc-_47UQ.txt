I was very happy with this restaurant. Mariscos are hard to come by (good ones, that is) and this place almost wholeheartedly delivered. 

Pros:
- Food was great.
- Service was good too.
- Lots of pre-meal extras.
- Big portions!
- Horchata is actually good.

Cons:
- Music was loud and annoying. 
- Parking sucks. 

Weird:
- Some guy off the street was trying to sell us bread. The restaurant staff seemed to not mind, so I guess it was cool.

Great place. I will definitely be making plans to return in the future.
