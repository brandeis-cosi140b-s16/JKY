This was the best Mexican I have had since I have moved to Charlotte. I had the tequila burrito with shrimp while my boyfriend had the California burrito with steak. Both were full of flavor and extremely authentic. Most of the Mexican restaurants I have experienced out here have been very bland, but Salsa's spices and sauces forced me to finish this monster of a meal. 
Their Margs were also very impressive- many flavors to choose from and the frozen were mixed perfectly. 
We will definitely be returning and recommending it to anyone!
