Tamales are my Kryptonite. If I find good tamales, I get weak and can't help myself.  I read the reviews and well, to be honest, IT WAS INCREDIBLE! I highly recommend this place. The owner told me that if Duncan Donuts only sells donuts, they only sell Tamales at Old El Paso and that is why they are so good. The masa is firm and smooth. The fillings are great. Besides beef, chicken, and pork, they also have a sweet corn and cheese and on request jalapeno and cheese and zucchini and cheese vegetarian. I want them all. When I told him that I read about this store on-line, let me try several of the tamales. EAT HERE! If you don't like tamales, eat here and you will!  GREAT! I can't say enough. Yelp should add another star so that I can give them 6!
