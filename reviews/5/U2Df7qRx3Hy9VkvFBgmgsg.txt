Super awesome, will definitely come back. We both agree this is some of the best Mexican food we have ever had. We got the chicken burrito and chicken chalupas, both were so tasty! We raved about the chips the entire time we were there. They are served with a trio of lime wedges and two different salsas. Ingredients are super fresh, and definitely made to order. Looking forward to the new location with a slightly expanded menu.
