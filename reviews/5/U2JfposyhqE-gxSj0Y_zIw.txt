My BF and I saw this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We absolutely loved it! Very refreshing and unique menu. 
Right when you walk in the staff greets you and give you a sample of the meats they offer. I went with the steak and my bf went with the chicken
Loved the food and the service was awesome! Very friendly and upbeat staff! We will be back very soon!
