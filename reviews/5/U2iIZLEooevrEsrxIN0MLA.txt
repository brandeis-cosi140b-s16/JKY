Yipppeeeeeeeeee!!  I found a Chipotle near uptown.. This place is the greatest "fast food" in the world.  The burritos are massive and the quality of food is optimal.  Not to mention, the speed of service is off the charts.  They have found a way to maximize speed without negatively effecting quality.  Take a break and make a stop at this Chipotle.  mmmmm mmmmmm. Enjoy!
