This place is consistently awesome. The service is great, the staff is friendly, the food is to die for and the craft cocktails are something to write home about. I've ordered almost everything from the menu and have yet to be let down. I would highly recommend al pastor anything--bowl, taco, vampiro, you can't go wrong. The suadero is also pretty incredible. And they have a great beer and craft cocktail list. Next on my list to try is the Beach Better Have My Money but today, a Bloody Maria fit the bill. What a work of art and ay carumba this was spicy! Enjoy Taco Y Taco early and often!
