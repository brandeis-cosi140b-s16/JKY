I kept forgetting to write my review but I love this place! I used them for catering for my babyshower back in feb and everyone(40+) loved the tacos and asked where I got them from (I did just tacos carnitas, asada, and pastor). The ladies are all very friendly and helpful. I'm upset I just moved farther away but it will be worth the drive! I've tried different dishes and have not been disappointed yet. The sopes are sssooo good!! They also recently renovated and the place looks great!! DEFINITELY recommend trying them out:)
