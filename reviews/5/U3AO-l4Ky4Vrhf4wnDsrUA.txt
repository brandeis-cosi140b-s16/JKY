I love this place. But, I hate that I keep getting burritos even when I am not hungry. I am addicted. I have seen this AM PM location go thru two other Mexican restaurants. I am so glad that this family finally came around. The shrimp cocktail is AMAZING. I get the chicken breakfast burrito most of the time. I just call and Conception has it ready for me when I show up. Prices are very reasonable.
