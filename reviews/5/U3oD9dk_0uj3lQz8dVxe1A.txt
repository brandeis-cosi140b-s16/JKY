There are two amazing dishes I love to get here: the California burrito and the torta de puerco, which was included in an LVW article listing the top Mexican meals in the city.

The Cali burrito was huge, packed with carne asada, fries, different salsas, cheese, and other yummy things- the flavor profile was complex, spicy, meaty, and amazing. Somehow, despite being an especially americanized burrito, the ingredients gave it a  traditional flavor. I'd eat this any day of the week, and it was spicy enough not to need any of the extra red or green salsa.

The LVW article doesn't play around, describing the sandwich as "loaded with pork belly carnitas, lime-braised pork shoulder,  quesadilla cheese, pickled vegetables and lettuce." Ingredients I never would have expected in a torta, all singing together in perfect, crunchy, harmony: crispy, buttery roll plus crispy, greasy pork, plus bright, acidic pickled veggies balanced by fresh lettuce and a touch of creamy cheese. Pretty sure my  BF would sell me on a streetcorner for a truckload of these. Or maybe even just one.
