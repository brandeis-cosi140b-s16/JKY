My boyfriend and I always enjoy date night here. The wait time to be seated is always a bit of a wait so don't expect to be seated right away. The chips and salsa are delicious and I always get a burrito topped with their green sauce. Delicious! BUT whenever I have ordered an alcoholic drink they are never really all that great :/ just to warn you! But other than that I always go back!
