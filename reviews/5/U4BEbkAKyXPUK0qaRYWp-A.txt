I have passed this Vegas icon by for years.
Fortunately I was stuck in bumper to bumper and directly in front.
Popped in for a dinner
Absolutely fabulous
Authentic Mexican from the decor probably built like years an years
Makes you feel good inside
Tamales with rice and beans
Flan was perfect with a rum after bite
The tamales were filled with chicken and shredded beef
The tastes were just great
Trust me you don't want to miss this experience 
Old school very rare these days
