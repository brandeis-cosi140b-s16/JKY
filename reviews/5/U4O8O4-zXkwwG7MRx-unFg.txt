El pastor Burrito, a cold Tequila Fresca, live music, and top it off with a hot churro! My favorite music venue in AZ by far!

Been here on several occasions and every visit has passed my expectations. The food is delicious and affordable. The specialty drinks are unique and kickass; however slightly more expensive. There is ample seating both in the lounge and music venue area, and there really is no bad seat in the house.

The scene is very diverse but leans more towards the hipster side; however this all depends on who is playing. 

The audio quality is above average in the music venue area, and the small setting makes for a very intimate show.

Highly suggest this place and I hope it is here for as long as I am!
