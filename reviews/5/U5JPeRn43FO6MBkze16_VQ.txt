Let me start off by saying that I LOVE hippies. They make me smile. So I was so excited once I moved to east Phx and now have 2 two hippies close by. I had never eaten at one before and I had high expectations. 

My first experience was nothing less than stellar. I went with a hot dog with jalapenos, onions and cheese. They dog was definitely all beef. They sliced it in half and loaded it up which made it that much better. And the bun was lightly toasted which always adds nice texture. I also got an order of fries. They were my kind of fries for sure! They were the crinkly ones and seasoned. They were not to crispy which is how I like it. The prices were very affordable as well. I can't wait to go back to try some tacos. Fish tacos are next on my list!
