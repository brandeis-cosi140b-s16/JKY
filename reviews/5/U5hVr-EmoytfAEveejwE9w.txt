It upsets me seeing negative reviews about this teeny tiny gem. I went there twice during my most recent business trip to Vegas. Amazing food, fast (and RIDICULOUSLY accommodating) service, and a pleasant atmosphere. What more could you ask for? It just goes to show you can't please all of the people all of the time. I had two of the aforementioned mojitos... they are fine. I also had the aforementioned fajitas... they are also fine. But if you want a REAL treat, Garlic Shrimp all the way.
