The food here is the best Mexican food I have had. When I have out of town guests, I take them to Popo's and they insist it is the best Mexican restaurant they have visited. Their shredded beef is the best. Huge portions. Also, they rotate chefs between the Indian School and the second restaurant on Bell so that they are equal in quality. I always get the shredded beef chimichanga.. but it is so large, I always end up taking half home for another meal.
