By the time I found this place I was so sick of looking for a great authentic mexican food in Nevada. I was so SICK OF IT! But I walked in cause it said TACOS MEXICO so that's a big bold statement. I ate a carne asada, with a burrito and they tasted so good, just like california makes. I was so happy when I left. It's a funky looking places, but the food was goooood. Just wish it wasen't in such a odd location and the place was more cleaner. I will come again! Good for family that do not care, and only care for food flavor.
