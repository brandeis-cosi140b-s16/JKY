Great tortas and burritos.  Tortas served wet with knife and fork.  Tastey meat, good sauce.  Coworker got a chimi, great results.  Aa other got a couple burritos and said best breakfast and bean n cheese burritos ever.

Needless to say will be coming back often.

Watch for the high school lunch hour
