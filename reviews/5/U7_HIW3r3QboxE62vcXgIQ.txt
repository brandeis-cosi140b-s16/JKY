Thought they had closed down. Not so! Just a new sign. Also, closed on tuesdays.

Excellent Sonoran-style hot dog: bacon wrapped with beans, tomato, mayo, mustard, etc. As good as the best I've had in Tucson (el Nene, Ruiz), and better than Moreno's down the street (they are not bacon wrapped as a Sonoran dog should be; Mickey's are).
