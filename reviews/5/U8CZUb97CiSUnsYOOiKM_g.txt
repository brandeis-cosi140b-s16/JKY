This is a great bar.  It has a 2 levels and the staff there is great.  $3 Coronas are a pretty good deal.  Good mix of people.  There food is good, but nothing to write home about.  There are two pool tables (which are normally open) and a air hockey table if you want to drink and play games at the same time!  Great atmosphere and it's outside so it's a different feel than most other bars.  Dos has a great mix of music and doesn't just place the dance club hits.  Great bar.
