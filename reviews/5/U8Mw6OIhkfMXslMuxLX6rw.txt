Roberto's... 

Had a few beers? 

Want something to fill that belly at 3 am?

It's delicious, it staves off hangovers, it fills you up, it's cheap. It does it all... 

Roberto's steak quesadilla... order it with pico de gallo (tomatoes, onions, cilantro, etc) and get some of those jalapenos they have at the mini bar. Don't worry that it looks like a sad salad bar... who cares!?!?!

This is budget Mexican at it's best. Get the peppers, get the sour cream, get the steak quesadilla (extra steak)... Put it all together and YUM!

No hangover, guaranteed!
