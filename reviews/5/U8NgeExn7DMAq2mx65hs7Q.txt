This is one of my favorite places for lunch or dinner.  Every time I visit Las Vegas I make a stop here for the burrito.  I usually order the steak burrito with brown rice, veggies, black beans, cheese, lettuce, and salsa.  Service is fast as they make your order like a cafeteria style.  This location is not that busy so there usually isn't a line and there is a lot of free parking.  Come hungry because the burritos are huge.
