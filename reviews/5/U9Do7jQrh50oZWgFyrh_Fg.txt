Love the atmosphere.  All staff  is Super friendly. The Mole sampler is the best I've ever had. Close to the strip and vegan friendly. Also organic and NO GMO which is awesome. The manager Sean came to our table a few times to chat and make sure we were loving the food ,he was so nice and friendly. Chef Paco came to check on us too, he was so nice and friendly ....I lOVe this place !!!!!.Definately will be back, I highly recommend this place, ask for Sean if you go he will take great care of you.
