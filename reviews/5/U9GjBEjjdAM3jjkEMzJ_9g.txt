I come to this location all the time. There's a ton of them in the area but this one is my favorite! Almost all Chipotle's I've been to are good but at this one the food is hot, fresh, and delicious every single time. The service is always prompt and the employees are super friendly and welcoming. I tend to make jokes when I interact with people at stores and the employees at this location are always receptive to my sense of humor :) Love it, I'm sure we'll be coming here for years to come.
