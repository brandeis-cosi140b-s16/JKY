Green Dacha is the best Russian restaurant in Las Vegas area. Great atmosphere, very friendly ppl working front and back of the house, and the food is awesome!! grilled chicken, schnizel, the beef stroganoff and the lamb chops are top items in the menu and in my list :) Great hospitality!!! Thx Alex, you make it feel like home!
