This was my second time visiting for breakfast and I couldn't have been more pleased.  I had the adovada benedict with jalapeno hollandaise.  It was tremendous!  A touch of spice but not overpowering at all.  And the adovada; EXCEPTIONAL.  Served with perfectly done hash browns and pinto beans, I had to take half of it home with me for a second round.                                                  

My girlfriend came for the French toast.  It's all she ever wants here and is worth the drive from Surprise.  Add some awesome local sausage to the plate and it's near nirvana!                                                       

Seating is super limited so get there early and be thankful there are no signs or you'd never get in.
