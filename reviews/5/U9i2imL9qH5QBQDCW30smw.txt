Food is good, ribs were fall off the bone tender. Brandon was a huge fan of the Mac and Cheese which certainly has a kick!

What I really appreciate is the manager's attitude. John's great! He really cares about the customer and making things right. I used to review restaurants professionally, and he really gets it. Go here if you want great service, and chug some half priced beer!
