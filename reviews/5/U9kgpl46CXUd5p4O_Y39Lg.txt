Found myself in Henderson one Saturday afternoon before a flight home. Consulted my mobile Yelp! for suggestions on where to eat and Andale appeared with great reviews. This place is classic whole in the wall strip mall, which is a good sign if you like authentic food. Andale has both Mexican and Salvadoran sections on the menu. 

I arrived about 4:15 and was the only one in the joint the entire time. Service was fast and friendly, of course. I ordered the enchilada plate and a side order of cheese and bean pupusa. The pupusa was delicious. Enchiladas were also very good, but the chicken was just a bit dry. Very authentic meal. Once again Yelp! delivers with a great recommendation!
