Love this place been her twice now from San Diego can bring my dog during the day. Food is great even though I am from the home of Carne Asada!! It is miserable during the summer but that is just cuase I am not used to the heat.  Service has always been wonderful. Loved the fried chimichanga.  Will be going here when I visit my brother again!!! Loved the Gringos!
