The inside of the restaurant is decorated so uniquely, we really enjoyed it's ambiance. We walked past a salsa bar when we were seated. The waitstaff asked if we wanted to start with any chips and salsa which we said yes (they charge ~$3 but seemed unlimited). I had a frozen peach margarita which was very tasty. For dinner I had the Frito Burrito which was a giant burrito stuffed with your choice of fried chicken or fried avocado. served with rice, corn salsa, chili meat sauce, and frito's. doused with chili meat sauce and queso. served with a side of slaw, pico, and sour cream all for $8.95. I thought this burrito was absolutely delicious. It was also so big that I took half of it home and ate it the next day. My husband has the Chorizo And Egg Torta which consisted of chorizo, egg, tomato salsa, crema, lettuce, onions, and jack cheese for $9.99 and is served with a side (he chose sweet potato fries). He said his Torta was good but then it got pretty hot. Which he normal likes spicy and hot so I thought his comment wasn't like him, must have been pretty hot! 
We loved the food here and we would definitely come back!
