Service is incredible, everyone is always so nice. The food is quite tasty and the prices are such a value. I'd recommend their chencho fries and the monster "boyger". Tip: they sell authentic Mexican cokes in tall glass bottles that taste completely different than the American version. Real sugar and not high fructose corn syrup being the culprit, I believe.
