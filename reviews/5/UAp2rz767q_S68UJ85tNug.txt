This is one of my absolute favorite go-to places for tacos or just a quick snack in general. I seem to find myself there most Saturdays (it helps that there is a bakery right next door and a pita, etc. store two doors up!).  

At $2 a taco you really can't go wrong!  And the do-it-yourself salsa topping bar is just really great.  You're always sure to get your taco topped just the way you want it.  It allows you to experiment with the different salsas as well.  The tacos are filled quite generously with your choice of meats or potato, etc.  I find that one taco is not quite enough but that two really fill me up.  

I've never ventured inside the store but am always tempted.  Now that I actually feed the meter (one too many parking tickets!), I will definitely make it a point to go inside the store on my next trip.  The Jarritos drinks are sold outside during the summer and are the perfect beverage to wash down your tacos.

This taco stand is really a must for everyone!  It's authentic Mexican food, not that crappy Taco Bell stuff.  Yummy!
