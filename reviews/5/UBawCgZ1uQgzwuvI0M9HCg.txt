The local spot! CLEAN, friendly and quick food. My  favorite is the #4 on the menu, they also have very good carne asada nachos, not so good chicken nachos. The chicken is shredded (boiled) and flavorless, maybe if they dice and grill it. The food is fresh and affordable! Now if they could serve margaritas, it would be my weekly stop.
