Simply put Chipotle is the best quick burrito around. I have to write an update to my shrine to Chipotle because of the experience we had at this store. It was AMAZING! I have to say that I have eaten hundreds of these burritos, and this one was the best since leaving Colorado (the home of Chipotle). Same burrito, but for somereason today's was much better. I also want to thank the staff for thier ability to make me laugh and give me my favorite burrito. LUV YA!
