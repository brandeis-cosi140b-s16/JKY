There are two Mexican Restaurants in town and this one is by far the better of the two.  The portions are large and the produce that is served with them is always extra fresh and crisp.  Many of the locals know about the El Ranchero, but most of the people out of town get suckered into going to Anita's which is in the heart of ole' Wickenburg.  I live here and I will always recommend El Ranchero to out-of-towners, because the locals know where to eat.

Cheers El Ranchero!  Best Mexican Food Ever!
