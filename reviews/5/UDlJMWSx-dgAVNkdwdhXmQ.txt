I stop by here alot and this time l tried the Caldo De Res- Beef Stew. It was delicious, fresh vegetables..alot of beef. 
Very tender and it was not overly salty...
As a side note, they are getting hurt real bad by the construction at the corner of Higley and Baseline...business is way down.....
People, if you want to keep a great family restaurant alive, come down and tell your friends....
