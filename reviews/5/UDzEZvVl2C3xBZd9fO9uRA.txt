It's a nice hidden gem in Laveen! We were trying to look for a delicious Mexican joint for lunch and saw this place had one of the best reviews. Glad we found it! I had the chicken naked burrito and it was so delicious! Fantastic flavor in the chicken and you could tell that all the vegetables were fresh. My boyfriend got the carne asada fries and wowsa! So much flavor and so much food! Great portions on both entrees and amazing flavor. I also liked the salsa bar they had out for customers. Also, great customer service and kept everything clean. They even checked up on us to see how the food was. They also greeted people coming in and out of the restaurant. Definitely 5 stars all around! Great food and great service.
