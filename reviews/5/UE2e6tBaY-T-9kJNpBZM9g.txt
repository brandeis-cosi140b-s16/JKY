Happened upon this establishment while out and about in Scottsdale. The food and drinks were excellent.  Try the chicken taquitos...you won't be dissappointed.  Sat at the bar, our bartender Izzy was attentive and personable without being overbearing. If you are in the area stop on in, you will be glad you did.
