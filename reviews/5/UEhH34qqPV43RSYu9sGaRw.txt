Good Mexican food in Tempe is very hard (impossible?) to find. Generally it requires a trek to Phoenix or Mesa to find the good stuff. When someone told me the old Devil's House had turned into a new mexican place, I was there that very night to try it for dinner.

I brought along my friend who grew up in Yuma just like I did. We may be white boys, but we consider ourselves Mexican food experts. The one thing we have been looking for is good street tacos. In Yuma, there is at least 50 taco stands around the small city all serving up amazing tacos for around $1 each. The closest we've found around here is Mickey's in Mesa (a small hot dog place with great street tacos). 

Upon entering, the layout is a little weird. It looks nice like a sit-down place, but there is a big counter to go up and order. There is a salsa bar that my friend quickly examined. He said it was a good sign. Two kinds of salsa, creamy guac (the real mexican kind, not the chunky american kind) and an assortment of your standard taco toppings. 

We both got the carne (I got three tacos, my friend got the burrito). From the first bite, we could tell this place was a keeper. Big portions, juicy and very tasty meat. The salsa was perfect. I got the plate, so I got beans and rice as well. The beans were good but nothing special... The rice though, was amazing. I could eat a pound of it I think. 

The prices are average (I think I paid about $7, and my friend about the same). My friend also got a horchata, which he said was amazing. 

All in all, I'm just happy to have an actual good mexican food place to go to in Tempe now. It was pretty dead inside at dinner time, so I hope it can make it. Lets support this place and keep it around folks!
