I first came to this restaurant over 10years ago and they still are delivering the same quality, if not better. The pastries are okay, but the burritos and most other items are made with love. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Oh and the best item (to Me)is the horchata! You'll be sure not to leave disappointed after your visit!! What you waiting for??
