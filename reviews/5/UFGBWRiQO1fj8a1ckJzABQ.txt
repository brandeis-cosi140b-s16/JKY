When I read that these owners also own El Zocalo in Chandler, I was super excited to try what they had to offer.   I love that they serve breakfast burritos all day.  We are always looking for a good breakfast burrito, and we found it here.  It has huge chunks of potato, egg, and either bacon, sausage or chorizo.  The salsa they serve here is absolutely transcendent.  I could eat that stuff like soup!  It's spiciness hits you after a few bites and slaps you in the face!  My hubby and I were both sniffing through the whole meal due to the salsa clearing out or sinuses, but neither of us could stop eating it.  The tortillas are just as good as Carolina's, but a little bit thicker, which seems to keep the burritos from tearing as easily.  Next time, I'm ordering the shrimp burrito because it looks like a winner as well!
