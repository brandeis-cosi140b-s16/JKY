This was one of my favorite meals...ever. Since I was only in-town for 10 days, I was determined to find authentic Mexican tacos in Phoenix. This place delivered!

When we arrived they asked if we had ever been there before. When we told them no, they allowed us to try EVERY type of meat.  I was in love with all of them, but I ended up getting the 3 LARGE tacos with two types of pork, and one type of chicken. Sorry that I can't remember the exact names.  I got them with all the toppings- fresh cilantro, corn, salsa, cabbage, cheese, pickled onions, and sour cream.  5 STARS! They were so fresh and flavorful; my mouth and belly were so happy! 

My boyfriend got the 1 lb burrito with all the fixins as well. It was Chipotle-sized, but with even fresher ingredients and better flavor! 

We were feeling rather gluttonous this evening, so we ordered the nachos as well. We got those with cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, cabbage, and corn.  

They have a salsa bar that has so many options. There are also some pickled peppers that you MUST try.  

You have to come here. It's got such a fun wrestling theme too!  I am already dreaming of my next trip here in July. :)
