I'm one of the pickiest eaters around and before Chipotle, I've yet to experience a restaurant that I can feel confident, knowing my order will never be wrong. Granted, they make your food right in front of your eyes, but I've been to other restaurants that have the same visible line and have still managed to somehow mess up my food. Yes, the lines are extremely long, but once I get my burrito, it's all worth it. Besides, long lines speak "great food" to me!
