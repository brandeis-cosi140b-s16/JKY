Hands down the best chipotle I have had. I eat chipotle when I travel, when I'm at home, on my break, chipotle is my life. So you can see I want my chipotle made right! These people here are amazing. They get my order right every time. Their lines are long sometimes but it's worth it. They are always fast and give good portions. They have messed up twice on my order but the people where new so I let it slide. Haha but my favorites are the tall girl at the register, the short African American lady with the nose piercing, the lady with pink hair and the shorter girl with tattoos on her arms and red hair. You can see I come her often just for their food and have my favorite staff picked out. If you haven't gotten the point, THIS CHIPTOLE IS LIT! hahaha I even tried the one on 99th and theirs doesn't taste the same and the portions suck.
