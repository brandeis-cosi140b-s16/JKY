Was here on Friday afternoon massive crowd about 25 minutes waiting time. Food was great. Much better than expected.  Servers were running their tails off but very friendly and considering the amount of people that were there The time between ordering our food and receiving it was not that bad.  Had a live band and just a great place to people watch
