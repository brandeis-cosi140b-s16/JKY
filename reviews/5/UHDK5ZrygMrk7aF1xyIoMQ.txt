I love this market. it's my go-to spot for all things authentcaily hispanic. My wife's family is from Puerto Rico and I can find what I need to cook her home food here and hardly anywhere else in the city. They have everything you need for a hispanic feast or good ole barbecue! 

I like to rummage through the meat department, try one of the probably 20 different types of crema, pick up some fresh tortillas and get vegetables I can't normally get elsewhere. All in all, this is one of my favorite shopping places in Phoenix.
