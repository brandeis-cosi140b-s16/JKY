So.... a third time must be the charm. As they say.  I have tried to eat at this place so many times.  alittle coocky to enter of the side of the building, like in an alley, weird right?  But inside so intersesting to look at. I would put the neon sign out front so as to draw people in, but hey I'm just a patron. Staff  - eclectic,  but kinda more interested in chatting with the bar tender. Food - Queso Fundido, love the hint of honey and pepitas and the baby that the Mojito and the Margarita produced is great... Jalisco something, liked it. The design of the decor is so fun.
