I love tacos and fries, and this place knows how to do tacos and fries. My favorite meat is the marinated pork adobada (which I still can't pronounce), and I get that with everything. Their portions are ginormous, esp with their fries; guacamole, cheese, sour cream, pork adobada, mhmmm. It's all there. Their tacos are crafted to perfection and omg, I crave the tacos from this place 24/7. T_T

This place is also extremely busy at night, and I'm not fond of their ordering system at all. There are lines for different types of meats, and that prevents me from trying other meats. Regardless, I'm still satisfied coming here just for the pork adobada fries and tacos!
