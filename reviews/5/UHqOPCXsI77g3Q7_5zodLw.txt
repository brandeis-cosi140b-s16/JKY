Good Place to enjoy some Latin dancing! We arrived around 11-pm and left at 3:30am, The DJ was good he played Merengue, Salsa, Cumbia, Regueton, Ranchera, Rock en Espa√±ol but No Bachata, that was not an issue though. We had $8 Long island ice tea, I was content paying that price, other places charge $10-12 for the same drink and are not as "strong" as the ones we had at this joint. FOLKS Always give a good tip to the bartender,  if there's more than one bartender try to order your drinks from just one, the bartender will take care of you if you tip him/her well, give a tip on every drink you buy. if you tip well and are a "return customer" you may even get a free drink here and there. Overall this is a good spot to dance the night away. BTW I've never tried the food!
