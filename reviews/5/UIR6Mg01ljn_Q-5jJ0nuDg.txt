This place is AWESOME. We went not knowing what to expect. I got the flautas. When I got them I was thinking it wouldn't fill me up but it actually did. Their queso isn't the "normal" but it is still tasty. My hubby got the bangin chicken burrito and said it was great! We tried the cookie dough flautas and they are so awesome! There is a girl named Chandler that works here and she's fabulous! Her outstanding customer service is the reason we've come multiple times.
