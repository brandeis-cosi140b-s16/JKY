Some of the best Mexican food in AZ, hands down.  This place is right at the top of the list of best Mexican I have ever had.  Unfortunately, I do not live very close to this location.  I came here once while in the area for work.  I was super impressed.  If you have a chance to try The Original Garcia's you won't be disappointed.  I can't believe this place doesn't have 100's of reviews on Yelp!  Help spread the word.
