Food is great. Clean place, and friendly help. Speaking of help, there is a woman who works at this place who is DEVASTATINGLY cute. I haven't caught her name, and if you are reading this, you really should be doing modeling work. She has a pierced nose on the right, and lip piercing on the left. Today she dyed her hair half red.  She also has a bunch of tattoos. Wow is she hot.
