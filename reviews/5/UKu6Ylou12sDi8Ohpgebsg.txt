I am a native Phoenician and Mexican American. I was shocked to find this restaurant serving such authentic Mexican dishes. It was similar to my Mother's cooking. Try the seafood with Mojo de Ajo (Garlic sauce). They added peanut butter to the Mojo de Ajo and this was truly a delicacy know  to very few locals.
Try the Dos Amigos (Prawns and Scallops) - $13.25. The cooks are the 2 owners  Man and Wife. Beautiful decor and very pleasant young waiters/waitresses
