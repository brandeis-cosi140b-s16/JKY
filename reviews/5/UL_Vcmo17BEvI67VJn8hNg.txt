Warning!  This is not a place you go for the atmosphere.  You go there to eat the freshest and most authentic Mexican in town.  Takeout is great, but make sure you have all your items before you leave.  The food is absolutely fantastic and almost all the menu items are very appealing. If you do decide to eat in try to sit at the counter for the best service.
