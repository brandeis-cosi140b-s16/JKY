The bottom line is this: if it's not on the menu here, then it's not really Mexican food.  I eaten in Guadalajara.  The food at Taco Bell tastes exactly the same.  Nachos, tacos, burritos... The flavors here are a culinary journey south of the border.  And the little se√±oritas who take your order are not bad either.
