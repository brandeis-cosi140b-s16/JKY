Best Mid-Wexican food out there. Okay, they're probably the only Mid-wex restaurant out there, but they're still outright stellar.

Just to give you an idea of what you can create there, my burrito is a create your own: tator tots, cranberry salsa, sweet potato puree, pickled onions, rice, black beans, asadero cheese. With options like the "Hungry Hippy" and "White Trash" (complete with Velveeta and Spam), you do not have to have a boring burrito. (But you can if you'd like!)

The staff at the counter are friendly and will even bring your food out to you if you're nice.
