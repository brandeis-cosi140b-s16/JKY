You can get tacos and enchiladas customized how you like it - sort of similar to Chipotle in that you're ordering at a cafeteria-type line.  I ordered two tacos and selected short ribs for one and mushroom/spinach for the other.  I also saw they have a mashed potatoes filling that looked pretty yummy, I might have to get that next time!

You can also pick from a variety of salsas, and something different from Chipotle is that they also offer a cabbage slaw and picked onions on top.  I tried the slaw, just bc I like eating as many veggies as possible, and it was a nice addition!

I would love to come here again, although come at around 11:30 for lunch bc after that the parking lot and the line become a big pain!
