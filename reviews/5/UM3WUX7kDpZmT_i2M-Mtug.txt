When our family first moved to Charlotte 6 years ago, the house we rented was within 2 minutes walking distance from Fiesta Maya.  Ever since, we've been returning to this little gem, even after moving a few miles away.  The food is really good and very suitable for the range of tastes that are in my family.  I especially like their dishes such as Pollo Nortena and Arroz con Pollo, and this enjoyment has spread to my kids.  The staff are always friendly and attentive and we love them.
