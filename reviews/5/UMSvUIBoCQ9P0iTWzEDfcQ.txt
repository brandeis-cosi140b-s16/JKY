I've been here a couple of times mainly getting breakfast burritos or a carne asana burrito but I must say that their food is excellent! It takes a bit for the food to come out but that is because it is all made to order. They provide a chips and salsa bar while you wait which is convenient. Their prices are very cheap and you get some quality food! 
Don't be overwhelmed by the location though. It's technically located in Tempe, but just blocks away from the town of Guadalupe. 
I definitely see myself coming here a lot more often!
