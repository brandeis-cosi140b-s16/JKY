Everything was amazing! ... Maybe with the exception of how sweet my margarita was..  But everything was delicious! Javier, our server/bartender was great. We had magaritas and tequila sips. We enjoyed our meal. My boyfriend had the enchiladas and I had a taco and flauta. I can tell you that I enjoyed my meal as much as I did, if not more, in Mexico.  Cooked to perfection and our complimentary dessert was what was needed.   I read the yelp reviews that helped me pick this place and it definitely didn't disappoint. We did however end up spending close to $100 for 2 people  but that was after two meals, 2 magaritas, 2 Mexican coffees with alcohol, 2 shots of premium tequila and soup. That was the beat part of all!!!! We enjoyed it and can't wait to come back with friends.
