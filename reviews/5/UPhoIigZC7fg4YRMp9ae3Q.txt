In Vegas for the weekend, we were starving, saw Los Tacos we had to hit it!!! Off the bat food looked amazing. The owner took our order and took the time to tell us how the food was prepared. He let us try carnitas samples which were amazing. Everything was great!!! Food and customer service. If I was a local this would be my spot!!! Thanks from the Suavecito Guys.
