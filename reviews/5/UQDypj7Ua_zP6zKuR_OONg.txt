Typical "hole in the wall" mexican restaurant. Usually packed during lunch/dinner hours. The food is delicious! If you love seafood and mexican food, this is a great place. Their ceviche is fantastic and entrees Are great too. Large selection of drinks including margaritas. If you don't mind waiting, this is a great find.
