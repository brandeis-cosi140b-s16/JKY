Really great place for some awesome margaritas and some of the best Mexican/Southwestern that I've had. The place was shiny and new enough to appear like a high end chain but I'm told this is the only location and the food certainly had great taste and attention to detail. Try the guacamole!! Just a warning to get there during happy hour if you like to pound back a few as the bill can get steep in a hurry!
