I was drawn to this place while walking around the 5th Avenue shops and loved their set up and service! I enjoyed the warm greetings and customer service Barrio Queen provided. My server (forgot his name-sorry) was an excellent provider for recommending me a few great treats from their menu. If you visit this place make sure to take advantage of their 3 for $10 gourmet tacos! I of course had 4 tacos, the dip and their top shelf Margarita!
