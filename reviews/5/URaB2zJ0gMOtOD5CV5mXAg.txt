The place in the Valley for upscale Mexican food! 

The carnitas are exceptional and my wife regularly demands the chilaquiles.

Save room for dessert, as the flan and chocolate cream pie (made with Mexican drinking chocolate and cinnamon) are fantastic, both served with homemade whipped cream.

If your looking for upscale French-inspired Mexican, this place can't be beat!
