This is our favorite Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix! On the main menu, everything is great and consistently great.. My favorite, are the Pork Chops, that have an amazing rub, and can't be beat!! Also, love the happy hour menu.. Price and portions and quality are incredible!! Love their Happy Hour Nachos and Mexican Pizza. $2.00 domestic beers!!! 
Try Nando's. You won't be disappointed!!
