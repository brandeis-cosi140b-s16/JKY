This restaurant is everything that Carefree is about.  Great food, goregous roof-top seating, laid back atmospehere -- I love it.  The duck and the prime rib were generous in their portions, and their midnight rice with coconut infused was something completely out of ths word.  The duck fat french fries were also a nice acoutrement if you've never had them before, but not unlike those available at other establishments.  Grilled wedge salad = perfect dish to cool you off after an appetizer  (flaming saganaki was great for being outside of a greek restaurant)

One warning, they have lots of versions of margaritas, any of which I would recommend above the apple pie margarita -- it was fall-like, but just didn't work with the tequila (perhaps rum would have been the better addition!).

Our server was excellent -- it was the most "European" meal we've had in a while.  Meal was not rushed, server encouraged us to take our time, and was more than willing to provide numerous recommendations when asked.

We love this place and will be taking guests here if they want the authentic Carefree experience -- fancy food, yet laid back.
