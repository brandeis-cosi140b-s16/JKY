I went here with a friend during the lunch hours and was blown away by how delicious the food was and how friendly the service was. I had read a few yelp reviews before hand and was braced for an inattentive server, but our server was fantastic and friendly. More than that, I was so impressed by the shrimp enchiladas, which were so amazing. The fish tacos were good but not as noteworthy. The prickly pear margarita was in a smallish glass that had a lot of ice, so I finished it quickly and was initially disappointed by the size. A few minutes later I realized it was actually quite strong and a little went a long way. I was glad it wasn't larger. The decor is Mexico-chic, with lots of unfinished wood, stained glass, and other
