Disclaimer: The 5 star review is based on a baseline for the average Taco Bell which frankly isn't the most highly prized food establishment.  I would say only 50% of the time they get my order right and I don't make a habit of eating there but sometimes it's cheap and easy for this vegan.

After getting dragged into work for a 14 hour emergency day on a Saturday I was seriously hungry when I finally left the office shortly after midnight. I have had this experience at this particular Taco Bell once before but had long forgotten about it. A few cars were in the drive-thru for some late night nosh, when I pulled up the speaker boomed:

 " AND HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT? " " THAT"S FANNNNNTASTIC!! " " WHAT WILL YOU BE DINING ON THIS EVENING?"(I am paraphrasing). 

The window/order taker was a riot. I entertained him back an forth, when I ordered a Tostada(no cheese) and a Bean and Rice burrito with no cheese his reaction was " MMM, That sounds delicious! " After 14 hours staring at a computer this put a smile on my face. When I got to the window part of the act was over but they guy was super friendly and honestly looked like he was having a good time.

Lot's of people treat fast food workers like they are second class citizens and I haven't figured that one out yet.  If someone can work a late Saturday night fast food job and to put a smile on a customers face while keeping sane then he is a better man then I. 

To top it off, he had my drink, bag of food,and fire sauce ready and waiting. Uber fast and friendly service. This guy(and late night crew) should make the rounds to other establishments. They could teach the places that charge $9.99(rather then .99) for a taco a think or two.

Hit this late night drive-thru for great service and some comic relief.
