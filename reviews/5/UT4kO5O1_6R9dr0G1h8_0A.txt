Came here with a gift certificate and got A LOT of food!  We knew we must be in for something good because there was a decent crowd waiting and by the time we left there was a large crowd.  

We ordered the mini taco basket.... my husband and I split it.  The taco basket alone could have filled us up, yummy fried goodness.  I ordered the enchilada and taco combo and my hubby got an asada burrito.  We are so full of awesome authentic Mexican food I don't think we'll need to eat tomorrow.  

Service was good, we got refills on our drinks before they were half empty and the food was GOOD!  This is the first actually totally authentic Mexican restaurant that I have found in Phoenix.  Yay :)
