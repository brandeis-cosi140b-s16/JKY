Can't say enough good about this restaurant. There was a line at the door before they opened &  they had room for reservations only. 
My wife and I ordered custom guacamole & chips-excellent. We then ordered the carnitas & bistec tacos-amazing. Great flavors & the most tender & moist meats. 
On top of that, the service was top notch & the decor is interesting, "trendy", and comfortable.
