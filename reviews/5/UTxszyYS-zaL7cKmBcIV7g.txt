One word best describes this place.  DELICIOUS!!!  My husband recently picked up some food to go from this place and I absolutely loved it.  Authentic Mexican food at its best!!!  Been back a couple of times since and everything has been excellent!!!  Will definitely be frequenting this place whenever I'm craving Mexican food.
