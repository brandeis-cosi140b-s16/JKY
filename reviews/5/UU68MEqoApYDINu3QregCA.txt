I fuckin love these tacos. In my opinion the asada & barbacoa are the best. The salsa actually has flavor...good plain avocado sauce. 

Very cheap & fast yet food is hot! 

I am literally willing to drive 45min from the east valley for them..while flipping off all the gross filibertos on the way here..
