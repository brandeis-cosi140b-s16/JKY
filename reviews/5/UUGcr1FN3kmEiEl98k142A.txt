Ok I believe Rita's just opened and on a recommendation we went. It was late afternoon and I had already eaten my late lunch. But my wife was very hungry just getting off of work. We got there in the store said sold out. Not something you see very often but can happen for a new business. Well I'm happy to say that the people there were extremely friendly they opened the door for my wife! They kindly explained that they had such a large volume of business that they ran out of most everything but my wife was so hungry and asked if they could make anything...and they did! Very happy to write this as being the first review because these people are very nice and the food is very very good! It's great having a place like this and people like this in our neighborhood and we will be sure to come back many times! Thank you Rita's!
