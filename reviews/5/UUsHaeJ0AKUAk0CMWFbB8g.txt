I loved the unique concept! This isn't your typical Mexican restaurant, its more of a fusion with modern American cuisine.

Everyone loves nachos but a change in the traditional flavors was so refreshing and exciting to me. Thai chicken nachos are amazing! Buffalo chicken nachos? YES! 

For my healthier non-chip-eating friends, they loved the fajita salad and mexi-cob. 

You can tell everything they made was fresh and unique. 

The food and atmosphere was exactly what I was hoping for when my co-workers and I were searching for a place to meet up for Happy Hour. 

I was shocked to see an entire Vegan section on the menu, I'll be coming back to with my Vegan friends soon!
