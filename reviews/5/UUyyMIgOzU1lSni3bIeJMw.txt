I'm honestly shocked at how poor the reviews are and how few stars this place is getting. I've NEVER had an issue here, but to be fair I've only ever dined in the restaurant for lunch and dinner.

Pros:
-I've never had to wait for seating
-Within 2mins of sitting down I have chips, salsa, and a drink order placed if not filled
-I never feel rushed by the servers who are always very helpful
-The drinks are good, STRONG (you probably don't need that double you thought about) and don't take long to get to you
-The food is all authentic Mexican cuisine and is probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh to date. Always served hot and quickly
-Prices aren't the lowest, but they're far from unfair

Cons:
-The TVs can be hard to see from some seats
-Chips can be a bit greasy
-Tables have designs on them that can make setting a glass down seem a little more treacherous than it should be

I go here all the time and I'd suggest it to anyone looking for Mexican food beyond Taco Bell and whatever Chili's decides to throw on a quesadilla.
