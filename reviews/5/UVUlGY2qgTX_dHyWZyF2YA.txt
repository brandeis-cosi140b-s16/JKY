This place is always busy but I enjoy their quick and nice service. I wish they were open even later because I seem to crave their food 10-12 at night lol. I love their horchata and they have vitamin water blueberry pomegranate flavor in their fountains now! Drive thru experiences are always fast and friendly, they haven't messed up on my order yet so that's definitely good that they're consistent!
