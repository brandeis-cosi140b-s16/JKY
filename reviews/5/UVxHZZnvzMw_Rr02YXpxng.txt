Okay we ALWAYS go to Carolinas across the street from here. Ummmm yeah that won't happen anymore! I had a ceviche tostada and camaron al mojo de ajo (garlic butter shrimp) my husband and Daughter had menudo and goditas de pollo...... I must say that was THEE best ceviche I have had in a while. Everything was good and I am very picky with spanish rice (cuz I make the best hehehe) but their rice passed the test! The beans were HOMEMADE not canned rosaritos lol.......since carolinas is closed on sundays guess where we'll be going for sunday hangover menudo??!...... P.S. while we were there an employ from carolinas came in for food hahahaha need I say more?!
