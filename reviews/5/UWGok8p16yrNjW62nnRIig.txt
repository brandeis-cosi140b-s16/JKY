One of our newest restaurants in Casa Grande owned by the family that owns the Big House restaurant in the historic district. Had an early dinner there today; they're having a soft opening an I had the Mornay enchilada. You get three of them and they're full of chicken, spinach and mushrooms with a delicious white wine sauce. It's also served with your choice of rice or beans plus chips and salsa. I was very please with the food and the service we had Austin, he is an amazing young man! Looking  forward to the grand opening where they're going to add steak, seafood and have their full bar available. 
I felt the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food that they serve.
