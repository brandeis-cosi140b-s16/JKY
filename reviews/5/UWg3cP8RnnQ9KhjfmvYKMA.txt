Thank you Tacos el Gordo for bringing good TJ tacos to Vegas! I was so sad that I moved from San Diego to here. I miss the authentic Mexican food that can be enjoyed so conveniently near home. However, this is exactly what real TJ style tacos are about. The meat cut right in front of you, fresh ingredients, and homemade tortillas. The flavors are amazing, and that's something that can't be beaten. I wish the tortillas were a little bigger, but they pack them so well, it's almost unnoticeable. Great service too. SO AMAZING!!!
