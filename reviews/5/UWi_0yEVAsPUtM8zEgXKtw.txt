It's hard to find. We were parked right in front of the place and didn't see it. But once we realized we were there, we walked in and found Dick's Hideaway was literally a hole in the wall. It was small and dark, but we could tell immediately that what they lacked in size, they made up for in large, delicious plates! In fact, their dishes are so large they can be easily shared for up to two people. They had whole chickens roasting over an open fire pit. That was pretty cool. Don't expect to go dancing after, as your clothes and your hair will smell deliciously of food. 

One thing we've found helpful was to ask the server what the restaurant is best known for. The server said the Carne Avodava. This dish was in a class of its own, and I highly recommend it. We also ordered the New Mexican Platter, which gave us a generous sampling of their chile relleno, tamale, and chicken burrito. The spices they used for all three dishes were incredible! 

They serve breakfast too, but we didn't get a chance to return. When in Phoenix, Dick's Hideaway is a MUST!
