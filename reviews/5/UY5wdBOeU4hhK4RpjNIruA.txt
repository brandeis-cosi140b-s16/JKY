1st time at this gem, but certainly not the last....had dinner and drinks and the food was very tasty, lots of it and most reasonably priced. Server Ally was exceptional and when she found out it was our first time, brought us a tamale dish to sample. Very nice touch. She also told one of the owners Laura that it was our first time and she stopped by our table and introduced herself. We will return!
