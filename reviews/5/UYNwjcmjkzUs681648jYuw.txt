This place is a hidden Gem; the only reason it does not show up on reviews is people don't know it is there.  The place is hidden behind a vets and a gas station.  But the food is REALLY good and very inexpensive; everything is freshly made to order and is very authentic.  The test for me of a really good Mexican joint is the Chile Relleno, theirs is the best I have tasted, I have to have them at least once a week from here.  It is not greasy or mushy, has just the right amount of heat, real Mexican cheese inside and a lovely soft batter, they do not smother it in cheese but instead cover it in a nice rich sauce yummy.

Please give this place a try, you will wonder how you stayed away so long.
