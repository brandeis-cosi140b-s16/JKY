I am a big fan of chipotle.  Kind of embarrassed to say it but I have gotten Chipotle about once a week for the past 4 years.  I usually go pick it up during lunch at work, and this location is the one I always go to.  This location might be busy, but the workers there are AWESOME.  From the line cooks to the manager, they are all very friendly and accommodating.   The best part is how efficient they are at making your burrito.  Other chipotles' in the Phoenix area take note!  Suggestion to avoid the lines:  Get there around 12:30 instead of around noon.
