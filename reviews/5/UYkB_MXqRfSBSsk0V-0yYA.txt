One of the best Taco trucks in Phoenix hands down!! If your going to a game or event and want a quick satisfying meal,grab some tacos and a drink and you'll leave with a smile! The meats are fresh, moist and flavorful! It seems like they make their own corn tortillas which is an added bonus! 

My favorite is the fact they give you chopped cabbage instead of lettuce on the tacos and sliced cucumbers and chilies on the side! The carnitas are my favorite, but from the cabeza, pollo, lengua or pastor you will not be let down.  Remember to bring cash, no debit or credit cards accepted here....
