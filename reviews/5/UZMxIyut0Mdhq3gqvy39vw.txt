If you're looking for something better than Filibertos, And Ferderico's... This is the place. I used to work at Safeway right across the street and I'd always come here! I love their food! If you're looking for bomb ass food, definitely come here. The workers are awesome! One girl always knew me and knew what I ordered (because I literally went there all the time). So friendly and down to earth! 
I love the atmosphere because you can literally just chill and eat great Mexican food. Not to mention, they totally aren't picky with their cheese. They will pile that stuff on like no other. This is my first review, and I was thinking of who I would review and this place came to mind! Love this place! I recommend their rolled tacos, and also the all the special's are good as well and come with plenty of food.
