A testament from a Mexican, these tacos are the BOMB! So, so good! Best I've had in Pittsburgh. I love the BBQ beef! Corn tortillas hot off the grill. Tender juicy meat. Plus, an excellent salsa bar. Wow, these things are good! Did I mention they are cheap? If you haven't been to this place yet, GO! NOW! What are you waiting for?!
