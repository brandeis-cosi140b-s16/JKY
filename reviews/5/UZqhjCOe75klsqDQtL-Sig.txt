If you are looking for good quality cheap eats and some places open really late, this is the ONE. Tacos EL Gordo hase open kitchen and few staffs constantly sweep floor and wipe tables. It's probably the cleanest taco joint I ever seen. My favorite tacos are Taco De Adobada & Taco De Lengua (spicy pork and beef tongue). Spicy pork is tender, juicy, and flavorful. Beef tongue comes in huge chunks (the most generous portion, but then again, they do cost $2.25). I always leave feeling satisfied and comforted after visiting Tacos El Gordo.
