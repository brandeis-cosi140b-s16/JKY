This place is simply amazing. I drove about 45 minutes to get here because I was referred by a friend. It was WELL worth the drive. It was clean, fast and the employes were super nice. I got a enchilada place with rice and beans. It was delicious! It was so great that I even ordered more food to go! I highly recommend this place for anyone craving authentic Mexican food!
