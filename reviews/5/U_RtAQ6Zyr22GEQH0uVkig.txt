I was pleasantly surprised by my entire experience here.  From the outside you see 1 single banner thats easily over seen by the Doc Holiday's signs that take over the entire building, but I'm glad I took the time to stop in and have the best mexican food I have had in Las Vegas.
I have lived in Las Vegas and have tried lots of mexican restaurant this city has to offer, and this one was by far my favorite. When you first walk in you aren't overwhelmed with loud hispanic music and dim red lighting (like every other cantina in Las Vegas), You are greeted with the family who runs the whole operation. The decor was simple,  but it obviously wasn't the focus, because the food and the service was the real star.
 I ordered a the chicken enchilada meal. It came with a drink, rice, beans, and 2 enchilada's, which is more than enough food. Get this, it was 5 dollars! thats a deal! it cost more to eat at Roberto's and I wasn't violently attacked from the food 30 minutes later like I am when I go to Roberto's or Faustos. obviously I was excited that it was so keep, but it was absolutely delicious. you can tell that the chicken was seasoned, moist, and made with love. 
Our server was a young boy, probably about 13 or 14. whenever I go to a family restaurant and the service is by the children, it can be awkward and kinda painful to watch these young kids try and interact with adults and do a good job, but not for this kid. He was bright, lively, and not awkward at all. He was very quick to have combacks to our jokes, and was very good at answering our questions. Not to mention he gave us better service than that of adults at far more expensive restaurants.

I will gladly comeback, and I am constantly telling everyone I know about this place.
