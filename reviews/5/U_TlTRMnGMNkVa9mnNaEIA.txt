I worked on 32nd St and Broadway for over 5 years. I knew of every small hole in the wall place to eat and Mims is a favorite. Think of Lennys burgers made with love and then throw in the best green chili burrito's, catfish, chicken wings, bbq etc. 

Don't expect fine dining or fancy place settings, but you can expect good food. 

The owner is also a Pastor and it was always fun to visit on Sunday's after mass when the entire congragation would show up. (I should have been born to a black family) 


I miss you Mim...
