This restaurant was a great find through Yelp and I did not know what to expect.  I thought it was Mexican but then it said Tapas which traditionally is Spanish but to my surprise it was tapas style but inspired by the entire a culinary mixture of different Latin American dishes.
We ordered the grilled shrimp pupusa and it was awesome. The Yucca huancaina poutine which was good, the cochinita pibil belly that was so tender and flavorful, and the taco of the day which was a sword fish with a delicious cream.  Once done our server Alyssa asked if we had room for dessert so she about to recite the offerings and the first thing mentioned was the Tres leches.  I quickly halted her and asked to say no more and to get me teh Tres leches.  It was to die for.
