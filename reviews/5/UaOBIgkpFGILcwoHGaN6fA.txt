Without a doubt the very best Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale and possibly all of Phoenix. Portions are unbelievable, the food is remarkable and the prices are extremely reasonable. It has easily become my favorite place to enjoy Mexican cuisine in the Phoenix area and I look forward to every visit.
