Love cafe rio! Everything is delicious,  although my favorite is the salad with sweet barbacoa pork. It's huge enough to share which I usually do with my daughter. Comes with choice of 2 dressings creamy avocado or cilantro lime vinaigrette.  Yum!  Fresh tortillas made right on site and so delicious!  Service is fast and love that this location has outdoor seating and lots of seating in general.
