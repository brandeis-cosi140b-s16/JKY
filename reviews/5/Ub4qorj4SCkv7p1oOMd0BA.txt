I love small taco shops like I'm used to in San Diego been here in Phoenix for 2 years and looking for the right taco shop. Well this is gotta be it. I don't see how they can make such good food for so small prices. Their chili rellenos are the best of any restaurant I've had here in Phoenix their shrimp cocktail is fantastic and the breakfast chorizo burrito is out of this world I live directly across from a taco shop on Southern but I come all the way over here now.
