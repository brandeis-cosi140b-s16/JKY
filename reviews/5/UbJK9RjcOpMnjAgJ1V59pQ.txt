I wanted to cry from happiness when I bit into my burrito--it was that good.

This is by far THE BEST food I've had in the Chambana area.  I had the horchata along with my meal as well and it was delish!  Definitely a step up from Chipolte, and a better deal, too.  You get chips and salsa packaged with your meal for free!
