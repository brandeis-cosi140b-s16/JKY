So good.  If you want authentic Mexican food for a quick lunch, then this is your place!  I have yet to have anything less than stellar.  They have vegetarian and a wide variety of meat options.  The shredded chicken on a burrito is my fav!
They tortilla chips are good, but could be a little saltier.
