I'm so glad this spot took over the abomination that was "Phat Burrito II."  This gives the neighborhood a very interesting dining option.  I'm a big fan of Three Amigos (same group that owns this place), so I know it would probably be pretty good.  I've always wanted to venture a little farther down Central avenue to the land of the true Latin food, but I just hadn't mustered up the courage to do so (looks a little sketchy to say the least).

I've never had a papusa or an arepa before, but they're terrific.  I love the thick corn tortillas they use.  I'm an American, so naturally I've eaten flour tortillas my whole life.  I've come to prefer corn in recent years.  Out of everything I've tried, I'd have to go with the papusas and empanadas as my favorite.  Do NOT forget the salsas.  They bring some serious heat that gives a badass crunchy, chewy, cheesy, SPICY punch.
