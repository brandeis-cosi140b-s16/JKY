Absolutely incredible,  this is such a hidden gem! ! The service was quite incredible, the food was outstanding!   The owner and staff were very personable making the experience perfect!  The owner recommended the "Costra  Lobster Tacos " which were out of this world!  They grill cheese and wrap it around the meat and put it in a warm tortilla with their signature sauce!  Best thing is the value of their menu is affordable and delicious! ! Very thankful I stumbled apon this place and look forward to our future visits!
