I am so excited that Los Sombreros has opened a new location closer to me in North Scottsdale.  For years they have been serving the best upscale Mexican food in the Valley and with the new location I can enjoy it more often.

I was here today for lunch and everything was great.  The salsa for the chips was amazing.  My chiliquiles were delicious and the service was fantastic.

I can't wait to come back for happy hour and dinner in the very near future.
