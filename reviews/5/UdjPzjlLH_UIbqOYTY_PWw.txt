Another great meal. This place has managed quite a feat staying consistent over the past 5 years we have been coming. The restaurant business isn't easy but the spotted donkey makes it look seamless. Excellent and authentic Mexican food and creative and inspired drinks make this a must visit destination when we are staying at the Boulders! Thank you to the staff for being so warm and accommodating.
