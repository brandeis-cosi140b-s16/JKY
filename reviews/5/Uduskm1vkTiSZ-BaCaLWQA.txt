My large family of 14....and that wasn't all of us, had dinner there last night. The service was excellent! 
We all ordered different things and everyone loved their food! 
The fresh chips & salsa....
unbelievably addictive!
I also ordered meals to go for my older children who couldn't come, my youngest son loved the food so much asked me for another whole meal to also take home! 
Everyone was so nice & the atmosphere is so HAPPY!....Especially on a cold winter night! We will be going back!
