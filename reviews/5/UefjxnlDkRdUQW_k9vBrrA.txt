I'm not sure why i haven't heard about this campustown gem earlier, but i am VERY happy i know about it now.  First off,i LOVE their salsa more than anywhere else in town, but it must be mixed with the hot (red, not green) and regular salsa in a bowl, their fresh, hot chips go perfectly.  SO GOOD.

i've had the Pollo Quesadilla twice and love the flavor, especially of the Cheese sauce.

Overall, this place is excellent, good service, has a big menu and best of all, its Cheap!

Go here soon!!
