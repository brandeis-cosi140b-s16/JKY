I went in for the first time last Thursday night on a whim and I'm extremely glad I did! We had Taylor for our server and she was absolutely exceptional (so much so it compelled me to write a review which I never do!) She gave us the rundown since it was our first time in and came across very genuine. Food and drinks came out very quick, waters were kept full, and it was made sure we were satisfied and had everything we needed. 

My friend had the grilled carne asada burrito and loved it, I had the kale spinach and quinoa salad with grilled chicken and it was amazing. I'm a sucker for a good margarita and even their house was delicious. 

I wasn't hungry enough to try any starters but they looked awesome, I'm excited to go back and try more!
