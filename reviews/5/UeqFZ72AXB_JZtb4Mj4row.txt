You'd think that in a state like Arizona that you could throw a rock 10 feet and find great Mexican food. This is NOT true unfortunately. I've been searching for truly great Mexican food for two years and Ive finally found it!  Not only is the food fantastic but the ambiance can't be beat. The patio is gorgeous, and there are several different rooms and each has it's own look and feel. If you don't want to sit in you can get take out. There's a separate building in the parking lot that handles only carry out orders.  It's not the cheapest place but it's worth every penny
