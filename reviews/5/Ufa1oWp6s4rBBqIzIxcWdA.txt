This restaurant is gorgeous.  It shines, and everything was perfect.  The food was great, the Margaritas were huge, just like we wanted!  The servers were wonderful and very welcoming.  The manager came over to introduce himself and to make sure we got everything just the way it was ordered.  
I've even taken out orders from here.  I can't complain about anything.  All restaurants have learning to do about the new area and clientele.  I hope this restaurant is around forever.  It is very inviting.
