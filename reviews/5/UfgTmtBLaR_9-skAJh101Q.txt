Dick's Hideaway is truly one of the best kept secrets in the valley for American southwestern cuisine. I cannot fault this establishment for anything: its setting, lack of pretense, extremely warm, welcoming, knowledgeable and efficient staff...and the food mon dieu! 

The flavors were so overwhelmingly delicious...that my friend and I were speechless the entire meal. Everything was so farmly fresh from the fresh squeezed orange juice, the eggs benedict combo, the green chile....My hunger was so satisfied for days to follow and smiles to linger...
