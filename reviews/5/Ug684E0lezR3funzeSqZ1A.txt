I grew up eating this food, but then I lived outside AZ, and outside the country for 20 years and had all kinds of Mexican food.  When I returned to Los Compadres it was like coming home.  True, it's not typical plate lunches or new-age fusion, but there is truly no better tasting food in the world than their guacamole cheese crisp or their shredded chicken mini-chimi with fresh guac and sour cream (no runny sauce).  Yes the chunky salsa is mild but the other salsa is great and there's plenty of it.  I go through several bowls in one meal!  Don't go in with expectations of something like Chipotle or On the Border - try a few unique things like the soft taco that comes with cheese melted on the outer shell or even their bean burro (not burrito) all by itself is amazing - melts in your mouth.  Some great food here if you ask around and know what to order.  There's a reason people love this place and keep returning after 40-50 years!
