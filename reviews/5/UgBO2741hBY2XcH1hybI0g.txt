Came to Las Vegas for a convention and had just about an hour to grab a quick bite to eat. I have eaten at many places in las vegas but as usual you need to drive and park/give your car to valet and then walk a bit to get to a decent quick restaurant. I was driving near the peppermill area and as usual the wait was out the door, but to my luck i saw this food truck right across the parking lot. Being from Chicago i am a TRUE food truck lover.... So i decided to try this place out. 

TO MY SURPRISE, not only were the tacos AMAZINGLY FRESH but also really light and non greasy so i would not feel guilty if i ate more. I ended up grabbing me a combo plate and a pineapple jarritos. The combo comes with 3 tacos ( you can choose from carne asada, pork or chicken) and a side of rice and beans. The price for all of that was under 10$ which made me very happy being in a city where you are more than likely to  loose money. I had the pleasure of meeting the owner inside the shop, where they sell drinks and ice cream , and as per his recommendation i also ordered the carne asada fries. ( I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THOSE FRIES)

I was so happy with all of the food and the taste was amazing that i had to share my joy for this place. The owner was telling me how they are planning on adding more food trucks with different cuisines so i will definitely be back to check those out next time i am here.
