Baja always has great food and great service and the owner is always friendly!  Try the potato tacos, its sliced potatoes pan fried with cheese served taco style.  They also have a ton of hot sauce that is always fun to grab a few and try them on different tacos.  My only complaint is their fountain drink machine, granted they did fix the ice machine, but sometimes the drinks are flat.  Just need to tune up the carbonation and it will be great!
