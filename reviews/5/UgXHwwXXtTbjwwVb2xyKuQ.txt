Got my Christmas tamales here, first time ordering, not the last!

Sampled many types, all were good, all had their own merrits.  EVERYONE's favorite was the green chili chicken tamales, for me a close second were the chicken mole followed by the green chili pork and the poblana chilis and Monterey Jack.  

My biggest complaint about most tamales is the excruciating lack of filling, but not from The Tamale Store!  These are big tamales with big filling.  Trust me and get your tamales here.
