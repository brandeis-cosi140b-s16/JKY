There are lots of places to get this type of burrito these days.  I think this is one of the best choices.  I find the quality of food to be very good, the prices fair, and the employees have always been friendly and really seem to care about doing a good job rather than just performing their corporately mandated duties.  Their dessert bars are also excellent and taste like home made!  I've had plenty of Chipotle and Qdoba in my days, all are very near to me, and I prefer Burrachos.
