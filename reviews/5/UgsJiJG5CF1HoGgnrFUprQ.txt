This place has been a long time favorite of mine and I just returned during a recent visit to Phoenix and was reminded why it is so great.  The salsa is particularly good, and I also discovered the jalape√±o cream sauce available for smothering your chimichanga- absolutely amazing. I will definitely go back on my next visit.
