So awesome!!!  We flew in from Atlanta,  Georgia. Not sure what to order it all looked so good.   One of the owners,  Jeff, suggested a combo plate with Nana's Chili Relleno, Green Chili Enchilada, a shredded beef Machaca Taco with rice and beans!  It was delicious, the  order was brought quickly on a steaming hot platter...and we had margaritas to top it off!   It was all so yummy!   Suggest you don't miss an opportunity to stop by and have a meal at Tee Pee Mexican Food Restaurant on Indian School Road.  You will find the food to be delicious and the service excellent!
