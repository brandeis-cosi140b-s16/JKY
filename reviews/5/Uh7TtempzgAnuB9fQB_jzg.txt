This restaurant is by far the best Mexican food in CU. I am from California so it's not ACTUALLY five star Mexican food, but it is absolutely the best in this area. The fajitas are good and huge. It easily is enough food for 2 meals. 

I love salsa and salsa bars. I usually feel like I can accurately judge how good a Mexican restaurant is based on the quality of the sauces. SO I appreciate that this place has some freshly made salsas. The chipotle one is not good, however, the other 3 sauces are fine.

This place is small though so in the evenings you may have to wait a bit for a table. I would definitely come back to Huaraches when I'm in the mood for Mexican in CU.
