So can we talk about how I used to live in Beechview  a block away and this place was just a little taco place?! I had gone there a few times before... But moved away this past winter! I had no clue that it was turned into a restaurant! We liked the food then, but it is SO much better now! We started with the wings (ok... nothing too special). I had heard from several people to try the ribs.... Sweet baby jesus I was glad I did!!! They were AMAZING!!!!!! Awesome amount of spice (maybe a little too much for some people) and sweetness! I am already craving these and it's been 2 days only! We also split a couple of tacos that we both knew we liked from the past! I love the Al Pastor and my husband always gets the birria (beef) tacos. I remember from the past that the burritos were awesome too. 

After we were completely stuffed... But we STILL needed to try some dessert. The chocolate hazelnut cheesecake was awesome! I work at the Cheesecake Factory so I really didn't want to eat cheesecake.... But the waitress convinced me it didn't take like cheesecake and more like a mousse.... And it was completely worth it! 

I wish I still lived in Beechview and could go back daily... But I will definitely be making the 15 minute drive back.... Probably a lot!
