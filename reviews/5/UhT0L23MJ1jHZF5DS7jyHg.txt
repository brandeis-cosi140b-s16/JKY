At first I was upset because they didn't have vegetable burritos on the menu but the waiter decided to make one for me anyway and put everything I asked for in it. He kept it at the same price as the other burritos too! Which was like 10 or 11 bucks. I really appreciated that he did that. The vegetable burrito is huge and really good! They put enchilada vegetables, sour cream, guacamole, onions, jalapenos, beans and cheese with rice on the side. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!! Arriba Mexican Grill is the new mexican spot for me! Ask for Jonathan. He is a great server! He is the reason for the 5 stars! You guys need to give that guy a promotion or something. Great service!
