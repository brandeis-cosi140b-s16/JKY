Used to live down the street from this place, man was that dangerous! the ability to get the dankest tacos with a Manzanita or Corona any time was true heaven! The Al Pastor with both the chipotle and tomatillo salsas with the jalapeno/carrot escabeche to crunch into.... oh my.... the salt, the tang, the spice! when i think authentic mexican street tacos, TJ's is the spot! 
Clutch!
