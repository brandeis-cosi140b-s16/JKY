We just randomly stopped by looking for margaritas and chips. I freaking love it here! I've never really been to Mexico (just TJ but does that even count?) but I feel like I am there! Haha even have Mexican news on the TV. We're at the bar but service is great, house margs are great, Super Nachos were so good and the salsa is delicious! Perfectly spicy. We will definitely come back for a full meal sometime.
