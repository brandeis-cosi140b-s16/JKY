Fantastic Mexican food, served 24 hours a day (including breakfast)...this place is great! My girlfriend introduced me to "Fili B's" in Mesa a year ago, and since it opened we've hit this 7th Avenue location 3-4 times a week. The staff at the drive-thru are very friendly and efficient, and the food is always fresh and hot (and of course delicious). Their breakfast burritos are my favorite - for less than $5 you're getting a burrito as big as your forearm, a delicious tortilla packed with scrambled eggs, cheese, and whatever else you want in it. My girlfriend's favorite isn't actually on the menu, but when we ask for refried beans and egg and cheese the staff always get it right and never seem confused by the custom order. We've also ordered taco plates and quesadillas to go, both with wonderful results. Also, if you've had good green salsa before, try the green salsa from this location - you'll love it too! :)
