I have never posted a review for a restaurant, but feel this one needs to be noticed. Lots of great Mexican restaurants in town, and I have my favorites. Adding this one to the list. Food and service was stellar. Beautiful restaurant and atmosphere. Patio is incredible with nice water feature. We ordered the T-Bone with salsa, beans and a cheese enchilada, as well as a chicken dish that came with rice and beans over pinapple queso. Also ordered quacamole for an appetizer. All delicious and very fresh! Complimentary chips and salsa were very good, and $2.50 margarita special was great too. Glad I decided to drop by. Great place to take a date, or family and friends.  Will be returning!
