The barrio name doesn't do this place justice because everyone that worked here spoken perfect english and didn't look like border jumpers. Cool place lots of cool art. The food was really good! I had taco's and my girlfriend had the pork sandwich. 14$ & 12$ bucks thats about as cheap as you can get for a meal here other entree's are 18-25$. Definitely recommend for a date or a group of friends and they have over 100 tequilas to choose from. I love mexican food and this place just topped my list for best in phoenix.
