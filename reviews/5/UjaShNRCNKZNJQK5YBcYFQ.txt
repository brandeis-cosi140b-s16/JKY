It's great to have that favorite place very close to home, the best pizza, best subs, best bar, or your favorite Mexican food. Manuel's on Southern is our favorite Mexican restaurant close to home. We dine here regularly and I've never had a bad meal at this location. I cannot say that for other nearby places we frequent.

The staff is prompt, friendly and competent. We've never waited long for a table, food, drink or a check. And we have a favorite waiter, Ian the wannabe Mexican.

My go-to dish is the Three Amigo enchiladas but there are many good dishes I go back to when dining here. When I need a Sonoran food fix, this is my place. There's only one other cantina in the east valley I put at the same level as Manuel's. My fondness has reach the point where I assume any negative review comes from a person who does'nt know what they're talking about.

My only slightly negative comment will be their discontinuation of Bohemia Beer, and they could have a better tap and tequila selection.
