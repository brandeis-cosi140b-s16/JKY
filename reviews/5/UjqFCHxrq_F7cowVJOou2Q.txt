So we were driving away from the Cashman Center and my father-in-law (who owns a few taquerias in California) goes, "hey, pull over; those are going to be good tacos." We did and he was absolutely right. How he could tell that from 3 lanes away with the windows rolled up, I don't know - but I'm happy that he has psychic taco finding skills.

Hands down, Tacos El Pastorcito has the best al pastor in Vegas. I've been across the city from the chain stores to the street-corner taquerias whose menus aren't even in English. This place ranks at the very top. Yes, it's on a street corner in the parking lot of a tire shop -- BUT it has an "A" rating from the heath inspector (most mobile kitchens are "B"s at best). Yes, it's in a ghetto part of town, but it's 30 seconds off the freeway, so suck it up, jump off the 96 and risk your personal safety for 5 minutes while you pick up some of the best tacos in Vegas. 

The carne asada is worth the risk and the al Pastor will make you completely forget that you are surrounded by drunken creepers staggering home from Fremont Street.

Delicious!
