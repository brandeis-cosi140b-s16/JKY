This is hands down the best Mexican resturant in the valley. If your like me, whose last choice is Mexican; Well no more, this place has rocketed to the top of my list. The menu has a large selection of entrees. I had the pollo chipotle with black beans and rice. It was presented on a unique 16" round plate . It was amazing! My lady and I love margaritas, you must try the fresh margarita. Made with fresh lime juice, and agave. Again amazing. Its a family owned resturant with wonderful people and great service. My advise is drop what your doing and go eat at this place.
