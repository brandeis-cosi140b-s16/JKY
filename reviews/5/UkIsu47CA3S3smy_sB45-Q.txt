The short:  Absolutely AMAZING!  Go try it NOW!

The long: 

Carlito's Burritos is easily my new favorite place to eat.  Not just my new favorite New Mexican place to eat.  I cannot believe I waited so long to try this wonderful place, and now all the buzz and reviews make sense.  

I placed a to go order with a friend.  We ordered a combo burrito and tacos.  The burrito was absolutely gigantic.  And when they "smother" a burrito, they really mean "drown" it - but in the best way possible (if there is a good way to drown something, I mean).  It was packed with meat and all the "fixins."  The tacos were absolutely to die for.  They are crispy but not greasy.  The steak was amazing; perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  They were topped with the freshest and most delicious lettuce and tomatoes I have had from a restaurant.  Straight from the garden ya'll.

We ordered a few sides, too.  The refried beans are killer; they are not smashing smooth, they have a really nice texture and amazing flavor.  The rice wasn't great, but I'm not holding that against them.  Just not my type of flavor.  The green chile stew was super yummy, but very spicy.  

The yelp 5 star rating says it all: "Woohoo!  As good as it gets!"
