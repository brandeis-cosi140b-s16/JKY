Had a late lunch today with a friend who has cancer.  We both ordered the Enchiladas and loved every bite.  Not for sissies, the sauce packed a punch, JUST RIGHT.  I fought myself between those and the Stuffed Poblanos...another favorite.  And don't forget to share an order of the Jalepenos Poppers!!!   I can't speak for the Margaritas as I don't drink them so if YOU don't like them, have a Victoria draft and dive into some of the best Mex food in the Valley!!!

And, the service was great, as always.
