We stopped in here late at night, right before closing, and it was still fabulous.  All the food tasted fresh and the service was excellent.  The staff was pleasant and never rushed us (but we did try and hurry).  The chips and salsa could have been a meal in itself.  I had a beef burrito, no cheese, and that combined with the refried beans and rice was divine!.  Can't wait to go back.
