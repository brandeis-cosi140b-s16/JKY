After driving past Tacos Tijuana almost every day, my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and try the food and I must say, we were happy we did. The food was very good (Tacos de Adobada, Tacos de Asada and Tacos de Sesos). Service from ALL of the staff was excellent! Denise, Mike and Benjamin were awesome. Mike made us feel welcome with a warm greeting and inquired about our visit. Benjamin and Denise helped us decide what to eat with no hesitation as well as providing us with a welcome greeting upon our first step into the restaurant. We WILL be back! Thanks guys.
