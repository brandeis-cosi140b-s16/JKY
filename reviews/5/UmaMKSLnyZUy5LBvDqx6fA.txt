Old El Paso Tamales is easy to miss, located in a non-distinct strip mall off the beaten path in Mesa... and right now I feel like it's a well kept secret.

The decor is basic and the menu is very short... they sell tamales, beef, chicken or pork (although I've heard rumors they do dessert tamales around Christmas and make other things as well). Currently the chicken tamales are my favorite as they have a green chili that gives them a little extra kick.

It helps to call ahead to make sure the variety of tamale you want is currently available or you might get stuck waiting... but if you have to, the tamales are well worth the wait.

These are the best tamales I've found in the valley.
