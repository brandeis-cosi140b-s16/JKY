I am a regular patron in this restaurant. I enjoy the food, the drink specials, and the interesting people that work there. I come here for the big portions of reasonably priced decent Americanized Mexican fare and the people watching. The manager Chemin is a friend. He is one if the nicest people I have met in Rock Hill and he always has a smile and a kind word order the table side guacamole, you won't be disappointed.
