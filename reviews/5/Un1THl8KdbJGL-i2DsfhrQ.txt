Great for downtown Madison. Walked by this place a billion times and finally decided to try it. I assumed if it wasn't on Park Street, it wasn't going to be good (ethnic food-wise). Sure enough, it really was. Now, I'm not saying this is the most authentic Mexican place (do they have cheddar cheese in Mexico?) but they are relatively close in many respects. Multiple sauces and they really do a fantastic job with making things flavorful. They have some great specials and their margaritas were very good. I didn't find it to be that expensive. Plates were $8-15 (most around $10) and drinks weren't horribly over-priced. The ambiance was nice, as was the service. If you are seeking a good dinner in the area, I'd definitely recommend it.
