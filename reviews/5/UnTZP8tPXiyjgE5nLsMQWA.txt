I see a lot of places comparing chronic tacos to chipotle. Chronic tacos franchise have been around longer than chipotle. Maybe not here, but in California. 

That being said, we walked in and we're greeted immediately. The lady was busy and another employee came out of the back within a minute. We had not been to this restaurant before and they helped us with each step. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. It will be a place that we will revisit and I encourage everyone to visit, even if your first experience was less than perfect.
