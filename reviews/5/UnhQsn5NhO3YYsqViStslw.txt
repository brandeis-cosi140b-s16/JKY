One thing that disappoints me about Las Vegas, is the lack of REALLY GOOD hole in the wall Mexican places.  It seems that all of the mexican that comes up on my yelp search is always robertos, don tortacos or taco bell.  Really disappointing.  I've also been to the Bonito Michoacan and I'm not super impressed.  I used to live in California, so I just miss those really good, line-out-the-door mexican spots where there's a huge language barrier but the most amazing food ever! 

I have been wanting to try Fausto's for quite some time.  I keep watching the yelp reviews because everyone seems to be a fan, but I wasn't convinced that this place that resembles a robertos could be that great.  I think it's the way the menu looks or something, but it was a difficult one for me to actually give a shot.  

I got a supreme chicken burrito.  It was awesome.  The only thing I didn't like about it, was how it was served for dine in.  I prefer to cut open my burritos and eat them with a fork and knife but the little dish they gave me to eat off of was too small for the burrito and it would have been half sitting on the table.  LOL.  

Their salsa bar is very similar to that of Robertos.  It was comforting that while I was there a ton of mexican families came through and ordered + seemed to be regulars of the place.  

I look forward to trying more menu items and boosting this up another star to confirm that this is the best Mexican hole-in-the-wall place in Las Vegas.  :)
