3 Margarita's is one of my family's favorite local spots in the West Valley.  The salsa and bean dip is always fresh, the staff is always courteous and friendly and the food is always superb.  I especially like the Arroz con Pollo and the Tres Amigos (Chile Relleno, Chile Colorado and Chile Verdo).  Everything is always fresh and delicious!
