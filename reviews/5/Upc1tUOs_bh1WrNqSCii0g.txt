These flavors together are amazing! My boyfriend and I ordered a bulgogi burrito, nachos, a taco and a tostada ... A ton of delicious food (this ended up being lunch AND dinner for two people) for very little money. I even loved the hot sauce, and normally I can't take anything too spicy. A little bit of their regular hot sauce on my food was perfect. However, they said they can make the food much spicier if you ask - so it's a great place for spice-wimps like me, and spice-hounds like my boyfriend (who will pretty much eat ghost peppers and not die). Very friendly staff/owners as well. Highly recommend.
