I generally wouldn't review a takeout joint, but an experience this past Sunday just blew me away. Los Favs has long been our go-to place for Mexican food in a hurry. Their breakfast burros are the best around.

We were headed out for a day trip on Sunday morning; left the house around 5:35. We weren't counting on Los Favs to be open, but the light was on and it looked like the open sign was in the window as we approached the corner, so we pulled in. As we parked out front, we could see they were prepping for their morning, but still closed. 

With a sigh, we resigned ourselves to egg McMuffins, and I shifted into reverse, but before I could back out, one of the guys hustled out of the kitchen  to unlock the door and flip the sign from "Closed" to "Open." He waved us inside, they whipped up an awesome chorizo burro in minutes and off we went. THAT is service!
