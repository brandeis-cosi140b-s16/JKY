Honestly very great place! It's really small and not in the best area of Las Vegas, but the food and service make up for it! I am Mexican, so when it comes to the food I'm extremely picky. This place literally hit the spot on the taste!!!! Every plate I have tried here is filled with taste. The prices are not bad at all either compared to other places I have been to. 
   They also have a variety of Mexican beverages including alcohol. Definitely recommend a michelada with any dish you order! My all time favorite dish here is camarones a la diabla. It's a very spicy shrimp dish that includes beans and rice. Hits the spot every time! 
   If you are looking for a great place for some Mexican food in Las Vegas I recommend this place before any other place!
