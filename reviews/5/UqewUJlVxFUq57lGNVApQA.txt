Great carne asada burritos.  The fish taco/burritos are also on point.  The owner is incredibly friendly and gives personal service.  The food is affordable and extremely high quality.  I enjoy coming here for consistent good tasting Mexican, best in the area.  Skip 'bertos and come here instead for an authentic taste.
