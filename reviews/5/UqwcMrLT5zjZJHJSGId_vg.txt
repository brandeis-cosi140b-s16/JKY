Delicious as always. Enchiladas or tamales or the Huarache burrito are all my favorites. Fresh made chips and sauce are a plus. Prices are extremely cheap by airport standards. I was here tonite eating my food and witnessed an unruly and abusive customer that had a little too much to drink and was getting mouthy with not only the cashier but also the old woman next to him in line. This idiot was actually threatening the manager with " I gonna ruin you on Yelp if you dont comp my meal" I heard the guy admit his food was made properly but did not like what he ordered and felt the restaurant owed him something for his buyers remorse. The police had to be called just to remove him. Really good food and ive always recieved excellent customer service. Its sad they have to deal with airport rifraff, their food is better than restaurant quailty and does not get the credit due because of the location
