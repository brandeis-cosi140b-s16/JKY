Fat tacos, man. This stuff is delicious. I've been eating at Taco Bell for the past 2 months because there's nothing else near my brother's place in AZ, so I feel redeemed. I feel like my life has taken a real turn. Things are looking up. The grass IS greener on the other side!

A lot of these smaller places make great food but everybody ignores them. Someone said this is out of the way, but... what? It's like 5 minute drive from anywhere. Vegas is small. Well at least if you're from LA. Go here, give them some business, they deserve it, they make better food than most restaurants I see with 500 reviews.

Oh yea La Takiza your website link is broken, fix it guys!
