So this coincidently is right down the street from our gym. My husband was driving past it one day and decided to stop best thing he could have ever done!!!!!! He kept raving about these "Korean tacos" for a week before I finally broke down and said lets go try it. WOW is all I have to say we started with their Nate dog and not so French fries. I have had everything on their menu, and look forward to their specialty tacos that change every two weeks. All I can say about Ron's (owner/chef) creations is ammmmmaaaaazzziinngggg!!!!! He's always coming up with different yet delicious treats! Sometimes i'm skeptical to try like his Persian, but in the end it is always a blend of flavors that I end up craving all week long! He's extremely customer friendly and you can always tell when someone is truly proud and happy with his work. If I were him I would too!!!!! My Husband even participated in his Nate dog eating contest swore he could never eat one again but after a week started craving the deliciousness that is the Nate dog!!! Definitely a hidden gem we HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you stop and try this place, we drive across town most of the time just to eat here. Do not listen to the negative comments below, its not meant to be "traditional" Korean. Come here with an open mind and leave with a very very happy belly!!
