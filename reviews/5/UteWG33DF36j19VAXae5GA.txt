Awesome Authentic Real Mexican food. My husband and I have gone several times on a Saturday for breakfast and lunch. The food taste like it came out of my nana's kitchen. The Chimichanga enchilada style is served with some of the best refried beans and rice, and topped with fresh quacamole and sour cream. Being Mexican myself, I am very impressed  with the quality and flavor with  the dishes we have tried. My husband loves the tamales. The decor is very nice, the place is small and cozy. The service is always excellent. The prices are very reasonable. This is a small hidden  gem in West Phoenix. I would highly recommend to anyone. Not just your average burrito/taco joint.
Real Mexican food! Kudos to the chef!
