I love this place. Real Mexican food and plenty of tex mex to choose from. The carnitas are excellent by far my favorite. Nice sized queso dip and fresh guacamole made at your table. I actually got my wife to start eating real Mexican instead of the tex mex she use to eat. Wish I was there right now.
