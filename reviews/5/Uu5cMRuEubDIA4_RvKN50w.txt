Let's get one thing straight, this is New Mexican style food. And its delicious. Watch out for the lunch crowd, as the line builds out the door by 12pm. As everyone else seems to agree, go with the chili (either red or green) burro, enchilada style. The best thing about it is the New Mexican style sauce.

If you're looking for authentic Mexican, there's better.
