So freakin' delicious! So many mornings I sneak over for an Eriks Special burrito. The name scares the hell out of me, but it's a really good, giant burrito, full of deliciousness. For later in the day food, I love their rolled taco meals, the beef burritos and their chicken tacos. Eriks beats Fili's like a red headed step child with bad grades! I thought about moving to Gilbert once, but then Erikberto's opened up shop. Try it!
