Wasnt sure if 4 or 5 was earned but gave it a 5 for overall....Was there on Saturday night (usually only go for a special late night meal after work).   Last time they forgot my quesadillas but lesson learned, check your order.

Very tasty, love the spicy mexican sausage.

I always leave some cash since they are very nice and accomodating...

Thanks Amigos!
