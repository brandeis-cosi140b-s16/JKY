For lunch, my wife suggested a new place she'd seen. A cantina in Boca Park?  Gotta be pretentious, I'm thinking. Quite the contrary. The atmosphere is very casual and the staff very friendly and courteous. I would liken it to Chipotle meets sports bar but with higher end ingredients. The restaurant and restrooms were very clean and the service was excellent. Our party of six was seated immediately and drink orders taken on the spot. The bartender brought me the wrong beer and before it even registered in my mind, she returned with the correct beer and told me to keep the first. All right, this is my kinda place. 

The menu is a bit limited, but hey, it's tacos. The street corn is charred to perfection and the salsa bar is pretty good, too.  The manager checked on us, which I always like, and we were in and out in just over half an hour. Price was very fair, too. Can't wait to go back.
