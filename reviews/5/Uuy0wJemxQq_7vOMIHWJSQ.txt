This has been one of our favorite mexican restaurants ever since we first went to the original one in Mesa and is our goto place to take out of town guests.  As soon as we entered there new location we were very impressed.  The amount of brick that went into the build out could probably house a small village.  As soon as we were seated we had chips and two kinds of salsa, my favorite part of eating mexican food.  If you like hot food ask for a side of the habanero salsa.  I like to use the habanero salsa as an excuse for why I drank my marg so fast.  I ordered my favorite, the salmon tacos and my wife ordered the carne asada with all three meats.  The carne asada is cooked for 10 or 12 hours and reminds me of my moms pot roasts.  Everything was fantastic.  We did not have mexican fried ice cream this trip since I overindulged in chips, but if you save room i recommend ordering it.  I was very impressed with how well our waiter knew the menu since the restaurant just opened and he made several recommendations even though we stuck to our favorites.  Welcome to Chandler, we will be seeing you often.
