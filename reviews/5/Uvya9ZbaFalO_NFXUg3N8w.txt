Finally tried this place one Sunday afternoon and loved it! We had the shrimp quesadilla for a happy hour appetizer and it was so cheesy and yummy. The shrimp were big and juicy. The shrimp tacos were great too. Loved the refried beans that came with the tacos. Even the endless chips and salsa were amazing. Had a glass of Mexican white Zinfandel for the first time on their happy hour menu and my husband had a beer. Service was wonderful. We will definitely be back. The place is really cute.
