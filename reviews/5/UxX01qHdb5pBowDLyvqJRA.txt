I love this little hole in the wall! Their fresh juices are amazing and oh so yummy, and their carne asada is delicious. The service here is great, and the food is always consistent. It has been a little while since I lived in Phoenix but I was sitting at my office in LA thinking how much I would love some Tacos Kissi carne asada and some fresh juice! Their location is not great, but give this place a try, you won't be sorry!
