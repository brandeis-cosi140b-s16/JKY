Yes, I am old but I get out alot and don't live in a bubble.  So how is it that it took me so long to eat here?  Probably due to my aversion of chains but man, Chipotle changed me.  I'm on board with their attempts to bring better proteins to the table and their flavor combinations are off the chart.  You can't go wrong with any options but to me, the barbacoa is hard to beat.  While not traditional, made with beef rather than lamb, the meat is tender and unctuous and pairs well with any of their salsas.
Also, don't miss out on their guacamole and chips.  It seriously rivals that of local mexican restaurants.  Cilantro.  Red Onions, Citrus.  Perfection.
While I still will choose a local place over a chain, in a pinch, Chipotle has my vote.  It's fast.  It's cheap.  It's delicious!
