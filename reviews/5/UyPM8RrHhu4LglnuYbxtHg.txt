I have been back several times since my initial review and have not been disappointed. 

Today, Norm and I braved out the south side of 19th ave and Peoria. 

Once again it was an excellent meal, especially for $5.35. 

I had the red chili burrito with rice and beans and shared chips and salsa with Norm. The burro was full of chunks of beef simmered in red sauce and covered with cheese and more red sauce. The rice was perfect and the bean... oh the beans... you cannot have better. 

The staff was on top of it and extra friendly.
