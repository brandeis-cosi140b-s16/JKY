Whenever I get the hankering for Mexican, I'm always left disappointed wherever I venture in Pittsburgh. BUT BUT BUT that will no longer be the case now that I've found Los Cabos. 

I happened upon Los Cabos by accident. The first time I went I ordered the shredded chicken burrito -- SO SO SO GOOD. I've also got an exceptional bean tostada. there. (I've also had an underwhelming chicken taco, but, five stars nonetheless for service and for the excitement of finally finding good mexican). 

Also, reasonable prices!
