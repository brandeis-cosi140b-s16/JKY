WOW! My wife and bro have been telling me about this place for years now but for some reason we never went. We always visit Cartel Coffee on the weekend which is about 100 steps from there and FINALLY this past Saturday we went for lunch after our coffee and I am still kicking myself for not going sooner. The red chicken is ridick and the tri tip was amazing as well. I am (as we speak) thinking of putting in an order for lunch and I work in Chandler! The food does take a little bit but its more then worth it!!!!
