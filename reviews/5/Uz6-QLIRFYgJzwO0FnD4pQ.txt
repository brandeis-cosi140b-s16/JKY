Mmmm! All 6 of us left stuffed and happy! 

Everything here is fresh, from scratch, from the tortillas to the yummy, smokey corn chips. The family who owns the place is incredibly kind and accommodating. Honestly, I don't even like mexican food but the ingredients, service, and homey feel won me over. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular.
