My husband has been raving about this place, so we went there for lunch.  We started with their guacamole, made fresh right at the table.  It was incredible.  They come to your table with a cart loaded with bowls of ingredients and you can choose what to add to your guacamole.  I've never had anything so delicious!  Wow!  Their chips were also the best I've had in any restaurant anywhere!  We each ordered the tacos.  I had the pork shoulder tacos, which were incredible.  My husband ordered the barbacoa tacos.  He said they were good, but we swapped one taco and he liked the pork shoulder better.  I also had one of their "famous margaritas" and it was really tasty!  It was just the right strength, not too weak, not too strong.  We will definitely be going back. My only complaint was it's SO hot sitting outside on the patio, but I'm from Seattle, so not used to the heat.  It was like a sauna, so if you're really sensitive to heat, stay inside if you can.  

Definitely five star, will definitely be back.
