My wife suggested the idea of coming here for breakfast for the 'Arizona Breakfast Weekend'. Their special was $7 breakfast which included mimosa, Bloody Mary or coffee. Without having made reservations our wait time was about 30-40mins but because the bar counter was open we decided to sit there and not have to wait. My wife ordered their chilaquiles with egg and I got the chorizo with egg burrito. We absolutely loved it!! The atmosphere is great, service was great and food was delicious. If you're looking for a modern/hipster Mexican restaurant come here and enjoy. We're definitely coming back soon!
