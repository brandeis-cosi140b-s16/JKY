This place has the best Mexican food, and prices!!! You name anything on the menu, Breakfast burrito, tacos, enchilada, even the kids menu and you will be satisfied.  Service is great, which is a main factor.  Their salsa is the best i've ever tasted, and I don't even use salsa, unless I'm at Caminero's because anyone else's salsa doesn't taste good after having Caminero's.  I have eaten here for the past 3 years, about once every couple of months, and each time they deliver.
