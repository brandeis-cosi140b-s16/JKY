This is what heaven would taste like if heaven had a taste... hands down my favorite Mexican joint in town, I have not had a bad thing on the menu. The people who run this place are impeccably nice, and always respectful. Listen if you want a bad burrito that tastes like Chef Boyardee, go to taco bell... you want the real deal! come here.
