This place is tiny, which often leads to tricky parking situations and lines out the door, but don't be dissuaded! Everything I've tried has been fresh and flavorful, and absolutely not drowning in grease (which is often my complaint when it comes to Mexican food, particularly in the midwest). My current favorites are the guacamole, veggie chalupas, and pumpkin flower quesadillla. I'm slowly working my way through the veggie and fish menu as I return and return again, snacking on the complimentary chips and adding delicious warm salsa to all of the selections. Yum!

Lately I've been calling for take-out more often because the logistics of getting to Maize and finding space are not always easy... and so I would love if it could expand a bit and get some better bike / car parking. (Bike rack, please?) But that doesn't seem to be worth knocking off a star -- and other than that, I wouldn't want them to change anything.
