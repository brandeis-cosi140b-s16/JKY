HUITLACOHE!!! HUITLACOCHE!! THEY HAVE HUITLACOHE and it's delicioso.  Otherwise known as corn-fungus, this is a delicacy I have only learned about in my foodways courses and read about in the pretentious Gourmet magazine.  It's damn delicious in quesadilla form.  Subtle mushroom-like base w/ a slight touch of acidity and an even slighter touch of garlic.
 
Their melt-tender lamb barbacoa was rich and satisfying.  The orange cake my friend ordered was much the same -- it had fresh rind and icing layers so thick and fluffy. that I had to do everything in my power not to stick my fingers into it.
