I eat here on a very regular basis. My wife and I absolutely love the food here. I consider this the best chicken made. Tip: make sure you ask for the chicken extra juicy, it makes a world of difference. The manager Joseph and assistant manager David are always ready and eager to help. They great us with a smile and fast service. I can't say enough about this place. Come and enjoy for yourself.
