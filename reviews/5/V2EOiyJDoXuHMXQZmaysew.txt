Amigos Tacos!!! Oh, hells to the yes! 

This place spanks every taco shop in town (Roberto's, Tortas Del Rey, Tacos Mexico), you name it! This place is makes is delicious! There's not at bad item on them menu. This little gem in nestled in the SE corner of a Smith's parking lot. 

My favorites here are tamales, chimichangas (beef, please), and their cheese enchiladas. There are several combinations, ala carte items, and different combo deals.

There salsa is on par with what you find at other taco shops (and I hate them all, what the hell is that shit anyway). The food here is so bomb dot com, that you won't need any of that other business.

The one draw back is that this place serves Pepsi, but I don't eat on places depending on what beverage options are available and I always get my food to-go. If you live in the SW area of town (Rhodes Ranch especially) get on this. It's addictive like crack!

Si senor, with yo' tacos, we most certainly can be amigos! Hasta luego and viva Amigos Tacos!!! Ole.
