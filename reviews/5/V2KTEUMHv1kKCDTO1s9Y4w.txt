What a great find hidden in a place where you would never expect it to be!  I love the beans and rice here so much.  Probably the best I have had of any Mexican food in Queen Creek.  The green chile is good too, not to hot, but spicy enough.  I am for sure going back to this place and trying more.  They serve breakfast all day, and it is homemade goodness style.  Pancakes, bacon, potatoes - anything you can image.  Great for the kids who hate Mexican food!  I can't believe it took me so long to try this (no kidding) hole in the wall place!  Can't wait to go back and try more on the menu.
