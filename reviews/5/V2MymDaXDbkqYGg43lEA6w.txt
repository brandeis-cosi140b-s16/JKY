This is a tasty well-kept secret in Avondale. It is delicious. Everything we've tried is very good. My favorite are the chicken tacos - I don't know what they do to the chicken, but it is a perfect blend of marinade and fajita-like juices. Their soups are also very good - menudo, caldo de res, etc. The owners and staff are so sweet!
