Oh Popos how I love thee...let me count the ways. Awesome chips and salsa and friendly service.  But it's the seafood enchiladas that make this place my favorite restaurant.   They are the best I've ever had.  Just spicy enough and not fake crab meat tadting like so many others.  My little one enjoys the chicken tacos and hubby always orders something different but especially loves the cheese enchiladas.  My in laws celebrate everything here because the food is so great.  Mexican food is my favorite and I litterally ate her weekly when I was pregnant.   My favorite restaurant in the valley!
