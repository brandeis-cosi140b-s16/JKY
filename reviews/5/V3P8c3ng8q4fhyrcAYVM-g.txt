Coming back from San Diego I was hungry not starved. Since the Barrio Caf√© was near my gate I stopped in looking for something cold to drink and nothing too heavy to eat. The menu was chock full of belly stuffers and just before giving up I spied the Posole Verde Soup. It was deliciously described as:
Pork, hominy. Roasted tomatillo and poblano soup topped with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, and diced onion.
What a fabulous choice. The large chunks of oh so tender pork, the spices, and the wonderful broth was off the charts. I added some hot sauce and bingo it went from a solid 8 to a 10. 
This was one of my best airport restaurant experiences to date. I just wish I had a thick slide of coarse bread to sop up the remaining broth!!!!
Service was great at the bar. The bar stools are kind of funky as the cushions are too thick and soft you feel like one false move and you will flip off.
