I was staying in Vegas for a week, and I hit up this place 4 times! Seriously.  Before I dropped off my gf at the airport, she wanted this place to be her last meal before heading back to Fresno. Seriously. So good and as authentic as the taco shops in San Diego.  As a gift, I then took a best friend (who now lives in Vegas, and grew up in San Diego) to this taco shop. Sharing is caring.
