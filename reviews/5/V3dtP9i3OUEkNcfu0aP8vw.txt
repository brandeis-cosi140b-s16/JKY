We went their based on the reviews seen here and we were not disappointed! Very cool vibe to the place, the wait staff was great and the food was fantastic!  We ordered The Taos plate and the Scallops special...WOW.  Everything taste incredible and the scallops were probably one of the best we have ever had...super tender and way mouthwatering.

Had margaritas...those too were very good.  Mrs. had the prickly pear version and was thoroughly impressed.  

We want to take some friends back...might not be able to sit in the bar ( we went on a Wed. during happy hour and it was full) , but the back room looked like you can hang out with a group a little more comfortably.

We will be back!
