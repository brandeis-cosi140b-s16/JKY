I love this place or I should say I love their ceviche!  If you like ceviche, you MUST try the Hot and Raw Tropical Ceviche; it is amazing!  Also, be conservative when adding in the fresh diced habanero pepper that comes on top....it will sneak up on you as you get to the bottom of the bowl.   If you are not into spice Sol has, I think, four kinds of ceviche and I highly recommend 3 of them (not a fan of the shrimp one).  Another brownie point for Sol is their complimentary, yummy, unique 'chips and salsa'.  Many Mexican places have moved more towards making you pay for the chips and salsa, so I appreciate them keeping with my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant tradition :)

I have had a few of their entrees as well and the food is superbly made and beautifully presented.  They definitely add a little extra 'Sol flare' to all their food, which usually isn't a bad thing, but you should not be expecting 'traditional' Mexican food while dining at Sol.  My servers and bartenders have always been knowledgeable about the food and pleasant- the other reason I keep coming back apart from the ceviche!  In terms of ambiance this is definitely chic for a Mexican Restaurant- no tacky bright decor and neon lights here!  The patio is also very inviting with misters during the hot summers and it is attached to one side of the bar, making it rather lively if it is hopping.  

My one complaint about Sol is the prices are a bit steep for Mexican food (around $13 for 3 tacos, entrees $15-$30 & house margarita $8+), but I guess they do have to pay rent at the Scottsdale Quarter so I will cut them slack on that.  I should also mention they have a decent happy hour from 3-6 everyday, so if you are on a tighter budget you should go then.  Unfortunately my favorite, the Hot and Raw Ceviche, is not on the Happy Hour menu.
