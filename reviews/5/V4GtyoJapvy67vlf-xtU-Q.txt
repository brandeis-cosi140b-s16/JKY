five stars for a Rubio's. definitely the nicest looking and most well kept one I've ever visited. they impressed my wife by using real plates and forks and etc. which is nicer than the styrofoam crap you get at most places. overall just another justification for the higher property taxes you pay in Gilbert I suppose.
