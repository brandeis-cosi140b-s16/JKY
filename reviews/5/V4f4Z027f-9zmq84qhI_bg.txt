This is our second time here for breakfast this week.  This little chain has grown to 3 locations.  They have a great chilaquilles and eggs special for $6.99 comes with beans and potatoes.   It was pretty good and large portion although I did add some extra crunched up chips to mine as I like a little crunch in mine like I have had in some parts of mexico.  Very clean place, a fish counter to pick out your own fish to have cooked.  Included some pics of our breakfast.  We now need to try it for dinner. Since this is a seafood restaurant the prices run from around $14 to $22.  They also have lots of platter for 2 and more people.
