I can't say enough about the brunch here! It's totally  MUST DO if you are in Vegas.  It was pretty quite when we got there at 10am on a Saturday, but by 1pm when we left (yes, we brunched for 3 hours but wouldn't you if the mimosas just kept coming?!?) the patio was full.

Our table looked directly out on the pool and palm trees on THEhotel.  Our server was very attentive, telling us about the option of either ordering from the regular lunch menu or getting the brunch, which consisted of your choice of 22 tapas-style brunch items ($34.99) to which you could add unlimited mimosas ($8) in a variety of flavors including pomegranate, lemon ginger, and apple basil.

Of course, having done our research, we chose the tapas brunch, each starting with 2-3 small plates and progressing until we tried nearly all of the 22 dishes among the three of us.  The brisket hash, churro tots, potato tacos, and manchaca benedict were some of our favorites, but really none of the dishes we had were bad.  We sampled all of each other's dishes and no one left hungry.  The server did not rush us and we enjoyed several rounds of mimosas after the meal, making for a great start to the weekend!!  

It's truly a gourmet dining experience in a relaxed atmosphere.  The food was incredibly fresh, artfully presented with attention to detail, and was very flavorful. I loved this place and definitely planning on returning in the future. It's well worth the price!
