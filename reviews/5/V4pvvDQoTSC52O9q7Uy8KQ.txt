Well, it's about time I got around to writing a review of my favorite neighborhood mexican restaurant.  Within about a minute you'll get fresh chips and salsa and Cadillac Margaritas, if you like.  Some of the best enchiladas I've ever had are my usual, and fresh jalapenos (not pickled) are readily available if you're a wee bit more daring.

Sit at the bar and enjoy a new HDTV screen and watch some football; special tip after those jalapenos: head over to your favorite gelato place ;)
