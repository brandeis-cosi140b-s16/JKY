Just visited this place last weekend and if you read my review of Tacos El Compita #2 then you will know that this is THE BEST place for good ass hood style mexican food - taste so good make you wanna slap the bum at the chicken shack! The carne asada is the business here! No matter if you get it in a burrito, taco, or mulita, it's all good! Don't forget your Mexican Coke!
