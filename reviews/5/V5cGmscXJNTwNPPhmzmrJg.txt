i loved the whole day of the dead look. it felt festive in a different way compared to other mexican restaurants. completely casual and easy to order. the waitress was nice and knowledgable about their menu.  i tried the cali burrito and some shredded beef tacos with rice and beans on the side. i thought the beans had a very marinated in lime juice taste which was awesome for me. the prices were very affordable oh and you have to try their version of jamaica! for lazy people who need a waitress at all times - this would probably not be the place to go to.
