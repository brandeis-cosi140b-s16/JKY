This is my new favorite restaurant on the strip. We have been to many fancy 4 and 5 star restaurants in Vegas with a much higher price tag (though this place isn't inexpensive either) and yet the food here was far more delicious and memorable than most of those places plus the service was impeccable. We did have to wait 20-30 minutes to be seated but it was well worth it once seated. I was super impressed with the service being so great on a holiday weekend. Despite the wait to be seated, the food came quicker than typical and the waiters and staff checked on us often and were very friendly but polished. Their menu is huge and includes sustainably sourced seafood with daily specials. I had the chicken fajitas which were super tasty and then my boyfriend and I shared the cornbread with ice cream which was kick ass. He had the seafood trio enchiladas which he said were really good. I also appreciated that they boxed my leftovers in tiny side boxes (without my asking) versus those huge to go boxes places normally give you for tiny to go portions (rediculous). The ambience is lively with club-ish music but you can still talk to the people at your table. I loved it. Anyway, go here!
