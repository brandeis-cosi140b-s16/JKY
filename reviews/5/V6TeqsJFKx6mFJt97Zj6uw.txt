Poblano's makes me happy.  

Some highlights: 

1. Really good and fresh food. 

2. Extremely clean: Both the store and the kitchen.  (Its an open kitchen.)

3. They are open late: Now they are only open to 10.  (An hour later than the average phx place.)  But they say that after their grand opening the store will be open till midnight and the drive-through will be open 24 hours. 

4. They are in my hood.  (Yes, you should care that they are in my hood!)

These last two points are really important: It means no more eribertos or pizza hut for me, when I am searching for food at 11pm.  Finally a good food option! 

I really hope they make it.  Once they begin their late night hours, I'll be there every night...
