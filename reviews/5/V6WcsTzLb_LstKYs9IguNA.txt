I work Nearby this chipotle so it's easy for me and coworkers to stop by on our lunches. I go here so often the workers know me I chat with them and make jokes as they prepare my food they are quick and friendly every time but then again I keep things simple and don't ask for outrageous orders like I've seen some other people do like come on.
