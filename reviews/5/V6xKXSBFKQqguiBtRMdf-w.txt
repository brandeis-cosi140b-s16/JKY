So, freaking amazing! My fiancee and I eat here frequently because the quality and value of the food is top notch. I will say that of every thing that I have tried, I did not care for the seasoned ground beef tacos. My personal favorite item is the 3 cheese queso burrito. Eat early if you are going to get burritos because they are huge and will fill you up for the rest of the day!
