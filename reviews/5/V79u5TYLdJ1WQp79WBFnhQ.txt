Place is great.. Definitely not a place to take a serious date.  I enjoyed eating and the small dining area made it interesting.  My wife and I chowed down on everything.  The guacamole and chips were good and the numerous other items we had were great.  Make sure you go hungry because you will want to try most of the menu.  

The staff made some great recommendations and everyone were friendly and hospitable.
