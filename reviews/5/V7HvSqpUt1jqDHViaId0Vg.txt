The pork tacos here are amazing.  Generous size with crema, guacamole, pickled onions, and cheese.  The tortillas melt in your mouth.  Yum!

The cupcakes are also terrific.  I had a banana bread cupcake with peanut honey frosting.  So good.  I can't wait to come back and try more cupcakes and the signature sloppi jo dish.

I don't swing that way, but I have to admit that the Sloppi Jos crew is definitely easier on the eyes than the other food truck crews, save Snow Ono.  I really dig this new trend of woman-owned food trucks and I hope it continues!
