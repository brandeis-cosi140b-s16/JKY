If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This place has the best wait staff and the food is awesome. Having moved from Texas we were looking for some authentic Mexican food, and we definitely found it here. The atmosphere is nice as well; it's very laid back plus they have a live singer. What more could you ask for? All around it was an great experience that I will be doing again and again. This place made me miss home.
