Great tacos. From now on when I  am in Las Vegas on a food bender, this is the first stop. 

The El pastor was amazing, juicy and plentiful. But it was all good. Full accompaniments of salsa and what not.

These guys work hard. Constant line of customers. So you know the food is fresh. 

Some of the best street tacos ever!
