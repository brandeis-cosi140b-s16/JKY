Mexicasa is a delight to a neighborhood city with no other evidence of mexican within 10 miles. Nonetheless, this place will stand anywhere even in Texas and California full of mexican delights.  They have a great Mariscos menus full of Ceviche and Seafood enchiladas.   The traditional menus are good as well.  My only issue if it is a bias issue is they only have guy waiters no waitresses.
