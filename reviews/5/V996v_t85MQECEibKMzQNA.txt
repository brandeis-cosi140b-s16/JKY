So I have gone a couple of more times to this restaurant and I am really impressed. Their service is consistent; they are quick, knowledgeable and supper friendly. I've tried their fish tacos and ordered their specials and every dish that I've had was delicious. Next time you go try their Queso Gringo (cheese dip) with jalapenos and Tortilla soup. Ohh and by the way they still have great drinks!
