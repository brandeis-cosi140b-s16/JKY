This is one of the few places I miss in Phoenix. We used to get take-out here all the time. The food is your typical Mexican food, but it is much better than a Filibertos or some similar place. Their chimichangas are great and they have one special food which is spectacular: baby banditos. They are basically mini chimichangas, about 3-4" long and 1" wide with a sort of cheesy mix inside. If you happen to make a trip there, make sure you order these or you are worthy of a beating that would make the most extreme of masochists run in fear. The baby banditos come with a "jalapeno mix" which is a necessity. If you get a large order of banditos, make sure you get at least two of the jalapeno mixes. One is not enough. The banditos are also excellent cold and microwaved. Hell, they might be better microwaved than they are when you originally get them. It just doesn't get better.

There's about 6 wooden tables inside. Each one has a bottle of Cholula sauce. The staff is friendly and the place is clean enough, but really, this place is best for takeout.

Above average chimichanga with the best snack/mini food ever? I'm sold. Five stars. Come to Tempe, please.
