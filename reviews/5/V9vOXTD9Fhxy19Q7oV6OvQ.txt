A legit hole-in-the-wall mexican restaurant! It ain't pretty but don't let the deter you! I moved to Arizona because of this place! I take everyone here. Their salsa bar is authentic. The al pastor burritos, breakfast burritos, and tacos kick ass! Thats all I ever get because they have the best al pastor I've ever had, but everyone else enjoys their food thoroughly as well. $3.99 for a burrito, eat half and eat the rest later. I hate left overs and I swear that their burrito is awesome and might even be better reheated in the microwave. WTF! Try them and foodgasm.
