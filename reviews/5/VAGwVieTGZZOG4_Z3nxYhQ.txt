The food and service were fantastic.   We used the tqueria service for my birthday party and it couldn't have been better.  Oscar was our server and he was a real trooper.  A large storm rolled in that night and he had to move the cart and set up into the garage (which was very hot) and he did not complain once.  I felt bad for him but he just kept on serving some of the best tacos we had ever had.

It was so much fun that several friends have mentioned that they will likel have one at thier next party.  One of the guests in from LA was so impressed that he has ordered one for his daughters 2nd birthday next month in LA.  

Hector and Olivia couln' t have been nicer.  The selection of meats is so good you hate to limit the choices to just 4.  I would definately use them again.  The service and food were both exceptional.
