Loved everything about it!!! Tacos and hot dogs were great! Hubby and I were both FULL and wanted to order more! (We only didn't because we didn't want to ruin it by making ourselves sick and we only live about 15 minutes away) So, we will be back! 

Hubby has traveled all over the country and LOVES hot dogs. He says "this is the best hot dog ever!" 

I know we will be back often and it's the perfect place to eat after 2nd Friday art walk in mesa! :)
