This location took over the terrible failure that used to be Amigo's Tacos, and I must say, what an improvement! The food is always made fresh when I order it. I usually visit during the 7-9pm time frame, which is a plus that they don't serve you something that's been sitting there all day. Carne Asada Fries are delicious. Reminds me of the Mexican food joints in East Los Angeles. Oh, I almost forgot to mention... these guys do know English, which is always a plus when asking questions with words other than those on the menu.
