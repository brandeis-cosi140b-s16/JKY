I absolutely love this place! I reside in the area and what we needed was some good Mexican food. Well, it is here and it is good! Prices are very very fair, the food's quality is super, customer service is outstanding, salsa is delicious; basically everything is great and I have no complaints. I am suspicious of other reviewers complaints, because I can't see one thing wrong with Salsa Blanca. Everything I have ate here is made to order, within viewing. The owner and his wife are always there, so if there was an issue, I am sure they would remake the food in question or fix the situation. Overall, this place is delicious and authentic. It's better then the local BIG Mexican food restaurants like Macayo's and Garcias, even better then Top Shelf which was our only area choice since Ninfa's went under. I will be a repeat customer.
