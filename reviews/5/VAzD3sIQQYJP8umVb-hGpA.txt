Finally a real Mexican restaurant with real Mexican food and real Mexican ingredients! !!  My family and I moved to Pittsburgh 4yrs ago from California. We hadn't had a real Mexican meal with authentic ingredients and atmosphere. We felt at home!   This is the ONLY real Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh! !   And we'v been to all of them.
