Thank God - actual street tacos here in Pittsburgh!  A friend caught this place on Yelp and got me and an officemate here for lunch.  What a great find.

I have been longing for street tacos since a couple of trips to Cancun and then finding a taco stand in Michigan of all places that did an amazing job with them.  Here, they are about $2.50 each and a choice of shredded beef, carne asada, shredded chicken, potato and chorizo.  I think I may have missed an option or two but they are perfect.

Just the right amount of meat, on two freshly made corn tortillas with a delicious pico de gallo and two hot sauces on the side with a slice of lime - you are set.  

I got 3 street tacos (shredded beef, carne asade and shredded chicken) and a fountain drink for a little under $10.  Just the right amount of food and it was fast.

There are just a handful of seats and a lunch counter that runs all along the wall.  If you expect to eat in, get there before noon like we did.  Otherwise, not sure how the tacos will make the trip back to your home or office.

The others with me went with the burrito of shredded chicken and the extra $1 for guacamole.  They enjoyed their selection but both were a little disappointed with the light spread of guac on their burrito.  Other than that, this place was a crowdpleaser!

Maybe I'll branch out and try some of the other offerings.  But maybe not for a while until I get tired of their street tacos - this has been a long time coming to see a craving being satiated!
