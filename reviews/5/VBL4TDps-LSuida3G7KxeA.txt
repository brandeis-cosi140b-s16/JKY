I visited the little red food truck that never moves to try the rest of the menu and was very sad to find out they had just run out of chicken. SOL I thought, until the owner remembered that the same thing happened to me last time I showed up so he butchered a fresh batch of chicken special just for me. You just don't find that kind of service and that's why I needed to up my review to 5 stars.

The chicken taco was well worth the wait and the flavors were really on point. The egg and tofu had a really interesting texture that was improved by the crispy tortilla strings on top. Add in the really interesting flavor and spice of the fries and I was in heaven. My food coma was complete with the sweet dough for dessert which gets better after every sugary bite. Keep up the good food, great service, and the rest will fall into place!
