This place is by far my favorite spot in tempe . Proudly, I eat here 3-4 times a week. Carne Asada is amaZing . It literally feels like home here . The lady at the front is always nice. And the cook in the back always has a smile and says hello to me every time . California burrito, breakfast burrito, and many other choices are my favorite . I love this place!
