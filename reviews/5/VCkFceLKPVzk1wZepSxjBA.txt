OMG this is my favorite place to eat!!
staff are very friendly and make food exactly as you request. Unlimited queso and guac (what could be better?) and the ingredients are very fresh. I have to eat there every 3 day otherwise I feel my life goes wrong. Never went to Chipotle again after eating at this place! 
Perfection! Keep it plz!
