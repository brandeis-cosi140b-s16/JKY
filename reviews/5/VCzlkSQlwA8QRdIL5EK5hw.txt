So much fun!  The servers were so friendly and nice...which is always great!  The food was good, with huge portions...not the greatest Mexican food, but pretty good.  They serve really fresh chips, with 2 types of salsa and beans.  They definitely won points with us that way...in addition to the bottomless margaritas!  If you spend $12, you get unlimited refills on the $5 margaritas...what an excellent deal.  If I wasn't so full of Mexican good food I would have had more than just 2 margartitas.  

A little gem tucked in Sam's Town.
