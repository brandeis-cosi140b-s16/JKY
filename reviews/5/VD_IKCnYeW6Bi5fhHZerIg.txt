A+ for effort. I love the view and the service has always been wonderful. The food is good. I think the food is very good and honestly I've had better Mexican food but they get 5 stars bc they are wonderful for large parties as well as a cozy environment for a simple date night.  You can't go wrong suggesting this for dinner!  I love good service!
