I just have to say that I've been here three times since my first post and I can comfortably say that this is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. 

Guac, margs, and aesthetic...top notch when compared to the rest of what the city has to offer. 

(but I am always up for suggestions on places that could rival my love for Barrio!)
