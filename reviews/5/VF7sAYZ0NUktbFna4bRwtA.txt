I always choose to drive past the ghetto TB at 4402 W Glendale in Glendale to eat at the nicer location at 35th and Glendale Ave in Phoenix. It's right next to QT. This location deserves 5 stars just on customer service alone!!! Someone I met that used to work at both locations agreed with me that things are run a lot differently in Glendale than they are in Phoenix.
