Fast, fresh, always reliable. I had a salsarita's on my college campus so maybe I am biased. Maybe it invokes a little bit of nostalgia in me. 
I am a BIG mexican food fan and I enjoy this place. The menu and ordering style is similar to chipotle. But correct me if I'm wrong, I think Salsarita's was around before chipotle. 
Anyway, the food is always fresh and tasty. This location was very fast and efficient at lunch rush. I saw that they were changing out some trays of food and keeping things fresh. Stop by if you're having a Mexican food craving at the airport.
