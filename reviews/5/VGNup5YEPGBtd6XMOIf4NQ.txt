I was not very impressed by the looks of this non-descript Arcadia restaurant located in a strip mall. However, on the inside its modern, bright and inviting with excellent service and very very good modern Mexican food. The chips are perfection... Also try the heavenly habanero-raspberry margarita! - you're welcome!!!
