Tried the KISS Gene Simmons inspired "All Hell's Breakin' Loose" Sizzling Molcajete last night. It that comes with 2 Grilled Shrimp, Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, pepper's & onions, guacamole over rice, ancho-tomato broth and radish. Probably the best dish I have ever had here.  The dish is only $24 and it easily serves 2 people. The presentation is just wow when it comes in. The Molcajete made from volcanic rock stays sizzling hot throughout the entire meal. I hope this will stay on the menu because I plan to come back and try it again. Service was as always fast, polite and great as usual. Gotta love this place.
