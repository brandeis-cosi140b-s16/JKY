they have the best breakfast burritos.  they call em "burro chicos".  $1.99 I cannot get enough. tortillas made fresh there.  also you get chips and salsa.  their red salsa is the best in the state.  I wish they bottled and sold it.  

call in your oder because it gets packed fast.  also get a large lemonade it tastes great and the ice they use is like sonics.  

the service is also friendly and nice.  they keep that place clean.
