I love El Taco Fresco. I love that it's attached to a great bar, I love that it's some of the best Mexican food I've ever had (and yes, I've been to Mexico), and I love that it's super cheap and always open. 

My boyfriend and I go to Taco Fresco and Money Plays a lot. We always order at the counter and sit in the bar. Our food is brought to the bar within 10 minutes, usually less. The food is excellent; we usually go for tacos.

The chicken taco is great because the tortilla is fried. It's greasy, but delicious. The carne asada is a no-brainer. Just order one. I think it's actually the cheapest taco on the menu, which makes no sense, but I'm not complaining. My favorite, carnitas, has to be done right. This place does it right! I'm pretty sure the meat is boiled, then shredded, then deep fried or maybe fried on a flat top in lots of oil. Anyway, it's fantastic, but be prepared to have pork breath for the night. 

You have to try the rolled tacos. They're taquitos stuffed with shredded beef, topped with cheese, and served with guac and sour cream. They're a given anytime I go to Taco Fresco. 

I don't eat the American food they offer because I love the Mexican stuff so much, but I did have a friend say that their burger was great, and I tried a french fry- not bad.

They do deliver, but I've never actually taken them up on that, because it's such a fun place to go to eat and drink. If you need dinner and some drinks in a casual setting, check out Taco Fresco and Money Plays.
