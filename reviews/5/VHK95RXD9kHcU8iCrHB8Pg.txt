Stopped in at La Canasta for dinner on Tuesday night, the food was excellent and our waitress Stephanie was fabulous. Stephanie was working the hostess station and waiting on tables all while checking on us regularly. 

I had the carne asada combo, it was flavorful with the most authentic rice and beans I've ever had at a restaurant. My husband had the machaca combo which was equally delicious. 

Great place for Mexican food, I would highly recommend it.
