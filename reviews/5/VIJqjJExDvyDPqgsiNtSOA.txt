Obviously there are over a 100 different places that have burgers but there are more than a 100 reasons why "THE STAND" has the BEST!! It is true, I have never had their burger complete, I order the lettuce wrap with patties, cheese, pickles, and onions..ONLY, no seasoning! And it is the best I have had.. I have knowingly had celiac since 2008 and always have had lettuce wrap cheese burgers, so believe me when I say getting the lettuce wrap, especially with no seasoning, no sauce... You really get to see the quality of the foundation of the burger.. The pattie is juicy always cooked to perfection, the cheese is melted over it as if it was the sauce itself, the lettuce is always fresh, and so is the pickles and yummy caramelized onions.. As for the FRECH FRIES  Exceptional, no other explanation necessary!!! BASICALLY, "THE STAND" is 100X BETTER than "In n Out" "5 Guys" and obviously all the drive thrus and many restaurants I have been to.. SIMPLY A MUST TRY
