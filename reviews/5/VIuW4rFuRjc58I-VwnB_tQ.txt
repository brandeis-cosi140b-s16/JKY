Me and my boyfriend live less than 5 minutes away from here and love it when we want to go. Plus it's probably the best tacos we've ever had. We learned that calling ahead is a lot easier because it takes 15-20 minutes for them to cook your order sometimes, which is fine with us since they make everything fresh! And you can definitely taste the freshness in all of their food, we've eaten here over 10 times now and it never disappoints. My boyfriend usually goes for the chicken tacos or the carne asada burrito and I usually go for the vegan tacos or vegan nachos. My fav tacos are the crispy avocado and potato taco. I also had their vegan tamale for the first time recently and all I can say is WOW. It's a must try (even my boyfriend loved it). I'm not a big fan of pinto beans (even though theirs are actually very good) so I sub them with the black beans and they are literally the best I've ever had! Also, the ladies behind the counter are so sweet every time we get our order and give the place such a great atmosphere!
