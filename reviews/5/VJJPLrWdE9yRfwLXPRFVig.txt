So I stopped here on a whim because I had a craving for some Mexican food and the Federicos I tried to go to is permanently closed. I am not in the least bit disappointed and it was probably a blessing in disguise. I only had the rolled tacos combo. You tell a lot about a place by the simple stuff and these definitely some of the best I've had. 

The salsa deserves it's own paragraph because of it's quality. I unwittingly globbed a bunch on my rolled taco expecting it to be tame to mild... Nope. Its fuego like the bottle says, and it's delicious as hell. After my sinuses cleared and my eyes stopped watering I got a chance to notice the awesome subtle smokey taste. The consistency is good too--not too runny, not too chunky like pico de gallo. Absolutely perfect.

The rolled tacos were nicely prepared. Not over fried with hard, dehydrated bits hanging out. They weren't greasy all and the garnishes including some awesome guacamole were pretty darn fresh. 

The rice was good. Not as savory as some of the other places I've been too but not under flavored either. The refried beans included were pretty awesome too, creamy but firm enough you could actually eat them with a utensil. 

Definitely will be returning! The gentleman that took my order was a hoot too. He explained to me all the options for different dishes and they were more than happy to customize orders to your liking. Maybe I can convince the office to cater from this place.
