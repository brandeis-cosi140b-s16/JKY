I met my long time friend Tracy, last Friday, at Q-doba for lunch.  It was her first time.  She was so impressed!  I've been telling her for months about how GREAT this place is!  She loved all the extra's you get for free, like all the queso sauces, and guacamole you want!  The cool coke machine with more than 100 flavors is a bonus!  Nice people, good food, good value!
