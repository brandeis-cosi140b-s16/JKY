Wow this place is amazing!! I went out to eat here last night with my girlfriend and the ambiance was fantastic! We started with the crab bread pudding which was highly recommended by the manager there Brock! Boy was he right it was melt in your mouth good!! then for dinner I had the Sea Bass and my girlfriend had the Swordfish! The Sea Bass was cooked so perfectly and the sauce they put on the dish is amazing! Best fish meal I have ever had! My girlfriend also ranted and raved about how delicious hers was as well! After we ate our dinner Brock came back over and asked how everything was and recommended that for dessert we try the un beet lievable parfait. For as much as I don't like beets I was so impressed with how good that was too!! I will definitely be coming back here!!
