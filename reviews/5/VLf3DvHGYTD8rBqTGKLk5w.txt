We love Roberto's!  The food is always excellent and the families that own it are wonderful.  Maria makes the best food and everything is made to order.  The ingredients are always fresh and the flavors are authentic.  We always keep a bottle of their homemade salsa in the fridge.  Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives was right when they featured Roberto's on their show and the food never disappoints.  

Don't count them out for breakfast either, their breakfast burritos are the best!
