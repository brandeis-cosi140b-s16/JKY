Don't get all the negative reviews.  The only bad thing you can say about the place is that it can be a little slow.   I go about once a month with the same group of guys from the office and everyone loves it.   I often go with a couple buddies, no complaints.

Its not cheap, but the ingredients are not the borderline stuff you get at the chain places.
