Finding delicious, traditional, Mexican food in Henderson and south Vegas is a chore to say the least. This place solves that problem. The girlfriend and I were looking for a traditional Mexican restaurant that served breakfast before 11am. This came up on Yelp and we decided to go.

We both ordered the Chilaquiles with steak and, my god, was it fantastic. The spice level was perfect (not too white, but it also won't take the enamel off of your teeth), the steak was tender and grilled exactly the way it should have been. Their coffee was strong and fresh, and the chilaquiles was blended like an artist has done it. The tortilla chips in the meal weren't too soggy, but they weren't to dry either, there was plenty of cheese, the egg was exactly as we ordered it (over easy) and the grilled onion finished off the deliciousness excellently.

The service was also friendly and fast. Based on this one experience we will definitely be back for many more meals here. This might just be my favorite Mexican restaurant on this side of town.
