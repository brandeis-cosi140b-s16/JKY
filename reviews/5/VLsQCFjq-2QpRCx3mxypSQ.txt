The best!!  Whats up with all the haters? This place is the best. I cant believe there are chumps across the parking lot throwing their money away at el pollo loco, when this gem is here. 

I got the adobaba and sirloin taco plate. So good and only 5 bucks!! Their horchata is amazing.  Salsa bar is awesome. Free chip refills. Great rice and beans. This has to be one of the best mexican restaurants in Mesa. 

The atmosphere is not 5 star, but who cares, this is about good authentic mexican food. I will be back again...and again.... and again....
