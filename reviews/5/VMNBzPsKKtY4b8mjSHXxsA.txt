I'm a believer. A nice late lunch on Sunday on a not yet hot day. Alcohol? check. Cheese fundido? Check. Camarones? No, the waitress explained to my spanish speaking companion that he should wait until he hit a real mariscos place. Check for honesty. She tried to get us to order the parilla, but I always have bad luck with smoke in my eyes. I think I got the carne asada.

And the place was full of Mexican families. It's in the hood so whiteys beware! N.B. If you don't act white they bring you the good salsa. And the fundido like many artery clogging choices, is the authentic preparation. Go back to Baja Fresh you chain loving haters.
