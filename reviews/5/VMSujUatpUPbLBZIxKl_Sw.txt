We chose to visit this place while visiting Las Vegas due to the positive Yelp reviews, and it didn't disappoint.  The chips were tasty, almost to the point of being addicting.  I had the steak lettuce wraps, which tasted amazing.  The steak was well flavored, tender and had absolutely no gristle.  The rice was perfectly cooked and buttery.  The service was great, and everyone was very friendly. The prices were fantastic, especially compared to everything on the strip. I'll be sure to stop by again the next time I'm in town!
