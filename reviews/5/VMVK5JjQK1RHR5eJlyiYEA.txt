Sure, it's a chain.  But I thought it was very good!  We were promptly seated, our waiter checked on us several times, and the manager was even on top of things and cleared the plates the minute we were finished.

The food came out within about 10 minutes, and it was really good.  I had the shredded beef chimichanga with a side of refried beans.  The meat was juicy, slightly spicy and the chimi was fried just right.

Overall, I'd be back!
