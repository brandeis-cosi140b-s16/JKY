this is one of those places that you can not eat at every day but it is an amazing morning after a long night meal. I moved from Northern Cali so our go to heart stopper was Carolinas. So when I moved into this neighborhood and saw that we had a Roberto's it was a must try. I tried the Carne Asada burrito the first time and was happy with the choice. We have also tried out the super nachos, taco's, and carne asada fries. This place is a must if you are in need of a hangover or savere hunger pain reliever.
