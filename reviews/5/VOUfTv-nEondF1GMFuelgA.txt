We got carne asada tacos on yellow corn tortillas and they were delicious! Tacos come with meat and cheese and then you add your own lime, cabbage, pico and choice of salsa. I was looking forward to a good street taco while in AZ and I found it! We also ordered the horchata and it was sweet and delicious. My tummy is happy!
