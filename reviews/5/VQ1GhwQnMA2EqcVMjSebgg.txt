Dinner only. Ask for Angel. This is so cool they even have a tequila sommelier. Began with a recommended tequila flight and spicy crab guacamole. Amazing. Probably the best guac we have ever experienced. I had the filet. Wow. Had to finsh with coconut flan cake.  This was a dining experience we need to repeat.
