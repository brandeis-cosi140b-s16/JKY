I stayed at the Graduate Hotel on a recent business trip and had no car, so I went to Tapacubo for drinks after my workday. I wasn't thrilled about not having any options, but I was really pleasantly surprised by this place! The atmosphere was great; it's open to the outside and has combinations of tables and high-tops/bar seats. The pool is right next door so you get a little of that chlorine-summertime smell. They have a decent menu, although I only had chips and salsa/guac, so I can't really comment on the food. The servers were super attentive and even let me charge my phone in the bar area. Justin, the bar manager, is really friendly and knows his drinks! Definitely recommend this place, even if you're not staying in the hotel.
