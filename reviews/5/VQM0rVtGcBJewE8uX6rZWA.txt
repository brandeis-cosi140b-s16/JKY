Juan's is a Phoenix staple in my opinion. I moved here from the Northwest about 3 years ago and I've tried just about every Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix downtown area. Juan's is defiantly up there with the best of them, the burritos are awesome and filling, the carne asada is amazing and the tacos are WHOA! I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for a large, Delicious meal not looking to spend a lot of money (did I mention they were cheap?!?)
