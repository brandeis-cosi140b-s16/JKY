To be honest... I have no idea what these low reviewers got when they came here because I received 5-star all around. After I left I actually felt bad for not leaving more of a tip - it was that good.

I didn't expect much but the food came out lightning fast and it was very good. The service was amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice-cream (that the kid didn't eat) back in the freezer while we ate.
