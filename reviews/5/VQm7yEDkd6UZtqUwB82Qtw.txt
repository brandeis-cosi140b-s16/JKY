We will definitely be back!! The food was sooooo good, even my picky eaters left satisfied!! I had the Carne Asada Nachos (with extra Guac thanks to my daughters not liking it) & they were fantastic!! This will be a new fave for us.

The girl at the counter who took order was very friendly, our food came out in under 10 mins and everything was fresh... ESPECIALLY the tortilla chips which were piping hot & crunchy. No complaints from a tough critic!!
