I'm a big fan of Mexican cuisine and La Cosina (IMHO) ranks up there with the best. The food is really good, authentic-tasting Mexican dishes, freshly made chips and salsa served upon seating paired with a fast and friendly service. Whenever there's a craving for tostadas, we make sure to make the trek despite the location being out-of-the-way from where I live. My faves include their excellent tostadas in both succulent shrimp (camaron) and tangy fish ceviche generously piled high on a seemingly always-crispy tostada and then topped off with fresh slices of avocados (this always gets my vote). They also serve a wide variety of dishes such as carnitas, chimichangas, enchiladas, menudo and one of the best tasting guacamoles I've ever had the pleasure of devouring!
