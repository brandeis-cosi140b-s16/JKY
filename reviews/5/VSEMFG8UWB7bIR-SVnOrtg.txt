Exceptional family run restaurant with out of this world service, excellent taste and quality, good drinks, LARGE menu selection! The shrimp was really tasty and fresh, table side guacamole is a must, chips are fresh and you get warm bean dip work the chips and salsa. They have a HOR sauce that has really good flavor with a bite at the end. Pride per plate was good for the amount of food too get! 

A MUST try for sure!!!!
