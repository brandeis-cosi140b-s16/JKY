We've gotten take-out from this place a number of times and it is definitely our number 1 choice for pizza in Madison. My order is always ready 10-20 minutes from when I call and the staff who check me out have always been friendly. The only reason, at this point, that I would go to another pizza place is if Salvator's was closed.  We've ordered the Tomato Pie and a number of the specialty pizzas including the Carbonara, Fig and Bacon, and Forza.  I have never been disappointed with a pizza here.  The ingredients are all high quality and fresh and many of them are locally sourced.  While the price tag might seem a little high for a pizza, it is well worth it in my opinion as the quality outshines most, if not all, other pizza places in Madison that I have tried.
