yumm. if youre in vegas visiting, this place is a good place to go for lunch or dinner if youre not feeling like anotherrr buffet. Good service, great food, prices are reasonable! where else can you get guacamole for just 3$!? (not in california) and everything is home made! their tortillas and beans, omggg so GOOD!
