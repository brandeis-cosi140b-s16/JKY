Great family restaurant!

Great food and holy horchata! Love the tacos and enchiladas. Burritos ain't bad either.

The gems of this place are the pastries and the horchata. Seriously. Save some room for dessert. And they have the best horchata in town. It even beats out Joyride Tacos, hands down! No contest...

They're not open for dinner so aim to get there before they close! Prices are a tad more than some places. About $10-11 a person, but we still love to go.
