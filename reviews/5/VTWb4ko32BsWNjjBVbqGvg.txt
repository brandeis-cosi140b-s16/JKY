This store is ontop of their work! I go to this location often and have not had a bad experience. They're staff is always paying attention and checkout is quick. The drink/napkin/utensil station has always been clean and they're even sure to keep the tables clean when people get up and leave.  The parking lot is always a bit crazy, but you can expect that with other neighboring food places.
