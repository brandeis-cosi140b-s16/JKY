I've ordered delivery from this place, and I've also been inside the restaurant a few times and have met with the owner. They get 5 stars right off the bat for the simple fact that they deliver Mexican food to my house. That's a rarity in this town in and of itself, but the fact that the food was good was a bonus. 

People get really picky about their Mexican food here - as they should. Arizona is lousy with Mexican food restaurants. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's the best I've ever had (I've had a lot of Mexican food from a lot of different places), but I will say that it's delicious and consistent. I mean, some of the best places to go get authentic Mexican food in the Valley are dirty little hole in the wall joints that you might be scared to go into. This place is clean and nice and quite a bit more upscale than that. 

I wouldn't say the food here is inauthentic either. It's plenty authentic... that word means different things to different people anyway. Some think it means a similar experience to when they visited Rocky Point, and others will cite examples from when they visited Oaxaca or Cabo or Mazatlan, and yet others will compare your favorite place to a chain they like. Who knows. Good food is good food. 

My experiences with the staff, management, and owner have been outstanding as well, and I will probably be eating here a lot.
