You know what Mexican food joints really lack in these days? Hot sauce. Habanero's, however, definitely does not! This hot sauce is bomb as fekk. Got a steak n egg burrito. Naturally. Steak is fantastic and cooked fully, nice presentation, and served right to your table. Cooked quickly too. 

Great atmosphere.. college football and basketball on tv, full bar, plenty of seeing, well kept.. there's no wonder why Habanero's is still open out here, nearby to so many bars and clubs! 

Definitely recommended. Try the habanero sauce.. spicy yet sweet and delicious!
