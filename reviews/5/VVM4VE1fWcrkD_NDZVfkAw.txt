I came in around 8:30 before closing and they insisted I stay though they were cleaning up.  Had a huge seafood plate that was very fresh.  Wasn't sure what it was called but pointed at the picture.  Pretty good value.  The ladies were nice, maybe not fancy restaurant professional but easy to waive down as they moved around shutting down.
