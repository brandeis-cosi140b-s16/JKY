Great service, friendly staff and excellent food as always !!! Beef enchilada is my favorite,
Vuelve a la vida cocktail with shrimp, oyster, octopus and abalone is the best! Im glad they opened this location near Summerlin because the other one is a little too far for us. 
Often they have a good deal on Groupon.
