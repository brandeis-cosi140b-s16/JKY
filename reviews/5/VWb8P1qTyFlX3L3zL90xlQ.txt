I came here with my friend since she was on a budget and we needed a place to eat, she told me this place is super delicious, glad that I went with her, cuz now this place is definitely on my go-to list!

So far, I have only tried the fusion tacos, in both beef and chicken, I personally like the beef better just because I love bulgogi xD The corn tortillas are small, but with alot of fillings. When I first looked at it, I was like, "How am I supposed to eat this without being messy?", but my friend was like, "You just can't be afraid to get messy." And yeah, it gets messy, but once you take a bite, it's worth the mess :p

Also, I tried the bulgogi fries, the portion is huge, good enough to share with your friend if you guys are not eating anything else, and the fries... very very very good. I love these kind of fries that have toppings on top, with all the cheese, bulgogi, kimchi, jalapenos, and other ingredients, this fries is a little spicy and a little sweet, just amazing!

I also tried the Bulgogi Tostado, but I had it when I was like full already after the 2 tacos and a little bit of fries, so I don't remember much from it, and I didn't have much of this dish. All I remember was that the rice was crispy, but a little hard. If I have another chance, I might get this again when I'm not that full.

I took another friend there, and she ordered the bulgogi burrito, she told me it was good, and after that, she drove all the way down there to get that burrito again, must be really good :)

As for the service, some people complained that the lady was unattentive, but please cut her some slack. That place is packed and she's the only one that's waitressing! When I was there and it was busy, you can tell she tried her best to keep everyone satisfied. I actually thought she is a really good waitress, nice and attentive.
