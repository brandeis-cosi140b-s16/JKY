I have came here about 5 times now. I've experienced this sober and not sober. At first I thought they were so good because I was drunk and anything is delicious when drunk. But ohhhhhh was I wrong. I wanted to try these before I got intoxicated and they were probably even better... I do prefer the chicken over the steak ones because they have more flavor in them. Also throw some of that guacamole sauce... These tacos change Mexican food for you. Nothing touches how good these are and I've had a a lot of Mexican food in my lifetime. Fresh, hot, and fast! The customer service is also amazing for how busy they are at certain parts of the night. One time I came and they were closing down and they gave us two free taco cards for each of us. So 6 free total! That's amazing if you ask me! All I can say is if you're around this area and you are intoxicated or not you should try this amazing place.
