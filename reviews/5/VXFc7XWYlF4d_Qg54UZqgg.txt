I was born in Culiacan and both of my parents are from there as well. So, it's safe say I know what good Mexican food is especially from this region. My favorite food made by my Mom are "Gorditas" they are very similar to "Sopes" for those that are more familiar with those. The only problem is that they're super time consuming so my Mom doesn't make them too often. So when I found out about this place I was excited. They taste a lot like my Mom so I kept coming. 

I invited my co-worker to have lunch there and the lady that took our order noticed we were kind of in a hurry. She asked us if we had a place to be and once we told her we had to go back to work she told us that it would be better if next time we called her ahead of time so she could start cooking them before we got there so we wouldn't have to be in such a rush. Now that is customer service ! I was so happy when she told me that. 

This place is extremely inexpensive as well we had six gorditas and two glass sodas total and we only paid twelve dollars. If we would of gone to the mexican place behind our work we would of easily paid at least twenty dollars for less food. Just the glass coke there is three dollars. So we won't mind driving a little further for better food and prices.
