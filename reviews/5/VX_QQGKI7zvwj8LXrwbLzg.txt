Craving Mexican food at the time but then changed my mind driving to the taqueria. Decided to go to my favorite Chinese restaurant (Oasis A.K. ) because they cook cashew chicken and lo mein the way I like it. Needed drinks for dinner went to the Walgreens on Buffalo and Flamingo. Needed to make a U-turn to get to the Chinese place so I drive through the little strip mall and seen KoMex Fusion. Wonder what it was all about and Yelped it. Seen good reviews on it and decided to give it a try. Now I don't know about Devine intervention but this is it. First I was craving Mexican but then decided on Chinese. I know it wasn't Korean food but something led me to this place. First time here so looked over the menu. I "Fused" what I like at Oasis A.K. chicken and lo mein. Ordered the Chow Fettuccine w/chicken. Thank you for whom ever guided me to this place. I will be coming to this place a 2nd time to try another item. Most likely the bulgogi tacos or nachos or maybe the rice bowl. Everything looks good. Except the Spam items. Don't do Spam not even when it's with email. Huge portions also! Well worth the$$$ though on yelp it's only one $. Which means good food at a cheap price.
