The "Sloppi Jo", breakfast burrito, pork tacos, red burger(special), and the sopapillas are items offered by this delicious provocative yellow truck and what I have devoured so far. From what I know everything except the sopapillas have an awesome kick added. The spice is not too much, but not too weak either, and it lingers in my mouth craving for more. 

The "Sloppi Jo" is a twist on the traditional sloppy joe sandwich where everything is inside out, has a tortilla instead of a bun, uses slow roasted pork in a red chile sauce that I could just eat pounds of while watching tv, and a over easy egg, ohhhh yeah! I don't miss the traditional sloppy jo.. at all, leave this one for the adults and let the elementary kids have the messy ground meat in between two buns. 

Jo is also very nice, she keeps it personal with her customers (she even hugged me once), and makes you feel like you guys already know each other. I also like the supplies table, she has the forks, spoons, knifes, and some nice quality napkins (nice napkins is a star in my book haha) all stocked up and ready for you.  

Sometimes when I watch the food network or read some reviews I notice they really exaggerate how GREAT the food or the restaurant is. Don't you hate it when you're disappointed by your fellow foodies? Fortunately you won't be let down by Sloppi Jo's Roving Eatery truck of awesomeness. They're always working hard at some different time of the day (1130-3PM and something like 12-3am) giving you the opportunity to catch them.

P.S. I was at Sloppi Jo's maybe two hours ago and now I'm craving it.
