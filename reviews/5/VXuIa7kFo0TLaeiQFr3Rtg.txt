I LOVE El Sol!!  My family and I have been going here for breakfast and lunch for 4 years.  All of their food is absolutely delicious!  Their baked goods are wonderful and their entrees are the BEST!  I am from Texas and it has been such a challenge to find a Mexican restaurant whose food is as good as something we can get in Texas.  We found that with El Sol!  Their flour tortillas are homemade, as is all of their food.  The owners and staff are great and friendly and remember us every time we come in.  You must try this great restaurant!  You will not be sorry!! My only complaint is that they aren't open all the time!! :)
