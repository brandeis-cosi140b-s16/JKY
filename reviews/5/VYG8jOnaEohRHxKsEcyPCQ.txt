I go out for lunch every Tuesday with my mother in law and we usually eat Mexican food because no one in her house will eat it and its her favorite. Lately its been disappointing between poor customer service, messed up orders and flavorless meals so we were THRILLED after deciding to try Leticia's.  The service was great, the food came out quickly and everything tasted fantastic!

This will be our new regular spot. Try the shrimp ceviche. It's the best I've had in Las Vegas.
