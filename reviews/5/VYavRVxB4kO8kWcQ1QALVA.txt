Glad we found them!! Don't let the exterior of the building fool you. The food is awesome! The entire restaurant is spotless! It is very traditional Mexican, not the bad Mexican food you get In most Mexican restaurants in the Carolina's. The best part is the ice cold beer and the amazing service! Check this place out!
