Wow, hands down the best carnitas I've ever tasted. The carnitas torta comes filled w meat, a side of pickled onions, side of limes and sits on top of a sauce. It's delish! 

What's also amazing is their array of hot sauces they have for your extra condiment pleasure. The waitress brings them to your table, introduces each one and tells u what to expect as far as spice level. We didn't dare try the habanero since the one below that (the one recommended for the torta) was plenty spicy! 

Service is friendly and restaurant is clean! Loved it here. 

We'll definitely be back since my mom lives across the street from this gem!
