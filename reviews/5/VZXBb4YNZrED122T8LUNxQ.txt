After nearly 1 year of driving by this restaurant we decided to try it out. We were presently surprised by the great quality food and affordable bill to top it off!

Was also refreshing to have such good service. Had 4 different employees ask us if we needed anything else (besides the waiter). This included chips, drinks, and utensils.

I would highly recommend this restaurant to couples or families.
