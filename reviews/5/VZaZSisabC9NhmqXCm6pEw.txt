We stopped in for a quick beer before our flight. The bar features a large beer selection at pretty reasonable prices. They were served in red solo cups, which was a little odd, but kind of fun at the same time. We ordered from the counter as the bar was full. The beers came quick and the staff was friendly. We didn't try the food, but it looked good and was reasonably priced. We will definitely be back.
