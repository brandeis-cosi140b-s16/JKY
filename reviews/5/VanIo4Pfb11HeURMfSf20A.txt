Checked this place out since it changed owners, because the last ones were nasty and had roaches everywhere. This place is definitely clean now. As for the food I took it to go, and I gotta say it was really good, got the Windy City fries half Asada, half barbacoa, they were both really good. Also got 3 tacos with tripe and they were also good and cooked perfect. Definitely coming back.
