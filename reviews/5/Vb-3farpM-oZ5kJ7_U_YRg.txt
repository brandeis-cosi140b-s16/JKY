OK this was fun.    We just arrive at the Bolders after a six hour drive.    Dropped off the luggage and found this little gem for lunch. 

The Cadillac margaritas were refreshing with a generous pour of tequila.   We shared and enjoyed the shrimp cevice and the nacho's.   Oh but not just nacho's!   You are properly warned in advance that they are not what one would typically expect.    Corn toritillas and cheese yes.    But add to it olives, black beans and red and green enchilada sauce.   An amazing concoction of flavors!  The cevice was fresh, generous and full of flavor.   

Our server was attentive and as friendly as can be.  

We wish we could box this place up and take it home to California!
