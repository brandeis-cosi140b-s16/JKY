When it comes to the quality of the food, all locations are the same... good. However, not all locations are equal in their level of service or consistency in product. This is by far the best location of the two other nearby. The people are friendly. We eat here often enough that many of the employees know it's and recognize us when we come in. They know what we order and are always pleasant. At most other locations you have to fuss at them to put more than five grains of five and two beans in your bowl, but not here. The only time they get a little stingy is when they are busy, so it is more out of being rushed than anything else. If you're coming for dinner you need to be here slightly before five or after seven. All other times there will be a considerable line.
