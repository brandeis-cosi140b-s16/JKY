My wife and I stopped into Charanda when they first opened some time ago and the Mexican chicken soup I had was not that great.  I decided to give them another try and noticed they had bean soup on the menu, which is another Mexican soup favorite of mine besides chicken soup.  I was very surprised on how good the bean soup was, probably the best I ever had.  Tres Peso's use to offer bean soup, but no longer do and it was the only thing I ever ordered there.  I haven't been back since.  

Anyway, the service was outstanding and has a comfortable setting.  I'm a little surprised by the reviews.  I did mention to the waiter that I was there before and I didn't care too much for their chicken soup. He told me they had changed it for the better.  He also told me they have a sirloin or beef soup now. something I plan to try the next time I'm there.  

I definitely plan to return.
