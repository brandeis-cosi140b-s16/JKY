I ate here a while back and forgot to post my review because usually im too busy drinking...but this food is great.fast service,the meat is cooked just right.I ordered the big ass steak burrito loaded with everything but the kitchen sink and it rocked.They really do know how to make great mexican food.I'm actually contemplating now if I should go grab a burrito quick since I live like a minute away ...:)
