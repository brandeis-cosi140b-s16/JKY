We have frequented this restaurant since 2007. At first it was VERY good.  (Not sure what happened in about 2010/2011 but the food went downhill.  It was always room temp to cool, over salted, inconsistent.  We lost trust in frequenting here and have not been back... until recently.) We noticed they are now closed on Sunday so presumed it was under new management or ownership.  We live in the Villages and decided to give them a go. Well, 3 for 3 visits in the past couple months.   They always & still have good service, good atmosphere, very fair pricing and something for everyone on the menu.  The real test in the end was the food.  We've had the machaca tacos, carne asada burritos, huge side salad when you choose this as a side with your rice.  Food has been consistent, served HOT & was plentiful.  Hopefully they keep up the positive changes.
