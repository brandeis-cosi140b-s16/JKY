Move over, Guadalajara, this place has replaced your spot in my belly/heart. 

First of all, this place has micheladas to die for. Que es eso? Beer with lime juice, chile powder, and salt. If you like bloody Marys and beer, give this a shot. Yumtastic. 

Their handmade tortillas are mad fresh n fluffy, which makes their gorditas and sopes killaaahh. Try a chorizo gordita...RIGHTNOW. 

The service is also friendly, though it can be a bit slow at times. Also be warned that you pay extra for a second helping of chips and salsa, though it's less than $2. 

Go here for dinner, and follow it up with a cocktail at Le Tigre Lounge. Evening of champions.
