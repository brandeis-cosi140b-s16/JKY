I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had never been to this location--just to the now closed one in Mesa--and from my Chicago home I was planning a surprise 80th birthday party for my stepmom.  I talked to Clay, the manager? a manager?, over the phone.  When he found out I was planning long-distance he kindly sent me pictures on my phone of the patio we would be on, and sent me the necessary menu info and pricing--which was extremely reasonable.  No extra private room charge like another Mexican restaurant in the vicinity.  Even said we had an inside backup private room if the weather didn't cooperate.  I crossed my fingers and signed the contract.  Best. Decision. Ever.  For a group of approximately 50, the service was fantastic--thank you, Chris, who was the waiter in charge.  It wasn't a buffet--I went with the abbreviated 6 item menu, making it more difficult for the servers.  Everyone was served promptly, water glasses refilled, drinks refilled.  I can't say enough great things about the experience.  Oh yes--the food was amazing.  I heard a lot of folks, who had never been there, saying they would return.  My stepmom said she couldn't have imagined a more perfect evening.  To everyone at Rancho de Tia Rosa, thanks for making me look like a SUEper hero! :)
