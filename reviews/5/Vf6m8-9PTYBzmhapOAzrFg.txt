This is my favorite place on Mill!!! It's super nice, classy and its the least likely place to get thrown up on. The set up is great, I love how everything is seperated. You can hang out at one of the two bars or two patios, and decently sized dance floor! I really like the watering hole bathrooms! They always play good music! Amazing tequila selection. Definitely a must if you are going to Mill.
