We came here specifically for the Adobada Tacos. My girlfriend has been raving about this place since we started dating because apparently there is one in San Diego and it has the best Tacos in that nation. When we had arrived on a Monday afternoon, it was still packed! At that moment I was pretty excited to try the Adobada tacos because people were lining up for this place on a weekday. 

Finally we had arrived at the counter and had ordered 3 Adobada tacos each person and it did not disappoint! It was by far the best tacos I have eaten. We both pretty much inhaled it in a matter of minutes. The Adobada tacos because the meat was cooked to perfection and the sauce was on point. We also got the Horchata to wash it down. Best combo! This place definitely worth the hype and worth the wait. I'm glad we came here and will definitely be visiting this place again.

I can't wait to come back and order their other signature dishes!

TACO HEAVEN :)

5 Stars!
