I LOVE this place!  I go there at least once a week (sometimes more) for lunch.  The food is very tasty and yes they serve real beans (not the canned stuff)!!!!!!  The Carne Asada Burro is one of my favs.  Staff is friendly and offers fast convient service.  If you haven't stopped in yet, I would suggest you put it on your TO DO List :)
