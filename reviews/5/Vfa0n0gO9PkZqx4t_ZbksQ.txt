I've been ordering from these guys for almost a year. This is probably one of the best burrito places I've ever eaten at. The Sheh-meh-neh burrito is UNBELIEVABLE! Delicious tender succulent marinated chicken, with some red onions, topped with a thin layer of sweet potato puree!

It's that wonderful euphoric delight where both salty and sweet collide and form a paradise in your mouth...like a chocolate covered pretzel...or pigs in a blanket! I love this place and order from it so much, they knew me by name...kinda embarrassing but awesome at the same time.

If you're looking for a late night snack or just a mid-day fill up, I highly recommend Burrito Drive.
