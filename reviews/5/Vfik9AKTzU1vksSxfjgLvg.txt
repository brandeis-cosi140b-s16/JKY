Love this place. The decor is awesome. Perfect place for date night, night out with friends or family dinner. The chips and salsa are on point. Love this place cause it's not like every other taco or mexican place in town.  Favorites are the crunchy taco made with mashed potatoes (hubby loved all the meaty tacos), guacomole with pumpkin seeds and pomegranate seeds and  enchilada stack. Great beer selection. Ton of craft beers. Def will be checking this place out again soon.
