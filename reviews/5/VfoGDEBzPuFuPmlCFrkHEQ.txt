This location was very clean. I don't usually eat Chipotle but I was in the mood for Mexican ever since I landed in Arizona.  I ordered a burrito bowl and I was surprised at the large amount of portions this chain gives.  The servers were nice and fast and the food was good and fresh. I had enough food in my bowl to last me two meals. This location offers comfortable outdoor seating. I love this type of healthy eating!
