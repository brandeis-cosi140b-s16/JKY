Being from New Mexico,  I heard about Chile Addiction from friends.  This is our 2nd time in, and I had to express my overwhelming interest in this restaurant.  The food is amazing,  especially the Carne Adovada,  and the best Sopapillas in Nevada. 

Love the service,  and the owners make you feel right at home. We will be back, and back again.
