When pressed for that *one* place to visit in Phoenix, there is only Rokerij. Somehow - magically - the space is designed to feel intimate. Cozy. But the space meanders around. (The booths have room to seat parties of four to six, depending on the side of the fireplace you're gazing at.)

Dates would be impressed. As would a business partner or your girlfriends. The hushed tones of the dark room encourage whispered conversation. The food and wine has always been impeccably delivered. 

The Oysters - just stop. Whatever you're doing can wait. Go. I promise you, your palate will enjoy the menu. I have a few photos up of sliders, scallops wrapped in bacon and artichoke dip. But that is an injustice. Rokerij offers a robust menu.

Happy hour is quite generous. If you're not sure pay attention: Happy hour is *every day* until 6pm. (Reverse HH is 10pm to midnight.) Alas, the true secrets of happy hour are best revealed by calling in. They change often and may not make it to Facebook or their website in time. Visit often and you'll know the inside scoop!

Currently... Wonderful, hearty glasses of wine are poured for 1/2 the normal price. All appetizers are $2-3 off a plate. But you *must* sit at the bar.

The bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge. The table staff are stunning. Visiting here is like visiting dear, close friends. Special note: The space is ADA accessible. 

Parking is valet. 

Thanks Rokerij!
