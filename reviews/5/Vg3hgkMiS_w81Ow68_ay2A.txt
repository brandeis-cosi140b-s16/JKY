Amazing.  Get the most expensive tasting menu and brace yourself.   Exceptional and very fun.  Amazing kitchen.   Great drinks.   Need work on wines though.   Among the best and most knowledgeable staffs anywhere.  Great place.   It is a destination restaurant in a destination hotel.  Buy cool original art for $5 in the Artomat  machines (converted cig machines from a bygone snd smoke-filled era).  Killer.
