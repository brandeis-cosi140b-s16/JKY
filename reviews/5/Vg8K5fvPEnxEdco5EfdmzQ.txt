I LOVE Roberto's!  I can't find the location I would frequent when I lived in Vegas because there are SO many of them, so I'll just write about this one.

They are open 24 hours, 7 days a week and is the spot to go to after a night of partying!  I love their breakfast burritos (with sausage) and their carne asada FRIES -- SO delicious!  ALSO, they have those spicy carrots -- I usually fill up a whole sandwich baggie full of them -- they are so GOOD.  They are the only taqueria that I know of that has huge sliced spears of these spicy carrots and not those wimpy canned bought carrots.  

Roberto's is one of the top reasons why I miss Las Vegas.  And PT's coming in a close second.
