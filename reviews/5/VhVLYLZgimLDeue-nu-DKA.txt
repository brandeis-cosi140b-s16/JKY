I am impressed beyond all words to have such an amazing TRUE, CLEAN and FRIENDLY taco place near our home in the South PHX. I won't lie, since moving in with my boyfriend from my lovely Biltmore last year, I've been in a slump over the dining choices in his hood. This place is a treat! The little tucked away gem is family owned and the owner helps you decide on the menu if you have questions. At least he helped the night we were there. We ended up with way more than we could eat, but not to fear.. These tacos and burritos, which are HUGE, btw!.. heat up the next day, nicely. They will not scimp on ingredients in any of the choices that you make. I had tacos and I ate one and was stuffed. My boyfriend had a Wipeout Burrito. HUGE HUGE HUGE! He ate a quarter of it and was full! We also had rice and beans. The food is fresh and you can tell. The salsas are fresh and amazingly a feast for your tastebuds. 
Because it is family owned and run, they are closed on Sunday. That is okay. Family is important. I love that there is obviously delight that goes into this business and the food they create. As long as we are here in this part of PHX, we will be back! Worth the trip if you don't live over here! It's very nice to have Gordas here!
