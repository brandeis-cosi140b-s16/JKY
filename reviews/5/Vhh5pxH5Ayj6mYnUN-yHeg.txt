I told my brother to go to school here instead of some other unnamed Big Ten School's on the sole purpose that when I visit him I can come back and get a burrito bravo.  I didn't go to U of I, I went to the much more rowdy Big Ten School just outside of Chicago, but when I would visit friends I would eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I think I got in a fight once, because someone we were with didn't want to eat there.  Anyways if you're a student at U of I and you haven't been there then shame on you!
