La Tradicion is in a grubby strip mall, even looks a bit seedy to my taste. Deep on the east side of Las Vegas, I consider this a little hidden gem. I guess I am adventurous and enjoy meals cooked by the people who are really from the dish's origin. Well the chili verde plate I had was nothing short of spectacular. The pork was about the tenderest most flavorful ever. If you want an adventure, step out and give this one a try. I liked it a lot! It will really help if you Spanish is above average.
