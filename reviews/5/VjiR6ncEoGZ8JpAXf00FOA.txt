Had lunch here today and liked everything about the place, from the spare decor to the incredibly fresh, flavorful food.  I had maybe the best ceviche of my life (a dining partner concurred), my friend had the chilaquiles verde which was a heavier meal but really tasty, with fried eggs on top.  Another friend had a tuna steak which was a little overcooked, but he wasn't complaining.  

The atmosphere is comfortable, with exposed metal girders, nicely spaced tables, and a small bar facing the kitchen area where one could dine alone and not feel conspicuous.  Pricing is reasonable (ceviche was $10) and our server was friendly.

Be sure to check out the giant photos in the hallway by the bathrooms chronicling the Don Bolles car bomb murder that took place in the parking lot in the late 70's.  A piece of national history.  Creepy, but like a train wreck, you can't look away.

Highly recommended!
