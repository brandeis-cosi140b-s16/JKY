Highly recommended! This place is the bomb! Don't even bother with the yuppified, hipstered places.
My girlfriend & I went here couple of days ago. We were both very satisfied with our selections. She got the green chili chicken, chicken quesadillas & one other thing which I can't remember. I got the chicken enchilada mole platter. OMG! The best mole I've ever had. definitely hitting this place again before going back to Seattle!
