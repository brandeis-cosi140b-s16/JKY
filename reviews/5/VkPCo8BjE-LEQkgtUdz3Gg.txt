I've been eating at Cafe Rio restaurants since 2001 when they had two or three of them (in Utah), and was happy to find one nearby upon moving to Henderson.  I have to say that I continue to be impressed by the consistently good quality and reasonably priced food.  My favorite is the chicken salad with house (tomatillo) dressing - hard to order anything else.  Their flour tortillas are wonderful.  The portions of ingredients in the salad are generous and if I separate things into multiple containers (to keep the cooked stuff from wilting the lettuce) as soon as I get home, I can usually get 3 meals out of just one Cafe Rio chicken salad.  This is literally the only place I have ever completed a frequent buyer card - and I have completed quite a few over the years.   I normally choose mom an pop places over either fast food or any chain restaurants, but I make an exception for this one.  I like that if I'm hungry when I walk in the door, even with a line of people, I can be seated and eating in about five minutes.  I give five stars for combination of value for the money, good tasting food, friendly employees, and upbeat atmosphere.
