As current Duke of Tacos Sahuaro on Yelp, I guess it's about time I review it. This place is a block from my house, so that biases the review. However, there are other restaurants and dives just as close or closer that I've only been to once. TS definitely won me over. The first time I went in, I did what I normally do at a new taco joint and got 4 different street tacos. They were all delicious, and the carne asada definitely stood out as the best. The tacos came with fresh onion and cilantro, red and green salsa, a spicy dark salsa, and a bowl containing lime wedges, radish, peppers, and cucumber. All for $2 per taco. Brilliant. I've been too many times to count (check ins not reflective of actual visits), and tried almost everything on the menu. The carne asada is still my favorite, but I often switch it up. Also, their horchata is killer if you can get it. It doesn't last long during the day. The only thing I don't enjoy about the place is the $0.50 "transaction fee" for using a credit card. I think that's a load of it for businesses today, but I also don't like carrying cash, so it's the price I'm willing to pay for the best tacos in Phoenix. Truly, if you haven't been there yet, give it a shot.
