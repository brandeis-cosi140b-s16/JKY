Just ate here for lunch today and I walked away VERY happy! I had the Carne Asada Torta and I swear by the end I was stuffed but I did not want it to end! I wanted more! The meat is flavorful and accompanied by soft bread, mayo, guacamole, lettuce, and sliced jalepeno the whole thing is heaven! For being a Saturday it was not busy so our wait for the food was very minimal. I got the ceviche to go and I started eating it as soon as I got home, I couldn't wait. I love a good ceviche and this one is not too spicy and the shrimp are still tender (haven't been sitting in the liquid too long and continue to "cook" and get tough). I will be back, too bad I have to drive a ways to get here!
