A staple for me.  I found this place right across the street from the Cardinal Stadium.  We were working an event there and needed some lunch but the food at the stadium was, well, stadium food.  Chipotle to the rescue!  I love the fresh corn they have.  Here is a tip; raw corn counts as a vegetable.  Cooked corn counts as a starch.  Chipotle serves it raw. It adds a sweet flavor to the food with great texture.
