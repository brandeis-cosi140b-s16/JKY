Okay, just finished early dinner here based on the sky high ratings on Yelp, plus there aren't a ton of restaurants near my hotel. The glowing reviews are well deserved. Irma's is a very small restaurant with maybe 4 or 5 small tables (4 tops at most). It's kind of the picture of a mom and pop, Mexican version and Irma is the cook with I assume a young family member running the counter

The salsa that comes with fresh chips is different from any other I've had, it almost looks like chicken soup, yellowish, clear and very flavorful. I had the chicken fajitas, which came with a giant flour tortilla that was as hot as hades. The chicken breast pieces (not cheaper thigh meat) were large and perfectly cooked through yet juicy and tender. Squash, onions and peppers add to the fajita mix.

Rice and refried beans and an apple slice with grapefruit slice on shredded lettuce fill out the plate. I was stuffed when I finished and there was no way I was going to leave anything this good on the plate! All that and a refillable fountain soda for less than $10.00.

Support a really nice if little neighborhood restaurant if you're in Phoenix, and go to Irma's.
