FINALLY! I have been waiting for this restaurant to open close to my part of town for a while. This is a brand new El Pollo Loco and as far as fast food Chicken places go this place is great. I was greeted right when I walked through the door and the person taking my order was super friendly. There was no lack of friendly service and you could tell by the full tip bin that lots of other people agree. I love the fact that you can see the grill and prep area. The sound of that meat sizzling makes my mouth water like a Pavlov experiment. The condiment station was clean and so was the dining area.

It could be the cooks or it may just be because its new, but the chicken just tasted better than any of the other El Pollo Locos I have eaten at. I even managed to convert someone who was not into El Pollo Loco food into a fan.

Good food, good service, good prices and a clean restaurant. That's more than enough for me. I'll be back here frequently to see how things progress but based on this first experience I am a very happy camper.
