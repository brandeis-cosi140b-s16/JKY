This is one of the cleaner Roberto's in town.  They are very nice here and have quick service.  You may need to speak as little as possible as they do not speak much English.  They are also one of the few locations with a shrimp burrito, which is very good and always served hot!  This location has a very interesting interior and it almost seems like a converted McDonald's or something like that.  If you use the drive-thru, beware that it may take 10-20 min. for your food.  They have plenty of parking and never have a long order line.
