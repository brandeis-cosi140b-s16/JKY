Blue Adobe is our meeting place for Abby Bella Dance Scottsdale. We meet new emloyees, have meetings and just have lunch and happy hour. Every day there is an amazing special for just $10, my favorite is the seafood enchiladas. Stuffed with shrimp, salmon and other delights from the sea combined in a blue corn tortilla and topped with sauce and cheese. Everything I have tried is great! 

The patio is a great place to meet with friends and wind down from your day. 

Great chips and salsa. The service is always good and Michael always stops by with a joke and/or a story.
