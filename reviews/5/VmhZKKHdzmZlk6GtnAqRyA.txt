Okay we all know Phoenix basically blows for Mexican food. This place however will rule you. No frills here, order your food at the counter, sit your ass down & squirt salsa on your chips out of a ketchup bottle until they call your order # to pick up. Usually when you don't see allot of white people at the establishment, it's usually a good sign you're gonna get some son of a bitchin' authentic Mexican food. Friendly service compliments the excellent food, making the overall experience well worth it.
