Wow my family came once and so we came here for my bday today.
They got us in as a party of 10 right away and were very accommodating! 
The server was AMAZING and interacted well with everyone including children... Honestly it was very impressive. 
They gave me an awesome flan for my bday dessert and sang for me:)
The manager came over and everyone was very pleasant.
Now, the food was off the chain with the lobster tacos, the halibut, and the peach margaritas!!! Simply just a great place for a friendly atmosphere:)
