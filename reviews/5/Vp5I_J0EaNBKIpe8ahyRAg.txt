The place is simple, no fancy shmancy seatings just the perfect local spot to grab good food and enjoy. The wait was a little long but heck i understand, the food is good and plus you only have two hard working guys running the kitchen. Overall, i was satisfied with my San Francisco Burrito and Super Fries... i'll definitely be back
