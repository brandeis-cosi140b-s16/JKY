I have a bias AGAINST chains ... I prefer to support the independent guy ... I find they care more, I get more unique experiences and food, and I like sharing the wealth a bit.  That said.  Man... the taco's at this place are amazing.  Full of flavor, bold but not over the top.  I love the delicate crunch of the fish filets that are fried.  I had the coastal trio - three different seafood tacos.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  Wow.... that doesn't happen all the time.  Great job all!
