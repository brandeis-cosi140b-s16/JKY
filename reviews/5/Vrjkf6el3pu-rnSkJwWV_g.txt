The food is delicious. The drinks are absolutely amazing. Atmosphere is more open and inviting. Highly recommend the el jefe, flama dolce, and the que melagro cocktails. Chicken torta with a side of cucumber jicama coleslaw is so yummy! I feel like customers are giving negative reviews because they're expecting Gallo blanco. Not the same restaurant!
