Busy place even for lunch but the tacos are cheap and really good!

Most tacos are $ 2.

As you get in the door:
1. Spot what you want on the boards
2. Line up according to what you prefer
3. Pay the food & drinks (they'll give you a refillable cup)
4. Get drinks and condiments
5. Enjoy your meal

Repeat if you're still hungry :)
