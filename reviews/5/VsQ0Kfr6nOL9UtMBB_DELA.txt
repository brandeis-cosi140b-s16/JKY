We really loved everything about this place! The food and service were both exceptional! The only thing there really is to complain about is the smell from a nearby nail place. That's not the restaurant's fault but if you have a sensitive nose or stomach it might bother you while you are eating. Good news though, they do to go! :) the carne asada was awesome and we will definitely be back!
