Went to Joyride for the first time with a couple of friends last Friday for happy hour and had a wonderful time. It is a unique and hidden gem nestled between Postino's and Federal Pizza. The food and service was amazing and I enjoyed all of the food and drink recommendations made by the servers. I definitely recommend the pineapple agua Fresca with vodka added, the chicken burrito, and the bottomless chips and salsa (the chips are a little salty, but can be easily washed down with a agua Fresca or another one of their tasty beverages!)

 All of the servers made us feel welcome, wanted, and appreciated. I plan on returning again soon for another happy hour with friends!
