Rosa's is the only Mexican place I like in the East Valley. They serve baja-style, seemingly authentic Mexican, with fresh ingredients and good service. Don't be put off by the almost-dead, no habla ingles crappy shopping plaza...just park in the ample lot and ignore your surroundings.

I've been there enough to have settled on a favorite dish: the baja shrimp tacos (also available in a tasty grilled fish), which are amazing. The shrimp is always perfect, and it's complemented with a not-too-sweet pineapple salsa and fresh vegetables. I'm not a rice and beans fan, and the staff has always happily substituted black beans and a grilled corn-off-the-cob dish.

I did once have a mistep, which might have been more my taste than the food: I didn't care for the mango chicken salad. The carmelized onions with mango didn't appeal to me, even though separately the ingredients were all fine.

The highlight of Rosa's is the green salsa verde that's served with chips as you wait. They'll also bring a red tomato salsa to your table, but you'll forget about it after you try the green.
