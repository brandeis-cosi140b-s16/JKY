This restaurant is so awesome!  we had two different kinds of burritos and a kids meal.  we had a little bit of trouble ordering, but I think it was just because it was our first time here.  the restaurant was so clean and neatly decorated.  the staff was so friendly it was a great atmosphere.  the food was amazing and I cannot wait to go back again and again.  I will tell everybody about this restaurant!
