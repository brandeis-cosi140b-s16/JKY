I absolutely love this place. I use to go to another Mexican Restaurant in the plaza midwood area and it was the only place I went for almost a year. Well the service started getting slack and the food fell off a little bit. My fianc√© and I decided to try La Unica and it was just ok the first couple  times but good enough for us to keep trying. And I am so glad we did keep coming back because it seems like they've done a complete 360. The food has always been on point but now the service is great too. I work in the industry and service is a make it or break it for me. You can have the best food in town but if you can't it right or hot or in a timely manner then I'll go find someone who will get me mediocre food like I want it. I feel like we literally see every server in the restaurant; whether it's bringing out chips or bringing our drinks or taking our order. That's what I call awesome; every server in the place should be just as focused on the other servers tables as they are on theirs to ensure everyone is always taken care of. I truly appreciate a Mexican restaurant with food that's always right, hot and timely and service that is quick, efficient and attentive. It's hard to find!
