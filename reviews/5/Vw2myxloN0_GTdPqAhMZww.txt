Ok, so this place is our go-to for Mexican food! The service is always so friendly. The chips and salsa they give you are always fresh; the chips are still warm and the salsa has just the right texture and kick. I've tried a few things on the menu from salads, to tacos, and burritos, and pollo con queso. Everything is good with lots of flavor. The pollo con queso is my favorite dish! It is literally chicken with cheese. The chicken is cooked to perfection and is served covered in this amazing melted cheese sauce, along with a side of refried beans and rice. I could eat this dish every night! Pair it with one of their margaritas (I love the mango one), and it is American-Mexican perfection!
