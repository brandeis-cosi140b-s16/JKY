I have to admit that I am a bit of a Mexicanfoodaholic, I could pretty much eat Mexican food 3 times a day and 4 on nights that we go out drinking. 
I cannot say enough good things about Humberto's.   I have to say for a "Quick Service" Mexican food experience it doesn't get much better than this.  I have never been disappointed and I have tried quite a few items on the menu.  My personal favorite is the Machaca (it is amazing) and it keeps me coming back again and again.  The staff is very nice and accomodating.  The seating is not the most comfortable but the food is soooo good that you will finish before you have a chance to notice...
