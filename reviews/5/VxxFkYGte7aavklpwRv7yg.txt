I have been coming to Phoenix for the last 6 years for work and how I missed this place I will never know.  Went to dinner with a girlfriend last night and the food was amazing!  Very crowded but we found spaces at the bar.  Service was fantastic and the atmosphere was awesome.  I will definately spend more time at this place.
