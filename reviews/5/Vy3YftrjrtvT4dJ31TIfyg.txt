If you want old fashioned good Mexican food, this is the place.  The food is fresh, standard style of sauces, beans, rice, salsas... bar, very good service, very friendly staff.  Wifi too.  It's a good place to go and get an enchilada or carne asada.  The staff deserves 5 stars.. it's clean, it's convenient, and it is fast.
