Phenomenal! Best fast food Mexican food I have had in AZ. Ordered the carne asada tostada and a chicken taco. Both were seasoned perfectly and included very fresh garnishes and a delicious salsa bar. My only regret is that I didn't discover this place sooner. And the prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back this weekend!
