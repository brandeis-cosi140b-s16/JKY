While I heard they have other locations, this is the very first time we went to this (new) location on Northsight Blvd. Amazing food.  I struggled with the menu because it is so different from Mexican restaurants. I don't remember what the name of it was but it was shredded pork with a chipoltle sauce with corn tortillas. FABULOUS! Service was good and the place was very busy. I am looking forward to returning!
