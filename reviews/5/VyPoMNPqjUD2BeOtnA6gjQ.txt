I had here what I think, in my humble opinion, was the most authentic and delicious gourmet enchilada plate I've had in my life. I grew up in Mexico and tried the lot. I've had from curb-side to high-end restaurants. This was quite a treat and this place takes the gold. 
For a quick bite to eat I always resorted to stop at chipotles which was my favorite, until now. This place elevates Mexican food to a whole new level. The place has a similar feeling to chipotles, very rustic. 
You can see the pots and pans being used to cook delicious meats that probably had been simmering all morning before opening. All the ingredients are fresh and they taste fresh. Crema from scratch? When a business is taking their time to make something as basic as crema fresca from scratch, you know you will not to be disappointed. 
Enough with the talk. I encourage you to give this place a go. I know they have tacos and salads but they are a dime a dozen in this city. Not saying by this they are not as good, but good enchiladas are hard to find.
