I love it here! I came for the first time last night and I thought it was awesome! After reading all the yelp reviews, I wanted to try it. The place was packed when we got here but we only waited for about ten minutes. When we got seated, they gave us the best seat in the house. We had a beautiful view of the strip, it was so nice. 

I loved the authentic feel and mariachi music. All of the employees had nice Mexican uniforms on. The margaritas were fantastic! First we tried the mango margaritas, soooo delicious! Second time around, my husband had the peach and I tried the skinny margarita. Both were also fantastic! We had the table side guacamole. It was so cool to watch the waiter prepare the guacamole right at our table. I've never had that before. Let me tell you.....that was the BEST guacamole I've ever had! It was so delicious and fresh. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it, lol. For dinner, my husband had the beef tongue mole, it was also very delicious. I can't remember the name in Spanish of what I had but it consisted of large shrimp and a spicy sauce. It was delicious as well but very spicy for my taste. I was also surprised at the side of the shrimp. The menu called them "giant" and they weren't very giant. However, everything was delicious and the service was excellent! Will definitely be back!!
