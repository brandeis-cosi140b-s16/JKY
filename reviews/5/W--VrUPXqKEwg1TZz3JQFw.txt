I love La Bamba.  Great food, authentic, quick and cheap.  I personally love the steak tacos with cilantro and onions (traditional tacos) and the steak burrito.  My BF always gets the fajita meal with is enough food to feed 2-3 people (or have lots of leftovers.)  The only thing there I'm not a huge fan of is the ground beef, so I just dont get it.  Everything else is amazing! and there open late.  No more Taco Bell for me.
