YAY! Pasqual's is back in Verona, right where it used to be on Cross Country.  We were so disappointed when they closed that location a few years ago.  We stopped in on a Friday night, and the place has been completely renovated and was packed.   It is much more like the Hilldale location, with a beautiful bar.  We were only there for margaritas and nachos, but both were just as good as always.  Their margaritas are one of the best in town, no skimping on the booze.  (They are pricey, but you can get them 1/2 price on Monday and Tuesday.)  The nachos are great, we got the shredded chicken.  You can definitely make a meal from the large order.  Our server was attentive without being bothersome.  The menu is a bit different than the other locations.  There are burgers on this one and not all of the other offerings that the other locations have.  I am anxious to try some of the new items now that they are back in our neighborhood.  We have been eating at Pasqual's since there was only one location on Monroe St. and cannot think of a time we have been disappointed.  The only thing I wish they hadn't changed is they no longer have their menu on that colorful chalkboard.  Who's idea was that to get rid of it???
