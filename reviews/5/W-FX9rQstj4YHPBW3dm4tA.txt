The BEST carne asada burrito I have ever had!!! I was shocked!!! My friend took me here while visiting AZ and I would have never expected such an excellent meal! I have asked multiple times to go back and am going to make sure I have atleast one more burrito from here before I go home. The meat was very flavorful and the tortilla was so soft and light. You have to go here!!!!
