I just ate a very satisfying break fast . I had the huevos Ranchero and found it authentic and filling as it shuld be . I also got a side of very tasty onion rings . Wow could not have enjoyed more . The service is great and the place is clean and neat . Pricing is inexpensive which doesn't mean the quality isn't there. It's just a very good value.
