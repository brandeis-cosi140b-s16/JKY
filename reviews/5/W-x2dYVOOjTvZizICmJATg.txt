We went to El Encanto on our first night in Cave Creek.  It was within walking distance of the resort at which we were staying.  

The outside wall hides the beauty inside.  We were amazed at the ambiance hidden behind the concrete walls surrounding the restaurant.  There's covered indoor and outdoor seating around a huge pond.  You would never know you were in the middle of the desert.  Even inside (in the air-conditioning), we felt like we were outside, sitting along the pond with only a big glass window separating us!  

The fresh salsa (3 kinds!) and chips that they bring you were delicious.  Nobody wanted the two spicy salsas, so I had them all to myself.  Mmm...  

For my entree, I (and so did two others at my table) tried the Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole (Chicken Enchiladas with Mole sauce).  Everyone agreed:  the mole sauce was AMAZING.  It was the best I've EVER tasted.  It was so full of flavor that other mole sauces have, apparently, been lacking.  Now, no mole sauce that I ever eat in the future will be able to stand up against this one.  Sigh...  

My one negative comment would be that I was a bit put off by the server's rudeness (or perhaps, lack of interest).  He seemed to do the bare minimum and nothing else.  When I asked him what the dinner specials were, he replied, "I don't know."  Well, okay...   What he *should* have said was that it was only 4:30 (we got there early because we just flew in and were still on East Coast time) so their dinner specials didn't start until 5:00 and the chefs and/or management hadn't informed the wait staff yet.  The food and atmosphere were so perfect, though, that I can't even slight the restaurant's ratings for his lameness.
