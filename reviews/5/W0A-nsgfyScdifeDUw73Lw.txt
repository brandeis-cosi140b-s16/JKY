I hope this is the right location (directly across from Chipotle).

Okay, this review is way, long overdue (like since December 2013), however, I must say while in town helping brother & family move- hubby and I worked up an appetite, as well as the rest of the crew.  So we were craving some good south-of-the-border place and figured we'd go to the local Chipotle Grill- but it was so busy and we were so hungry, someone suggested the Qdoba Mexican Grill right across the street from Chipotle.

Never heard of this place, as I don't think we have any here in So. Cali, but once we got in and met the friendliest counter girl, Anna, my nephew recognized her from an earlier Christmas party and her smile grew even bigger.

I didn't believe their food could be better than Chipotle, but after we satisfactorily satiated our appetites, I vowed to go back each and every time we make our way out to Arizona.

Yumm and delish is all I can say for Qdoba.  

The queso sauce was lip-smacking good as each of my tortilla chips took multiple dives in that well seasoned, warm, saucy deliciousness.   The Mexican Gumbo (sounds funny) but it was so good as I got to add whatever ingredient I wanted inside of that bowl of yummyness.

5 solid stars for Qdoba and the same for the waitress/food handler Anna!!!

If only we had a Qdoba in So. California, tsk, tsk.
