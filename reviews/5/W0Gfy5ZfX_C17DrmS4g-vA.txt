This is a delightful place if you don't want chain style food.  There is a place for chain restaurants, but I like to find a place that can be whatever the owners want because it is an independent.  They have more control over what they buy so you hopefully you should be able to expect better quality for the food you meal is made from.  Gadzooks doesn't disappoint in this area.

I went in there this afternoon more to look to the menu than to eat.  All of us have had one of those weeks where you are tired but have just enough energy to do something you've been meaning to do for what seems forever.  That was my day.  When I got in there I found a very creative menu, almost more than I wanted to deal with.  With the people being s welcoming and the restaurant so clean I decided to go for it.  â€ ruthfully, I let them recommend things and told them to use their judgement on them They had a lot of interesting choices to make from the tortillas to the cheeses to the condiments.  Once I sat down and ate, I guess I got some of my energy back because I started considering how I could have changed things from the many interesting ingredients that were available.  Next time, I will make it a real adventure to put together my meal.

Go and have fun here...definitely not your chain Mexican food.  II think it would be a great place to take a group and find out how many different combinations people could end up at the same table.  There is seating outside for people who enjoy that.

The cornbread tacos stood out for me!
