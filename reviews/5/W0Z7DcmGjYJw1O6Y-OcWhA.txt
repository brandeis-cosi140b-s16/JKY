Go. Here. Delicious breakfast burritos. And they are HUGE! Two people should split one. We also got chips and guacamole. I was skeptical at first sight, the chips had grated melted cheese and then guacamole spread over them and the guac was more of the creamy variety with no veggies. But they were also really tasty. The chips themselves were great. And pretty cheap - two huge burritos, chips and guac, two medium sodas all for $17 (before tip)!
