Growing up in Phoenix, Garcia's was a favorite dining destination for my family.  Fast forward 20 years later and I am living in Tempe with my partner and it is still a favorite.  This location is actually inside an Embassy Suites Hotel.  Even when its busy there is not much of a wait time. Yes it is a chain restaurant but the food is muy bueno.  

The chips come with a spicy bean dip, yum!  There is a good selection of food, my favorites are seafood fundido, shrimp tacos, pork tacos and most of all their fajitas are probably the best I've had!  I'm not much of a drinker but they have lots of tequilas and margarita specials.  We are regulars there so we get treated very well.
