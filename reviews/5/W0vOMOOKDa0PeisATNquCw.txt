I LOVE this dumpy little place with it's scuzzy looking exterior...and, let's be honest, interior.  But the food and service--and how do they get that food out sooo fast I wonder?--is superb!
I had 2 fish tacos, a carne asada quesidilla and the grilled onions with a grilled jalapeno just for kicks.  Was it good?  Fantastic is more the word!
Tax, title and license (in other words, drive out) came to a tad more than $9!
And I don't know if my stomach has shrunk or what, but I actually came home and rested in a recliner for 2 hours afterward I felt so stuffed.  
And this is probably the kind of place where you could go in with no shoes, no shirt and still get serviced............................................but,
I love this place!  I will be back to Tacos Atoyac when I am even remotely in the area.  Dis be duh place, dis be duh place, dis be duh place!
