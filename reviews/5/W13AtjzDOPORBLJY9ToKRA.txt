holy moley. it hasnt been since my treks out to tj have i found tacos this amazing.

the meat. moist and fatty, but not too fatty. just the right amount of fatty

the tortilla. surprisingly subtle

the salsa bar. oh holy salsa bar. one of the best hot sauces ive had a chance to taste. giant jalapenos. radish, fresh onion, cilantro, lemon. and the pickled onion...i would make the 4 hour drive from so cal to lv just for those pickled onions, whose hotness factor can pwn even the most experienced of taste buds.

must return one day for their soups, which you will often see mexican locals slurping down just about every time you visit. 

and the sinker? the workers only speak spanish. how much more awesome can that get? its like walking through tj all over again..
