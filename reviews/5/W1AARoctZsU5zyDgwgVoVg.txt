One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the world! They've got the BEST salsa and their chips are amazing. One of the best parts about Manuel's is the jalapeño cream cheese that they put on their Pollo Especial. BUT...if you want the best dish they've got...get the Carne Tampiqueña and add some shrimp. You really won't regret it. Drinks are delish...servers are awesome...really nothing to complain about!!
