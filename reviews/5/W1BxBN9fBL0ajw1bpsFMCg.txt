How did I miss this place?! We live up the street and order from Prima Pizza all the time but never saw Cafe Casera. This place is my type of spot. It doesn't overwhelm you with a huge menu but a few amazing New Mexican dishes. The first time I got a burrito, and now I am enjoying the amazing green chile chicken enchiladas! The tortillas are so fresh and the chips and salsa are delicious!! They are going to have to 86 me from here because I will be stopping by way too offen. Oh, if you like deserts and coffee you can stop in and get it as well! I like the decor its like a chill mix of coffee shop meets contemporary.  

Cheap good quality food comparable to robertos prices and they deliver!
