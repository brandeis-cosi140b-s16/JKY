Awesome food, spectacular service. The location on Central Ave has always been a favorite of mine, now we have one closer to home! We had the Shrimp Veracruz and the Chicken Chimichanga both were great, if you don't like spicy dishes, and both of these are, they have other great options!

We will be back over and over!
