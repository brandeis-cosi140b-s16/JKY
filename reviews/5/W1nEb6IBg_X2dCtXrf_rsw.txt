I love this place! Everything on the menu is made from scratch, including the chips & salsas and the drinks mixed up in glass jugs that they scoop out with a ladle. I usually get soft tacos and horchata, but the huevos rancheros are pretty good too. They've got the standard variety of meats and then a few others including tongue,  cheek & goat occasionally. Plus when he's there (he has 2 locations) the owner Jose is super friendly!
