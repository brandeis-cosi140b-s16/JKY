I come here often with my family so this review is long overdue. The frijoles staff is always friendly and the food never disappoints. I usually order the mini tacos, shrimp cocktail or nachos.  Green and red salas are at each table and you can't leave without  trying an Agua Fresca.  The food is made to order and although a bit pricier than your typical Robertos or other taco shop...you get what you pay for in quality.  We will continue to visit this restaurant :-)
