The food was absolutely amazing here!!  We ordered the fish tacos, suggested by a worker, and they were delicious. The fish was freshly cooked, the sauces and veggies were fresh, and the corn tortillas were tender. 

While the food was absolutely delicious, we were particularly impressed by one of the workers, Alex. He was quick to suggest good items, kindly inquisitive about our experience and food satisfaction, and clearly dedicated to his job!!!  Great work hiring your staff, Zabas!
