Another fine addition to the food court at Caesars Palace located across from the world famous Colosseum. This place serves up some great Mexican street food dishes. La Gloria is hip Mexican restaurant in San Antonio that made it to Vegas by Chef Johnny Hernandez. 

We ordered tons of food. I wanted it all. Everything was super fresh. We got chips and queso, ceviche, bistec and al pastor tacos, chicken quesadilla, and a couple of drinks. The food was very flavorful and tasty. Try all the salsas. My favorite was the Al pastor with the little pieces of pi√±a. And the Mangonada with mango and cantaloupe was so refreshing after working the entire day. We left so full, we had to walk around the forum shops to rest our stomachs. I made a joke with my dining partner that this place is like Border Grill light.
