So many taco choices; combinations I never dreamed of in a taco! I had the pulled pork taco and it was fantastic. My hubby and I also split some sort of taco roll appetizer (can't remember the name) and it was so yummy! My world tour (mixed drink) was delicious! The bartender was really nice too. Definitely recommend :)
