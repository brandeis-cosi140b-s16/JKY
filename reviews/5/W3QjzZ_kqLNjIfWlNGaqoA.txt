Delicious food and great ambience!

We were on a road trip heading south looking for lunch close to the 15 freeway.  Thanks, Yelp, for bringing us here!  We were pleased right off the bat with the warm tortilla chips, hot bean dip, and salsa as soon as we sat down.  We're suckers for tableside guacamole, which was great as well.  The portions were huge - we only needed two entrees to feed me, my wife, and our two kids.  We got the fish tacos and the combination with a chili relleno and green chile pork burrito.  My only criticism of the food is that the peppers they used for the relleno were VERY mild and I like them to have a bit more punch.

The kids enjoyed the live mariachi and had fun watching them make the tortillas fresh behind a window in the corner of the restaurant.  All in all a pleasant meal and we were back on the freeway quickly.
