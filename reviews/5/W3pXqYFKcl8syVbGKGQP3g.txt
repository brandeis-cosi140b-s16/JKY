First off, let me be clear that I'm a long time fan of New Mexico cuisine.  I live in "the 'tuke", but have been making road trips to Carlsbad Tavern in Scottsdale and Richardson's (formerly in Phoenix) for more than 10 years.  So when I heard there was a New Mexico place in the 'tuke, I thought... "yeah, right.".   But Secreto did not disappoint.  Excellent carne adovada, lamb and other specialties.  No, this is not a Mexican place.  It's New Mexico-style and they do it very well.  Glad to have them in the neighborhood.
