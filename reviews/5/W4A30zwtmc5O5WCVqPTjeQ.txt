Blown away.

I was in last Saturday for lunch for the first time.  It was a little chilly so we sat inside but I would definitely like to go back for happy hour on the patio.  The menu was a little different than what I was used to being that I normally dine at more 'authentic' mexican restaurants so I asked our server, Joey, for some recommendations.  He was super friendly and honest in giving his opinion on certain dishes as well as answering any questions we had.  We felt very comfortable and finally decided on the  cotija grilled corn appetizer as well as the poblano queso. WOW.  SO much flavor in the dip and the corn was grilled to perfection.  I can't wait to go back for their happy hour and have the chance to enjoy them both at HALF OFF.  Next, he suggested we try the new soup/sandwich combo (went with the corn chowder and beef torta) which was also quite delicious.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has good taste in food and is interested in trying something new.  While it is not traditional mexican food, it is definite quality food AND service.
