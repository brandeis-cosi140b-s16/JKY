Let me start by saying this place is in no way conveniently located for me, but I would travel across the Vegas valley over and over again for their tasty cuisine. We happened to be in the area and stumbled across Fat Boy after a co-worker's search on Yelp. There were five in our group and we could not agree on a place to eat and turned to Yelp. All five of us left Fat Boy in utter amazement.

We were greeted with a smile and had all of our questions regarding the menu answered. The dining area is kind of small and was crowded upon our arrival. Space opened up quickly and we bellied up to the table in anticipation of our feast, when we quickly realized we forgot to order the highly recommended "Chencho Fries."  With a holler back to the kitchen, our request to "upgrade" our fries was graciously accepted and the transformation began. 

When the food arrived at the table, my jaw just about dropped to the floor (which was actually a good thing, because I needed every bit of clearance I could get to fit this mouth watering masterpiece into my mouth). I ordered a Monster Double Cheeseboyger with bacon and boy was it a Monster! The patties were handmade, like you would expect to find at a family bbq. No pre-fab circle patties around here. The bun was toasted to perfection and the supporting cast of veggies and bacon was fantastic. This is quite possibly the best cheeseburger I have ever eaten and I have eaten plenty. 

The Chencho Fries definitely lived up to the hype we read on Yelp, as did the entire experience. It was so good, we contemplated ordering another burger, but opted to wait for a return trip. Located at the NE corner of Lamb and Stewart, this jewel is tucked into a small strip mall and could easily be overlooked. If you are into burgers, I highly recommend you give Fat Boy a try. There were numerous other items on the menu including wings and pizza, but I was in search of a burger. Next time I'll try to save room for a Fat Boy milkshake.
