La Tolteca is outstanding. Passing through PHX and a friend (and frequent visitor to AZ) told me I need to stop here. He spoke truth. 

Get the chilaquiles! Get them. 

We also had tacos de papa, and caldo de camarones...the latter was awesome too, delicious broth and packed with shrimp. The salsa bar had grilled jalape√±os & habanero salsa we couldn't get enough of. 

I'll be back to La Tolteca. Five stars no hesitation.
