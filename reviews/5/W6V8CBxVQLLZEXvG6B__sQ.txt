This is as authentic as it gets!

I come here with a co-worker for lunch. He said it's great Mexican food. 

We get there and it's this huge restaurant. I had high expectations. 

7.99 lunch chimi special? So good. 

I would totally reccomend going here in you're in the area. 

The service was good, but I had to ask for things a few times. All in all good experience!
