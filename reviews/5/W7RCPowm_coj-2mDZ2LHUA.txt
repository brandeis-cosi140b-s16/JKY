A friend and I used a groupon today for a spur of the moment dinner.  We were very pleased with the choices on the menu.  I had the seafood platter.  My friend enjoyed a green chile burrito, enchilada style.  Excellent choices.  We had too much food after enjoying the $5 happy hour margaritas and the excellent chips and salsa.  That's ok...I love to have the leftovers for lunch the next day.  
Hats off to Aaron the manager.  He took great care to give us a great experience along with our meal.
