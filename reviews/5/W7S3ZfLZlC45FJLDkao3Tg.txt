This place is the bomb!!! They have your typical Mexican dishes that are all good flavorful and really cheap too! My husband had a carne asada burrito smothered in green chili and topped with cheese. I had sopes (chicken and deseprada AKA shredded beef) they were amazing! The beans are to die for and the service was great! I will be going back to this place for sure!
