El Hefe is a blast and Taco Tuesday is always awesome: the $2 tacos & $3 Dos Equis are totally the way to go but you can never go wrong with margaritas. Lunch the couple times I have had it has always been good and pretty fast, but I can't say I've ever tried having dinner here. Since this is a bar my primary experience here has been bar hopping. I'm not sure why everyone seems to be complaining about drunk people and crowds- this is a BAR in downtown Tempe...last time I checked isn't that what people are looking for when they go to a bar at night? People watching is always a blast here-if I wanted a place to myself I could always stay home. Sundays aren't my drinking scene anymore (I'm getting old (26) so I recover slower...) but if it's yours the party starting at 4 is probably for you! Definitely a fun place to hang out!
