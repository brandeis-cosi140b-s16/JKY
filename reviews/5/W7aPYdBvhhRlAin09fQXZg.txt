Best chicken and waffles I have ever had. I ordered the breakfast style chicken and waffles and I was thoroughly impressed. The food is AMAZING, the bartenders are very friendly, and the food is worth every cent of the ten dollars It cost. My only complaint is that the service was a little slow, but the food is well worth the wait. The atmosphere and decor is great. The owner/manager came over when we were eating and asked us how our food was. My overall meal and service was better than at Lo Lo's. I definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for chicken and waffles in Tempe.
