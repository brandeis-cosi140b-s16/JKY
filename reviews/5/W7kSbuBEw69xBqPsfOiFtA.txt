so today my coworker trace was looking for a place to get lunch, carne asada was on the request. i quickly jumped on Yelp did a search for Carne Asada in our work zip code and low and behold El Yaqui came up and it was pretty close and had a glowing review from Angelo C. 

it was confirmed that this place is not on the street, but instead inside a market place. 

the carne asada burrito is delicious, grilled and chopped meat, seasoned right, with grilled onions and beans. wrapped up in foil to keep it warm with a side of lime and pickled carrots and a salsa. from what i can tell from the beans in the burrito, they are awesome. lardy and smooth just the way they should be. 1 million calories later... 

I'm in carne asada coma now. 

if your in the area, or work around here. check this place out...
