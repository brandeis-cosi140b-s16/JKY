Johnny Burrito is the best burrito in Charlotte, BAR NONE.  This guy used to work at one of the Charlotte banking giants, and left to start his own restaurant because no one uptown made a burrito like he wanted. 

This is one of the most popular lunch places with the uptown bankers -- by noon the line stretches out the door, down the hall, past the florist to a soda shop that must be jealous of Johnny's business.  You can get regular or large burritos or salads, and your choice of meat (or not) and your choice of fresh toppings.  Do not be alarmed about the line: even from past the florist, you'll be in and out of Johnny Burrito in 15 minutes.  

This guy knows how to make your burrito, and he knows how to move people.
