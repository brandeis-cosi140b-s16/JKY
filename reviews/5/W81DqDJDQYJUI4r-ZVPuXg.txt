Went to this place on impulse after the dog park.  We didn't know what to expect but were pleasantly surprised.  We got our food to go and didn't have to wait long.  We got the enchiladas and a wet asada burrito.  Our food was delicious and correct so we will definitely be going back. Best Mexican food I've had in Vegas and not as Americanized like other spots.
