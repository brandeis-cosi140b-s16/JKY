Javier's is muy bueno!  

#1 best Chips and Salsa in my opinion in Las Vegas period.

I have been to every Mexican Restaurant in town.  Javier's is a little pricier than most Mexican restaurants but in my opinion well worth it.  If you are debating between Mexican Restaurants on the strip it blows Border Grill,and Diablos out of the water on every level.  If you are a Mexican food lover then i will say this is a must for you to try!

I have eaten here many times and have always had excellent professional service and a great experience.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has the nicest mexican ambiance and decor i have seen. 

The Food is excellent and what is really great about this place is that they have a lot of very sophisticated items on the menu that you don't typically find in most Mexican restaurants.   One dish thats different and I make sure somebody orders at the table  is the Camarones al mojo de ajo, or garlic shrimp. Another stand out is the Chile Verde special which is a pork dish and is most excellent.  I actually have them turn this into Chile Verde enchiladas when i go - a modification i highly recommend! :) The best appetizer is the chicken taquitos or the steak nachos.  The main dishes come with rice and beans and you have your choice of black/white refried or regular beans served in a cup.  Both are delicious! ( I prefer the white)

No matter what you select for your meal you will be very pleased.  They use all fresh ingredients and the kitchen definitely knows what they are doing.  Food comes out hot and perfectly cooked every time.   

Buen Provecho!
