Wanted some authentic Mexican food while in Vegas. This place was recomended and was as good as we were told. My wife and my two kids went and we all had different dishes, all was excellent. We had ceviche, campechana (seafood coxktail) carne asada huarache and chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Servings were big and service was great. Saw alot of molcajetes served at other tables, will try them next time we come to Vegas.
