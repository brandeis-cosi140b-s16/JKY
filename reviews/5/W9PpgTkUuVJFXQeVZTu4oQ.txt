Carne Asada fries!! That's it. Get those and you will love yourself. They are enough to share with someone.

The tacos are good too, but I'm just saying. I liked the tacos al pastor and the asada ones. The chicken tacos were my least favorites. But they were still good. 

I came here with a party of 8 HUNGRY people--and they did a great job getting our stuff together. There was a little confusion, as we were missing some tacos, but the employees there were really friendly and were helpful.
