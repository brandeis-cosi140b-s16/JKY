My wife and I were looking for some good Mexican food and we are new to the area.  We are really glad we stopped in...the food was excellent, service was great too.  I recommend the queso dip, it was amazing.  I tried a bit of everything, taco, tostada and an enchilada and the ground beef was excellent.  We have already been back once and I can assure you this will be a regular place for us.
