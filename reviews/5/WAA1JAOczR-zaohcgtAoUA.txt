I start drooling just thinking about this place. The food here is amazing and so is the staff. I moved to San Fran for 6 months and when I came back, they remembered me and I only went there like once a week before. 

Let me start off with the burritos: the tortilla is absolutely scrumptious and grilled lightly to perfection, you can tell they actually make it themselves. The meat is so juicy and delicious I can't even begin to describe it. My personal favorite is the shredded beef burrito (i add cheese to it..mmmm). Their breakfast burritos are also insanely good and have good portions of ingredients (it's not all egg).

SALSA!!! Holy hell, their salsa is phenomenal and available for purchase in-store in the fridge on the side in a small or large container sizes. Sometimes, if you mail Santa enough, they sell it at Costco in large containers...those days are glorious. They also have fresh chips that they make every day that are soooo good.

Finally, the pastries...yum yum yum, I''m in love with the cream horns and cherry empanadas. They are always baked to perfection and are so fresh.

I'd recommend this place to anyone, great for breakfast, lunch or dinner since they now have extended hours from 7am to 8pm Tuesday-Saturday. Only downside here is that they aren't open every day :(
