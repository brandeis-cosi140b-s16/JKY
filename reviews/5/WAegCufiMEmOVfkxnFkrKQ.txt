I truly have no idea how anyone could rate this place low. Different strokes I guess. 

But, let me tell you the shrimp mojo is a world class dish. Light, full of flavor, creative and perfectly cooked. The Guac is perfect and balanced. Chips were good and the lamb potstickers were so wild and crazy, you must try them to see.

If nothing else you try from this mad wonderful scientist Jose Andres, give the salt air margarita a whirl. So new and fantastic. 

Service was intelligent and right on. She knew her menu and was on it to recommend all the good stuff.

No cheap, but worth it to have my mouth happy for an hour! 

I'll be back to try all of his spots.
