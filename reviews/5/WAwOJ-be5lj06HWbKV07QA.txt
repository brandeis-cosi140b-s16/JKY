No complaints with the food or service here. The pile of veggies I got with the veg fajitas borderlined ridiculous, but they were so fresh and tasty I somehow managed to eat the entire skillet.

Husband's tilapia/scallops/shrimp dish wasn't as healthy as he hoped. The bacon and butter sauce wasn't listed in the description. Regardless of the calories, the flavor and preparation were great. The scallops were tiny, but there was a lot of seafood on the plate for $12. 

The service was significantly above average. We never went without drinks and special requests were accommodated quickly.
