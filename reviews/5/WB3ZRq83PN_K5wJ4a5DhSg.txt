The burritos are GREAT. I'm a huge Chipotle fan and when I went to Chipotle after having Picante for a few months, I was so unimpressed. Tuesdays is $5 burrito or burrito bowl day, Thursday is Thirsty Thursday and you get a free soft drink with your burrito or burrito bowl. 

I had one of their homemade popsicles and that was pretty great too. The staff and owners are really friendly and they're nice people to brighten a day on a "blah" work day.

Totally recommend! They have burrito punch cards too! I'm 2 punch holes away from my free burrito :)
