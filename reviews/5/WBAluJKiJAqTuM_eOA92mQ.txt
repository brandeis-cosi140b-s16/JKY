Been eating their food when it was really in a backyard behind M&M and the fire station *kneeslap!*

I am a regular at this restraunt. Best tacos in the valley! HANDS DOWN!

Simple menu, fair pricing on the food, clean welcoming feeling at the restraunt.

Absolutely good food and service.

Only one problem about this place. It needs to find a bigger location to fit all the customers that go there.
