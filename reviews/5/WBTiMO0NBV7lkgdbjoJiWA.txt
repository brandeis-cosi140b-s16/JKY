While staying at The Boulders, the concierge recommended we try the Carefree Station, saying it was one of his favorite places. Then, as we were getting our car, another person working there said it was his "favorite place on the planet." A good sign!

The entrance is rather hidden and felt kind of spooky at night. You walk down this little narrow walkway. But then it suddenly opened up to a fairy tale. Dining al fresco. White Italian lights glittering against the night sky. Cheerful banter and the sound of clinking wine glasses. Is this heaven?

We managed to get an outside table -- shoot, I would have waited for one for as long as it took. Props to our server Ben who walked us through the menu and made sure we were taken care of that evening. There is the regular menu that made this place famous. However, there is a La Familia menu that started because there are a number of Mexicans that work in the kitchen. When they would cook for themselves and the staff, they would make the food they were taught as kids and the owner thought, why not offer it to patrons? So he created a dedicated Mexican menu that doesn't disappoint. 

We are chatty people and before I knew it, the manger had pulled up a chair (it was toward the end of the evening) and was offering us tastes of other items on the La Familia menu. Good lord these were awesome! I am a Mexican food nut. And this is unbelievable Mex. We even go to chat with some of the cooks and had just the most magical night I can remember in a long time. 

I know that people go to Carefree Station for their regular menu. But having had the La Familia treatment, I would never order anything but those specialties. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
