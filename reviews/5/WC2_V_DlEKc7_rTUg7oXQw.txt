Not sure what people are complaining about--this is about as authentic as it gets.

My friend and I are on a little mission we call "Taco Quest." We've been to almost every Mexican restaurant in Madison, and we are very, very critical. Guanajuatence exceeded any expectations I had, and then some. I knew we were off to a good start when the waitress barely understood my super slow, semi-clear English. Food was spectacular and the chips were very, very fresh. Salsa bar was a wonderful added bonus.

Tacos: Got the asada, campechano, and pastor. Asada was excellent and overflowing all over the place; the added cilantro and onion (traditional) topping was wonderful. Campechano was good, too. However, the pastor--holy mother of god--I dare say this was one orgasmic taco. Wonderful chunks of pineapple combined with perfectly-seasoned pork made for a simply superb experience. I'd happily make the drive back JUST for this.

To those who somehow left unsatisfied (what's wrong with you people?!)--try Mercado Marimar. It's a tiny Mexican grocery store on S. Park Street with an even smaller cantina inside. That place is excellent, too. More importantly, they both blow away the Madison "standard"--Tacqueria Guadelajara. I thought that was good, but after going to Marimar and Guanajuatence? Please.
