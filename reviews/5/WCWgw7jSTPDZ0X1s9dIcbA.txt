We had a half day off in downtown Phoenix and I decided that I would forego all of the close options and mind Mexican.  We have been on the East Coast for about 6 weeks and I need to get my fill. 
Off to Yelp I go and found La Canasta.  Exactly what I am looking for.  A 1.5 mile walk later and I am at the front door.  Uh-oh.  What does that hand-written sign say?  Close at 8:00 PM.  Out comes the phone.  Exactly 8:00 PM.  I enter anyways.  
They ask if I want food to go.  I said I would rather eat in.  No problem.  Grab a seat.  You just need to pay first.  No problem. 
They took me in with no one else in the restaurant.  
I quickly ordered and quickly had my food.  Most of it was too hot (temperature) to eat.  That is a good thing. 
I went simple with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada.  The cook came out after 5 minutes and asked me if it was all good.  He encouraged me to use the salsa in the bottle as it was great.  It was. 
Chips and salsa were super great.  Warm, light chips and 2 great salsas. 
Iced Tea was alright.  Passable.  Not best ever, but good enough. 
Service was great seeing that they let me in after they were shutting down.  This seems to be a family owned place that has been around for awhile.  Definitely worth the 3.0 mile walk in total.
