Small place with a Big Taste! I have been coming here for 25 years! The tastes exactly the same as it did 25 years ago as the place is still owned and operated by the same family. I've had about everything on the menu over the years and everything is good. Their cheese crisps are a must try appetizer as they are THE BEST in town! Not the type of place you would typically stop at as it is not fancy on the outside! However, if you do stop in you will not be disappointed. Great food at a good price. Service is good and place is clean and friendly. They use to have Mariachis on Friday nights. Not sure if they do that anymore.
