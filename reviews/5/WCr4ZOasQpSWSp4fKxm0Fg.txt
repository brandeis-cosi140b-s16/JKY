We received a gift certificate to go here, and the server (travis) knew we had enough to cover the bill prior to ordering. He not only provided us exceptional service, but also was one of the best servers we have ever had (and we go out to eat a lot!) Many servers will give you the cold shoulder when they know you aren't paying for your meal but not Travis.  The food was over the top exceptional. Hot when received, tasty and generous portions. We highly recommend this place (and try to sit in Travis' section!)
