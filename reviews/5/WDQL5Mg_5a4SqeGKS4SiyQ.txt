This food was so amazing, and tasty. Being a Chicago native, I didn't expect much because there are a lot of bad Mexican restaurants there. The tacos were filling and amazing. The drinks were ok, but my waiter was awesome. He had some great recommendations and he was super cool. Give it a try. Great food for the money.
