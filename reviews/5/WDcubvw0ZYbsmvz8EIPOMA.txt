This is a brand new Cafe Rio and I am ecstatic that they finally opened one in this area! Cafe rio has always been one of my favorite dine in mexican places!!! Of course, go for the enchilada style burrito, steak salad or shrimp taco special only on Saturdays! The BEST dealis always going to be the special of the day. Remember to bring in your stamp card for a free meal after 10 stamps. They need the strawberry lemonade in the drinks area just like the Summerlin location.
