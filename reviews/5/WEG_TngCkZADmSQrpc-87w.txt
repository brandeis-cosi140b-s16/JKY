I an so excited to be the first to review this gem!!

For those of you not in the know, this is a branch of a restaurant in Sun Prairie of the same name, with a stellar rep. I have been looking forward to their branch opening in my hood for months, and they have lived up to the hype.

This did not feel like an opening weekend at all. Décor, food, and service all felt pretty much spot on. They have a great beer selection; I got a yummy sour ale from a brewery I was unfamiliar with (Funk Session 5), which tends to impress me. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our ales while waiting to be seated. The bar area is a little cramped, but I think they've done really well provided the space.

We had a house salad, with a pesto-y vinaigrette and tons of veggies (radishes, beets, cukes, mixed greens, etc.). Very fresh. Perfect start to a meal.

We ordered the Jalapeño Asesino pizza. Omg. Fresh jalapeños, chorizo, chicken, a kind of chimichurri-style sauce drizzled on top...super flavorful, and with that perfect level of heat that doesn't blow out your taste buds, but builds slowly on your tongue. Fab.

It's pretty dangerous how close I live to this place...
