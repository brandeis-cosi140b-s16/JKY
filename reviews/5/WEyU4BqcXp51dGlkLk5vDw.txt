As I scrolled through yelp for a local place to meet my husband for lunch I stumbled across this place.  When walking in immediately I fell unloved with the decor. We were seated promptly by a very nice lady wish I could remember her name.  The food; amazing .doesn't even begin to decide how good it is.  I ordered cheese enchiladas, my super picky husband ordered chicken mole. We will definitely be back.
