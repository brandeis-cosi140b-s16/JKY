Came into town to visit my mom and had a craving for Mexican food (I'm 7 months pregnant). My mom told us she usually goes to Sylvia's across the street, but I wanted to try La Pi√±ata since it was a new spot. Our server was Daniel and he was so sweet and very easy to talk to. The food was so good! I had the create your own burro and the red sauce is divine. My husband got the mini chimichangas and loved them. Daniel kept coming back to check on us, fill up our waters and spark up some small talk. My husband and mom ordered margaritas and I was so jealous because they looked so good. This is definitely a new and upcoming place in Phx. We are in town for a few more days and will definitely be coming back before we leave!
