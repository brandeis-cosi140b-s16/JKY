This is really good place to go, I like their burrito bowl with fresh tortillas by side! Absolute fresh ingredients. Great for lunch as well, you just walk in and get food done couple minutes. Great place to go over and over. I won't be stingy to give them 5 stars considering the price, service and food they serve me!
