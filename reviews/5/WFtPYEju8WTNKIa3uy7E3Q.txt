Simple menu decent price.  I wasn't a fan of the salsa but it grew on me.  The meat is all fire grilled and cooked perfectly.  The place is packed whenever I go and it can be overwhelming, but it is worth it, the wait is not that long even when its packed.  ******Bring cash for the tip, if you tip on your credit card the owners keep it.*****
