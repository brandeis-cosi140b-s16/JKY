Where to begin? First of all, this amazing local business offers the most original "loaded" Clamato drinks I have ever seen. Huge fresh shrimp, cucumber, chamoy, sazon picoso and beef jerky???!! This is the flavor explosion that reminds me of the build-your-own Bloody Mary bar trend, only way cooler "con mucho sabor". 

I think the best part of this business (beyond their affordability, delivery option and Arcadia location), is their social media savvy. Their pictures on Instagram and Facebook make me want to jump through my phone with every one of their crazy concoctions. 

This absolutely is the snack shop the community was missing. Well done!
