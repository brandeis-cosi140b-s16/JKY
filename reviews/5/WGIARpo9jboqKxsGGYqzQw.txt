This is the real deal...  Cafe Zamora is a hole in the wall dive in "Downtown Avondale".  

Back when Bill France Jr. was alive (Bill ran NASCAR "back in the day" of Dale Sr.), anyway, Mr. France would have the Chef, Mr. Zamora go the the track (PIR) and cook for him...     Now that's cool in my book!

I like to order in Spanish...   it's funny because usually my white friends get a kick out of the whole experience.
