This is definitely one of the new hotspots to go in Chandler.
They just opened a little over a month ago and serve a fusion of Mexican and American food.

The food is good and the prices are very reasonable especially during happy hour and reverse happy hour.
The staff is super friendly and very attentive.  

On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturday they have DJs spinning on the patio. They mix everything including rock, classic rock, hip hop, house, and usually pretty good about taking requests.

Definitely check it out!
