It took awhile to find the place, circled the building three times; it is definitely a hideaway!  Yet it was so worth it.  Best green chile enchiladas I ever had.  We tried the queso and it was fabulous.  I think the best word to describe the food is flavorful.  Everyone in our party loved the place.
