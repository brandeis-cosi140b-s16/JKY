One of my "go to" places in downtown Phoenix.  Food is very good, salsa bar is excellent.  Very creative menu, so you aren't stuck with just a single filling choice in your tortilla.  House special is a fave.
Place is very small, which can be an energetic environment for a meal.  However, it can also be a bit of a pain when you want to go to the salsa bar at the same time as someone else.
