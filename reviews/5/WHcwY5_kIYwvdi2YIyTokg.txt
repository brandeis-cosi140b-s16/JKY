Cant say enough great things about this place! I love it here, the ambiance, the food , the wine, and dessert, give me everything!! I brought a friend here for their first time and they were extremely impressed with the food and our service, which Mike took great care of us! Half off bottles of wine on Sundays and Mondays! Great place for a date night with cozy booths by a romantic fireplace, and dim lighting.  I long for the day they get bring a Ribeye on their menu, but until then, the bacon wrapped scallops are a perfect starter and the filet topped with crab sauteed butter with roasted beats are a great choice!
