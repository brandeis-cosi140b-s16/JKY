Definitely the best Seafood restaurant in Las Vegas!!! The food is absolutely delicious, you will find unique flavors... A lot of variety,  so much on the menu, my faves are langostinos, recuerdame shrimp, pasta with shrimp and a special spicy kick!!, oh and did I mention homemade tortillas..!! Wow!!! Visiting this place is a must!
