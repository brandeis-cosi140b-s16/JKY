We found this place through GroupOn, and glad we did.  We have been searching for good and reasonable sit-down dining Mexican, this is it.  Great bean dip and salsa and our meals were great.  Ample servings and very tasty.  Saw 5-6 kids highchairs so I am thinking local families know of this place.  There is a separate bar area with TV;s and poker tables, and a separate dining room for families or those that prefer non-bar area to eat.  It's a little far from our home but we will be making regular return trips.  You won't be disappointed.  It is just North of the 215.  I had the Chimichanga meal (diet food - ha ha) and it was perfect.
