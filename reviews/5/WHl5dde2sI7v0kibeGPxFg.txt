Growing up and spending my most of my life in San Diego, Ca, I became accustomed to fine "Hole in the wall" Mexican food. One of my greatest disappointments upon moving to the Valley, was not being able to find the same quality of carne-a-sada burrito, quac, and salsa that I was used to. And then I found Herreras...

Pretty much the only thing I get here (because I'm a creature of habit and it's sooo good) is the Carne-a-sada burrito and a cheese quesadilla w Guac on the inside.  In fact, I've ordered it so often, this combo is now a "secret" item on the menu...all you have to do is ask for the "TN Special", the ladies there know what it is...it'll run you about $10 plus a drink cost, but it will also fill you up for the rest of the day!

Great service, great food, makes me miss San Diego just a little less...
