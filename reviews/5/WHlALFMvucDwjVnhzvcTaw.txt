This place is delicious and the service is really solid!  The Carnitas Tacos are great.  I ordered the same dish basically at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess for $34 and Senor Taco destroyed them for $6.  I am excited to continue eating here and would highly recommend you give them a try.  I'm addicted!
