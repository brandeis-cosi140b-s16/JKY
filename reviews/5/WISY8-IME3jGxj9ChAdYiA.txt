This is my favorite fast food chain in town since I can order stuff that isn't god awful for me.  I haven't eaten a big mac since the fall of 1994! 

2 piece breast/wing combo with a double order of steamed veggies always makes for a reasonable lunch...health/pricewise.  I could have the spicy avocado sauce with almost anything...might give corn flakes a try :P
