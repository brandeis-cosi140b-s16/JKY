Excellent food and more reasonably priced than the more hyped up restaurants in the Casinos. We were a party of 6 with different dietary restrictions and tastes, yet each found something they really enjoyed. Nice atmosphere, friendly service. Skip the mediocre buffets and treat yourself to a good quality culinary experience.

An unusual mariachi band will surprise you!
