Wow, what a find! Great salsa, darn good house margarita, and the Pollo Pasado was wonderful! Great place for lunch as the service was prompt and the food came out super fast! The owner Oscar came to our table and shared various salsa's with us you can tell his restaurant is his passion. I was impressed by the quality of the food. After reading other reviews I was expecting something a little more bland and less thrilling, but honestly the flavors and quality was great. My new favorite find in Gilbert. Don't hesitate to give it a try!
