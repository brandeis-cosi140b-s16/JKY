This place is the bombbbbbbb! Some may think $2/taco is kinda steep but I actually think it's worth it. Can't remember exactly but I know it was either a Friday or Saturday night when we went, and it was busy but the wait wasn't too bad. My husband and I had 3 tacos each, sampling the carne asada, spicy pork, plus horchata. Unfortunately, the horchata was just from a vending machine so it wasn't the best but like I said the tacos were def bomb and off the hook. We always look forward to hitting up Tacos El Gordo whenever we are out on the strip now!
