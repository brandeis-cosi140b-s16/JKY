Normally the service in a restaurant doesn't matter much to me, but this place has the friendliest waitstaff there is! Every time I've been, whether with my cousins' kids, mother in-law, or on a date with my wife, the folks serving us have been so welcoming, helpful, and happy. The enchiladas verdes are amazing and it's hard not to order them every time I go. This place isn't upscale, but it doesn't need to be. And, if you order anything that's not a traditional Mexican or TexMex dish (like a grilled chicken salad, for some reason), you'll regret it. But if you're down for some fantastic Mexican food with outstanding service in a very casual atmosphere, this is the place for you!
