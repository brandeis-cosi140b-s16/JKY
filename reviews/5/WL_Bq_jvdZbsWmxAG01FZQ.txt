Called in an order for one Al Pastor Burrito and one carne asada breakfast burrito to save some time.

Upon my arrival I was greeted by the owner; very friendly.  The carne asada breakfast burrito was very good and was eaten before I made it back to campus; that's how good it was.  The Al Pastor Burrito is being saved for a late lunch and possibly part of my dinner; it was also very good. 

The Al Pastor Burrito was over 7 inches!
