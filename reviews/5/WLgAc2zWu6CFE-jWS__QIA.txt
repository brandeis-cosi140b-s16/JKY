Found a new-to-us Mexican spot in Concord and loved it! They have about 10 different fajita variations and that makes me happy. Like super duper fajita happy. 

I had the Fajita Mexicana with beef, chorizo sausage, jalape√±os, dried chili peppers, mushrooms, bell peppers, and onion. 

My better half had the pork carnitas and it was equally delicious with what looked and tasted like pork three ways. 

The service was prompt and with a smile. We'll definitely come back!
