Always delicious and always there when I need it. 

Here is another place that I am a creature of habit! Side by side salad no pico and extra salsa!

Fresh and tasty.  

The side by side salad isn't on the menu, but they are always ready to make the exception and create my favorite meal.  Lettuce, mexican cheese, sliced avocado, grilled chicken drizzled with their green tomatillo salsa.  Of course I make a visit to their salsa bar and add some hot red salsa, lots of cilantro and a few squeezes of fresh lime!  

Ahhhhhh Baja Fresh...I Love you!
