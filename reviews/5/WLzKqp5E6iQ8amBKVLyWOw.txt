Great food I loved it!! Chips good not greasy and the salsa was awesome! Sure it might be a family place but the delicious food just keeps you coming back and believe me you can't resist. For all those alcohol guzzlers out there come on and give this place a chance,there has to be at least one restaurant in the whole world with no alcohol..Keep your cool and ohhh , i made a point of staring at the hostess to see if she was touching her face or anything...looking to see if she maybe had her cellphone hidden somewhere around there and guess what nope, nada!
