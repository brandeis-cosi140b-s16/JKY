Leave it to my boyfriend and I to plan a vacation and have a trip to a Mexican restaurant be our first stop.  Yep, that's us!

We read about this place in a travel guide.  The description said that we might fear our surroundings.  They were right!  There are bars on the windows!  But oh well.

Because you know you are in a good Mexican restaurant when there are more Mexican-Americans in line than anything else and you can see them making the tortillas in the background.  Oh yum, you are in for something good.

Adding to the ambiance is that your order off a very large board where there are no descriptions, only names of foods written in Spanish.  And you won't recognize LOTS of the words.  But why order a burrito when there are 15 things you've never heard of up there.  Go for some adventure!

I did and wow was it a good choice.  Delicious tamales.  Awesome pork burritos.  The rice and beans are amazing.  And they have a nice variety of Mexican fountain drinks for the adventurous.

Stop #1 on vacation was a good one.  Go and don't worry about the neighborhood ... they will know why you have come!
