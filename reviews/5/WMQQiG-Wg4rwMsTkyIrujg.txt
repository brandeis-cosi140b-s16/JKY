I love this little old place.  They are friendly and serve the kind of Mexican food one used to find often in Phoenix (but not any longer).  It remains a family-run business and they want to make sure that you enjoy yourself.  It is an older building and is a little dark, but that's part of the fun.  The food is not super spicy so is good for out-of towners who can't handle the hot stuff.  I have never had food there that was less than great, so order what you like and enjoy!
