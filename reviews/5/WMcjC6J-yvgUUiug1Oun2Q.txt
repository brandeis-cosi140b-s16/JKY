A few people have told me that La Paz just isn't the same since their move. Back in the day, they were a frequent lunch place of mine when they were on South Blvd.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but went with an open mind.

On my first visit I had the fish tacos - well one fish and one shrimp.  They were very accommodating in allowing me to try one of each.  They were good.  I would order them again.

The five stars come from my second visit.  I had the shrimp and steak salad.  They cook the steak perfectly to medium, as requested and the salad is simply phenomenal!   Their sun-dried tomato vinaigrette is delicious and was the perfect match.  If you have to eat a healthy salad, this is the one to pick.  The meat is spicy, tender and char-grilled.  

If you go to La Paz with expectations of their former self you might be disappointed.  I think they did a great job.  New look, new menu....just the name remains.  Plus, their house wine is one of my favorites.  How can that be bad?
