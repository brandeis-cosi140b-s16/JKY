My husband and I are frequent visitors to all Chipotle restaurants. I need to say that this location was the best!  Vincent, the Service Manager was excellent!  He followed through on my request and even checked on us as we were eating. Great service! Every employee was friendly and helpful. Even the music was good, which I rarely say at an Chipotle. It was a great experience and we will return often.
