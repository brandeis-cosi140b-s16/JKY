I love living closer to central Phoenix!!!  Restaurants are so much better over here!  I had tried Barrio Queen in Scottsdale a few times before getting to the Cafe.  Totally different atmospheres! Love both!
Table side guacamole is a must at both locations.  I always get the cochinita pibil and a couple margaritas but I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!
