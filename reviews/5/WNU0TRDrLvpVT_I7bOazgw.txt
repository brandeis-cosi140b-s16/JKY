My wife and I tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on Yelp. We were both raised in SoCal and wanted to try the carne asada. On our first visit we tried a carne asada burrito and had some el pastor and the carnitas tacos. We were surprised that the carne asada burrito was not as good as everyone said. It's not bad but it's just not as good everyone said. The el pastor and the carnitas tacos we had however were fabulous!! 

We went back again today and tried the El Pastor tortas and some more carnitas tacos. Both were unbelievably good! The tortas was the best I've ever had. The food tastes so fresh. The green sauce and condiments are very good. 

Finally, the couple that run the place work their butts off and are extremely friendly. 

As good as this place is I am surprised it is not busier. You should go and change that.
