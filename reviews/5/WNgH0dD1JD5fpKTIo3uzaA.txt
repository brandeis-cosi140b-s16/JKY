First and only time I had been to The Mission was for drinks at a social mixer before the group headed to another venue for dinner -- that was back in 2009. When two of my closest Chicas suggested we head here for Happy Hour, I was excited!

I was seated at the Bar and enjoyed an Iced Tea before the girls arrived. As soon as they arrived, we were seated. We were in good hands with Kristin, our Server. Appetizers were delish! I loved their Spicy Chicken Wings! Chicken Tacos were perfect! This would be ideal to bring my Partner for a nice dinner -- he would love this place.

Good friends, fabulous conversation & great food & service...Five Stars, Baby!!!
