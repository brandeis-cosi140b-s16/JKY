Let me start off by saying THANK YOU for opening one on the west side finally! I have been to the location in tempe and I live in the west valley, so I am beyond excited they opened one here! 

I read the other reviews and thankfully my experience was nothing like theirs. The line is not confusing at all... If you have ever been to chipotle then you should know exactly what you're doing in cafe rio. You go to the far end and order just like you would at chipotle. 

I got (and it is BY FAR my favorite thing to order here) the sweet pork salad. TRUST me you absolutely want to order the sweet pork. It is the perfect amount of sweet and just a TINY bit of spice. Even if you don't order a salad, get the sweet pork. Moving on... I got rice, pinto beans, lettuce, salsa, cilantro, crispy strips, guac (which isn't extra ha) and a lime wedge on the side. The tomatillo dressing is my favorite. The whole salad is on top of a giant piece of tortilla. It's mouth watering!

All 3 women who helped with my order were very friendly! The cashier gave me a punch card and explained how it worked. It was also decently busy for lunch, and as they grow, they will get busier. 

Definitely worth coming here!
