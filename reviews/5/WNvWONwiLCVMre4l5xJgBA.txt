We had a meal there on sunday-sat in the bar-we had DJ for a waiter-he was attentive and awesome-we had the most delicious food..I had the tamale with red sauce and rice & beans...its highly addictive ..the chips and salsa are fantastic.....wonderful experience....the food they serve has sooo much extra flavor it will blow your mind....
