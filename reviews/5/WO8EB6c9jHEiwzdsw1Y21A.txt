wow!  i have never been to a taco shop like this!!!!!!

outside of the restaurant looks like in the ghetto and a little hard to find.  there is parking in front, side and across the street of the restaurant.

the ambiance is really nice.  cool paintings on the wall and very small and only a few tables available.  since the restaurant is small it gets real noisy.  oh and plus a bar with seating.  during lunch this place fills up fast.

once you sit down someone will bring some chips.  next, you walk yourself over to the salsa bar to select from the 14 salsas available.  kinda cool and different.  i'm a wuss when it comes to hot stuff but gave it a shot.  i loved the strawberry salsa and it was dang good!

when you order you need to place your food order at the bar.  we ordered the mayan cochinita pibil taco and oaxaca black mole chicken shark taco.  for too adults i thought it was pricey for 2 tacos per plate with a small portion of beans & rice.  all freaking good but a little too spicy for our taste buds.  for the record we still loved it.

this place is AWESOME!
