We were looking for a good Mexican restaurant and wanted to get away from the strip, so we took to yelp and found Juan's. The chips and salsa came with some beans and grilled onions which were both a nice surprise.Three of us went, and all had different things. All excellent. The Chili Colorado, and the Carnita's were excellent. Really really good! planning to go again when we get back to Las Vegas after our Grand Canyon side trip vacation.
