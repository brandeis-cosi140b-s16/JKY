La Paz definitely has the best margaritas in town hands down. Even on a busy weekend night the service is impeccable also. They do take reservations so utilize that and you should have no problem. 

The queso is a good choice for an appetizer and while I've tried a variety of their dishes I really love their quesadillas. 

They also have different events that they host throughout the year so if you follow them on facebook you can keep up with what they have going on.
