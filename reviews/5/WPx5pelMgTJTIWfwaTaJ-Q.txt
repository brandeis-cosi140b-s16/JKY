Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.  My bassett hound got out of my yard down the street from taco bell and they were very nice to take my business card and let me know if he by chance would show up there...got home after going through the window and sans de bassett, patron saint of speed bumps was wandering up the drive way into my yard....called taco bell to thank them for caring.  And I got a sweet burro to boot!
