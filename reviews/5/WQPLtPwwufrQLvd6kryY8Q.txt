I'm from Texas and have been to many upscale Mexican restaurants. This upscale urban Taco Garage has the feeling of a modern "Taco Shack" it immediately made me feel like I was on a beach. But enough about the "home run" hitting atmosphere. The tacos at this place are out of this world great. They make me feel like I could rise up to any occasion after eating. From breakfast tacos to quesadillas this place is a sure fire slam dunk. Not to mention their amazing Craft, Mexican, and domestic beer selection. You will never leave Sir. Veza's feeling hungry or thirsty. All around home run.
