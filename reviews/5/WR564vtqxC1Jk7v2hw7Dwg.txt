This is one of those places i used to go to with a friend every weekend.  After dozens of visits i can easily say this is one of the best Mexican restaurants i have been to.  The portions are great, the food is always good with excellent variety.  The staff are always nice and are on top with whatever you need. Their seafood cocktails are mind blowing.  It has been a while since i have been there since i have moved, but give a shot.
