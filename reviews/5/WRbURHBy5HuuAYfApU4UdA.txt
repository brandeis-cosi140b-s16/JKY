My son and I went to Blanco this evening.  It was amazing.  The restaurant itself was clean and open & airy.  Our server was wonderful.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  She also went above and beyond.  When it came time to box up my leftovers, she gave me extra salsa without me asking.  In a time where customer service is seriously lacking, it's the little touches that stand out.

Now for the food: the chips and salsa were very good and the burrito was absolutely delicious.  Not to mention the rice was the best I have had a Mexican restaurant.

I am not from the Scottsdale area but would definitely come back when I am in town to visit my son.
