I had a great experience here at Yolo's Mexican Grill! I would consider it the best restaurant that we visited during our trip! I mean it's not super fancy or anything but the atmosphere was great, the food was great, the customer service was awesome!

Our server, Todd (i believe), was extremely nice. They make the guacamole right in front of you which is fun! It was hella good! The chips were hot and fresh!! Then when you add the freshly made guacamole.... OH MAN! I can't even describe... lol You definitely need to order it if you eat here!

They had a lunch special with a salad and an entree for 12.99 i believe... that is what my friend and i did. You can also add a margarita to your lunch for 3.99 which is great!

Our server was great with making sure that everything i ordered was made vegan friendly and he was extremely nice about it! It is amazing how much your server's kindness can affect your experience at a restaurant! Anyway, i ordered a salad minus the sprinkled cheese that was on top and i also got the veggie enchiladas without cheese.. The rice and black beans were also vegan. The food was amazing and i was super excited to be eating a REAL meal after the previous day of eating nothing but bland, cooked vegetables at other restaurants because those were the only veggie options they had.

If you're staying at the Planet Hollywood Resort or you just want a good lunch.. come here! =)
