Cabo Fish Tacos is as good as it gets. My husband and I probably come here about once to twice a month (ok....maybe more!). 

Just some notes to consider:
-There is pretty much ALWAYS a wait. They don't take reservations in advance...I think they want to keep that low-key mentality intact. Though, you can put your name on the list and hop around to the many bars, art galleries, stores, and wine placse in NODA. They will text you when your table is ready.
-The crab dip is the best appetizer on the menu. Get it.
-I always get the BBQ Mahi tacos (and so does my husband). Every time I venture off that track, I regret it because I know what I like...and that is BBQ Mahi. Their tacos are the best and you can mix and match.
-For sides, we usually get fruit or the refired beans (depending on if we are trying to be "healthy" or not haha. Beware, that the refried beans are the typical tasting slop they give you at most typical Mexican restaurants. It has a different flavor and is a bit spicy.
-This is more tex mex than mexican....if you want a crap ton of floured wraps wrapped in some kind of meat covered in cheese and sauces.....this isn't the place (Not to say that meat wrapped in tortillas covered in cheese and sauces is a bad thing......I love Mexican too!)
-The vibe inside is chill, not nice. No need to look fancy. 
-Usually they have pretty good drink specials.
