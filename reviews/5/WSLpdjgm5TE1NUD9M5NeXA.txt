We have finally found our favorite Mexican restaurant since moving here last November. We had tried a few other well-rated Mexican restaurants in the area & just weren't impressed, but now the search is over! We just bought an entertainment book & I was excited to see the coupon in there b/c Coyote's was next on our to-try list.

We went on a Tuesday & there were a few tables occupied but not many which is to be expected on a Tuesday. We were seated right away & immediately given warm tortilla chips with salsa & bean dip. My DH & kids devoured the bean dip & I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa. In fact, I need to call them & find out if they will sell me a container, it was that good. 

The menu was extensive & I had quite a hard time deciding. My hubby usually always orders a combo plate & after asking our waitress for suggestions, he decided on a Chile Relleno & Chicken Burrito combo ($12.99) He was served an enormous plate of food & said he was glad he only ordered a 2-item combo & not 3! The burrito was filled with melt in your mouth chicken that had been cooked in a verde sauce. The chile relleno was one of the biggest I'd seen & although the breading was a little too thick for my taste, it was still really good & extra-spicy, just the way I like it! 

I finally decided on the Chicken & Steak Fajitas ($17.49-ish.. can't remember the exact price) since I wasn't really in the mood for anything too saucy or covered in cheese. They were some of the best fajitas I've ever had. The seasoning was perfect & the portion was huge! I brought half home for today's lunch. mm mm mm I really liked that they served it with plenty of veggies, it's one of my favorite things about fajitas. Sometimes you get fajitas & it's mostly meat & hardly any veggies. Not so at Coyote's. 

Our waitress, Flavia (sp?) was very friendly & explained to us that they were a family run business that had been around for 20 years & that everything is homemade, down to the tortilla chips. I really like that in a business & we will definitely be back!
