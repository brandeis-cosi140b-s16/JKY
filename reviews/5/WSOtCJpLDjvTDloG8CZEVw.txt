There will be more reviews to come, but I have only had the shredded beef burrito and it was amazing!  I was a little disappointed it didn't come with cheese, but dealt with it because the taste was so great.  Just ordered my second shredded beef burrito and added all the fixings.  We've been looking for great Mexican place in town and have only found one other place,(Lindo Michoacan) where we spend a massive amount.  This is great Mexican food, made by very nice people and hard to find here in Vegas for their great prices.
