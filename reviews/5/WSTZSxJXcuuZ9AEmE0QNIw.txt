I come here a few times a week for the chips and salsa and shrimp tacos.. The horchata is the BEST in the area...they have fresh limeade and pineapple juice that they make daily..

I recommend any chicken dish since they spice it so good... The taquitos are a great value and a meal in itself $3.99.. Now fir the best shrimp tacos in the world... The shrimp are seasoned and grilled ( not fried), juicy and it cones with a big slice of avocado and fresh pico on the taco.. I could eat 6 of these and still want more.

This is a small family owned joint and the owners are friendly and keep the place really clean. I just can't say enough about this place... I LOVE it... It's like going to an old friends house and being treated with TLC... Oh and the police like to eat here too, so I feel pretty safe
