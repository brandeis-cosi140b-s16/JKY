I give this place a good 5 stars!!! First the place wasn't busy at all when we went, and this was our first time there so we were a little skeptical. But then we were reassured by the good service we received. The lady was kind of quiet and not super enthusiastic but she was playful and very attentive. 
Now... the FOOD! we got the Bulgogi burrito and Bulgogi Beef Nachos. The burrito was alright, good flavor and what not. But the NACHOS were insanely delicious :) It was like the perfect combination of flavors! 
I can definitely say this visit was a success and I am beyond satisfied with the service and the food. We will be back soon!
