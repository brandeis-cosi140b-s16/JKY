This place is the real deal! Lots of "gourmet taco" restaurants around these days and they're for the most part good. But this place seems more like a gourmet taco place you would find in Mexico. Real  authentic ingredients put together in different ways. I had the shredded pork tacos. The pork was so tender and flavorful, they didn't even need salsa added to them. speaking of salsa, this place features a salsa bar with around a dozen different salsa varieties: jicama salsa, peanut salsa, radish salsa, just to name a few of the crazy ones. To top it off, there's some pretty amazing artwork on the walls. Even the bathroom doors are beautiful. This place is a must try! I'll definitely be back
