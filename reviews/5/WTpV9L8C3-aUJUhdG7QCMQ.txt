Another bad habit in the making.  Bust my ass for 12 hours at work, skip breakfast, skip lunch, off to the gym and i'm damn hungry - what's a guy to do ?  Los Parados is on the way to the gym - how about a super taco ?  $2.50 for a nice jolt to the system - energize me baby !!

Give me a couple tortillas , melt some cheese on top, making the tortilla a lil crispy around the edges, nice lil heap of pork, some cilantro, some slices of juicy pineapple a dollop of sour cream.  While they're making my masterpiece, i'm at the salsa bar dipping carrots into some delicious salsas.  

My kind of habit
