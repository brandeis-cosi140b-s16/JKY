Seriously friendly service!
Greeted with a big smile from happy and courteous staff who made everything we wanted to order.
The only thing I've ever had here are the fish tacos (BEST OF VEGAS!) and they're great with their in-house chipotle ranch sauce. Wife had the chicken tacos and she rated them excellent.
While we didn't order beer because it was too early for us, we do appreciate that they have it on offer for a future, later-in-the-day meal. Bonus: they have one of those soda machines where you can get any and all varieties of soft drink. Vanilla Diet Coke satisfies every time.
The atmosphere is cool, modern and, most importantly, clean.
