Phenomenal Mexican food. We lived in Phoenix for nearly 9 years and this was our go-to spot to bring visitors. Great prices, outstanding food, quick and polite service. This place has it all. We are in town visiting as I write this and we had to make a stop. The chicken flautas were as good as I remember and the six halves? Mouthwatering.
