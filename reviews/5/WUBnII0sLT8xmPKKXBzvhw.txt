Best tacos I've ever had, hands down.  Also the smallest, but that's okay because they were so damn good.  They were perfect.

The Mission does a wonderful job of combining various Latin cultures' cuisine into a dish to make it their own.  I got the chicken tacos, which sounds boring, but they were extraordinary.  They are served with an aji amarillo sauce.  Aji is a common Peruvian pepper, which has a wonderful and unique flavor, but I've never seen it on tacos before, since tacos aren't part of Peru's cuisine.  That's what I love about this place--they married the Mexican and Peruvian cultures and made something delightful out of the union.  

I can't wait for an opportunity to go back and try their arepas.  The pabellon has my mouth watering already!
