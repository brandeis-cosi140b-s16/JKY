Sabor means flavor. And that's what you'll find at this quick-casual joint, a Three Amigos concept replacing the previous occupant-a withering Phat Burrito.

We stopped in on Saturday, and were probably the first customers in the door at just before noon. We stepped up to the counter, in awe of the menu options described on the screens above the counter. We ordered arepas, pupusas and empanadas, along with tacos. Oh, and of course our favorite appetizer: chips and guac.

After ordering, we stepped up to the soda fountain and poured our own soft drinks. In a few minutes, our food was ready. 

To be honest, I know very little about Latin street food, but I do know what tastes good, and everything we tried was incredibly delicious. I'd have to say that the arepas and pupusas were my favorites out of the lot.

Make sure you order multiples of menu items-arepas, pupusas and empanadas come in portions of one. I should have ordered two each of the arepas and pupusas. So stinking delicious.

Vegetarians won't go hungry here, as there are numerous options available. I am really a fan of this place, and can see it filling quickly with those seeking inexpensive and piquant food. It's none too fancy, which is the way I like it.

I'm looking forward to going back...hopefully tomorrow!
