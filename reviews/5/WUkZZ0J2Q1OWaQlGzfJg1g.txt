Best Green Chili burro in the valley. I eat at both locations a few times a month. I love Carolina's but Rito's Green Chili is better. I actually prefer the new location because the burritos are bigger and you can always get taco's.

If finding great Mexican food is your goal, check it out, you will not be disappointed.
