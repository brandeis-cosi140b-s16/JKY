I could write a one-line review of this place--

$10 for two cheese enchiladas, rice and beans, sopapilla, and a Mexican coke equals a happy belly. 


But I'll elaborate a bit.

Yes, it is a great deal. Yes, the flavors are delicious. But the real winner here is the green chili sauce. Is this Adderall? No, it's Carlito's green chili. This sauce makes you feel good all over, like you were donating money to charity or listening to George Michael (both of which I did on the day in question, so obviously it was a super good day). 

What I liked second best about the place was not its sopapilla (but really, eat that thing first when it comes out when it's hot and melty--it's not as good cold) or its Mexican coke (hands up if you h8 high fructose corn syrup) but how you can pick your sides. I'm not one for refried beans, but black beans make my heart sing out with joy, so getting to be all democratic and have a choice in my Mexican side dishes is casting a vote and knowing your candidate will win and be successful in office--I rocked that vote, my friends.

All of this is to say, try this place out. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere (as much as something can be in Vegas can be in this sea of suburbia, amirite?) but if you seek it out, you won't be disappointed.
