Los Antojos just got a killer review by John Curtas:  eatinglasvegas.com  http://www.eatinglv.com/2009/07/los-antojos/  Congratulations!   This is actually it's 2nd great article in a couple of weeks -- the first as a shout out from Alex Stratta in Las Vegas Weekly.

If only all the great mom & pop places in Vegas/Henderson, could get their 15 minutes -- 

oh right, that's what Yelp's supposed to be...but all you bozos keep writing about are the big strip joints to get your review counts up.  And the rest have covered In n Out enough to last an eternity.   Oh, and don't forget the myriad of idiots who order wrong at Lotus, then trash it.  Seriously, you think we can't tell...?!

Please, people.  Broaden your horizons.  There are great gems still waiting to be discovered.
