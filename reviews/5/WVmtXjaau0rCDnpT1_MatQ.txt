I used this restaurant for a corporate team building dinner and paint event. There was mixup with the event coordinator who booked us at the other location. I was very stressed as I had about 30 people counting on dinner and the other location was 45 minutes away. This location was able to work with me to allow us to have the event there even though they were not expecting us. The staff was very friendly, helpful, courteous, attentive, etc. My team really enjoyed the food, beverages, and service. I would definitely come here again.
