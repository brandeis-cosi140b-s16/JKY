My favorite place for chips and salsa! They are served with red and green salsa and a side of smooth refried beans. The green salsa is my favorite as it is more of a sweet salsa rather than spicy.

I usually get the taco salad with shredded chicken and my son usually gets the kids bean and cheese burro. The chicken is very tender and juicy. Just the right amount to fill you up without getting stuffed. 

If you live in Gilbert, it is definitely the place to go for great Mexican food :)
