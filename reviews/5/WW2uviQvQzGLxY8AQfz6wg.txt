I have been to a few Zabas around the valley and I have got to say this is the best one around. First of all if you haven't already been to a Zabas you are really missing out. The food is absolutely delicious and you will not be sorry with just about anything on the menu. My personal favorite is the chicken bowl with sweet potatoes and rice but from the fish tacos to the burritos you will not be dispointed.
