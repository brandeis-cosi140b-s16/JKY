Let's be clear- the 5 stars is about the food and the service.  This isn't a fancy 5 star restaurant but that's not what the stars mean on Yelp- as we all (should) know!

We moved here from Southern California in August, so it's safe to say we've had our share of excellent traditional Mexican food.  Since our first trip to Maize we go there at least once a week- it's so good.

BE PREPARED: Parking can be a problem and it's almost always packed.  People frequently come in and order for takeout. In our experience, by the time we order a seat almost always clears up.  We have never taken it to go.  If you eat there, you get free (freshly made!) chips and salsa while you wait for your food.  Since it's just the two of us, we have always been lucky.  If you have a big group, I'd suggest ordering it to go and eating at home or having a picnic.  You can call your order in too, which is nice.

The food is always ready super fast, so even if you order to go, you won't wait long.  

The staff is extremely kind and happy to answer questions if you're not sure what something is.  I've tried many things on the menu but keep coming back to the tacos- chicken or fish are my fav- because of the RIDICULOUSLY amazing corn tortillas.  So. Good.

Word on the street is that they'll be opening a larger location near the Amtrak in Champaign soon.
