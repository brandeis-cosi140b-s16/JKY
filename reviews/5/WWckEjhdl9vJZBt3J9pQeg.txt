Came in for happy hour on a Wednesday and Opted to sit outside instead of at the bar. Patrice took great care of us. We enjoyed their $5 happy hour margaritas, the guys I was with got the $1.99 daily tacos, and I had one of the most delicious vegetable tacos of my life. I will be back for the great service and yummy tacos.
