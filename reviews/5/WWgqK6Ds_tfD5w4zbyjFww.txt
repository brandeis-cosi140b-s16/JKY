What an incredible find!
As most Phoenicians already know, most mexican restaurants in the greater Phoenix area are mediocre at best. This place is exceptional!
The quality and flavor of the food is beyond that of any fine mexican restaurant. To be sure - THIS restaurant is indeed a "Fine Mexican Restaurant"!!!
If good food is what you are after - check it out.
My family and coworkers will be regulars.
