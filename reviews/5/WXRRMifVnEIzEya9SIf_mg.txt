So I have been going to salsas for 7 years now, usually 3x a week if we are being honest. Then i realized I have never written a review, shame on me. It is honestly the best Mexican food, and you can't beat the price. The owners and staff are like family. It is authentic and everything is great, but I pretty much live off the bean&cheese burros and green chicken enchiladas. I dare you not to become a regular!!
