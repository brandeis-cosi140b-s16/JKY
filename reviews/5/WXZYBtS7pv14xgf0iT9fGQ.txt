Loved this place I give it 5*****s!! Best burritos in town! Tortillas made fresh just like at home and their meat tender, moist and flavorful! Just how Mexican food should be. I am Mexican cook everything from scratch so I know how it should be. Been to so many other so called Mexican restaurants but this is by far the best!!! Lucky it's in Queen Creek! Will be coming back again!!!!
