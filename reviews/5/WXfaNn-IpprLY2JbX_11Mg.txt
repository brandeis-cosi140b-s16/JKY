No joke. I had a dream about Komex last night. Let's just say, it was my version of Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. Stoned out of my mind, I was chowing down on bulgogi fushion tacos one after another...And then my stupid alarm goes off...F*** me...Coincidentally, this morning my sister insists me to get her a Pork Fushion Burrito after school. 

So I head over to Komex around 1:45 only to find out that they're closed from Dec. 15- Dec. 26!!!!

Ahhhhhh!!! Are you F****** kidding me?!? I totally forgot about that...sigh
But what am I gonna do without Komex for almost two weeks?

In all seriousness, this place is amazing. Not the most ambient of places (what do u expect from a taco shop) but very reasonable prices, friendly service, and just delicious food. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Their fushion (Korean-style) tacos and burritos are one of kind. And make sure you get kimchi added to your tacos or burritos for the extra zesty flavor.
