I wish I had this place on a daily basis. Ginormous, amazing portions of food. We went there twice with 3 - 5 people so we tried 8 - 10 different dishes, all spectacular. The bartender hooked us up with awesome margaritas. We had our photo taken and given a free souvenir postcard :) Every dish was superb, the staff was nice, food came quickly. Yummy chips & salsa beforehand which they generously replenishes. All in all, a wonderful place.
