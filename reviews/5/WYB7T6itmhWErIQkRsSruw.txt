Susie's is my local "go-to" for some bomb Mexican grub. The place itself is pretty straight forward - low priced, clean, fast, busy and reliable. 

I found it through Yelp when I moved to the area and after my first visit, the search for my local mexi-spot ended.

Burrito's are legit. Homemade tamales are AMAZING. Try and enjoy! GOOD FOOD is what I'm going for and they have it!!
