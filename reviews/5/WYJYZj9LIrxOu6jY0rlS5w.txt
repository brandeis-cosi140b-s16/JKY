THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR BREAKFAST!  We had been going to dicks for awhile now and one day we walked in and they said that it was full that morning,  and the waitress told us that Richardson's was up the road.  We never knew this was there.  

We usually order the french toast which is AMAZING both Dicks and Richardson's serve the same breakfast.  

Service is great and the coffee is even better!
