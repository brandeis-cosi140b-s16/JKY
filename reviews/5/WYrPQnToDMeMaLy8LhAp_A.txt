If you want a lot of food then this is the place  to go. I always have leftovers. However, I ask for almost everything in my burrito bowl so it is full! If you only like meat, rice, and bean you're bowl won't be as full. Also depends on who makes your bowl. Some times I have people who are very gracious on portions and others are stingy. I have had very good luck with this particular chipotle though. 
We also like to get chips with our burrito bowls... They give you very few chips in a bag. They used to give you a lot :-/ kind of a bummer.
