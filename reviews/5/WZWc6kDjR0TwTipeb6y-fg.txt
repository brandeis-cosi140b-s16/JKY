I recently moved, and I now live very close to the strip mall where this place is located. I was thinking about going to the Subway...I'm glad I didn't. The food is prepared fast, the ingredients taste fresh, and the staff is very friendly. I had a carne asasa burrito and it was very good. I will return!
