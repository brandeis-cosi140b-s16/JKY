Ok, I love it here. The end. There is so much right going on with this place. I admit that most of the feelings that it brought for me dining there had to do with the flashbacks I got of my childhood in Texas. 

Admittedly, the dishes are very much Silvana's creations,  however ask the ingredients come together to produce an explosion of nostalgia.

The drinks are great. I had the OG Margarita,  my mom had a mojito and both treated awesome. They have a variety of Mexican sodas, not just the typical coke. 

I had the Maya torta, and is was awesome. It came with steak fries that had a chile seasoning on them that made all the difference. My mom had a Chile poblano relleno and my sister a torta asada. 

The music they were playing was authentic Mexican abs not just rancheras, but pop and cumbias. I wanted to stay forever. The service was great. It felt very laid back. They do take a little longer than usual,  but we didn't mind. We enjoyed the experience very much. I love that it's at the yard, so the people watching situation is on point. 

The only thing that I would like us not to have to use the valet parking. I rather park my own car, but i can see why they have that option since it gets so busy. Also, interesting bathrooms for anyone that hasn't been to the Yard before. They have separate stalls for men and women but the sinks to wash your hands are communal. Never thought is mind that, but it is slightly weird to look into the eyes of a guy in the mirror while washing my hands. Must be all the years of being conditioned for seperate bathrooms or maybe I shouldn't be staring into s man's eyes in the bathroom mirror.

Anyway, my point is,  come to Barrio Urbano, enjoy the awesome food,  but don't come here if you want to be in and out. It's not that type of place she that is perfectly okay.
