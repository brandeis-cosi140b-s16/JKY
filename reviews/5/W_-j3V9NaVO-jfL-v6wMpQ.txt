Chinese Mexican? Really? My coworkers took me here and boy was I glad they did.

I love that they let you sample stuff before ordering. Smart move!

My first trip I got the jade chicken with the carnitas in a quesadilla. Comes with rice, beans and a snickerdoodle. For a great price, you can buy a meal big enough for 2.

That red chicken...THAT CHICKEN! It is perfectly glazed, with enough crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor. The carnitas broke my mouth it was so good. And that snickerdoodle! It was so good, we bought a bakers dozen. 

My second trip I tried the emerald chicken. I normally hate cold ginger chicken. It's all in that sauce and they perfected that recipe.

I love that they serve their meals in a foil take out pan. If you can't finish it, you grab a lid and go. Nice.

If only they could open one in Hawaii....
