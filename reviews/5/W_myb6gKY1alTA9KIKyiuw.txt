Not only is this place great for a quick and tasty Mexican dinner, but the employees here are FANTASTIC as well! My husband and I frequent J-Too a lot, I didn't realize how much until today. My husband was on his way home from work, and unfortunately was hit by a red light runner right in front of this restaurant. When I arrived to the scene, one of the employees came out and gave us some cold water bottles, and then said he remembers us from when we dine in, he said he was sorry to see the accident and hopes my husband recovers quickly, then he offered us a discount on dinner. His kindness was so appreciated during this stressful and scary time! Then, while we were eating our meal another customer's car battery died, and I think the manager offered to find jumper cables and help charge their battery. It was so cool to experience and see these guys go the extra step! We'll be back! Thanks again!!
