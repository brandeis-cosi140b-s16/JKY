This place is pretty great. I dig half chicken meal. Staff was cool. The salsa bar was clean with all fresh salsa. Their bacon is so good and the chicken reminds me of the awesome chicken I had in Puerto Rico a long time ago. Flavor all the way down in the meat not just on the outside like some places. I'll be back here often.
