Always friendly fast service, and the place is usually very clean.  No matter what time of day, the food seems fresh and they are great about the quantity of carne asada for example, so you always feel like you got a good value for the money.

Wish they had a drive through, but it's worth walking inside compared to Don TortacNO just down the street.

Go Roberto's!
