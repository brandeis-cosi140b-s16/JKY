Mmmmmm shrimp tacos.  I used to live in the Bajio in Mesa.  I feel like I was there once a week.  My favorite Mexican food.  The shrimp tacos have a honey sauce that is to die for and the tortillas are cooked on the griddle just long enough to keep them from getting soggy.  Really good stuff.  Plus the queso is wicked good.  This location is a bit pricier than the old Mesa one was but at least it is still open.  They also serve beer out here because it's not Mesa.  Much love for the No.Pho Bajio...just wish it wasn't so far.
