Pronounced (Chew-Ease). Sat at the bar. Chips and Salsa served. Really good Salsa that was Spicey but really chunky too. Bartenders were very friendly and recommended the Steak Burrito and I have to say was probably the best Burrito I've had. Prices are very reasonable and the food was really fresh and good. Regular price on Mexican Beer was 3.75 and a shot of top shelf Tequila was 7.75. Excellent prices considering they are a block from the Mall.
Overall great food and drinks and friendly service. I recommend this Restaurant highly. You won't be disappointed.
