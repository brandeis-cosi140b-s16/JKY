Great place to stop and get some very Flavorful mexican take out.

I drove passed this store front many of time always wanting to check it out.  Finally for lunch i was able to stop and see what they had.    There is a lot to choose from and they have pictures all over the wall to see what you want to order.

I got the california burrito. It was massive and had some of the best flavor I could have wanted . I highly recommend stopping by and checking this place out. I know ill be back to sample more of their offering. 

They also make the orders really quick too.
