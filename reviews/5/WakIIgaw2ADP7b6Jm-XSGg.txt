Not even a week old and already impressing me sooo much!!!!

So the name is pretty catchy n fun but let me tell you this gentlemen takes REAL Mexican food cooking pretty serious. You can choose to go to your nearest Del taco if you want those fake Mexican crunchy tacos (hey their not bad) but if you want a real taco with fresh ingredients, good flavor and authentic Mexican sazon then you will be in heaven at Desnudo tacos!!! Or should i say in Mexican folklore heaven, in deed they have the nicest small dinning area filled with dia de los muertos art. I say indigenous meets rock n roll kinda feeling!!! Their menu is simple but full of flavor just like your typical taqueria (tortas,tacos,burritos etc) but with a sort of flavor injection to everything they serve!

 We will for sure be returning to try their soups, aguas and tortas.. For now we are beyond satisfied with our tacos de tinga, verde rice and cali  burrito.. The flavor of this place is super sabroso and I applaud them for being unique and traditional. I must say probably the best Mexican food in Las Vegas, now go before they end up with lines so long you will hate to stand in them!!
