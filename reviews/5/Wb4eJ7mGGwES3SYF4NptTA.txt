Let's address those who give this place a few stars and say it is dark and gloomy. These persons were obviously expecting something else. I happen to appreciate that somethings do not change. The Florentino Room is a dank and dark bar lined with Ezra Brooks decanthers worth more than your lunch. The food, good. You go here because this is El Charro, a tradition with good and long time Arizona families. If you and yours are from                , well, we can't help it can we?
