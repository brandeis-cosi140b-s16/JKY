Have been here numerous times since I discovered it just over a year ago.  Prices are great for a State Street Location, food is good, mix of mild and spicy and staff is friendly.  

I love the quesadillas and sopes, they make the masa shells for these in house, and they are sooo good.  It can get crowded later at night since the place is small, but they offer take out which a lot of their customers get.
