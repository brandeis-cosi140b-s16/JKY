Always delicious fast Mexican food.  We have had a range of things that have always tasted fresh and very good flavors.  Their rolled tacos are filled with a lot of meant, rice and beans are really good authentic.  The green chile pork is a favorite as well, but so is the red chile.  Definitely give it a try if you're in the area.  You can eat there, which is really spacious and clean.  Or you can order the drive through which they're also pretty quick.
