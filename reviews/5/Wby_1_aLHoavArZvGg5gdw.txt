$9 for a plate of beef fajitas (good size serving definitely!), choice of beans so I took pinto, guacamole, sour cream and presented better than if I had gone to a white tablecloth Mexican place and paid $19 for the same meal!  Damn, but I love the food at Baja Fresh to begin with, but this place is fantastico!!!!
How I wish I were only 40 years younger, went to ASU and could chase the young boys......sigh...but I can't, so I am satisfying myself with a dee-licious and cheap plate of steak fajitas at Baja!
Believe me, as long as I have my original teeth, I'll be back!!!!
