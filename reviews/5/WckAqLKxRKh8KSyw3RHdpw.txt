Chipotle is the pinnacle of human salvation. People try to say "Oh dude, that's corporate" but those people aren't people, they're slaves to illusions. Chipotle just gets me, it speaks to my soul. We discuss dreams and life bite after bite. As it digests deeper in my body and fully integrates with my soul I feel as one with the earth. I realize sitting there in my chair with reggae music in the backdrop.. I suddenly realize everything I am and eat is infinitely old. 

                                              I sit there and think

                                       we are all made of stardust
