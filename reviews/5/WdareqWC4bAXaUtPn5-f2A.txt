Yum!! I had the vegetarian tacos and my husband had the steak fajita. The flavor was delicious and the portions were perfect for lunch. The atmosphere was gorgeous! We sat on the patio amongst the "trees" and the misters kept us a perfect temperature even in the Vegas summer heat. Our waitress was attentive, always refilling our waters even bough they leave you with a carafe of water. She also offered espressos when the meal was complete. Excellent food and excellent service!
