Was in the area and made a spur of the moment stop as we were hungry. I ordered the chili rellenos and taco plate, and my husband a chimichanga plate. Both were very good! The chips were also great, very light and crispy. Much better than any of the chain Mexican places. The place was small but clean and friendly. Was so glad we stopped!!
