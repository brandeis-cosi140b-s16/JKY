How great it is to finally have a Southern Californian style Mexican restaurant here in Pittsburgh. The food is everything in flavor and stands true to a M-experience. Their house made hot sauce is fantastic, ask for it if you want to add to your mexperience. Service was an A-Plus; I see someone reviewed it as having no wait-staff, but, they deliver your food to table and will bus the table as well. This is a place I can't wait to eat my way through the menu. Enjoy!!
