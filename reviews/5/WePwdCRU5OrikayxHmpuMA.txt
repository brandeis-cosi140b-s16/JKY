This is one of the best places in Vegas. Their food is unique. Their specialty is seafood, Mexican style. The food pairs well with a beer. Make sure to come hungry because the portions are big. I recommend to try the Mojarra Loca. By the way, all the staff is professional and well looking, which is a plus.
