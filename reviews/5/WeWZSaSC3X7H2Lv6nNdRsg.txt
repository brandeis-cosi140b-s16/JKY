The very first time I tried Rubios was when my family came to visit me out here. my dad told me to meet him and my family here for lunch as they awaited for me. At first I just thought it was going to be a regular Mexican Taco place. But boy was I wrong.. Rubios is probably one of my favorite places to go to in Vegas. After living here for a couple years already and never knew or heard about them I was so mad that I never came to their place. Their food is amazingly delicious and you will not have any regrets. My girlfriend's family came to visit her as well and I brought them to Rubios to try and they loved it so much that they "forced" me to take them there again before they left. For any person visiting Las Vegas, I would highly, highly recommend giving Rubios a taste that you will never forget.
