Hands down the best tacos in Charlotte.  Try the Al Pastor, a spicy pork taco.  I've also had the Pollo soup and the scrabbled eggs with Chorizo.  If you want authentic, then this is it. 

The service is always great too.  All the ladies speak great English so you won't feel intimidated.  And they are really polite.  

So if you're in the area and you want some good, scratch that... GREAT Mexican food then come check this place out.
