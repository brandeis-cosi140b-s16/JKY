Great food and good service,atmosphere. Only been twice so far, once for lunch with one son, fast, relaxing and delicious food, The chips and salsa are homemade and really great flavor. I drug my sister and nephew in the other night with my other 2 boys and they all loved it, my oldest son 17 loves Mole pollo and is particular about it, the owner/our waitress gave him a nice sampling to try it and he loved it! I just can't mix Chocolate and meat! Great alternative in North Mesa to the chains along Power road!
