This will definitely be my new must have when in Vegas. It's a little ways off the strip but not crazy far and you'll be happy and satisfied that you went. Exceptional service and well put together combination plates that you can have a combination of pork, carne asada and chicken. You're full before you even begin from the chips, salsa, bean dip and soup. Lindo Michoacan, your family recipes are sacred!
