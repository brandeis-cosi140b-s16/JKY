Deliciously filling tacos.  I was hesitant to try it but after expressing my gluten "allergy" they seemed receptive to my request for the cook to change gloves before making my food.  I've had no issues with gluten contamination with the tacos (corn tortillas) or the chips and salsa.  Its definitely a local favorite and always packed so calling in carry-out is a great option!
