Been here twice now and each time has been excellent and memorable. The employees are personable and really make the experience enjoyable and beyond satisfying! They're quick and on top of things. The food is super tasty and arrives fresh and hot. I've had the seafood enchilada and the spinach enchilada and I'm looking forward to trying more of their options. And if you're looking for a great Margarita, get it here! It's a nice atmosphere with comfortable dim lighting and decor. Overall, Manuel's has given me one of the best experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.
