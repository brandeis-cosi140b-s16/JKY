If you're looking for cheap, authentic Mexican food, this is the place. Yeah, the place isn't the greatest-looking place to eat, but the food is fresh and flavorful. I really like the different choices of meat on the menu besides just chicken and beef. My friends and I ordered some chips and guacamole as starters and the guacamole was very fresh. 

In addition, the place is also a grocery store with meat, spices, avocado, and etc. The price isn't too bad at the grocery store at all. The avocado seems fresher than the ones you would buy at the big chain grocery stores. If you want a recommendation on something from the grocery store, I would ask the owner who works there. He's super nice and friendly.
