It's the best "Mexican" food restuarant in Tempe. It's quick and we have been going here for over 11 years now. My family has been loyal to this restuarant since they've moved locations 3 times now. I personally love their red sauce and bomburro burrito. Their taquitos and guacamole are amazing and so are their crunchy tacos. It's not traditional mexican food, butit's tasty and their soda is always fresh. I don't always eat Mexican-American food, but when I do, it's Salazar Bros!
