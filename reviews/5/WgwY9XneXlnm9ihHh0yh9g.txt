Went here for lunch the other day and got the spinach enchiladas. They were excellent and there was a large amount of food. The chips and salsas that started my meal were excellent. I'm a sucker for a nice thin, crispy tortilla chip and the bean dip in particular was really good also. 

I ordered one of each the cream sauce and the green. And I preferred the cream mainly because I are too much of the hot sauce and the cream sauce helped to cool down the heat. The sides were rice and corn so overall it was a very loaded plate. 

And they were fast. I was well fed and done in less than an hour and able to get back to my day. I'll be back :)
