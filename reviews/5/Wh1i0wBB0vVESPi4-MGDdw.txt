A gem of a place in Pittsburgh for Mexican food. This was our first visit and the place did not disappoint us. We are sure to visit here again to try the other items on the menu.

Their portions are pretty big and for the price, I would say it's cheap! It's not like any other restaurant, simple interiors, good enough chairs to sit and enjoy the food.
