There's something abut this location that I love.  The food is always tastier.  The portions are always larger.  The staff are always friendlier.  The architecture is more unique than other locations.    

Maybe it's more appealing because I typically stop by this Chipotle after hitting the gym, when I'm absolutely famished.  Yet again, maybe the food's just made with more love.  (Not that I've ever had a bad meal at Chipotle...)  I'll gladly drive a little out of the way to dine at this location.

Right now I'm hooked on the chicken salad.  I'm very picky about my toppings and  they're always very accommodating.  Side of brown rice?  Check.  Separate containers of two salsas?  No problem.  A teensy bit of cheese?  You got it!  True Chipotle consistency, with a little bit more pizzazz.
