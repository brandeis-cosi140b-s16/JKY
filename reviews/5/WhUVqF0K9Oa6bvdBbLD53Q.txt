Absolutely delicious food that is well-prepared.  I highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the fish tacos.  My husband loves the Veracruz "flag" burrito.  There is a fried cheesecake dessert that is the best one you will ever try.  We have always received attentive service and have always had a pleasurable experience dining here.  We enjoy sitting on the covered patio outside when weather is warm.
