Excellent!!!  This is the place for authentic Mexican.   I had the vegetarian enchiladas verde. The veg. Version cost a bit extra but it was so worth it and most divine as it came with plentiful and fresh avocado. The tomatillo salsa had the perfect amount if spice and flavor. Hubby had veggie flautas; I inly had a bite but he seemed to enjoy them. This is a small but active place in Beechview with a tiny Mexican grocery on the side. BYOB.
