Can I please franchise this place and bring it to NYC?

Very very very good, quick Mexican.

Tacos, tamale (a little on the small side) and the California burrito were all amazing.

Salsa bar is everything that is right in the world.

Full menu available from the minute they open!

I will be back before we leave Fountain Hills.
