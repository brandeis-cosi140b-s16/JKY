I was pleasantly surprised my first visit here, I got chicken tacos and found them fresher tasting than Chipotle and less expensive. I came here again a couple weeks ago with my toddler and mother-in-law, who is allergic to onions. Almost everything at a place like this has at least onion powder...so I was worried if she could find something she could eat. I think the employee's name who helped us was Jesse R. He was very helpful and made a special burrito she could eat. Just a good experience to report! :)
