I love this place!! I go almost every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 original tacos). Every experience has been positive, the staff are friendly, polite and accommodating. I usually sit outside and when the server brought out my food, he noticed that the sun was in my face so he adjusted the umbrella for me. 
If you sign up for their emails you will receive a free birthday meal and it's not an a-la-carte size meal either. Great value and amazing taste for a fast food place. 

My only complaint for this location is the front door handles, they are filthy and black. I hate touching public door handles anyway, so I usually bring a napkin with me to use to open the door.
