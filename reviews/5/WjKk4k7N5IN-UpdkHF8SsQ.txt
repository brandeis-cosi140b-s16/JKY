I am a big fan of Chipotle... nothing new there. The only reason I ever hesitate to eat here (especially, this location) is because it is so damn busy... However, today, for the first time I used their fax order form- Totally awesome. I faxed it in, I called to confirm, I got there, the lady asked my name, handed me my bag, I paid and I left. I almost wanted to tease the suckers still in line. 

This is officially now the ONLY way I will order Chipotle. Score one for me and my time!!!
