One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  The machaca plate is awesome!  Gets busy on Sundays but so worth it.  Great for dinner too.  Lots of options on the menu and everything is cheap.  Huge portions we always end up taking leftovers home.  Get the watermelon or limeade drink too, you'll thank me.
