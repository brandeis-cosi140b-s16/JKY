After a few months have passed by I feel the need to update.. at first I was like hmm.. it's good but lacks the flavor of a TRADITIONAL burrito. This is anything but.. and I've cravings for this delicious burrito time and time again. It's perfect for one of those times where you're like, "Should I get Korean or Mexican?.." with KoMex you can have BOTH!
