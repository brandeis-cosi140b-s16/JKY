I don't like to write reviews for fast food but I feel that I must purely based on one person. Last night at about around 11:30 I drove through the Taco Bell in savoy and the woman working the drive through was the nicest and most efficient fast food employee I had ever seen. Kudos to T bell for hiring this lady. She was quick clear and even friendly. So often are we forced to deal with surely food service employees and this lady made my midnight taco run just a great experience. 

It's a Taco Bell man, I'm not really going to review the food.
