I saw this dive of a hole in the wall many times and just drove by. I was sure it was a real toilet to go eat at. It is located in a strip mall type property next to Surf City Bar and Grill...another dump, I was almost positive. I got tired of all of my usual restaurant.com coupons and as a last resort I purchased one for Que Mas. My wife complained the entire way there that the last place she wanted to go after work is a trash can to eat dinner, but none the less, we are cheap and we did had a coupon!

We walked into the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Mexican look and feel to the place. The person who greeted us (not surprisingly) was pretty authentic himself. We were given a menu and warm, homemade tortilla chips with homemade salsa. Nothing canned about this place! The menu was inclusive, but not over full. It was easy to read and understand. Prices reasonable.

The service was very fast and we were eating in no time. I had the Steak Ranchero, and it was the best Mexican food I have had since I went to Isla Mujeres, Mexico! I would say that the only thing that wasn't authentic Mexican was the owner! 

Surf City Bar and Grill...the "dump" next door...is a very nice bar area where they serve food from Que Mas. They are connected by a hallway, but separated so that food can be served in a smoking bar! Very smart! We will be back!

I would recommend Que Mas and Surf City Bar and Grill to family and friends!
