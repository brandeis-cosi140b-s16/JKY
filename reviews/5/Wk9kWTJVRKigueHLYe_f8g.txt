I don't know what all you haters are talking about but our service was awesome! There was no wait to be seated on a Saturday night around 6. The weather was perfect for patio dining and their patio was surprisingly well decorated. We loved the atmosphere. The food had great flavor, not the best Mexican food I've had but I'm very particular. I gave it 5 stars because we were so pleasantly surprised with our experience after reading all the terrible reviews. So either all you negative people had a bad night or El Zocalo had a customer service over-haul. Either way give them a try. They deserve a chance to earn your business. After all, you'll be supporting a local business and not at a national chain cookie cutter restaurant.
