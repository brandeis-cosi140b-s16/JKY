Okay so don't be scared when you pull into the shopping plaza that houses Chino Bandido.  The area seems a little sketch, and the restaurant itself looked sketch, but you'll be making a big mistake if you leave!  You don't want to miss out on the good food!

Upon entering, I was greeted by a friendly guy that offered both me and my sister quite a tasting of all their offerings.  I tried everything from their famous jade chicken to the black beans lol.  I think it is important to mention, I was already full from lunch, but even still the food tasted awesome.  I bought a combo with two portions of the jade chicken (which is something like caramelized general tso's) and paired it with their jerk chicken fried rice.  The jade chicken is good, but that jerk chicken fried rice is stellar!!  It actually had a good amount of spice, and just loaded with flavor.  It was probably laden with msg, but I don't really care.  

If i remember correctly, if you order two portions of something like jade chicken, you can make one of the portions into a cheese quesadilla version free of charge!  Really superb, and the free fresh baked cookies that come with the order are just icing on the cake!  Love this place!
