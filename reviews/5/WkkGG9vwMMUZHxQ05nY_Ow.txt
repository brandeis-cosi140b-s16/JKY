We've been coming here lately because they get my husband's order right unlike the Rubio's at Germann & Gilbert and Warner & Cooper, which often gets my husband's order incorrect.  This particular Rubio's is always clean.  The manager is always around when we come in and works hard to make his restaurant really good.

We're happy to come here now regularly, as we now live closer to this location.
