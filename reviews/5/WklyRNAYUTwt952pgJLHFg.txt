A co-worker introduced me to "The Hat" and I immediately fell in love.  Very authentic, hole in the wall Mexican restaurant like I'm used to in AZ.  The owners are there everyday along with one server, so it's very intimate, and I've always experienced great and decently fast service.  

The Pork Chili Verde is to die for and I'm a huge fan of their nachos.. not your normal mountain of chips with ingredients tossed on top.  Taco salad is marginal - but what was I doing trying to order a salad here anyway??  Burritos are good and a perfect size; not too big that I usually run into.  I'm going back asap for the sopapillas!
