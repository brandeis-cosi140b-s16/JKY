Absolutely delicious.  This small place doesn't have a lot of adequate seating but it has an amazing salsa bar.  Let's get something straight.  A salsa bar consists of more than the standard 3 to 4 salsas.  This place had about 20.  You can tell that some of them were experiments that went well like Peanut salsa and I believe there was a curry salsa.  There were so many.  

We ordered the famous baja sur dogfish shark taco, an El Gaucho burrito and an El Gaucho quesadilla.  I am not a big fan of quesadillas because of the flour tortilla and there is usually not a good filling.  This one was deep fried goodness.  Oh man, it was so good that I could only get down half of it.  The filling was steak, cucumber and just hell goodness.  My husband's burrito had majority of the same filing as mine with a little tweaking.  He enjoyed it a lot.  The fish taco was really good as well.  I only had one bite because I was aggressively attacking my quesadilla and fighting off the stares of people watching me enjoy.

With all that being said, customer service is once again an issue.  The small place was pretty packed.  Only one small table was open right by the door.  This table had to be misplacement because who would want to sit by the door and every time someone opens the door, they get smacked in the back of the head?  Our waiter was so non-existent that a waitress would come over to only end up doing the same thing.  Sigh.  The food was so good; I couldn't even dock any points for that.  Be aware that the first bowl of chips is free.  The second bowl is about $2 more.  The chips are good and hot so, I willingly gave over my money for an extra bowl.
