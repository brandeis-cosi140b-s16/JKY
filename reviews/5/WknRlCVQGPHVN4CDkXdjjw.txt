It opened today and not dissapointed!  You get what you pay for, they don't skimp on the meat great selection of toppings. Set up like Chipotle but better menu and selection of meals. Carne asada great flavor, a little grissle. Friend had the carnitas, she really liked it. Stated they were more authentic then Chipotle. I'll be coming back to try rest of menu!
