"Wanna try that place? You know, that one on the corner that we've passed a million times? I've heard it's good."

That's how most of my discussions begin. 

El Penasco has got to be one on the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The tortillas were soft and fresh, the salsa was a dream (and recently won an award at the Salsa Festival in Tempe), the tamales with red sauce were divine. The do breakfast too, but I haven't been for that. I went back for lunch the other day and had fajitas. There are different versions of "Mexican food" depending on the region of Mexico, and whatever region this comes from is one of my favorites. 

Service was a little slow, but I'm willing to overlook that because the food was great. They teach Salsa dance classes here on Wednesday nights.

Bottom line: a great local place and worth checking out.
