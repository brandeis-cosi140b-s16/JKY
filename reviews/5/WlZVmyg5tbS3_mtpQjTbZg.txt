I was so overwhelmed the first time I went here.  

Tortillas - get in the tortilla line, ask for how many pounds of tortilla's you want and they go get them fresh and put them in a basket.

Meats - get in the meat line, same deal. I've had both the barbacoa and the carnitas - they are both really good.

Cheeses - I haven't figured this one out quite yet, but definitely check out their selection!

Sauces/Salsas - available at the register when you check out.

Drinks - get from the coolers on your own.

I don't speak Spanish, so this is always an adventure for me, but the workers definitely try to help me out and are good at understanding my pointing and hand gestures for how much cheese I want.

This is a DIY take-out place and by that I mean, go here to get parts of your meal, take it home and assemble it.
