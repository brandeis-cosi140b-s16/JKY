I just finished my entree and am trying to think of anything negative to say but I've got nuthin'!  

The food was fantastic, the service was good and the value was excellent for the amount food. I couldn't finish my plate and that's rare! The last six bites were taken simply because the food was so good and still in front of me. I was nowhere near hungry at that point. 

We will be back and I highly recommend this place.
