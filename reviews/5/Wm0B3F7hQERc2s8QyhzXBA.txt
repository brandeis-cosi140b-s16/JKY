Went there for the first time after hearing great things about it and we weren't disappointed.  To start, we couldn't find the door and the, I believe manager, let us in. The environment was amazing, calm, friendly, inviting, and it wasn't obnoxiously loud.

Onto the service. The server was awesome and very fast getting our drinks to us. I got a margarita and my fiance got a beer, not complicated but I've had to wait 5, 10 minutes to get the same order from other places where they had a bartender and he made me a good margarita!  Another thing I saw was everyone worked together! Everyone helped each other out. The busser was so on the ball. Very attentive which I'm not going to lie, I usually don't see that in bussers.  

Onto the food. It burned my mouth when it but the table and that is the only is sign I need to like the cooks. I got the mole enchiladas and my fiance got the green chile chimichanga. Both were fantastic! I've never had mole and I couldn't get over how good it was. It went so well with the chicken. And not overly sweet. Speaking of sweet, I loved their sweet green salsa! My fiance not so much but I'd get that salsa again and again. The chips were so crispy and warm! We went on a Thursday night at around 6 PM and had the best service and food and have found a new Mexican restaurant we will be going to from now on.
