Gourmet burgers at greasy spoon prices. If you are looking for an exceptional taste experience for a reasonable price, this is it. Nothing fancy about the strip mall location or decor, but the burgers are really amazing. We had the Burger Brulee, made even more juicy from the soft cooked egg yolk, and the daily special Key Lime burger, cooked crispy in a graham cracker breading with a cilantro pesto sauce. Both had a touch of sweetness, which you can avoid with other choices if you don't like that. Definitely wanting to return to try out other things on their menu.
