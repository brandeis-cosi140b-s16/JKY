I am so glad I found this place! I'm not big on seafood in general, but my boyfriend is obsessed, and I DO love a good fish taco. Which, if that's what you are looking for, is one of the highlights of this restaurant.

Even upon first impression, the restaurant is impressive. Whoever decorated did a wonderful job; it reminds me of a little cozy cafe. 

We tried to eat a little of everything but definitely need to make another trip soon. We tried four different tacos - El Fish Taco, Fish and Chips taco, Octopus taco and Baja taco. I tried all except the octopus and they were amazing. The restaurant really uses the seafood flavors to make the food delicious, rather than covering it up with unnecessary spices and such. 

I also tried a carne asada gordita, which was delicious. I only wish it had some cheese sprinkled in it or something extra. My boyfriend also ordered the mixed ceviche, which he proclaimed amazing (and he's picky about these things). I tried to juice part of it with a cracker and it was actually very good. 

Their salsas are also a highlight - delicious and very spicy! And since we were there for lunch our tacos were part of the lunch special and we got some delicious Jamaica (hibiscus juice). 

On top of everything else, we received excellent service. Both servers were so kind, and very prompt with our orders. I will definitely come here again because there are lots of other things I want to try!
