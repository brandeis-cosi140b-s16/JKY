They only have a few items to pick from but all of them are delicious! Especially there signature dish which is a Torta Augada!! A Mexican sandwhich deeped in really delicious spicy hot sauce,goat meat,& lime juice but you can order it mild if u can't hang like the Mexicans  lol but overall the food here is Bom!! Oh and there huge fans of Chivas here so I suggest u don't wear a America 1 or they'll probably kick you out
