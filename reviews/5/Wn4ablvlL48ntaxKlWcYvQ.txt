I love this place, I have purposely gone out of my way to take my boyfriend and my mom here since the first time I've gone and they both love it as well. 

My friend brought me here and I was skeptical at first because being from Texas makes me a very picky burger eater. 

I loved it. I got the Burger Brulee without onion and it was AMAZING. The burger itself was so juicy and the burnt sugar with the egg was a perfect balance of flavor without being overpowering. I also shared an order of fries with my friend and they were so good with their jalapeno sauce! If you like burgers this is definitely the place to try.
