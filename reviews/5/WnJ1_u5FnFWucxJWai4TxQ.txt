This restaurant is fantastic! The food was amazing and there were so many options on what you could order. I had Connor as my waiter and he was one of the best waiters I have ever had. He was super friendly and always checking up on us. He recommended some amazing meals like Courtney's Burrito. Next time I come in I am going to make sure I am sitting in Connors section!
