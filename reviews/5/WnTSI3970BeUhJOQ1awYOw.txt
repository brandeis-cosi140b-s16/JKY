Boom goes the Taco Shop.  This is the only taco shop we'll eat at. Luckily we lived next to the one in Mesa and now near the one in Fountain Hills. Best part of this place are the beef tacos and their Mild red sauce. It's not mild.....and is so full of flavor. I buy the 8oz bowl all the time to keep in the house. I will not buy hot sauce anywhere else. Absolute YUM.
