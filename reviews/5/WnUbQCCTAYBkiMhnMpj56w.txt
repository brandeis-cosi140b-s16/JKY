My husband placed an order over the phone for today and they were super helpful. It was a surprise from my husband and the girl who was working drew a little heart on the bag and wrote a little note on it too. It was very sweet and it made my day! Food is always delicious, they have extra seating outside and it's the only place you can get gluten free dairy free food which is a god send to those who are intolerant. I wish I knew the girls name so I could personally give her recognition. She was a short sweet younger Hispanic girl who worked 10/20/14. Thank you!!!
