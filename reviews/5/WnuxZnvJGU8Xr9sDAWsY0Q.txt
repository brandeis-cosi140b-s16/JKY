This place is AMAZING.  I have been to this restaurant many times and have brought other people that love it too.  The dishes are freshly made down to guac and fruit juices (yum!).

The mole is to die for.  It is so rich and deep in flavors and I get excited just writing about it.  I've ordered it many times.  I've also had their cochinita pibil which melts in your mouth it is so tender, juicy, and a tornado of flavors in your mouth.  I've also had the adobada and what more can I say ... it's just so good.

I especially love their fruit juices because you can see it being made from an actual fruit, cantaloupe, pineapple, watermelon, etc.  So fresh and refreshing!  Price might be a tad high for the little things that I've noticed but when my palate was having a climax for almost 2 hours everytime ... I think it's worth it.  :-)
