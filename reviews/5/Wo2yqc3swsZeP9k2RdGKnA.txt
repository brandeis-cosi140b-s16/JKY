I totally disagree with the one star review. Thats insane.  I'm a foodie and love a good mexican restaurant. I just moved here from Chicago and Don Ruben is a few blocks from me. I thought it was a hole in the wall dive, but I was wrong.
It's clean and nicely decorated, with two rooms for patrons. The salsa is delicious, just the right amount of tomato, onion, spice and kick! I'm not a fan of the their hotter version, so I'd skip that. The chips are always fresh and hot. Great margaritas and even better at 3 bucks on weekends. I always get the shredded beef enchiladas with ranch beans. I've had this in numerous places and theirs is THE best. The sauce on the enchiladas is delicious. It's a full plate and enough for leftovers the next day. The deserts are amazing too. The wait staff is always friendly and quick!
I love having this close to home, but there goes the diet!!!
