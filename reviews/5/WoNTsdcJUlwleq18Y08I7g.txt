I had dinner at this restaurant on Monday July 27,2015. I loved it! The service was fantastic. I forgot  the greater and waitress name but they did a great job . I ordered the shredded beef and refried beans. The serving size is huge for the price. Our food did not take a long time to come and worth the wait.  I cannot wait to go to this restaurant again!
