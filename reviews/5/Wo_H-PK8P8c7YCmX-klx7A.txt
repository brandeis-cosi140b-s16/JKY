Yum!  Authentic greasy Mexican joint when I'm looking for a guilty pleasure.  We've  been to these types of Mexican places in CA, Tucson and now here in lv and this place is right up there with the others n its close to my place. Score.  The burritos are big my favorite is carne asada as well as care asada tacos which are packed with pico De gallo n guacamole, they are pretty big also.  Fast service and polite ppl.
