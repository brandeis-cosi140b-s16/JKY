I've noticed some people comment saying "I don't like Sonoran/New Mexican mexican food."

...then why are you eating Mexican food in a primarily Sonoran Mexico area? Do you see an ocean? No, this isn't Baja.

Valle Luna is the premier place to get Sonoran mexican food. The portions are copious, the flavors are bold, and the food is consistently good.

I can't think of anything bad for this place.
