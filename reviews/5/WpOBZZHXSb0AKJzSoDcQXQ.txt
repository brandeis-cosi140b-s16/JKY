What a meal!!!! This was our first visit on a whim. I got a large peach margarita. The hubby got a large homemade sangria. Both were really good and worth the around $9 price (better then Chilis and 3 times the amount. 

They bring chips and salsa to the table and we ordered a small guacamole. The guacamole was HUGE for $3.99  and really good. We added some salt to make it pefection. 

Husband ordered the fajitas fiesta. $17.99 and he could not finish. I got the pollo alcapoco. Once again ate about half. 

We will be back no doubt.
