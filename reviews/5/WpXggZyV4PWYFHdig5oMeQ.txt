This place was the perfect spot for a Saturday day night. As always, thanks to yelp, I found this hole in the wall, so small you'll miss it if you blink driving by. I loved the ceiling to floor length mirrors and hand painted flowers on the walls. We came around 630, right before it started to get busy. The owner and staff were all very friendly and warming. I tried both the watermelon and roja sangria, both are delicious, the roja with a heavy red wine taste, but still really good! The vegetarian enchiladas, with wild mushrooms, spinach, and my favorite, tomatillo salsa on top, were too good to focus on anything else. My boyfriend ordered the burrito, enchilada style. Not exactly sure what was in it besides shredded chicken, but it was damn yummy, too! And huge. 

When I called to book a reservation, I asked about their $50 for $25 deal, they said you can use it on the entire menu. What I forgot to do was buy it on the yelp app so I could actually redeem it at the restaurant (if you see a deal on yelp, buy it right when you open it, I had no idea it would disappear and I wouldn't be able to use it again). I'm assuming it was the owner that was asking around who she spoke on the phone with, and when she got to use I explained to her what happened, and she said it would be no problem, they would allow is to use the deal anyway. (I don't recommend doing what I did though, just buy it so you can save the server some trouble) 

Overall, awesome date night. We'll be back.
