We got lost when we exited the freeway and thought to give this place a try before trying to find the freeway entrance. The place looked busy which is always a good sign, I ordered house special which was half a chicken with sides my wife ordered the fish, to our surprise the food wash delicious, we did wait a bit for our order to be taken but it was worth the wait. I added this place to my favorite unknown restaurants.
