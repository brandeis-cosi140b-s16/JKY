This was EXCELLENT. I went looking for the taco place that formerly had been here, and was delighted to find Taco Bros there instead. The people working there, in particular the owner, are great, friendly, courteous. Prices are reasonable for downtown and for the extremely high quality of food that you get. I am so impressed with the dinner I had--it was delicious. I did the "buy three tacos, get free beans and rice" deal and for $10 it was more than enough food for dinner for one--I have a taco leftover that I'm not sure I can handle. The ingredients are all obviously high quality and fresh. The beans and rice were great, notable in themselves (which is unusual for Mexican, I think). I had both chorizo and braised beef tacos, and I strongly prefer the chorizo, though the beef is also very good (the chorizo is also fifty cents more a taco... worth it, IMO). 

I will be going back, many times.
