Chipotle = Woohoo! As good as it gets!
Did you know that all of Chipotle's ingredients are local and organic?  I know, I couldn't believe it myself till I checked online to create a meal calorie count.  Which brings me to my next point, you can create a burrito bowl with great protein and good carbohydrates (black beans are better carbs than bread because they burn off slower which makes your body work harder) for about 600 calories just ordering black beans, no rice, meat, salsa, & sour cream.  Enough with the educational session, this location is great because it is never super busy and it is close to my home and the staff is always friendly.  There is also great outdoor seating and the atmosphere and decor is a typical modern looking Chipotle.  What else is there to say beside Chipotle is the most consistent, flavorful, quality, clean, good service, best place ever to eat a quick meal!  I love the concept and wish they sold franchises!
