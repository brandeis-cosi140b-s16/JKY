My family and I moved up the street from Amigos 4 days ago. Once we tried it, we ate it two days in a row and if it weren't for the scary though of dying from heart failure, I might do 3 days in a row, but alas, my gas is on so I don't have any more excuses to not cook again. 

We used to be fans of Robertos and Faustos but NOT ANYMORE! The first night we got carne asada fries, bean and cheese burrito, and rolled tacos. Oh my gosh. I don't think I've ever had better carne asada. It is SO tender and my teeth cut through it like buttah, not chewy at all, or dry. It is perfect and super flavorful. 

Bean and cheese burrito is standard but delicious when I'm craving some legumes. Rolled tacos are also standard as I can't distinct the difference between these and other taco joints. The second night, we got carnitas nachos. I had to order these when I found out that they weren't the shredded carnitas, but rather the chopped and thrown on the flat top kind! These were also super tender and flavorful. In my opinion, the meats here are the star; they are quality, not chewy, and will probably change your opinion of what Mexican fast food should taste like.

Don't judge me if you see me here... everyday... for the rest of my life... in stretchy pants...
