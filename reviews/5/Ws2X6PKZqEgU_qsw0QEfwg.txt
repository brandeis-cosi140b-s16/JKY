I am giving this place five stars because the food was great and Ben was awesome. I wish it wasn't in a gas station, because my kids were all over the place wanting candy bars, ice cream, etc.  Hopefully, Jefe's will do well and can move to a place with more seating. However, I will definitely be back and get another breakfast burrito (and fajitas for the wife)!
