Wow, Just amazing. My hubby and I decided to go thanks to Yelp. We shared a quesadilla and then each had street tacos. The Guacamole is AMAZING. All was fresh and the ladies behind the counter were very helpful, especially since we said it was our first time. We got to taste all the different kinds of meats to choose from. I would recommend anyone go there.
