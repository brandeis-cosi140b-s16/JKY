How can you go wrong with a mexican restaurant is attached to your hotel room (MGM Grand) and has table side guacamole service and huge margaritas?  Diego was a great meal that had excellent service.  I had my 5 year old cousin with me and they were very courteous to his picky desires.  My sister and her boyfriend had the tortilla soup which was the best I have ever had.
Living in San Diego my whole life, I have had plenty of time to determine what is good mexican food vs. lousy mexican good.  Do not miss out on this restaurant.  Good vibe and great portions.  They give you salas with matching salts for them, what an interesting, yet simple concept, I am surprised more restaurants haven't done that.
