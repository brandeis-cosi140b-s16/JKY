For its size, El Charro packs a punch.  I've formerly only eaten in the restaurant here, which was always tasty.  I was a quesadilla fiend for a while, and they always delivered (figuratively, not literally).

Lately, I've been trying to cook my own Mexican food, and the grocery section, though small, had everything I needed the other day: corn husks, Valentina, chiles de Ã¡rbol, and El Milagro tortillas.  And, walking up to the counter with two huge bags of husks, the guy behind the counter started a friendly conversation about different kinds of tamales.  Awesome!
