The out side doesn't give justice to the amazing food inside. What a rush of flavors and quality ingredients. I got the badger burrito it has no huge fillers like beans or rice just good meat, fries, pico de gio (that tastes like they made it fresh just for you) to the guacamole that is just amazing. ( I am not a fan of guacamole, but man you got to try this) even the fries that are in the burrito just add to the profile in your mouth. Better yet everything is spread out evenly so you don't get a bite of just one ingredient. 

Over all if your hungry get in and try this place I will definitely be coming back.
