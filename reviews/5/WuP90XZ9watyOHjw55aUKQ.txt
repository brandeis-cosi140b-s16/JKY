Yummy! Well done! The trucks are new and clean. Order inside the small building (they have the menus on the wall in there too) and then pick up the food at the truck window.  I got the steak quesadilla, it was made fresh to order. I got a side of cool sour cream and FIERY salsa.  The salsa was crazy good but its not for the weak!  Serious heat. Fresh made and pure pepper taste.  It's very nice to have a good eats option that have late hours. Quick walk just North of the Wynn and on the same side of Las Vegas Blvd.
