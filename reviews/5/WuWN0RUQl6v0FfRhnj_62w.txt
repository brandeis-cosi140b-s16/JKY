Unpretentious, ... nothing fancy at all,  Taco and Burritos , this place is just a neighborhood restaurant with great food. I have been waited on by the 12 year old kid behind the counter,  ... the decor' is nothing to write home about, but all of this is what adds to the charm of the hole in the wall treasure!
