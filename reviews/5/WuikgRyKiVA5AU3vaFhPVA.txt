Went to this place because of the reviews. Was looking for a good cheap Mexican place. $5 for 2 fish tacos and they were fresh and fast. I will def back! Yummmm

Went back for my second time. Tried ordering online. Do not order on the app! There aren't nearly as many options to add things or omit things as there are in the storefront. But yum yum their food is delicious and wonderfully flavorful and filling :)
