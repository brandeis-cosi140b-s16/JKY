Great place for tacos and burritos. Past boxing champs have patronized this little place, and for obvious reasons. The portions are decent and the food is great. One has to admire the folks for making this place have a character all onto itself. There are photo graphs, signed jerseys and all kinds of memorabilia on the walls.
