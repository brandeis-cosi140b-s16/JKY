I am partial to indepedent, non-chain restaurants and especially ones with a casual feel and no attitude.  And ones with great food.

I've eaten at C4 four times now with its newly revised menu and have not been disappointed.  The atmosphere is cool and understately hip.  The food is terrific and reasonably priced.

The food:
I am addicted to the super-delicious corn & poblano chili chowder soup.  Absolute perfection.  I order it every time.
Other recommended dishes:
Appetizers:  tres queso quesadillo, crab cakes
Soups:  the chili stew
Entrees:  the tilapia dish, the pork chop dish, the chorizo mac & cheese, the burgers
Desserts:  lime tart (tastes like lemon drop candy), bread pudding, apple cobbler

All of the food is prepared fresh, including the desserts.  I've had the pleasure of touring the kitchen and meeting the cook staff.  You can see the pride in their faces as they prepare and talk about the food.

A great restaurant for one, for two, for four, for six, or more persons.  

Be sure to check out the rest of the hotel while you're there:  the rooftop with its incredible sunset and downtown views and the jawdropping pool area.
