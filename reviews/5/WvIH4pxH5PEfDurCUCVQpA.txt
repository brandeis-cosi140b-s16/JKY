When it comes to tacos, I don't mess around. I have invested considerable time and effort to become, what I consider, a connoisseur.

In each city I have lived I have found the best tacos in town, and then become a regular customer. 

When I moved to Vegas, I was admittedly nervous -- I can't live without good tacos and Vegas is big... it could take months to find the best. Luckily, it didn't. It took two weeks (and 3 great reviews from Latino friends) to find Tacos El Compita. 

 The food is fresh, authentic, flavorful and juicy! It is just greasy enough to be good  Mexican food, but not so much as to cause post-lunch regret. 

I recommend the mulitas, typically with carne asada, or some chicken tacos. (Be warned, the chicken tacos can be a bit spicy if you order them with everything ... but OH SO DELICIOUS).

I went for lunch today, and I'll be back again next week.
