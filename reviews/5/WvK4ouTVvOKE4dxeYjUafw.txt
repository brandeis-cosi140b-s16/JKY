This is a small taco shop that sells good food! Don't expect a cloth napkin and fine silverware, you went to a taco shop! But your food will be fresh and prepared the right way. Some of the menu is in Spanish so do your best or ask the friendly staff. Tacos, burritos, quesadillas, tortas, gorditas, and more come with your choice of meat. So far I have stuck with the Pastor (marinated pork) and it's tasty. There are many unique menu options I haven't seen at other taco shops. The whole reason I came here was for the corn (elote) because i couldn't find it elsewhere and it didn't disappoint! Support this small business!
