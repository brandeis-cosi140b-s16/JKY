I love this place. First of they get social media and how to reward loyal customers. I know that doesn't tell you about the food but it does say something about how they care about customers and their willingness to listen. Let me give an example. Shortly after they opened I commented that I would like to have had a chicken option for a quesidilla they thanked me for my comment. Within a month there were chicken options on the menu. Now that could have been something in the works but asking for comments, reacting to my comment, and doing something went a long way.

On to the food. Love the burgers. All of the ingredients taste so fresh. I have brought a lot of people here to try it and that is something that is always commented on. Everyone says they can taste the freshness.

My other absolute must have are the chips and salsa. I love the salsa and can't get enough.

I have seen them continue to evolve from the beginning and really like everything they are doing. I highly recommend.
