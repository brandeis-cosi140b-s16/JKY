The Crescent Ballroom is one of my newest favorite haunts Downtown. It's open late every night, they have a great beer selection, fantastic bands and the food is made by the owner at Gallo Blanco. 

You can't beat the ambiance either! Exposed brick and wood covered walls makes it feel antique and vintage while still looking fresh and new. There's always a space cleared for dancing when the DJ is working and people are always willing to jump in and have some fun.

They also carry a couple of cider beers, which is great for the gluten-free beer drinkers. One caution, stay away from their famous honeybadger - because he definitely don't give a sh*t!
