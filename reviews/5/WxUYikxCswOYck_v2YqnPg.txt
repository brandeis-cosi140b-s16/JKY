Wow!!! This gringa will be coming back frequently! Chips were crisp and delicious, salsa was homemade and unlike any I've had before (it was sweet! And amazing!), and our main food. Oh wow. The rolled tacos were hand made. So much better than Filis. The chimi was so big it filled the plate. We had lunch for two with lots left over for $20. Can't say enough great things about this place!!
