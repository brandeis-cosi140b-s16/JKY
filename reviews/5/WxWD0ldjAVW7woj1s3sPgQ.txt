Went there on Sunday night with my girlfriend and had an awesome time. The food is super tasty and HUGE!! The Combo Nachos are bomb (get a side of jalape√±os and salsa) 

Started off with a michelada (server John's recommendation) which was really good and the tequila list is not the biggest, but very good. 

Cliche I know, but the churro a are a must have.  For sure a perfect place to watch football.
