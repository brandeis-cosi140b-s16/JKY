Once again, it's great food, price, and 5 star service at Q doba!  Extra chicken, guacamole, anything I want, without the extra price!  They have the cool coke machine with more than 100 soda's in it.  I love the Sprite Zero peah, and raspberry.  The Ginger Ale selection they have is unbelieveable!  There's a Chipotle 200 feet from my apartment.  It's expensive, crowded, and they act like they are doing you a favor.  You should have seen the TINY amount of chips they gave me in a bag with my guacamole for $5!  Hell no!  Qdoba RULES!  I wish I could switch them.  The 20 minute drive is STILL worth it!
