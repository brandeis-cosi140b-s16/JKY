Went in to see if it lived up to its ratings and it did!  Was a bit difficult finding it because their sign isn't up but its under the Taco shop sign if youre struggling to find it. The service was really friendly and welcoming! Got to talk to the owner of the store, he was really nice and friendly. 

The food lived up to the reviews, got the small Windy City Fries, wanted to try the Pastor but they ran out so tried the Chorizo but was still satisfied. Half way of eating it i already got full, and not really pricey so thats a thumbs up. Tried their Spanish rice and pickled Jalapenos, would say its better than a others. Would definitely recommend it to my friends! Good food. Good service. Good people.
