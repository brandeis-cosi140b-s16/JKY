This is the best Roberto's in Vegas.  I have tried many and I think the one by campus is the most generous with cheese, guacamole, sour cream, etc.  It's a lil hole-in-the-wall but it's open 24 hours and has great, cheap food... relatively fast.  Can't beat that!  

When I lived in Vegas, I used to go here at least once a week.  Sometimes more!

Try the Horchata too. It's a Mexican rice drink (with a lil cinammon).  It's yummy and good for the stomach if you've been drinking!
