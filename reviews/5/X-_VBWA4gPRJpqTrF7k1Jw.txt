I must say this place is amazing. We were recommended this place from a local at Costco. Totally worth it. I had the fusion torta and my bf had the fusion chimichanga which were both to die for. On top of the food being bombdiggaty the prices were excellent! Super cheap! We will always pay this place a visit when we come back to Vegas!!
