The BEST tacos I've ever had! No joke!

But...let's start from the beginning. 

You walk in and the gentleman greets you and asks if you've been there. We obviously said, "no" and he starts handing us little cups of their meat. Starts from less spicy, all the way to the hottest. All amazing and full of flavor. 
We got the 5 street tacos and added almost everything to them (not a huge fan of tomatoes)....every bite explodes with flavor that gets better each time! 

Amazing customer service + great food = a winning combination! :) :) :)
