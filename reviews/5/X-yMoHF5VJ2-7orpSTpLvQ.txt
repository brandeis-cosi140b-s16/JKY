Ambiance: The owners have spent a ton of money on gutting this place and making it feel authentic, charming, and comfortable. All the tables have tablecloths and candles and the lighting, artwork, whitewashed walls, and tiles make this a cozy Mexican restaurant. 

Food: This was probably the best chile verde (green chile pork) dish that I have ever had. Instead of being oily like at other places, it was creamy and the pork was very tender. The carne asada was perfectly grilled. Paired with a refreshing and crisp salad and the sides of spanish rice and beans all made for nice stuffed corn tortillas. The appetizer of queso fundido was not what I expected (usually this is a large dish with melted stringy cheese), as it was a small cup of very creamy cheese sprinkle with chorizo. I guess my only suggestion would be to make the portions bigger to replace the small cups of guacamole and salsa that came with the dishes, but I am sure if you asked for more, they would provide it. Instead of huge messy plates of tons of food like you get elsewhere, here you get high quality ingredients presented in a clean and meticulous format. I definitely didn't leave hungry.

Service: The 2 gentlemen working were very forthcoming and welcoming. Our server, who came from their Chandler location, was obviously very knowledgeable of the food and was very efficient and friendly. The bartender was nice enough to get us to try new drinks, which were amazing and I would never have thought to order them without him doing this. We also met the chef/owner who is a great guy who loves simple, high quality food from family recipes.

The bar area looks like a quaint fun place to hang out during happy hour and it looks like they will have a patio soon. We'll be back for sure!
