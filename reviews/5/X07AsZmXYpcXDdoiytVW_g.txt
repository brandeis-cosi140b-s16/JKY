I love the New Mexican food, as it is sometimes hard to find out here in Phoenix since moving from New Mexico. This place does not disappoint and keeps me coming back. 

The complimentary chips and dip variety is great, followed by a huge portioned meal, and free soppapias! What more can you ask for? They offer three levels of spiciness with most entrees. My favorite is the hot green hatch, they are spicy and very flavorful! Try the house made raspberry tea.
