Great staff, great service!  Try the steak skewers, they are small, but that is why they are under the small bites section.  The chimichurri is to die for.  I love the pork tacos on flour tortillas and the grilled fish on corn tortillas.  The green enchiladas are bomb, kind of spicy but the Mexican crema, lettuce, and tomato help bring down the spiciness.  The Sonoran margarita is really sweet and strong!  Amazing happy hour deals on tequilas, make sure you ask your server about them!  Be sure to upgrade your tequila in your margarita during happy hour!  This is a regular spot for me and my boyfriend.  Anytime family/friends come into town, this is the first restaurant/bar we take them to!
