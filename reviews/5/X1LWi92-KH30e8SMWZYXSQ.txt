Just a funky lovely place.  The food is simple, yet complex.  I sat outside on consecutive warm summer evenings and watched the happy kitchen crew create beautiful, fresh, eclectic food bursting with flavor.  They did this while having fun (except for the girl with the tattoo on her neck who only very rarely smiled unfortunately).  Most importantly, the kitchen crew loves to blast old school rap which for thirty something's like me is, well, intoxicating. 

I even bought a t-shirt, enough said.  

The only negative is the cramped quarters inside.  The hallway to check in with the hostess is very narrow and a high traffic area.  My elbow accidentally caught some boob on a lady who glared back at me like it was an intentional boob elbow.
