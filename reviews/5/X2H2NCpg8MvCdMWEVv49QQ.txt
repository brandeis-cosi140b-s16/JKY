Great prices and great food!!! The meats are delicious and they have some creative ideas which made the food delicious and fun. The service was also excellent, our server (possibly the owner) was working hard tending to all of her tables and making sure everything was going good at our table, I was VERY impressed. Had a little trouble finding KoMex but its located in the small shopping center next to Winchells. Thanks KoMex, you have the key to sucess which is great food, great prices, and great service!
