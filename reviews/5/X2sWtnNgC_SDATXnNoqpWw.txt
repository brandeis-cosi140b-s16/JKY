We had a great experience. It was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Some good Mexican food and a margarita after shopping at the outlets in Anthem. We weren't looking for a major gourmet affair, just somewhere to stop on the ride back and we were pleasantly surprised. The service was awesome and it seemed very family oriented. I had the carne asada and it was really flavorful. My wife had the delux burrito and she enjoyed it as well. Thanks!
