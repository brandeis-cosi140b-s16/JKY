I come here all the time for lunch because they never disappoint. The wait staff is extremely nice. They are not over the top like you might find at In-N-Out, but VERY personable. 

The food is always prepared fresh and delicious. You cannot go wrong with the original fish tacos. My personal favorite, however, are the grilled gourmet tacos. 

They are consistently in the lobby making sure it is clean and stocked up. In addition, they'll bring the food to your table between taking orders. Seems like it's an unwritten rule, rather than calling out your name or a number.
