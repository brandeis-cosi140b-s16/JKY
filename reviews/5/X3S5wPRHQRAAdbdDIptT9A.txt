Now this is my kind of taco shop. Small, hole in the wall'ish, which means authentic and packed with flavor. I would highly recommend the Tacos de lengua. They cook it for 14 hours so it literally crumbles in your mouth. The tacos are small, so 3 will do you justice. In addition, please get the horchata. They add walnuts in there for added flavor. This is now my go to place for Mexican food. All other taco shops do not compare, as this is the best in Phoenix. Yup, that just happened (dropping my hands down)!
