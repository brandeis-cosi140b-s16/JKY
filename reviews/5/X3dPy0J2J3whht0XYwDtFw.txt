After walking out of New York's Best we went to Los Sombreros. Great choice! Their Cadillac Margaritas are delicious.  My husband had the the beef tacos which was loaded with large chunks of tender beef. I had the chicken mole, best mole I've had. It comes with black beans, rice and mixed vegetables. The tortillas are all hand made with masa. Servings are large,  service is good and it is clean. Will return.
