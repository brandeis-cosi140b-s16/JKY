Great place, great food. AMAZING hot sauce. Chimichanga's are too kick butt. Beer is in SMALL glass so I'd suggest sticking with bottles of Mexican brew rather than ordering draft. 
Beautiful building, wonderful food. I've eaten here at least 20 times, any time friends or relatives come to town, take them there immediately and never a complaint. Have to look  on Yelp for all of the whiners. 
Good eats, enjoy!
