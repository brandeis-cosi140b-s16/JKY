Service is top notch. I, go there for the best red chile in town! One point I did have an issue with their service and manager that had arizona syndrome but I have yet to see that person there ever again. They take care of their customers and ALWAYS serve great food. The mole and sopa was not quite as tasty as I like but decent. Great drinks as well. Rositas is a diamond in the rough. High 5!! HU
