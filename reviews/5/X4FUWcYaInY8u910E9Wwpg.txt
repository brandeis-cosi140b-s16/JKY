First things first, if you go here, get a Sonoran Hot Dog with everything on it. You're really missing out if you don't try one. I don't even like hot dogs that much but I get one everytime I go.

The rest of the food is great as well, crispy delicious tacos. The pork green chili is a great burrito if you like carnitas. It's a wet burrito so plenty of beans, cheese, and green chillies inside. Their carne asada is also really good but I will say I prefer mine a little more salty and on the spicy side. Still it was great and the Pico was fresh.

I found Moreno's about two months ago and I've been back three times since. This place has really great tasting and authentic food, plus as a bonus, they also have "Mexican" coke. Glass bottles, made with real sugar.

If you like mexican food, definitely check Moreno's out, I wish it was slightly cheaper but it's definitely worth it everytime we go.
