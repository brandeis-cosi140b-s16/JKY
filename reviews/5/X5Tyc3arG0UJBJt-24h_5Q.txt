I tried this joint simply because of the great reviews on yelp. I was not disappointed. There is an awesome salsa bar. The service was great. The staff was helpful and friendly. The food alone was worth the trip, but there was just so many wonderful elements. I had a steak and bean burro. The steak was seasoned perfectly and had a nice crust of season on it. The horchata is seriously the best I've ever had. I can't wait to take everyone I know to this great spot. Enjoy!
