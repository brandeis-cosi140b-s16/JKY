Have to say that the fact that the owners of Juan Jaime's follow Yelp and care enough about their service and customer satisfaction to contact someone who has had a negative experience made me up my rating to 5 stars.  Turns out the credit card discrepancy issue was indeed my fault.  My sincerest apologies to Mr. James and the Yelpers who may have read my update and gotten any kind of negative opinion about Juan Jaime's.
