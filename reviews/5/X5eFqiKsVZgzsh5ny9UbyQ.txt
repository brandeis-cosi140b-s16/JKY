New restaurant in the area I decided to give a try, great atmosphere, very rustic chic decor, not your everyday Mexican restaurant. Service was excellent, the drink was fantastic, if the rest are as good as what I had, can't wait to try. The food was out of this world, I had the Mahi - Mahi with  grilled esparagus and cilantro rice. Will definitely come back.
