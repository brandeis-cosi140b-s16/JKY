First thing to know -- this is Central Mexico cuisine like you will find in upscale restaurants in Mexico City. It is not Tex-Mex (gracias a Dios).  I lived in Mexico City for five years and still travel there on business, it is one of the most cultured dining cities I've experienced.  

The authentic Mexico litmus test --- the most basic margaritas are made with fresh lime juice and high quality 100% blue agave tequila, not sweet and sour mix and nasty Cuervo like many places. Taberna serves a damn fine margarita cocktail -- ask for it served up like a martini or on the rocks. 

Flavorful green and chile pasillo salsas with just enough bite accompany the an unique assortment of chips. 

I ordered the carnitas, which were perfectly prepared with a crisp texture outside and tender inside.  Carnitas are a simple dish, but hard to get right with this ideal combo of textures. Mi esposa had the scallops, a more sophisticated dish, and they delivered.  

Taberna makes my short list of Best Mexican of the Valley along with Gallo Blanco, Los Somberos, and Barrio Cafe. I keep wavering between 4 and 5 stars, they did everything right in my first visit, have to give it a 5.
