My husband and I just finished eating here. Everything you read about homemade food, FRESH food in a very friendly atmosphere. Management is warm and inviting. The tortillas for our dishes were made on the spot. You can have lunch food at 930 am, if you want. Get the shrimp enchiladas. 

Oh, and whoever said this was a sketchy area is being stupid. This area is fine - eat here and do it often!
