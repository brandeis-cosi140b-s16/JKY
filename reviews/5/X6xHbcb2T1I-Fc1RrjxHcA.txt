You know a taco place is good when it's packed with mostly Hispanics at 3am on a Saturday night.
They make your food fast and in front of you.

They only serve street tacos (2 big bites and you're done) and there's about 10 to choose from.

Cost is about $2 each.

So expensive, yet so good!

Adobada is probably the best (spicy pork).
