For the price, for the speed of service, for the cleanliness and general efficiency, as a new resident to Las Vegas coming from Miami I couldn't be more happy with Robertos!!! Long time visitors to Henderson we always found Faustos to be the area's best taco shop. Actuality, no, I think it's Robertos! We moved in across the street and stumbled into this place and love it. As a food service professional its clear to me the product is made fresh and made to order. The chimichanga among other things is amazing. Very good quality, fast and efficient!
