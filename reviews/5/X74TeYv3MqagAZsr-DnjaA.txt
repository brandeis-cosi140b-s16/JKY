Best Mexican food in the valley. I go there every week and that's because I force myself not to go more. It's a local mom and pop restaurant with really good prices. Buritos cost $4.50, I HIGHLY recommend the shrimp and carne assada, these are my favorite! But the shrimp is very special, it's an orgasmic experience! Also they make their horchata and meat is cooked to order. They are very friendly, and the place is very clean.
