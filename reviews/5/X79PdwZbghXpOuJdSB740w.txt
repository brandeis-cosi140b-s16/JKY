I haven't given a 5 star review before, but this place was great. It's fairly new - but the food was incredible. The mini-chimis for the appetizer were amazing, the tamales were amazing, the street tacos were amazing, it was all amazing. Highly recommend this place. It's the new go to when looking for a place to take out of towners.
