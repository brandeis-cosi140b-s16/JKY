So this is my go to for carne asada and now Sonoran hot dogs except I haven't really tried other places Sonoran dogs so hard to say this will be my staple for them for now. But it definitely is for carne asada tacos for sure. When I think about carne tacos I think of morenos esp on Wednesdays.  The green sauce idk what it is but I love drenching my tacos with the sauce so they are practically drowned. :) so good!
