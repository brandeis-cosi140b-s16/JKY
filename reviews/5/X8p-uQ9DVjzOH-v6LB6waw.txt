I ate 3 steak tacos with red sauce. They were fantastic! As good as anything I've had in Mexico, and among the best I've had in Phoenix. The menu is simple. The prices are great. The staff is nice. It's open 24 hours. What's not to love?

They should be offering delivery soon, so that's amazing. 

Go eat here!
