They have really great food! My boyfriend and I had dinner here and I had the prickly pear margarita and the jalape√±o margarita both were amazing. The habanero wasn't super spicy but had just enough kick to it for me. I got the Steak empanadas with rice and black beans very flavorful would definitely recommend and we also got the Portugal Tortes with refried beans definitely would recommend that as well. Everything on the menu sounds amazing!!! If you're looking for a great place to eat I would hit this spot up. If you like your sports they have plenty of TVs to watch all your sports. They have Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 3-6!! Would HIGHLY recommend this place for great food!!!
