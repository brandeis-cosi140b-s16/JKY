First of all... the 5 star review is for this location and staff only. 

All you people that were dissatisfied with the way your food tasted were going into the food experience at TacoBell with way too high of expectations to begin with. It's fast food, hello! It's not gonna be awesome. I mean you are paying less than a buck for some of the stuff on the menu. I doubt anyone goes here unless they are broke, in a hurry or drunk. 

I have to give this location props tho, they are super nice and friendly. Always a "Hello, welcome, how is your day going?" when I pull up to the drive through. Big smiles when I get to the window. Then the topper, "Have a great day, come back and see us soon!" I mean seriously, they are great! I am usually there once a week, usually after a long day and they always seem to perk me up. 

After the less than two words spoken and sour faces I get at Wendy's this place is awesome. Seriously, go compare the two places and tell me I am not spot on. 

Happy Belling! :-)
