Awesome place! Just heard about it's re-opening on Facebook and had to check it out! When I arrived I noticed that I wasn't the only one who must have heard about them re-opening. The place was packed! It was well worth the wait. The service and staff were very friendly and prompt. Had the Crab Relleno and was loving every bite of it. Their bean dip and green salsa is also awesome! Was so impressed with the food that night I went back 2 days later to indulge again. Will definitely be coming here often.
