I work downtown, so when I get the craving for some yummy mexican food I absolutely have to go!  The carne asada burrito is amazing and I absolutely love their tacos. The place is clean and the hot sauce station is nice, better than Robertos by far.  They take cards which is definitely a plus.  When you want some yummy, inexpensive tacos or burritos this is the place to go.
