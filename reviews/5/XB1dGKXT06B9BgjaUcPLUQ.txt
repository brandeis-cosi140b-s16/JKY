There's is no other place better than a hole in the wall other than a food truck. If you see a food truck that's slinging tacos surrounded by a ton of mexicans,, you can bet you're gonna get the good stuff. The real authentic Mexican eats that you'll remember for life.

If you're that "I love cheapotle" type, please, don't embarrass yourself. Stay American amigo, trust me, they don't want you coming around here talking smack anyways. This is for the serious food trippers, definitely not for the chicken fingers and fried potato sticks people.

Forget the beef and the chicken (pollo) meat. Those meats are like the general tso's chicken of Mexican food. This is where they met the American tastebuds half way. Please order the Al Pastor, it's a much higher level of meat that's loved ALL OVER the WORLD. Yes sir, there is a world outside the USA and they don't prefer beef or chicken. 

Lengua, Buche or Tripa is the good stuff. Trust me on that when I tell you. These are usually the good stuff that you don't eat everyday. It takes a special someone who knows what they're doing to make it really delicious. Someone sent to earth by God himself. 

There's a condiment station next to the truck. There you'll pick up your onions, cilantro, the grilled jalape√±os and onions. Get some sauce too,, green is tomatillo, red is Chipotle or sometimes tamarind. While sticking condiments in your baggie, you just can't stop but imagine all them good flavors mixing together and creating destruction in your mouth.

We should all eat in places like these. But not all food trucks are created equal, some are way better than others. This one, is the truth!! 

Thank you Taqueria El Buen Pastor! Hasta Pronto mi hombre!
