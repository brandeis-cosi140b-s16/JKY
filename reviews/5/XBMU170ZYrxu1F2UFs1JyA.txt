This is for the food truck on Sloan and Sahara on the east side. The one open Thursday - Sunday from 5-11pm. The one that has like three employees. The one that has THE BEST TACOS EVER. 

I've gone through taco phases. I used to like street taco combos that came with with three tacos and some rice and beans tortilla chips from places like Pepe's. Then I graduated to tacos el tizon where they melted cheese onto the tortilla as a taco base. Then I graduated to Tacos El Gordo street tacos that had adobada and tripas. Then I graduated to Los Tacos where a $4 filled to the max with everything taco was totally worth it. 

This taco truck is like a mix of all of them.

They serve tacos, burritos, and quesadillas. They have perfected the taco in my opinion. 

They take two medium sized tortillas an melt cheese between them. The bottom tortilla touching the grill makes them crip and crunch. They then fill it with the meat, onions, cilantro, beans, and salsa. Wrapped in some foil and it's the taco PERFECTED! The textures are just awesome. I suggest the carnitas- super flavorful OR the lengua or tongue tacos. 

Eat them there while the tortilla is crisp! Then you can add extra salsa and sour cream.

I've been here a handful of times and they get busy. Ive never waited long, but I totally would. I heard the owner used to work at Los Tacos and I'm a Los Tacos of Tacos El Gordo kind of guy so I love this place. Tax is included also.
