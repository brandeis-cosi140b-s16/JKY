Formerly Baja Taco which was horrible. This place was actually really really good. I came here yesterday and idk if it's because I was sooooo hungry but the food was delicious. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, nothing special because it's my safe food when I try a new Mexican joint. The tortillas appear to be handmade, nice and thick so they don't fall apart when you load up on sauce. The meat was seasoned perfectly. Huge portion comes with pico, and guac. I got some spicy red sauce for them and ohhhh sweet Jesus was it delicious. The 2 tacos I ordered came out to about $6 because they're not your average taco truck tacos. These things were massive. He gave them to me in a carne asada nachos container to be able to hold both. Super yum. I'll definitely be back. Sooo glad Baja Taco is gone or under new management because they sucked the big one back when they were open.
