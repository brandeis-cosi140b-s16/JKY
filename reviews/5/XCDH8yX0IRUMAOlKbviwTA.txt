Ok, Midwest guys, best ever Mexican.  Why?  Authentic.  More locals than snowbirds which tells you something.  Right flavors on my mexican comfort food list.  The homemade red sauce on the cheese enchilada.  The tender beef chunks in the red burro with just the right, again, red sauce that was different than the enchilada sauce.  

The lovely Maureen had the mahi tacos with chunks of fresh avocados. Homemade corn tortillas not the standard flour tho that's available.

Environment is fine: that's not the reason to come here.
