Awesome awesome awesome!!!!  This place is amazing! The inside decor is beautiful with large wooden chairs, oversized tables, and a very unique style that fits the restaurant.  The staff is professionally dressed and extremely welcoming! And the food is delicious! Extremely generous portion sizes. I had the arroz con pollo which is one of their signature dishes and it was very very good. Fish bowl size margaritas!!! A+++++
