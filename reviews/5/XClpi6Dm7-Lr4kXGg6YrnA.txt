Happened to stumble upon Los Taquitos while my hubby was getting his haircut at the salon next door. I had already eaten, so I grabbed a takeout menu to browse while checking the place out. Interior was very clean and i am a sucker for a place that has a chalkboard menu. (yah, I know)
Tried it out about a week later because the menu is a la carte(big plus if you want authentic food that is not suffocated with cheese) and I was not disappointed! Ordered the shrimp burrito and a bowl of pozole. Husband got a green tamale and fish taco. The shrimp burrito had a delicious white sauce that  I couldn't get enough of.  Their pozole is red and comes with fresh cilantro, minced red onion, lettuce, and tortillas on the side. The broth was flavorful and the pork super tender.  It even had just a slight oiliness on the top from the pork fat that I recognize as authentic pozole. Everything was EXCELLENT and came out piping hot .(not on a heated plate!)  I am going back tonight for some more!
