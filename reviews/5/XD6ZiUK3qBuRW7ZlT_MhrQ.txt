This is a great, family-owned restaurant. It's small but the staff is very friendly. Ask for Osiris. She will take great care of you!
The head chef is from Mexico City and doesn't believe in boxed products so she makes everything fresh. The salsa and green chile sauce were nice and spicy. My wife and I are very picky and we enjoyed everything we ate there. If you want to support small businesses, give this place a try. The prices are more than reasonable and they have a special meal everyday.
