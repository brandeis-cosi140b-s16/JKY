Seriously have not had a good mexican meal like this in a while! The environment is very authentic and and classy. The server was very friendly, she knew everything I asked about on the menu. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it was SO good. Not like a lot of the chain Mexican food around town. It was a really authentic , high quality recipe. The black beans were perfect, with a little cheese on top. And it was so good I had to order dessert. The homemade flan topped off my experience here, and it was just great. Thanks for a great experience guys, I'll be back many many times!
