I amazes me about how people complain about a curb or the size of the place, this is about food dummies. 

And the food is good and the prices are cheap for what you get, which is a lot. 

The breakfast burritos are more than enough to fill you up and the nachos will also fill you up in one sitting.

Good food, nice people serving and cooking your food.

I live in this place, do go and enjoy the food, forget the rest.
