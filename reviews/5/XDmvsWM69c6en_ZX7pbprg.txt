As if I could find a negative thing to say about Chipotle. This location in particular only lacks that they get bombarded by guests and If I don't time it properly between my lunch break I have to swing by somewhere else for lunch. Like any Chipotle you go through the line picking out what goes and what doesn't. I've noticed here they are very punctual about keeping the supply fresh. They're not conservative about how much they give you, if you feel jaded by the amount simply ask for a tad more. I find talking to them like a person and saying "thanks" will get you what you want sooner than a complaint. The biggest highlight here may be that there's no off the strip type premium charge for their food. They're no more expensive here than any Chipotle I've been to anywhere else and I'm really glad considering even the near by Subway deal is $8 foot longs. The place is a bit small maybe but they do offer additional seating just outside the store. I've personally had nothing but good experiences with the staff and that's a big part of why I'd come back and take the time to write a review. Keep it up Chipotle.
