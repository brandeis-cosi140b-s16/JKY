Stopped for an early dinner.  What really stood out was the service was awesome!  Our waitress was 100% right on the money.  She stopped by at exactly the right times and knew exactly what was needed.  The food was better than expected - we shared flautas and chimichangas.  And not to get too graphic, but a lot of times mexican foods leaves me a little odiferous later on, but I saw no ill effects this time.  The warm chips were tasty.  5 Stars Aranda's - we'll be back soon!
