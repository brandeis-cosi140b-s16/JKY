I usually mix it up between a steak or chick bowl. I love that its always fresh disregarding the crazy line that comes every so often. I tried switching up to a burrito but did not find it wrapped so tightly that ended up using my fork to scope the rest of the meat! I always hit this spot at least once a week because its just awesome!
