This is the second time my husband and I have been here. The first, we sat in the dining room, and had a wonderful server. I think her name was Sonni...she had great service, we were even one of the last people to leave at the end of the night, and we still got great service! We sat at the bar this time, and service was still great. Got acknowledged within moments of us sitting down, and got drinks really quickly since it was close to happy hour ending 

Food has been consistently great, I had the chicken and steak fajitas the first time, my husband the fish tacos. The presentation was good, not great, but who cares about that as long as the food is good?! Things were cooked perfectly, and it all tasted very good. This time we had the chivche.....good, not great. We added a little more lime juice and that helped. The flavor was a little bland, but not bad overall. Although, it was really hard to get the chivche out of the margarita glass it was served in, so I suggest that change. Otherwise, everything was great tonight. 

We will be back, and definitely bringing friends next time!
