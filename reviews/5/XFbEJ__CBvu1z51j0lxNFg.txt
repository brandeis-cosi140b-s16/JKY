I am a foodie that loves to cook. I like to eat food that takes effort. Food that takes hours to prepare. This is what makes paying premium prices at a restaurant worth it to me. This restaurant is totally worth it! 
     My husband and I started with the corn cake souffl√©, it was amazing. It is light fluffy, sweet and spicy. We then shared the Crepas De Mariscos and Puerco en Chipolte. I wasn't sure what to expect from the Crepas but when they arrived I was pleased to see two large "burrito" sized crepes on the plate topped with a green sauce. They were generously filled with fresh fish, shrimp and crab. They were so good I let out an audible sigh when I tasted them. The  Puerco is basically carnitas in a really good chipotle sauce topped with cheese. The pork is so tender and has a slow roasted smokey flavor. It was so good. The food was top quality.
     Our server was friendly and attentive during the meal. I am really looking forward to trying more dishes.
