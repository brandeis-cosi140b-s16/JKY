I live within walking distance to this resturant and its never let us down. It's good and REAL Mexican food made quickly. The portions are insanely huge for the price you pay and well, it's great quality Mexican food...This is no Taco Bell! We've even eatten at the resturant a few times as a family and even the inside of the resturant is fun and welcoming. If you want real Mexican food at a great price this is the place to go..skip Taco Bell!
