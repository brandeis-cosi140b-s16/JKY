I had the opportunity to grow up eating at the original location in Springerville,  AZ.   This is the first alternate location I've tried,  and all I can say is "wow!"   What a cool vibe,  to pair with their signature spicy food.   Excellent location, cool,  jazzy music,  very clean.   Only drawback is that it was pretty dark... As long as you already know what you want.. Perfect lighting.  The staff was amazing...attentive without being overbearing.  The food... Perhaps better than the original even,  with the same signature heat,  but a refined presentation and expanded menu.   I can't wait to come back,  and bring my family! 
And remember gringos,  that little chile pepper next to menu items mean business!   If you didn't catch the clue with their amazing salsas,  you've now been warned!  (As I sit watching a poor couple struggle through their scorching yumminess,  sweating their asses off!)
