best all around tacos i've had in a while.  firstly the ingredients are fresh fresh.  secondly they are really tasty.  and lastly its just a buck for a one of em.

i'm usualy a fan of carnita but they really make a good al pastor here.

some of the best mole sauce i've ever had anywhere.  very well rounded flavor - almost like an indian curry dish.

just one complaint - if they call the place nopalito they should be serving nopal.  and why dont they have tamales?
