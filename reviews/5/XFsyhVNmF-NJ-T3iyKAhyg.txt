This little mexican joint has to have the best, mouth watering, orgasmic beef tongue tacos on the face of this planet.  My pastor introduced me to this place while my friend and I were starving in our little office ready to devour every thing we laid eyes on.

I ordered 6 beef tongue tacos and I tell you IT'S AMAZING!!  The tortillas are made fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours.  Because the meat just melts in your mouth.  Matter a fact get the burrito.  You'll get more meat and is cheaper.

With your burrito and tacos that you purchase you also receive a roasted onion and jalapeno.  On the side if you want more pickled jalapenos or carrots, radishes, amazing salsas, they're available.

If you truly want a delicious burrito drop by any, I think there are 8 locations in Phoenix?  Don't eat the Americanized chipotle junk.  This place blows chipotle out of the water.
