This Mexican restaurant is pretty awesome for the Madison scene. My boyfriend and I frequent this place, and we have never been disappointed. The prices are great, and the food is tasty and filling. I usually get the burrito suizo, and the cheese sauce is amazing!! My boyfriend gets the quesadilla with a side of guac and always leaves happy. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great inexpensive Mexican!
