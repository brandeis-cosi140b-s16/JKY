My wife and I have a timeshare just up around the corner and in looking for someplace close we stumbled onto this gem. We went their for lunch and we will definitely be back. The service was courteous, pleasant, and attentive. The food was absolutely wonderful. Their chips, salsa, and bean dip are a great starter.
