Definitely the best mexican restaurant not only in Las Vegas but in the US. Chef Paco really knows how to make your palate go wild. The perfect mix of flavors in every dish. Must try the tableside guacamole, the carnes asada burrito, and the flan.... to die for. Out server Enrique was very nice and his service outstanding. He even brought chef Paco out to meet us. If you are in Las Vegas, you have to, must go to El Dorado Cantina!!!
