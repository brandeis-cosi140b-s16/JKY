Stopped by to partake of their Sonoran dogs and they are DYNAMITE! I sampled the flavored water and shaved ice and wished I wasn't in a hurry so I could've ordered more off of the menu. I will definitely be back and hope to try it all! The service was fantastic, a quaint family owned restaurant that wants to treat you like you are in their home kitchen. The owner took the time to familiarize me with the menu items, answer any questions and welcome me to return back. Like someone else had mentioned, the outside looks like just an ice-cream shop, but there are treasures of home made authentic Mexican food inside! Not to down play their ice-cream, because it is a thing of magnificent beauty I really haven't had the pleasure of sampling before. This is absolutely NOT a dairy queen or baskin-robbins, these are home made flavored syrups, fruit that has been lovingly prepped and everything is fresh and delicious! Definitely a one of a kind treat that is worth stopping in to try, you won't be sorry!
