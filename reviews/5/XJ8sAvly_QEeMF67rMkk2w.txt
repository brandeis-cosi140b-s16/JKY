A great lunch spot if you hit them during the non-peak hours.  I recommend trying around either 11:30 or waiting until after 1 p.m. to get some great eats here.  Standard Chipotle fair, and the service is fast, efficient and very friendly.  

I also recommend their online ordering service.  Pick your meal from the comfort of your desk, select a time, and even pay if you want to.  The food is ready to go when you arrive and all you have to do is walk straight to the front cashier and take it away!

Overall: A
Great lunch spot for some good food.  Try online ordering.  Parking lot can get packed at peak times!
