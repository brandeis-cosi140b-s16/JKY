Fresh tortillas are made in front of your eyes and delivered to your mouth. Wonderful bakery selection, great empenadas. I enjoyed the simple bean and cheese burrito but it's all good.  Clean dining area, good service, stop reading this and go there! Shout out to the "dubonthereg" blog for the photos. Great little blog, enjoyed reading this and other reviews.
