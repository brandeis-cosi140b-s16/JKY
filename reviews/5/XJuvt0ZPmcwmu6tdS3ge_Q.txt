This place is awesome!! It was as if my grandma and aunts were back there cooking for me ( and I know they weren't because they are in my hometown not cooking for me) I had six tacos de lengua (cow tongue, dont turn your face all wrinkled either cuz that stuff is good, try to expand your palate you simp). Anyhoo, I will be going back there again.
