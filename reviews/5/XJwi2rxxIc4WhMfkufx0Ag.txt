My social analytics company was in Scottsdale for a giant restaurant conference at the Westin up the street. We wanted to whisk a few of our clients and colleagues away for a few hours to enjoy a few margaritas and goodies. I am SO glad we had our party at SOL Mexican Cocina. We worked with Sharon who fixed us right up with a specialty taco bar, amazing apps like calamari with this amazing sauce and all the cucumber jalape√±o margaritas we could handle -- everything was AWESOME. The servers was so nice, funny and helpful...I think I may have even friended a few on Facebook during the night - LOL! It was a Tuesday night so they had a guitarist playing cool tunes. Deborah, the executive chef at SOL, even took the time to introduce herself to our group and made us feel right at home. I just can't say enough wonderful things about this place -- if you're looking to grab a party room while you're in Scottsdale, or hell just dinner...I highly recommend this place.
