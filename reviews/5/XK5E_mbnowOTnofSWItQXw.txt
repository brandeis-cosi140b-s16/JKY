On vacation from California, I can be picky with Mexican food and I normally hate breakfast burritos. On the first morning in AZ my family got us breakfast burritos, I was not very excited till I tried it. We have been here for 2 weeks and have had their breakfast burritos 3 times I can't get enough so good! And what great prices like 28 bucks too feed the whole family! Amazing
