This place is definitely not fancy, but it's the real deal.  They've got buche and menudo and sesos.  I had something normal: the tacos al pastor, which were good.  They seem keen to put on lettuce and tomato and sour cream for us gringos, and you can get it with beans and rice if you can't live without those American extras that you never get in Mexico, but you can get it Mexican style as well (i.e. you order a taco, you get a taco).

I liked this place.
