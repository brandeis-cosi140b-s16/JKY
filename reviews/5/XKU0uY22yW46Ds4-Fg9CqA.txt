Absolutely Amazing!!! From the minute we walked in I was impressed. The owner greeted us and the place was very clean. At first I looked at the menu and thought it was going to be very similar to Faustos and Robertos. We ordered and were given chips to go with our salsa while we waited. Chips were best I've ever had, the salsa bar was very good too. There are pictures on the wall of the owner and his family on Rosarita Beach. We got our food and Wow!! Very good, very fresh and not like any other taco shop in town. Very very very good. There is construction going on in the area on the weekend but find an alternate route and get in there!!! Soooooo good!!!
