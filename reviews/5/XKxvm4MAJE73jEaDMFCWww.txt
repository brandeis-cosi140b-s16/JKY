Gotta give this place six stars! There's only one "Taco Stand" that comes close since Ernie's in North Hollywood closed in the '50s, and that place is in Albuquerque. 

We've been doing ST for years and won't travel the Beeline without stopping. Recently they've spruced up the place--looks real nice--fortunately the food DID NOT suffer.

Try the shrimp burro! Their roasted pablano salsa is superior--well, maybe not with the shrimp--well, maybe.
