Was just there today and it was wonderful! Excellent servce, delicious flavorful food and nice atmosphere. Definitely will be back next time I'm in town! Only thing I could suggest is that there be a spicier salsa option. The "spicier salsa" as described by our server wasn't very spicy at all. Maybe it's personal taste.
