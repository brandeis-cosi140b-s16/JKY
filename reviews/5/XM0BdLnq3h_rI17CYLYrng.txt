Went here for lunch today with a friend. My friend asked, "What's good to eat here?" The customer in front of us turns around and says "Everything." I go here as often as I can. Favorite Mexican food place to where I live. I had the Super Carne Asada burrito. It tried its best to live up to its name but my appetite is bigger. Love the food here! Very cozy, but you will rarely find this place empty! Its a local favorite!
