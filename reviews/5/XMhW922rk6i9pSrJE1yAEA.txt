Really? I have never written a review for this place? Wow! Yes I am giving it 5 solid stars. Every single time I have come (and I pray I don't jinx myself) the service has been great. Last night was no exception. Ryan went above and beyond great service and for that I give him a huge shout out. Thank you again Ryan!!! Happy hour from 4pm-7pm that include half price drinks and appetizers. Sold!!  Even though he told me not too, I am giving a shout out to the manager on duty last night (02.23.12) who's name I do not know. You went above and beyond as well. For those that were wondering, nope nothing happened just the service and the food was great last night. (The nachos were piled high and the wings were perfect) I enjoy coming to this place and I will continue to do so whenever I am in the area.
