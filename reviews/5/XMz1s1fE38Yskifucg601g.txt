Driving from Palm Desert to Albuquerque and wanted some awesome tacos. Came here after the great reviews on Yelp (Thanks, Yelpers!) and it was FANTASTIC.

My husband had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco Plate. Tender and moist meat, he ate it with the Salsa Pecan from the Salsa Bar. The rice was OUTSTANDING. And the House Margarita was one of the best he ever had.

I had the El Gaucho Taco and a Carne Asada taco ala carte. Both ON POINT. And the horchata? ENORMOUS. The melon, berries and pecan at the bottom were such a treat at the end of a satisfying beverage.

I read some complaints about service. This place is small and every table was taken when we arrived. The two wait staff people were great. They were busy, the restaurant was full, and they were sharp. If you are in a hurry, don't come here. If you aren't and you are willing to stand at the bar with a drink and wait (which we did), it is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT.
