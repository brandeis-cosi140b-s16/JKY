Braddah's is a really spectacular lunch spot, so glad I found this place.  Food is of high quality, always fresh and tastes great.  I get a bowl with chicken or steak, big fan of the different hot sauces too.  Equally significant to the great food is the genuinely friendly and positive attitude of the owner and employees.  Good vibes in there, makes for a really nice dining experience.  Show some love for Braddah's.

Side note, unsure why anyone would list this place as divey as it's far from that... clean, nice furnishings and great music too.
