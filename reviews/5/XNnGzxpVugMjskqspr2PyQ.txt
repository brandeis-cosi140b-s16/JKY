Located in Red Rock Resort Casino. I can't get enough of this place, I would almost move to the westside of town for it, I said almost, let's not get nuts here. I will start with the drinks, most of the cocktails have a special rim rub, they range from sweet to set your tongue on fire, but they are all great. the margarita has a special feature, you can add heat and smoke or one or the other or none but come on you must try at least one. I do a double heat and half smoke, I highly recommend. Next up are the tacos, there is a taco for every taste, you will certainly find at least one you like, but I but you find four or five. Now here is the kicker, guacamole with bacon in it, let me please repeat that, THERE IS BACON IN THE GUACAMOLE! What more do you need? Great service you got it! A great happy hour, done! A great reverse happy hour, they got that as well! So stop in and have a cocktail or three and a taco or four. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
