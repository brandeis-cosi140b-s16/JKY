I've been here twice this week since I've found out about the place and I'm probably gonna go again today. 

It's right down the street from me and its exactly what I've been looking for. Fresh, tasty, bad for the body and damn cheap. 

I'm sure lunch hour is terrible but I've always been there in the mornings. 

Carne asada burrito dressed however you want and the carnitas tacos are both bomb as hell.
