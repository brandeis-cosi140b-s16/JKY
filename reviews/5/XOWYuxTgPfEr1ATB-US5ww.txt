If you're looking for great food get to this place! I went to a family dinner for my boyfriends sisters 21st birthday. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I shared the chicken and steak fajitas with my boyfriend and they were so tasty! I highly recommend this place. For dessert they served the birthday girl a rather large slice of chocolate cake and put a sombrero on her head and all the employees, with sombreros as well, sang her happy birthday. Thanks for the great food and service!
