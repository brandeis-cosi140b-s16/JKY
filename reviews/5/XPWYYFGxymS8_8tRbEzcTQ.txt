As far as fast Mexican food goes, here it is. EVERY time we are in AZ, we hit this joint up. Seriously, like three times in four days...the ladies at the counter were cool, the place was clean, salsa bar was rocking and stocked...all the good ingredients you need for a little 'hole in the wall' burrito spot. I don't think they make anything bad, but if you want to change your life for the better, get a carne asada burrito. They even have karaoke every night after 8pm. Totally kidding about that. I wanted to see if you were paying attention still. Use coupons and see what is on special each day.
