I normally regard Fast food as well..... fast food! Generally the food is consistent between restaurant locations unless something is pretty off. I also don't normally review fast food restaurants for this reason but this location is the exception tonight. 
First of all I will start with why. In the past five mos or so I have noticed that some of the TB locations have not been as customer service oriented nor as friendly. Again, I have actually and sadly come to expect this from fast food locations. 
Tonight the crew working at this location was very pleasant and outgoing! They were patient, fast and courteous. Additionally THEY asked me if I needed any condiments.( If your asking why that is such a big deal, its because most of the locations now do not ask you if you need condiments. I expect fast food orders that have food which is generally paired with condiments to have condiments provided automatically.
 When they don't just put them in there or I have to remember to ask i generally end up pulling around the side and having to go into the location to go get them. Sorta defeats the purpose of drive through. I inquired about this at one location and they said it was to save money and it was the customers responsibility to ask " its policy". 
I am huge on customer service so you can imagine how this went over! I haven't been back to the other location in years even though I am near it at least three times per week. 
So when this location asked they scored a huge smile from me. Additionally I got home and found that they had given me a little extra! Yay for the times when I go to a location that doesn't provide them, it will save me at least one return trip. Last but not least the order was accurate. 
Crew on duty tonight really had their stuff together.
