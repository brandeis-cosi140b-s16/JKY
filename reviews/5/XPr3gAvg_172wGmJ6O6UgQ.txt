This is my new favorite spot. So glad it is close to me. I was at another location for the first time the night before and liked it so much I decided to come to this location of lunch the next day.
I must have just missed the lunch rush because the place was pretty much empty. Which made me wonder for a second if there was something wrong with this location. Where were all the people? I thought it would be packed with people. Not that I am complaining because I was able to get right up to the counter and order and get back to work pretty quickly. There is nothing wrong with this location because the food was fantastic. So was the service.
This time I got the Langostino Lobster Burrito. I have never had lobster in burrito before and wondered how it would taste. But I was told it was very good and sure enough it was fantastic. I think I like the Original Fish Tacos a little more but this was good. I could eat 4 of there tacos even though 2 do a good job of filling you up. It is one of those things that is so good you don't want to stop eating even though you are full.
I will definitely be back again and again and again and again. So good and cheap too.
