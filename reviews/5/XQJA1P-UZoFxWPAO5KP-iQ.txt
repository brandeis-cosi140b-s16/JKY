This has now become my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would give it a try. The way I look at it, if a Mexican restaurant is full (and I mean full) of Mexican people, the food has to be good and I was not disappointed. The restaurant is nothing special, just a bunch of tables in a huge room. The server was very polite and seated us immediately. She brought us some fresh tortilla chips and probably some of the best salsa I have tasted. I ordered the torta Del Rey which was absolutely fantastic. It was so filling I could not finish it. I also had the mango licuados which was exactly like I tasted in Mexico. I will definitely go back and try some of their other great looking items. Try it out, you won't be disappointed. There is also another location on 7th Ave.
