The only reason we went here was for the free margarita for checking into yelp- but I'm so glad we came!  This is such a fun place!  We sat outside along the counter and people watched- so Vegas!  Our sever, Laura, was incredible!!!  So patient, sweet and efficient!  I HIGHLY recommend the Southwest Cobb Salad!!!  It was incredible!  Worth every penny!!  This is definitely a place to check out!
