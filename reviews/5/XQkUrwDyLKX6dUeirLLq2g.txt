I love love love Rubios!! The food taste fresh and is always great. I usually get the chicken tortilla soup with a health mex chicken taco. The soup is loaded up with chicken, cheese, pico de gallo, rice, avocado on top along with chips and lots of tasty flavors!! The chicken tacos are by far the best tacos.... well I guess that not fair to say because I have never tried any other taco because the chicken tacos are that good!!!!  If you like fresh inexpensive mexican style food then you will absolutly love Rubios!!!!
