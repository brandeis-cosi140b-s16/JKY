Chose this spot for lunch because of all of the positive reviews they have been receiving and they definitely delivered! The food was fantastic and staff incredibly friendly and helpful. At no time did I feel rushed while they gave me samples of the meats. And their sauces delicious. I have a chipotle a block away from where I live and I don't think I'll be going there with this place just a few miles away.
