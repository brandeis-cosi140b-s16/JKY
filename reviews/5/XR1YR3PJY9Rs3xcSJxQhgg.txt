Joyride tacos were amazing and being Hispanic I can honestly say they are very authentic the salsa is amazing and their black beans are really really good! I was there to days in a row! The carne Asada tacos were my favorite I did not care for the breaded fish but I got a taco replaced without charge which was really really nice the service was excellent and the atmosphere was Great! I would definitely go there again!
