Awesome burritos, made any way you want. After reading some of the reviews, I will add some stuff on here. 

They now have an ATM. 
Still cash only. 
Still awesome taste. 
You can have the food made however you want, but you have to ask several times for it. 
Overall the food is great. 

Thanks to my co-worker for recommending this place.


-----------UPDATE-----------

Sooooo, burrito express got me into trouble at work.

My time at work several hours after eating went a bit like this....

My co-workers walk into the room, and stop suddenly staring at me.
I say "Burrito Express"
Together they all say "Oh. . . . . . . OHHHHHH MAN!!!!! Come on!!!!!!!"
Next thing I know, I am being told people's orders and being sent on a coffee run to get away from everyone.

Let's just say that this place does not agree with my body. I could barely stand to be in the car with myself. 
I know that might be more info than you want to read, but be careful with this place.

Burrito Express is now my Only eat when not working, and wife is at work place.
