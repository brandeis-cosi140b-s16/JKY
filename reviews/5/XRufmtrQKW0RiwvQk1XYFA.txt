My wife, sister-in-law and nieces had dinner there last evening. This is the second time we've enjoyed this lovely restaurant since it opened last month. It is beautiful, clean, roomy and the food is excellent. We were attended to by "El Hefe" Jorge himself, and he made sure we had everything perfect. He aims to please and he made our evening wonderful. The wait staff are all attentive and friendly but never obnoxious. Just very pleasing. I especially like their beef enchiladas. The sauce has such a special delicate flavor that I have never tasted before, and the beef is tender and juicy with no fat or gristle. The rice and beans are perfect. Sister had a seafood tostada and nieces had taco salads and cheese enchiladas. Everybody loved their food. This is our new Mexican hangout. One of the best we've ever found in Las Vegas.
