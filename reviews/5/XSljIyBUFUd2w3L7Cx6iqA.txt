I've been eating here pretty regularly since it first opened. Since it's not in the busiest easy to find part of Gilbert, it used to always be easy to get in and has great food. Evidently, people are finding out about this place because now, at the right time, you'll be waiting sometimes out the door to get in. This place IS that good. I'll still stand in line, I don't care. Price is reasonable and food is great. I usually try to get something different every now and then and have never had anything I didn't like there. Staff is always great and has a nice outside area.
