BEST (only?) MEXICAN IN PITTSBURGH
(I feel confident in saying this because I'm not aware of any other authentic Mexican restaurants in the city.)

We've been eating at Patron's since it opened at this location.  Raul, Alicia, Oscar and the entire staff do an amazing job of treating their guests right and serving delicious food.  Much better than Tex-American-Mexican wanna be's like Mad Max.  Much less LOUD too.   

We've gone on date-nights, with friends, with our kids - and it's been great each time.

As I've told my friends, I'm not that crazy about Mexican food in general.  I grew up in the South and true Mexican restaurants there are numerous.  But not only does Patron serve great food, the atmosphere is casual & fun and the wait-staff are attentive and exceptional.

We budget for eating out and wouldn't waste these unique times on anywhere that didn't hit all the targets.  Patron Restaurant we return to again and again.

YUMMY!!
