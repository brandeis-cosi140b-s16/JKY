Married to a pure blooded Sonoran master chef so I rarely go out for Mexican food. However, I was craving a morning fix of some authentic Mexican and Asadero absolutely blew my fricken mind..

A lot of Mexican places in AZ claim to have carne asada but it tastes downright nasty. Asadero absolutely made me foodgasm over their carne asada and cabeza burritos. Highly recommended if you ever venture out to the downtown area and you need a quick, authentic fix.
