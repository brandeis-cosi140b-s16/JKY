Beyond delish. This is the only Mexican restaurant in the greater Charlotte area where this native Californian will feast.
We went here after hearing about it while sitting next to a talkative man on an airplane. We complained about the lack of authenticity in the Queen City. He couldn't agree more.
But this is real comida Mexicana, amigos. The prices are extremely fair (don't go to Cantina 1511), the food is fresh and you can tell that the refried beans are homemade. 
The staff seems to like it here, too. Our drinks were always full, the chips' basket overflowing and even though we sat outside on a semi-rainy day, we weren't forgotten.
