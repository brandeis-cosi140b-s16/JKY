So many people gave it good reviews I had to try it. Korean and Mexican Fusion? I had to give it a shot. I was in the mood for tacos. I took one of each. For 1.69$ why not? So Bulgogi, Dak-Gogi and Daeji-Gogi. Bulgogi hit the spot, and I was surprised by the Daeji-Gogi (Spicy Pork) that was great. The blend of flavors made it a great taco. Something that I definitely have never had before. This place got it right in all sorts of levels. I am going back to try the bulgogi burrito. Its cheap, fast, and such great quality. A Hole-in-the wall place, in a not so-busy shopping center, thank god for yelp or I would have never known about this place.
