Where to start! My boyfriend and I always seem to come here when we want to go out to eat for yummy Mexican food. First of all, flour chips.. I love them and it is awesome that they mix them in with the corn chips. The salsa is tasty yet mild so we always ask for the hot hot stuff because we like a little spice. 

We always start out with the South Of The Border Sampler Platter. I could eat their green corn tamales for every meal if I could! So yummy. It also comes with a quesadilla, red and green chile burros, chicken fundidos, queso, and guacamole and beans! Such a substantial platter and you get to try a little bit of everything. 

For our entr√©e we always split the Chicken Fajitas! It is obvious that they make their own flour tortillas because they are out of this world delicious. I usually eat the veggies out of the fajitas and my boyfriend eats the chicken (which is seasoned wonderfully) so it is plenty enough for both of us. The wait staff is always attentive and checks in on you. Only once they took very long in the kitchen to prepare our food and they felt bad and we got a free dessert! We will keep coming back here again and again!
