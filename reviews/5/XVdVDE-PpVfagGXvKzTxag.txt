Finally a good late night spot by my house- AND THEY HAVE A BAR! 

I had the chance to try out Pinches at the soft opening today. Upon walking in, the place was packed and I was still welcomed graciously by the employees, which I later found out was one of the owners. I've opened a lot of restaurants and I know how rough openings are, but wow- they made it look easy. If it's this great already, I see a bright future for Pinches!

I tried the El Pastor taco & the pollo taco- both delicious. My first time having pastor and I was very impressed. My family has owned an authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas since the 1960's, so I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, and I finally found one that I like. Quality ingredients, not just loaded with sour cream and cheese. The tortillas were handmade, and that makes ALL the difference. 

There's outside patio seating available and a full bar area that's half inside and half out. The seating is very relaxed and spacious.

After speaking with the owner, Jorge Anaya aka "Pinche" I learned a little more about the restaurant. They have multiple locations in California and one in downtown Las Vegas. He was awesome and treated me like I was at home, very smart guy that you can tell cares about the very last detail of his food.  

I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu!

In the words of Jorge, "We don't take life seriously, we just take our tacos seriously."
