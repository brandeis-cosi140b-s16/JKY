Just all around delicious authentic Mexican food with authentic atmosphere. Manager came out and let us utilize the free margarita from Yelp. Hostess was beautiful and helpful. Waiter was fast and always on top of everything. Salsa was good. Shrimp tacos were bomb. Cheesecake burrito was a new dessert worth trying. Just go, no way to be disappointed.
