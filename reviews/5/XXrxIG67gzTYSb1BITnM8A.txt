Los Cerritos is a staple of my neighborhood. I was born and raised in Phoenix, and I moved away four years ago, and every single time I come back my first stop is this little Mexican food joint.

I cannot be in Phoenix for more than one hour without swinging through the drive through window for the Chile Relleno Burrito. DO NOT MISS THIS! It is the perfect balance of chile, cheese, and sauce wrapped up in a warm tortilla, and it is extremely reasonably priced.

It doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside the service is quick and easy and the food is good and cheap. What more could you want??
