Stop by here my first time in old Town Scottsdale after dropping off an application in the area.. It was 1, i had an annoying day so far, I felt like having a drink. It was fairly empty but started to get busier while I was there, I had 2 margaritas that were great and the bartender was pleasant enough without overwhelming me and she was incredibly easy on the eyes.. Will go back here again sometime for the cheap drinks, divey atmosphere and the excessive day drinking that im sure goes on here
