Que ricooooooooooooooo! 

We picked up a couple of late-night burritos (after playing Galaga, of course) and were sooooooo happy. Sure the place was a little sketchy at 1 am but who cares - the burritos were delicious. 

They had the perfect blend of spice, rice, cheese, beans and meat! I don't care that they're a chain - the food's good!
