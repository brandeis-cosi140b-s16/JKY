Had lunch here the first day I was at the hard rock hotel. They recommended the pink taco and it was awesome. They have chips they bring out before your food and there are some pink ones in there. They also have merchandise you can buy - Which are all awesome. Outdoor or indoor seating. The hype is right - this place is great
