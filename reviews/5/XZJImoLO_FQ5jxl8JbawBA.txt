First off, best chips & salsa in town!!! Fresh, hot chips & thick, salsas. A flavorful red roasted chile salsa, & a nice and spicy green tomatillo salsa.
I had a habit of when I visited my father in mexico to visit every restaurant and try their version of the chile relleno, & the representation of it from Rosita's is a good as I can remember! My favorite mexican restaurant in town.
Authentic flavor, great portions, attentive staff.
They do tend to get very busy at times. So be prepared.
