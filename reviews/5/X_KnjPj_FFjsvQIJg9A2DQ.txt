From San Diego so we know good taco shops 
This is first rate fresh veggies and brisket beef in the caldo res soup my wife wanted to try the menudo and the lovely owners Caesar and Irene gave her a small bowl no charge
Carne and chicken tacos full of fresh meats not too salty and everything is made fresh
You won't be disappointed
