Awesome place for breakfast burritos.  Huge burritos with quality, good tasting ingredients for a good price.  Much better option than any of the chains around.  

Others have commented that they don't speak English however the girl that rang me up spoke very good English and had no problem understanding my special request for my order.  Menu is in both Spanish and English.  There is a sign that says specifically to make sure you know what you are ordering as they wont give refunds.  I'm guessing that's because there are like 20 different types of meat, a lot of which I've never heard of. 

This place has been on my list to try for their tacos so I will definitely be back to try them out.
