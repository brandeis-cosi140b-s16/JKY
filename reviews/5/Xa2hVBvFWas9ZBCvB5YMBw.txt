I LOVE PINCHES TACOS!!!!
No Really....LOVE!

First off, in the Container Park in Old Down Town. Such a super cool place to go.
We love bringing visitors to the park. Take them for the obligatory walk down Freemont St, then stroll over to Pinches for your reward! Delicious, amazing tacos!

I always get the taco plate. 3 tacos of your choice, rice and beans. And although I am definitely a gringo, but one my favorite is the lengua tacos (if you don't know, maybe you should not ask.) But the fish tacos are amazing, as are the rest. I have never been disappointed here!

Last time I was there, had a bite of the Torta (a mexican sandwich) - It was awesome too! 

If you are a local or even visitor and in the Old Downtown/Freemont area.
Do yourself a favor and go check out Pinches in the Container Park. You will not be disappointed! YUM!
