This place gets five stars for the green salsa alone. It's addictive, and they sell it BY THE CUP FULL. What they really ought to do is bottle it and put it in the store. It's spicy enough, but not overwhelmingly so. 

The breakfast burrito is the only thing I've had, and we get it every Sunday. The ham is the best, but so is the chorizo and bacon. You can't go wrong, especially with a side of pinto beans. Take it to go, eat in on the patio.. this place can't be beat. 

The price is right, and the green sauce is addictive.
