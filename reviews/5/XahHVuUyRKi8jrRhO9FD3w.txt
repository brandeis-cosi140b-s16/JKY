Idk what these poor reviews are about. I love the staff and the food is on point. They are always gracious, even at 9am when I show up. I grew up eating nothing but Mexican food. The borracho burro is a must try if you like green chili.

I come here almost every Thursday. Definitely a good weekly treat. Also, the place looks fantastic since the remodel.
