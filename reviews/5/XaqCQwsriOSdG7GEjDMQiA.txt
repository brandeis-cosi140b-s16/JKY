My daughter lives nearby and suggested we try it if I like mexican food. Wow, I was NOT disappointed! I ordered a chicken chimichanga.  The chicken was plentiful, shredded and tasty.  Enough beans, and fresh veggies to make it a mound of the most delicious dinner that was enough for 2 feedings.  Daughter had her fav: chicken quesadilla.  It was over-stuffed with cheese.  She was pretty happy.  Service through the window great and fast and very affordable!!  I can't wait to go back when I visit the next time!
