I LOVE this restaurant!  I've actually been eating there for quite some time, but just now getting around to reviewing them.  They are hands down, what you want in any restaurant.  Their prices are cheap, portions large and it's majority run by family.  Their "mom and pop" atmosphere is what really keeps me coming back.  They are always friendly, and their food is authentic and delicious!
