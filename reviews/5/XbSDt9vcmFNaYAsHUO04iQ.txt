Try the sampler plate... all meats perfectly seasoned, and the bean and rice are also good.  The tacos are my favorite, but the quesadilla de maiz was really good and crunchy.  Salsas are all fresh and tasty, my fav was the green salsa with red onion and the red one was spicy with flavor .  Service is awesome.
