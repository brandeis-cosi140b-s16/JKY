I pity the poor folks who don't comprehend New Mexican cuisine. I was turned on to this place by a friend of mine who grew up in Gallup. I asked where the best New Mexican food in Phoenix was and this was one of 3 places he loves. He lives in North Scottsdale, so it's easily an hour round trip with no traffic (since when is there no traffic in Metro Phoenix!) so he readily admitted that that journey doesn't happen very often. He, like me, stops there on the way back from Tucson (easy stop from the freeway) or if he is playing golf in the Chandler, Mesa, Gilbert area.
 
Here you go:
 
The BEST free salsa & chip plate I have ever had. #1 all time. This is worth the stop!
 
Hatch chile rellenos. They don't get any better. I often get 4 or 6 to go after we've eaten.
 
Maragaritas....... as good as they get. If you are driving .... no more than two.
 
Tamales...... none better. Fabulous burritos.
 
Stay away from the Americanized dishes and enjoy the best of Nuevo Mexico.
 
Get the #1 plate & pray you have room for the sopapilla(s). They'll bring you another if you are nice!
 

Just like Tia Stella used to make! Vaya con dios....... you'll be back and back and back.
