OMG! Amazing & scrumptious soft street tacos & delicious, fresh tamales!  ....5 Stars. all the way! 

The food is modeled after Mexico City street eats. The most obvious choice is therefore the tacos, sold individually for $2.50 or in sets of three for $7. Soft corn tortillas encase a selection of fillings. The star here is the barbacoa, beef brisket rubbed with coffee and chili de arbol. It's a tender and flavorful way to fill a taco, but the chicken and pibil (pork shoulder) are good second choices. There's also an impressive vegetarian option that goes beyond the usual rice and beans to include roasted potatoes, mushrooms, and pepitas.
