This place is great!!! My husband and I had a nice quiet lunch on the patio in the spring. The food was absolutely delightful! It was my first time trying chicken and waffles. Since then I have been addicted. We knew we had to go back!! We took our whole family there for lunch and everyone was pleasantly surprised with the food and service!!!
