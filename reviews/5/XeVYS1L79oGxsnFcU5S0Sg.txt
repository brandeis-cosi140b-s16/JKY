Soooo good! Ordered asada tacos and fries, hit the spot! Meat was good, fries were that perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside and the tortillas are made fresh in front of you and makes the tacos so yummy. Went at midnight and it was packed, you have to wait in  different lines to order certain meats, but totally worth the wait. Would definitely come here again and again.
