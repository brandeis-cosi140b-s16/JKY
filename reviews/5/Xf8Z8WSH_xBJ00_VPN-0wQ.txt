Caminero is like my mistress. I wake up thinking about you. You make me happy and never judge me. You don't get mad when I cheat on you and when I come back into your arms feeling guilty you give me a big hug. I can even bring my wife around you, although I here she is now making solo visits and not letting me watch.

My latest hug was the Chorizo Breakfast burrito. Its the best I've had. Perfect blend of cheese, chorizo and eggs. The hug before that was the chicken taquitos, which might I say are hand rolled and very meaty, not from a box like that ugly whore "Berto" down the street.

See you soon my love.
