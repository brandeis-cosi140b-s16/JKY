The food is absultely delicious and the service is even better.  The whole staff is super friendly even when dealing with an entitled and rude Scottsdale clientele.  They always smile and serve large protions.  The other locations around it are a waste of time to be honest.  This location is amazing and as you can see from the amount of checkins I have, I will continue to come back.
