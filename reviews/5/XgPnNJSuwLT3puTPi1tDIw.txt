This is my favorite taco place! I traditionally would always eat these type of tacos in Mexico on the side of the road hoping they were beef! lol... The carne asada tacos are excellent! You actually get all meat, no chewy surprises like at other places. I love them with lots of lime juice on them. I have also tried a carne asada quesadilla and it was great! Definitely stop by if you are in the area. You will love it.
