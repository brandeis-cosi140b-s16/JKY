You know how you try something new, you love it, and you go back to eat the same thing over and over again, and it never fails to taste just as good as it did the first time you ate it?? Zaba's is that place for me!! I went there for the first time about two years ago, and since then I have gotten their salad with the chicken, sweet potatoes, corn, balsamic vinaigrette, and guacamole almost every week. Ive tried making it myself since the ingredients are fairly simple but it never tastes the same! And for some reason this location on flamingo is the best. They cut their sweet potatoes perfectly. The downtown summerlin location sweet potatoes are a bit too big and chunky.
