Simply my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix.  Nothing fancy, but such delicious food.  The restaurant is very clean, the service is friendly.  My favorite things to order: chips and salsa (and sometimes Guac), cheese crisp (with extra salsa), chicken burro enchilada style, chicken chimi.  Of course, I don't get all of this is one sitting.  :)  We go back over and over and just love it!
