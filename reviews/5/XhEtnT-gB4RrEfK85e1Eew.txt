Oh my god y'all this place is for real.  The food is inversely proportional to what the place looks like on the outside, and I'm telling you it looks like a ramshackle dump.  The burritos are proper and the price is right.  I don't know if the horchota is any good, I don't drink that stuff.  I think its cash only but don't worry about strolling in to such a dangerous looking location with your last $20 because the dude behind the counter has a firearm on his hip and he will protect you.  I recommend the patio seating; it is probably the worst outdoor seating in all of Arizona if not the civilized world.  You'll spend your time waiting for your food marveling that anyone would eat there and then you'll snatch up your package when they holler and head home.  When you do take your first bite and then listen closely: I told you so.
