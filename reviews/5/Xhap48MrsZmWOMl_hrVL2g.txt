WOW!  Went with a group of 6 people and it was so much fun sharing dishes and great atmosphere.  Fun with a big group and every single thing that I tried, I loved.  Really great for trying new things and even more fun with a group.  As we were leaving, we saw a lot of young, singles coming into the bar.  Looked fun also!
