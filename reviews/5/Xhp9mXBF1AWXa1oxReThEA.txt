Best MEXICAN FOOD in the USA. 

My favorite here is the al pastor tacos. To order your meal you walk up to the station labeled with your meat preference (pollo, chorizo, al pastor, etc). You then take your food and purchase it at the register behind the line. There is not much seating and definitely no service but the food is extraordinary, especially whatever they put in that green salsa that they add in the tacos. 

If you've never been to Vegas and want to try some good food this place is a definite MUST.
