I've had the pleasure to visit this place about three times now, and It hasn't disappointed me at all. 
Firstly, amazing colors through out the place, such lovely and joyful decor. Secondly, what freakingly amazing tacos!! The cochinita pibil is one of my ultimate faves, with the carne asada very close to a tie!! Thirdly, the cocktails!! Oh my! The muy buena Paloma Cocktail!!! 
But seriously, this place is great, I cannot emphasize enough how terrific this cafe is.
I really adore and admire Gallo's style and taste in food, it's truly amazing, and closer to the actual modern food in Mexico, at least very similar to the South Central style.
 You won't see the overplayed cheese and beans plate here, no sir!  That's what makes me love them more, how they steer more into the actual True Mexican dishes, with a bit of a slight twist but still about the same in extraordinary flavors.
