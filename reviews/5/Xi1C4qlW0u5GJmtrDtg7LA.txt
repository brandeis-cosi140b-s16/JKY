Place was recommended to us by a staff member at the Hard Rock.... Thank you !!!
I am pretty sure the mahi mahi fish taco was the best I have ever had. I also got a shrimp taco- just as delicious. My husband said his 4 were off the hook. Great selection of Microbrew beers on tap- Homerun !! Friendly helpful staff and very good prices.
