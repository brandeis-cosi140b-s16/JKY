I brought a group of 15 executives to Hussongs Cantina for a few Margaritas and mexican food. I never expected such a fun and welcoming experience. The service was great! We were lucky enough to have tried just about every item on the menu. Every item we tried was tasty and captured the spirit of 'the real' food in Mexico. 

We started with guacamole and three salsas on the menu. 
It was obvious that the guacamole and salsas were freshly made and I was in heaven from the beginning of our gastronomical experience. We continued by having all the appetizers on the menu brought in as tasters. The one thing that was immediately noticeable was the freshness of the food - OMG the corn (Elote Plazero) and the tamales were my favorites. The taste of the corn on the cob was amazing - with Cotija cheese and spicy sauce still make my mouth water - I could not get enough!. The tamal captures the authenticity of the recipes from Mexico. I am South American so their food had me from the beginning to the end. We continued by having platters with the whole variety of the tacos they serve. My favorite were the Lobster Tacos -- All of the tacos had their own unique flavor since the sauces, peppers and salsas were different depending on which taco we were having. The Nachos were huge and loaded with all the goodies you can imagine. We finished with dessert plates which had a little of each dessert on the menu -- I have to confess, by then, I just couldn't eat one more bite -- However, everyone around the table were in heaven... 

We had so much fun! Our waitress was fabulous and made herself a part of our gathering as the perfect hostess. The place was jumping and music was playing ~ and our group of executives felt as if we were a friends house. Thank you Hussong's -- We will be back when in Las Vegas! Great Job...
