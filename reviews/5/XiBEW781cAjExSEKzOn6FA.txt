I lived in Tucson for 12 years before moving to Tempe. As such, I've eaten many Sonoran hot dogs at the best known places (El Guero Canelo, BK's etc). Micky's are the ONLY Sonoran dogs I've found in metro Phoenix that are comparable to the Tucson greats. In fact, I think Micky's makes a better hot dog than El Guero Canelo (gasp!). Since El Guero switched their buns from normal to gigantor sized bolillos, their balance has suffered. Too much bread relative to the filling. Micky's are just right. Combine that with mesquite grilled hot dogs with nice, chewy charred bacon and a green hot sauce that's actually hot, and you've got something. The only down side is that you don't get a grilled chile on the side. 

I've never had anything else here, so I can't comment on the quality of other items. I can't imagine they're bad if they do a hot dog this well.

Also, I always get the "what are YOU doing here, gringo?" look from the staff whenever I go, particularly from the lady that runs the place. That might be offputting to some people, but for me it just reinforces the fact that I'm in the right place to get REAL Sonoran food.
