Can't wait for spring so I will feel comfortable about walking about that area(new to Wi & snow)& going to enjoy this place, the staff is really nice & friendly.. the food outstanding... made me think of San Diego!!  The serving size was plentiful since I was really craving Mexican food! The restroom was clean too.
