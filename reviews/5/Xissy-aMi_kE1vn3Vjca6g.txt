Awesome food.  First time here and we will definitely be back for more.  Came on a Saturday afternoon with the kids.  Ate inside.  Kids each had great cheese crisps and wife and I had shredded chicken tacos and chorizo enchiladas.  Everything was great.  Stayed for some drinks-$3 make your own bloody mary's- and listened to radical 80s tunes!

Cheap cheap food and really great atmosphere.  We'll see this place again!
