Location for this place is obviously great, but that's not what makes this spot a 5 star for me.  The food alone deserve a 5 star.  They are huge tacos, so don't assume you will eat as many as you would with smaller sized tacos.  On a side note, you will smell like bbq by the time you're with your order, but well worth it.
