PLANTAINS ...

At the heart of this review are plantains. They put plantains in their chimichangas. 

Now I'll pretend that you are still reading. You shouldn't be, because if you re-read the previous line about the plantains you'd realize you should just move on to the part where you eat them in the chimichanga. But you're still reading so....

GUCACAMOLE MADE FRESH AT YOUR TABLE.. with LOTS of LIME. I could make, and have made a whole meal out of of the guac and chips. So fresh. It's... it's so fresh. I've only had fresher in Costa Rica. It's really fresh. 

I want to go back to these plantains for a moment. They are seriously delicious, and afterwards you can hang out with your friends and be all "Ohh no big deal, I just had a chimichanga with plantains, I guess I'm just special and you're not even really all that great, I don't know why I even talk to you.'

But anyway, they add a nice fried/sweet taste into the spices of the chimichangas. This is on top of the crispy shell that is covered in one of 3 sauces that you get to choose or mix. We really love the white queso sauce, but they are all good in their own right. 

And the people are great, always get that kind of service that's like 'sup, what can i get ya bro', as if you hung out with these guys in college. 

Outdoor seating is a plus, especially when there is live music. Seen a few good bands there. 

ps... Plantains.
