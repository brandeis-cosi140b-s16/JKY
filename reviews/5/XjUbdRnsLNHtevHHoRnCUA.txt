My favorite place to have a burrito.  Love the Carne Asada, it was made for me, no rice, just beans, carne asada and pico.  If you love Chipotle then you will probably hate this place because La Canasta does not include a salad inside your burrito like Chipotle does.  Shrimp burrito is amazing as well.  Something about the hot sauce keeps me coming back for more.
