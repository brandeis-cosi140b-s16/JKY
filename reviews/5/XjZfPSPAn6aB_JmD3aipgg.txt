Oh my gosh yum. I thought I was going to leave hungry after getting "only" two chicken tacos - could not have been more wrong. The guys who run the stand heaped on the meat, and I heaped on veggies and salsa toppings. I was stuffed, and could not have been happier. This is easily the best authentic Mexican joint I've been to in Pittsburgh, bar none. Do yourself a favor and go - the price couldn't be better, and the food is SO good.

FYI - if you do not like a lot of heat, DO NOT use the hot sauce in their topping bar! The orange sauce is SUPER FIERY!
