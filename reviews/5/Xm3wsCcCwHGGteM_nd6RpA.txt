Whenever Im in this area of town and I need a fast-food place, I always hit up Federico's. 

Call me boring, but I LOVE bean and cheese burritos. And this place really does an excellent job on them.  They are about 3 times the size of a lot of local spots nearby and the beans taste like the ones my Nana used to make. And Im convinced my Nana made the best beans around.  They also add a white cheese (asadero) to them which tastes a heck of a lot better than the standard cheddar that some places add to their burritos.

I havent tried anything else here so my review is based strictly on the bean and cheese burritos.  If I lived a bit closer, I would try some other items on the menu, but for now please take my word that these burritos are really good. Havent been disappointed yet.
