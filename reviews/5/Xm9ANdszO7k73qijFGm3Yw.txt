When my friend Jay F picked me up from the McCarran International, our first order of business was food, and that food was tacos. As you can see from his glowing reviews, this is a Top 10 Vegas spot for him. And if you are a foodie who loves authentic street food, this will be INSTANTLY be a Top 10 Vegas spot for you too.

The small and unassuming taco stand is on the side of a small shopping center tucked away in a corner off the strip within sight of The Wynn. And for about 1/10th of the price of meals on The Strip, you'll probably get your best meal on or around The Strip. The Abodaba is spicy pork that is cooked on a rotisserie like gyro meat would be, and is then sliced to order. Amazing. And if you like the jiggly pieces, they've got Beef Head, Beef Brains, Beef Tongue, Pork Stomach, and Tripe. 

Not being much for the jiggly parts - except for beef tongue, that is - I ordered the lengua, adobada, and asada. At $2.00 each ($2.25 for tongue) these were amazing tacos, filled with meat, each with a unique garnish, and served with a huge plate of grilled veggies as additional garnish. It was an awesome amount of fresh, authentic Mexican street food for $6.25. 

As I told my friend, this is the type of place that Tony Bourdain would go nuts over on one of his shows ... great cheap street food with lots of the jiggly bits offered. And this is a must-stop for all future Vegas visits.
