I hesitated to give this place 5 stars because it's in the ghetto and the decor is... er... not great.

But... that makes no difference because this place makes some of the most mind-boggling deliciousness at bargain prices. Yes. Korean BBQ and Mexican is one oof the most beautiful marriages in all of culinary history and this place makes the union shine. I nearly wept with happiness at the yumminess of each bite.

There's not much else to say except that this place makes Mexican food (which was good to begin with) new, exciting, and even better than before. If you like Mexican, Korean, or just awesome noms at awesome prices, then you MUST make a pilgrimage.
