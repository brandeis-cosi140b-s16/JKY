Having moved to the Queen city from SoCal where authentic Mexican food rules, I can say that this is the closest you will get to good Mexican food around this area. I am talking about food that is not drenched in melted cheese, canned tomato salsa, or tacos made from ground meat and on a hard shell. This is Mexican home cooking. The food served here and their flavors are what I am used to growing up on Mexican food. The place is a family owned business that cooks every dish to order and they try their best to serve their food as quickly as possible without compromising quality. This will be a good place to try if you have never had a chance to eat authentic Mexican, and the place to go if you are a West coast transplant yearning for true tacos.
