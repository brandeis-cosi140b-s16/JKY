I love this place. I used to live right by Mi Pueblo. Now I don't get to eat here often because I live so far away. 

The food is great. The service is great. I have never had a bad experience in the 7 or 8 years I have been going here. I have brought a bunch of friends to this place if we happen to be looking for something to eat in the area, and they have always enjoyed their meals as well.
