AMAZING something as simple as a steak quesadilla was delicious.  They have a great salsa bar with fresh limes, tomatoes, salsa..etc So good that after we ate we order another round of food all over again. Visiting from California and by far the best Mexican food I have ever had.  So sad I can't get this all the time but now there is a great reason to come back to Phoenix!!
