I've been to Dick's dozens of times. You can't say enough about the character of this place. Part 21st century technosaloon, part southwestern foodie's paradise, and no sign on the front. Every time I've been there at 11 on a Sunday it has been packed. 

Hands down the best huevos rancheros (overeasy, red & green) you can get, not just in Phoenix, probably the entire western US. I can't remember the last time I've come here and ordered something else. I've had the jalape√±o eggs benedict, too, and they're incredible -- not as much heat in the hollandaise as I'd like, but my tastes run spicier. My wife got the tenderloin benedict, which I tried and was very tasty. 

They have free wifi, nice cocktail servings (the mimosas and Bloody Mary are very generous), homemade chile sauce, and the coffee is above average.

I cannot recommend this place enough; if Yelp gave me 10 stars, Dick's would get every single one of them.
