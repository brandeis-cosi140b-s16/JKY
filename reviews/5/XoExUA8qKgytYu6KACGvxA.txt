We were there last Saturday night for our daughters 12th birthday, and she brought 3 friends. Could not have asked for anything better! The waiter was so attentive to all our requests! Food was really good and the Margaritas were excellent!!!  We stayed at the Hilton, so they gave us our drinks in go cups when we left....we got a pitcher so my husband & I weren't able to quite finish.... Will definitely go back next time we want a "staycation"  Hilton gives a great "local rate"!
