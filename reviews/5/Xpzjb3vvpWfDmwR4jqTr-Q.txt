Been here several times for the delicious empanadas and the best horchata ever.  Service was very personable and excellent by chef Carlos. The last time I visited, he was not there, sorry to see this, his recommendations and enthusiasm for the cuisine is deeply missed.  Also,hours are very limited now.
