I was completely impressed!  When we walked in, the decor wasn't all that which made me think this is all about the food, and it was.  Authentic and tasty.  Met and spoke with the owner and was taken by his hard working ethic!  Cannot wait to go back and try something different!  Again, dont judge by appearances - give it a try!
