Hey Urverybody.

You want the mexicos? You come to this place, capiche? 

I haven't been impressed with a mexican joint in a long while. Doesn't mean they aren't good, just means theyre all as good as the ones next door.

Not Cinco de Mayo.

Atmosphere and service are okay. Nothing bad, nothing really good. They're fine. But the food is some of the highest quality and freshest Ive had, the prices are crazy good. 

Go here. 
Drink a margarita, theyre amazing. 
Order a chipotle burrito.
They put real chipotle peppers in it.
