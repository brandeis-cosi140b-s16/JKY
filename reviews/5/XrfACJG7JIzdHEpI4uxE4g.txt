If you like your Mexican food Mexican, this is the place! Fresh salsa bar, friendly people, and the enchiladas are my now girl's fave in town. Personally, I like the tostada. It's piled high with goodness and the guacamole and fresh cilantro are so nice to my taste buds. I'm loving the Mexican bottled coke to go with everything. And don't miss the FRESH FLAN! With so many options in this area, this place is the real deal, a sure thing in Vegas.
