This is by far the best mexican food in las vegas. They have almost anything you can think of but the tacos are the best. They are just the way a taco should taste authentic mexican. They only accept cash but do have an ATM inside for you to withdraw cash. The wait is only about 15 min for you to get you food .......but of course they're always packed so thats great service in my opinion. Everyone is friendly there if I could 20 stars not just five   :)
