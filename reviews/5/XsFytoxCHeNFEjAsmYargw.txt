Stopped here for lunch following a morning of training near the strip.  I had read the reviews on this place for a while and always had wanted to try it.  People, listen, if you want good Mexican street tacos, come to this place.  Had two al pastor tacos and one carne asada.  They were awesome!  A bit on the small side, like mexican street fare, but at two bucks a taco, you can get filled for ten bucks.  Good luck trying to find a deal like that anywhere else on the strip that isn't commercial fast food.  next time, and yes there will be a next time, I'm going to grab some asada fries, because these other yelpers keep going on and on about them.
