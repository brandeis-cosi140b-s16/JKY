I've been coming to El Valle for years. I love the authentic Mexican food and atmosphere. The prices are very affordable.  There was another brand new Mexican restaurant in Matthews that has since closed.  I went there once.  No comparison.  My daughter loves El Valle also.  The service is great.  They give you free chips and salsa.  The salsa is spicy.  But, they'll give you mild if you ask.
