There's California Taco Shops and everyone else. It's just fact of the matter. If it wasn't for my wonderful, amazing, absolutely fantabulous wife I would have never thought twice to stop at Pepe's. Prior to going in I thought this had the chance to be one of the all time worst Mexican food joints I've ever tried. Holy guacamole was I wrong! This is the only taco shop in Vegas comparable to my SoCal roots. 

The first positive sign when I walked in was that this place had a juke box full of Spanish music - and it was blasting! There's nothing worse than walking into a quiet taco shop or one that's playing heavy metal (yes, that has happened). The next positive sign was that a majority of the patrons were of latin decent.  Another good sign was that the walls were all neon colors. White walls at a taco shop? No bueno. The last positive sign was that everyone who was finished eating had absolutely demolished their plates. Spotless, all were members of the clean plate club. Nuff said, I was a fan.

Now bean and cheese burrito's are the staple of my taco shop experience. If they pass this test they are guaranteed to have a repeat customer for life. If they fail, they never get another chance, they do not pass Go, and they certainly do not collect any additional money for me. Pepe's passes the bean burrito challenge with flying colors and oodles of cheese. They have the best bean and cheese burrito in Vegas. I've even ventured out to their quesadilla and tacos. Absolutely awesome as well. Their tacos aren't that Taco Bell/Del Taco nonsense either. Small and on corn tortillas, the meat is chopped fresh, ingredients are all fresh. They also have a really good salsa bar. 

Morning, noon, or night you won't regret a trip to Pepe's Tacos.
