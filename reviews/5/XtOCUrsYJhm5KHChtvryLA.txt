Second time  here and I would have to say i am definitely coming back for more. Super friendly service and very nice decor, makes me feel like I'm at my grandmas house. I enjoyed a specialty cocktail called la Michoacana, the perfect combination of sweet sour and alcohol. Then queso fundido came out sizzling and tasted just as
Good as it looked. Next table side presentation of ceviche made just the way you like it. Finally my entree of chicken fajitas did not disappoint, I heard my plate sizzling across the room made for an exciting reveal. Very good! my new go to place for Mexican food!!
