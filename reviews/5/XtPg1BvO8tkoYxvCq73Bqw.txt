This is my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas! The Carnitas is my usual dish, but I've tried most of the menu at the original downtown location. Chips and salsa are delicous. The fish dishes are always fresh. My wife loves the shrimp tostada for something on the lighter side. She also recommends the Cadillac Margarita! Muy bueno!! This is a family owned, local business and it shows. The service is always on point. A friendly staff always welcomes you upon arrival. Best in Las Vegas for sure!!! Forgot to mention the flan for dessert is always perfect. Enjoy!
