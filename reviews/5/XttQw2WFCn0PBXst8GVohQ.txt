Love Love Love Casa.  Sonoran Mexican food at it's best!  The tacos are to die for and the beans are well, the beat beans you'll ever try! The tortillas are fresh and you can tell they're homemade. The enchilada sauce is something of its own with delicious flavor and just the right amount of spice. The green chili is amazing and the salsa too. Everything is fresh and made to order and the service is great. Definitely give Casa a try, your stomach will thank you!
