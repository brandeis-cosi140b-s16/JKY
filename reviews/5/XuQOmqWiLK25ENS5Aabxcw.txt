Came here on the recommendation of my airbnb host, who claimed it was a secret neighborhood spot. From the outside, you can easily miss it, but it's well worth searching out. Extremely affordable food and drinks and, like many others have pointed out, the best green chile burro you'll ever have. Check it out!
