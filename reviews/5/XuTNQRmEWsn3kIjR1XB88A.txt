I love this restaurant!  They have great service, a nice ambiance, and the chips and salsa are great.  And the fried ice cream is the best!  Everyone in our family and everyone we have introduced the restaurant to, agree.  I have been to the Mesa and Gilbert location and prefer the Gilbert one.  There is a nice beside the restaurant literally out the patio.  Great place for a date or for a family night of good food.
