Love this place! It's NEW Mexican as in New Mexico (the state) food. A lot of times I see it grouped as Mexican or Tex-Mex but that's not the case. Chile and fry bread here and it's delicious! I could sit down with just a bowl of green chile and some tortillas or fry bread and go to town. It's always busy but the staff is friendly and helpful and the praise they get it well-earned and deserved. My strategy is to save half of what I get and eat my whole sopapilla which is a must.
