I started out on the suicide plate  and I'm still here.   

I think I just have to accept it that I've either burned out my palette or  the general public can't tell really spicy from  a hole in the ground.  It's not a macho thing  peppers are my anti drug. :)   You get the heart racing, cold sweats  , paranoia that you're never coming down. So while this one isn't  Bava or Choco   the Panda is still good  shit.    

The taste tour and instructions on filling out the menu are a very nice introduction to what one reviewer has called  a  food court fight.   I have to agree.

I came from Scotland and in the afternoon the Chinese  restaurants opened, yep  Chinese food was an evening  item. The first time I say it in a mall  at 10am I just had to have it, it just wasn't done , not very.. British:) 

 Neither was mixing it with an order from the Italian, I could have invented Mamma Bandidos years back:D   Keeping that history in mind I was so ready to love this place after reading the reviews. After   Pollo Diablo, Jerk rice, Jerk Chicken and the black bean plate I  will   marry this store if Prop 102 doesn't mess that up too.  I'll still cheat on her with Pizza a Metro but  I think the Italian part will understand:)

Ok the pollo diablo  was  crispy better than any buffet attempt  , or most  low to mid chinese eateries  not tough in the middle , full of garlic and  damn it's good. So good that I am glad the recipe for that is up on the Food Network site and plan to make this soon. 

The rice and beans on their own are again better than I expected it.  They are doing better rice than most Mexican, better stir fry than most Chinese and better jerks than a team of Jamaican weightlifters.    In short  I don't care about the canteen feeling , the cutlery  or the  tin dishes ( hand to pop a lid on to take leftovers in ..should I ever leave any)  

The sum of these parts really adds up to a greater whole in the Wall  and my smile can , I believe , be seen from space.    J
