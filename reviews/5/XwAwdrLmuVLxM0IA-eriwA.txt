This taco joint rocks. I ordered 3 carne asada tacos with rice/beans through the drive thru yesterday and regretted it because when I got home and saw the amount of meat on my tacos, I knew I wouldn't be able to finish it. They were very generous with the meat and I love that they had put guacamole and pico de gallo on the tacos. The meat was so favorable and tasted fresh, I ended up eating all the tacos and was not able to eat too much of the rice/beans that I had ordered even though they tasted really good too. The beans were topped with some cheese which made it extra tasty. Will definitely come back next time I crave tacos n burritos. They have so many different items on their menu and I want to try them all.
