| Out-of-Towner Review |
I visit family in Chandler each year for Christmas, but this was our first trip here. The food is excellent. The number 3 combo plate (chili con carne, tamale, taco, enchilada, rice, beans) solved my pregnant wife's crunchy|spicy|melty craving problem she's been having for a few weeks.

The red sauce here is to die for. (This is a New Mexico style place, so you get Hatch Valley chiles as your main pepper ingredient across the board.) It is very, very good and makes the combo plate one of the best things on the menu. You know it's good when the taco is the ranked last on the plate. (And the taco was very good.)

Lunch/dinner combos are served with chips to start (which come with four dips) and sopapillas for desert. Get the cinnamon and sugar ones - they're great.

This place does get busy, so you will wait during peak times.
