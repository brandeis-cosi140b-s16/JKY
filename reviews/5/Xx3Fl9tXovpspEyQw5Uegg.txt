FIVE TICKLED PINK STARS! I just HAD to write a review on the great customer service from the person who took my order and I paid, but more importantly the gentleman who gave me my food while going through the drive through tonight.  His closing remarks? "See you next time," in a friendly and cheerful manner.  I can't tell you how many times I have received sub-standard service in drive-thrus; . no thank you or come back and see us, etc.  We as customers decide where to give our hard earned money and the business needs to decide if they want us to come back because we feel appreciated for giving them our business.

Now for the food. I decided to try something I have never had before, the Nachos Bell Grande; a nice plate of chips with beef, beans, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream.  They were pretty good...chips crispy, nice presentation and hot.  I also decided to order a side of guacamole.  Not the best guacamole I have ever had, but it had good flavor and texture.
