Probably the best Mexican food in Vegas. Meat quality is outstanding, also the plates are real Mexican and not American-Mexican, (but they also have some of those don't worry, and very good). 
Monday's are 50%off for locals and Thursdays all tacos you can eat and domestic beers you can drink for only $20!
Important too, they are open 24/7.
Don't be scared by location or the saphire right next to it, just go!
