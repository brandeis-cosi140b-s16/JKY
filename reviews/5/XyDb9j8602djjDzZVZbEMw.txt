Oh wow.  This was a culinary experience that I will never forget.  I am so glad I found this restaurant.

"The Mission" is next door to The Mission -- that is, the original Spanish Mission from 1905 or so in Scottsdale.  They are not related as far as ownership, but share a similar style.

The restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  Dim chandeliers, and lights hidden behind warm quartz rock and crystals, and gothic decorations, lots of mirrors, crosses, and an angel in the middle of the restaurant.

The servers here are all very friendly and positive.  We had a reservation for the wrong date, but they were able to accommodate us even though we had it wrong. 

The bar is lively, as is the rest of the restaurant.  Lots of couples on dates, men discussing business, and groups of girls doing a "girls night out", all dressed up. 

The food was fantastic.  The small tacos were perfect portion sizes, and the kale salad was spicy and unique and delicious.  The drinks were all great.  Cannot recommend this restaurant enough.  Really a fun time and a great date spot.
