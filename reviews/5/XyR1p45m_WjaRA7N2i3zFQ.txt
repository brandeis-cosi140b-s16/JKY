This restaurant is a neighborhood gem.  The food is always good and authentic, and the service couldn't be better.  It's so nice to be appreciated--when we came in the hostess immediately recognized us and welcomed us back.  The food was incredible and the margueritas the best in the city.  Especially good are the tamales and the enchiladas.  My husband enjoyed the corn chowder and his three tacos.  Try the hibiscus tacos for something out of the ordinary!
