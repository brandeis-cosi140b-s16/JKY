Oh my goodness! How am I just discovering this place? One of the guys at Those Guys Pies recommended them to me. 

Yelpers, they are so good I ate there two days in a row. They offer burritos and gringas and different things but I say go with the tacos. Hubby tried them all and loved them. I as usual chose al pastor, two rancheras (with avocado and crema) and two regular. The meat is SUPER moist and flavorful. Four really wasn't enough, they are extraordinarily light! I could've easily eaten 20! 

As if super tender, moist meat wasn't enough, holy cow the salsas are amazing. And really, you can have sub-par meat but a good salsa elevates a taco. Oh man the green one was sooo good! Super hot and onion-y. It will give you terrible breath (as I write this I still smell to onions) but that's how good it is! I brought a bunch of containers home and have used the salsa to make huevos rancheros, poured it into a bowl of clam chowder and used it with fish. FYI, they are open thursday-sunday. 

Go get yourself some great tacos for dinner tonight!
