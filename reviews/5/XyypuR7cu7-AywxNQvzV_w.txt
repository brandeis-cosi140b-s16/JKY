Trip to Vegas checking out spots off the strip and found Frijoles. Amazeballs! Hands down the absolute best Shrimp quesadilla I have ever had. Great size shrimp, delicious and mouthwatering. No doubt it would be great in a taco or burrito. Perfect carnitas, just a little crispy and moist at the same time, great flavor. 
 I love the variety of aguas frescas, I chose watermelon with pineapple added to it. 

Definitely coming back, wish one was closer! 

Would love to have seen a condiments bar with lime, salsas, onions/cilantro and maybe some radishes!
