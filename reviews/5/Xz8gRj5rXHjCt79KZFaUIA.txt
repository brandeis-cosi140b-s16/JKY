My favorite fast food restaurant. They have the best soft shell tacos. They're meat is really soft and has a good taste. They're sauce is really good as well. They're potato ole's are really good and seasoned well (and very good with ketchup.. Or nacho cheese if you're my dad, lol). I would definitely choose Taco John's over Taco Bell any day.
