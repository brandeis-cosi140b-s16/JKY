Just as expected, 5 stars this time.
I came here with three other friends on New Years Day and we were seated promptly. The entire staff, from the manager, to host, to bartenders were extremely friendly and welcoming. Our server was exceptionally great, offered a variety of recommended items and explained the new items on the menu. We started out with margaritas and chips with guacamole; a delicious way to start a meal might I add. At Chico's request, I had the West Coast Burrito. Now I mean this in the most positive way possible, but I think whomever it was that came up with this concoction must have been high at the time. It was a tortilla stuffed with amazingness. Shrimp, carne asada, avocado, chipotle sauce, FRENCH FRIES....
It was sssoooo good. Everything went together perfectly.
I might go back later today to order it again today!
