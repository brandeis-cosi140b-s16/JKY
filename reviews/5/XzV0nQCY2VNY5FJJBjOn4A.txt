I was in Glendale back in July for 2 weeks, had rented a house, and this place was a mile from where I was staying. I saw all the good reviews and had to try it. This will be now the metric I use to compare all Mexican food I get now. I ate here probably at least 6-7 times in a two week period, sampling several different dishes. I even had breakfast here a couple of times. Everything is homemade and fresh. It's like I just sat down and had a home cooked meal.
