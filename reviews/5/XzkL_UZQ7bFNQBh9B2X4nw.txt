Best horchata ever.

(The food is great too, obviously)

Don't go in expecting much. It is a tiny place in a strip mall... kinda feels like it was a Subway in a previous life. I've only ever seen one dude working in there, so it wasn't super quick, but we loved it and sneak by to pick up horchata and enchiladas anytime we are in the neighborhood.
