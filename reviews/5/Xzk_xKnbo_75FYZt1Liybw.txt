Fantastic, we have been back a couple of times now to purchase the meat by container as take out and it is consistently good.  Purchasing by the container makes it easy to whip up tacos at home, they really pack a lot in the containers you have enough for about 7 tacos.

The salsas are terrific, the green ones are really flaming hot but full of flavor as well.
