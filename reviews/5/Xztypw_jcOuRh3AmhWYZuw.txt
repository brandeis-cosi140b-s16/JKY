After our original plans for lunch fell through, my husband and I ended up venturing over to Caesar's to try this new spot one early December afternoon. Upon entering, they asked if we would like a table or if we would prefer to sit at the ceviche bar. Ceviche? Bar? Don't mind if I do. 

After scanning the menu, we decided on a couple of appetizery things (places to go, other things to eat): the queso fundido and the smoked mussel ceviche. We also had some of an autumn-spiced white sangria our server recommended (delicious!) 

We loved the queso fundido, full of chorizo and delightfully melted manchego. However, the ceviche was absolutely the highlight here. I'd never had a preparation quite like this. The slight spicyness with the smoky mussel flavor and sweetness from the mangoes came together perfectly. I want more!

And a funny story, while enjoying our ceviche we were approached by someone I later figured out was Mary Sue Milliken. She was entirely too excited that we were sitting at the ceviche bar, because she loved the idea but was disappointed that not a lot of people sat there. She decided we needed to try a couple of the raw oysters, so she had the guy working the ceviche bar make some for us. They were, indeed, wonderful, and not just because they were free.

Border Grill will definitely be a part of future Vegas excursions for us, and for you as well.
