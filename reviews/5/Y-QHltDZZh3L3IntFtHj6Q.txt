OMG!! The chimichanga with machaca and green is to die for!! I had to slow down because I was eating it so fast and I knew I would get heartburn if I didn't pace myself!! The chips and salsa were also amazing, as well as the rice and beans!! The only fault is that they don't serve alcohol!! A nice margarita would have been perfect to wash it down!! However, you can bring your own liquor if you want! There's a Walgreens down the street!!
