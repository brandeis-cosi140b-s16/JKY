I don't give many 5 star reviews and I just ate here yesterday and again today.

First, don't expect fine cuisine. I'm not sure when Eric S. ate here, but the vegetables in my fajitas were DEFINITELY NOT frozen. Granted, I got the Fajitas Guadalajara, and it had peppers and onions. Neither were frozen. They still had that crunch and taste from having been fresh before grilling.

This place is an upscale, greasy spoon Mexican place, and it does it extremely well! My fajitas were $14 and I ate 3 huge fajitas in the restaurant and still had enough for 3 more at lunch the next day!

Finally - the guacamole and the flan -- fresh guacamole - has chunks of avocado in it and is made to order. They also use enough lime that it only browns around the edges by the next day. The flan - oh my god... The first time I had it - perfect. So smooth and creamy... Was a spiritual experience.

On top of this all... Freshly fried and still warm corn tortilla chips, and fresh salsa... What more can you ask for?
