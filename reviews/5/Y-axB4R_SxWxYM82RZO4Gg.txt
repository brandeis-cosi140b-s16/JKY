Wow, I really loved this place! Everything we ordered was excellent, even the rice and beans, which I usually never eat because they always tend to be bland and boring, but not Aranda's, everything was excellent.

They have complimentary chips and salsa, which were top notch, an extensive menu, so much to choose from, it was hard to decide. The unsweetened ice tea was killer, clean tasting and fresh, one of my many hang ups in life, gotta have good iced tea!

The portions were huge, so now I have another meal for later, winning. I will be back, I am so glad we ventured out to De Forest :)
