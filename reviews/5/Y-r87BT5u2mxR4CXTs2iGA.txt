Just ate here for the first time and it will definitely not be my last. Had the best chicken tacos since moving here 2 years ago from LA. Friends had the Tortas  and loved them. Will be coming back again and again. Can not wait until the weather warms up because the outside looks like a great place to hang with friends and family.
