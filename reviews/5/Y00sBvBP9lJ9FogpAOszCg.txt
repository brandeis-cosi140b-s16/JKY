Everything was very delicious we got the mar y tierra roll, and the milena roll. The wait was a bit but it was to be expected as there was a parry going on that they were not anticipating.  I highly recommend El Tataki for their service,  quality,  and environment/vibe. The music was great for those asking what kind it was mainly modern mexican. Manuel the owner/manager was on the floor and provided exceptional service,  as he was on the floor sitting/greeting guests, cleaning and even jumped into sushi making.  I quote my wife as he approached us to great us she's said "he made me feel comfortable and welcome" so yea 5 thumbs up Manuel
