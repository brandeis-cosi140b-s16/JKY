I could go on and on about the amazing fresh ingredients and how everything is organic and this and that. I have a feeling most people already know all the greatness that is Chipotle. The huge burritos that can feed a family of four. The super tasty guacamole and made fresh chips with just the right amount of salt. I personally love eating here because no matter if its the tacos or burritos I always end up with so much extra stuff falling out as I try to demolish it. I then end up with a nice little salad at the end. Tell me where else I can get a salad and a burrito for 6 bucks... 

I tend to act like an ambassador for Chipotle. When I find out someone has not experienced their greatness I immediately set up their pilgrimage and to be honest it brings me a lot of joy to see how much they love it. The staff at this location is always great and when they know I am bringing someone new they tend to throw in some free guacamole which they  know will have my friends addicted for life.
