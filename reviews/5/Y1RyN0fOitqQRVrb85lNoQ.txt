Located in a food court with mixed seating, it is similar to Taco Bell or Taco John's, only way more kick ass.  Cheap spicy food, yum yum.  Satisfy your hunger for less than $5 after losing your ass in poker or black jack.  If you win, by all means get the buffet at the Bellagio.  For the rest of you, see you at Del Taco or Wienerschnitzel.  Chose between processed cheese covered burritos or processed cheese covered weiners, it's a classy joint.  No shirt, no shoes, no problem.

Update:  Wienerschnitzel is no longer in this food court, it was replaced with a Sbarro.  :(
