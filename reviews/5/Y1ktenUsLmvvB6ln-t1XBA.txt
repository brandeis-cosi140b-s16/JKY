I have been here a few times before always ordered a bowl ... The review today is solely for the fish tacos ... My BFF had suggested them after the eastern location closed - so I drove to this one and it was totally worth it and I will Be back for these tacos !!! Plus $1.50 for chips n salsa can't beat it .. You get my vote too Zaba's
