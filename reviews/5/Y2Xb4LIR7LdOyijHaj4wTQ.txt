They have a separate vegetarian menu!  The tables are spaced well and you do not feel cramped.  I love the thin chips!  My niece had plenty to choose from on the kids menu and they gave her an entire coloring book.  The wait was only a few minutes while they reset the table (on a Sat. night).  I was out with some very picky eaters and server easily made any changes they asked for.  When they say the plates are hot, they really mean it.
