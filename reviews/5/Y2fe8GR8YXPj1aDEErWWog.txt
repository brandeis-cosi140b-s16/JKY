It was around 7ish in the evening on 10/3 when "it" happened. I had had a distressing phone conversation that left me crying before I went through the drive thru to get a quick dinner for myself  and my son. After I had paid at the window and received my order, the amazing team member handed me a caramel empanada and told me " I threw in this empanada because it looked like I need something sweet". 
Thank you so much to the observant and  caring Taco Bell team member- you made a positive and significant impact on a customer tonight. It's beautiful to see that there are still humans that care about others.

Thank you.
