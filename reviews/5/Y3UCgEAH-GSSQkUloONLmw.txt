Bring cash.They don't take cards. Molcajetes is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.

Lindo Michoacan, Faustos, and Agave can't compare because they don't have the Molcajete. From what I understand, Molcajete means volcano in Spanish. This restaurant's signature dish, "the Molcajete," is served in a black, heavy volcanic rock that looks like the mortar, as in a mortar and pestle (that you pound herbs with). The rock keeps the meat moist and it's decorated with tasty fillings for a fajita. My favorite amongst the fillings is the roasted cactus which looks like a green pepper. They also serve this with big chunks of Mexican cheese--the white, crumbly stuff.

I always order the chicken molcajete without the red sauce because I'm prone to heartburn. One order provides two meals, easy. 

Molcajetes is kid friendly. There's a jukebox loaded with Spanish music that bumps pretty loudly at night. Do not buy the DVDs from the kids that offer them out of their book bags.
