I've only been to Verde once (SO FAR!), so take this with a grain of salt.  But on that visit, Verde impressed me.  A lot.

Indoors is clean and decorated in a trendy, urban, utilitarian style. There was some audio equipment on shelves in a corner, and I wondered if they have a karaoke night or something.

Their menu isn't huge, but what they do, they seem to do well. The sauces were fresh and full of a ridiculous amount of flavor. I ordered the green chile, thinking it would be excellent, since the place is named after it.  So I shouldn't have been surprised that it was the best I've had in recent memory, but I was. Tender pork, fresh-tasting verde sauce with the right amount of spice. 

But wait, there's more: even the rice and beans were fantastic. How many places put much thought or effort into a side of rice?

My friend had one of the taco dishes, and we noticed that the salsa that came with hers was completely different than the one that came with mine.  Both were fantastic.

If I have an experience on a future visit inferior to this one, I'll adjust my rating and edit my review ... but I don't see that happening. This is already one of my favorite downtown restaurants.
