Not true authentic mexican food, but they maintain mexican spices and flavors in their dishes with a modern american twist.  Very yummy!!

Probably one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant is that they provide FREE chips and the most delicious/ flavorful salsa!!!! I could drink the salsa :) If you've lived in PHX for awhile, you know free chips & salsa is a score! 

I visited Black Chile Mexican Grill for lunch and we ordered the cheese dip for an appetizer, which was super rich and creamy.  For my meal I ordered one of the lunch specials plates that came with a half fish torta, french fries and tortilla soup.  One note about the tortilla soup is that is a cream based soup, not the broth kind that you might be used to, but still very good.  All the food was delish and after reading other Yelp reviews it sounds like there are some other great eats to try here, like the churros- sad I missed those!! Ill be back for sure!
