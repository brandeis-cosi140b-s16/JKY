I moved near Los Taquitos about two months ago, and it's funny that I've yet to write a review, considering I eat here at least three times a week.  I really love all the food here, but my favorite is the cheap veggie burrito.  It's the best damn veggie burrito in my sometimes sketchy memory.  Strange enough, and it's no lie, the second best was in Galway, Ireland.  

Margaritas are excellent, and can be had for a mere $3 between 4-7.  Mmmmm.  They squeeze limes and use agave nectar for sweetening.  Very tasty.  

Also try their chile rellenos if they happen to be at the bottom of the menu when you visit.  I want to go swimming in the sauce they pour over the chile.  Love the breakfast torta, slathered in a generous pour of the green salsa.  Great pico?  Absolutely.  

I can't really write enough nice things about this restaurant, and the fact that you have a 20% chance of seeing me there at any given time should testify to my true love.  My only complaint is the styrofoam cups and plastic plates.  I really hate styrofoam.  Get real plates!!!
