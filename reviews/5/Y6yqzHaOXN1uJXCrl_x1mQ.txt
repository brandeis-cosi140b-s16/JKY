I adore this restaurant. We frequented this restaurant for the two years I was in grad school. It is one of the many things I miss about living in Phoenix. Any time I am working or driving through Phoenix, I make sure to stop here at this location and get my fill of hot, spicy, amazing New Mexican food! I return to Phoenix in March, for work, and you can bet that I will make a few visits to Los Dos Molinos for their awesome food!
