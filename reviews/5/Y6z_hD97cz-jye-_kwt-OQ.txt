Wife and I have been coming here every Wednesday for the last several years. Carmelo and Eduardo know us by heart and always bring us my Giant iced half and half tea and the wife's Pi√±a Mexican soda. I really enjoy being able to enjoy my chips and queso dip for a little while before having to order and these guys know my routine. Eduardo always makes sure to bring my special hot sauce to the table "homemade roasted chilies". Pollo con Crema is my stand by but anything with grilled chicken is usually the winner for me. I don't think there is anything I can say negative about the place except the AWFUL "convenience store" that opened next door. Usually attracts the type of kids/adults that make you wanna lock your doors even if you can see your vehicle from inside the eatery....
