Pleasantly Surprised. Stopped in during happy hour for something to eat before the dinner crowd. Had a delicious freshly made Ceviche, and loved every bite. The flavors were great, the chunks of sea bass, shrimp, jicama, cilantro, radish and cucumber slices were mixed in a light grapefruit based broth and not tomatoes, so that was a great find. The lemonade was very tasty too. And. Dessert was a yummy cupcake of pumpkin, cranberry. And nutmeg with cream cheese frosting.

Priced just right. I'll be back. Glad to know its there.
