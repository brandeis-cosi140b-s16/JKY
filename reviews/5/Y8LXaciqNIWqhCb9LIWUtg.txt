Super happy they opened close by! Love this place. The food is AMAZING. You can't go wrong with their pork taco's--delicious. I've stopped by and they are very busy! So, expect a wait, but not too long. Even when it's busy I still manage to find good seating. And, you cant' go wrong with their Taco Tuesdays!
