Wow, found my first local cheap eats gem, hidden away on Reems Rd. Zef's is as good as it gets when you have less than $10 bucks to spend.  It was nice to see the carne asada made fresh and tasted fresh, the shredded beef tacos were yum.  The carnitas taco was just ok though.  The kitchen looked clean and the service was friendly.  We didn't try any chicken so no comment on that.  I'll try the sope and a wet burro next time, but my initial thoughts are two thumbs up!
