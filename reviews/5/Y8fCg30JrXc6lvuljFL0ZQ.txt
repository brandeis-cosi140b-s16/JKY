This is a small unpretentious hole in the wall restaurant with wonderful food. I have lived in the downtown area for several decades and have seen places similar to this pop up and then fade away. I hope that it will establish enough of a following to last, so encourage anyone living or working in the area to give it a try. Expect moderate portions of well-prepared food always made with fresh high quality ingredients. We have ordered take-out online almost a dozen times, and never been disappointed. It is notable that the vegetarian items are exactly that; flavorful beans are made with canola oil NOT lard. Cheese is used with appropriate moderation. I  recommend enchiladas with either the red or house creamy green sauce, nachos, tostada salad, taquitos,etc. and anything with guacamole. It is an ultra-fresh chunky mildly seasoned with the usual tomato,onion and cilantro, never too salty, dollop of goodness. I have reservations about recommending the chile relleno, as it is far from the traditional expectation. It is strips of green chile and cheese in an eggy crepe-like rectangle drizzled with the house creamy green sauce. We jokingly call it the green chile cheese omelet, but like it well enough order the relleno/enchilada combo often. The large menu also offers a lot of American sandwiches, burgers, chicken, salads. Something for everyone!
