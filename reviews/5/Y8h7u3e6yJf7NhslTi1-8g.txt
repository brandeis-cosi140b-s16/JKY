This place blew me away for a cheap awesome place to eat while visiting Las Vegas. It was recommended by a friend and although hard to find, so worth it. The tacos are amazing and cheap(only$2-3 each) I ordered three of them with a side of churros .They were cooked fresh and the flavors are incredible. The flavors are so complex and the meat marinates in a special seasoning and sauce. The chicken was my favorite but the others were delicious as well. There is a wide array of fresh salsa and homemade guacamole. To find this place you need to find the Harley Davidson sign and then walk a bit further to little Hawaii. This place rocks and is must in Vegas. The staff was incredible friendly as well.
