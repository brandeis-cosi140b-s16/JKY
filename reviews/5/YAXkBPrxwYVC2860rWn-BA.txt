Party of two, decided we should support the local community restaurant.
LINA'S
We immediately were greeted by the owner, seated and started with drinks, and Quesadilla appetizer. It was delivered hot, with all the proper sauces. The guacamole is excellent. We order two combination dinners that were hot, delicious, and very filling. All food is prepared and made fresh including the floor tortillas.
The prices were very inline with economy.
The owner answered all our questions, and the service was 5 Star.
