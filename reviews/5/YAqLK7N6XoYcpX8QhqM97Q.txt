Best Albondigas Soup in the US!!!!  We moved to SC from Southern California, where we thought made the best Mexican Food, but Azteca Mexican Restaurant has it down like no tomorrow!  
My husband and I both ordered a bowl each. He went ahead and ordered the pork Carnitas, but I knew the bowl was going to be big based on the price, so I held off ordering anything else. First, our waitress brought a small bowl 1/2 filled with chopped white onion the other 1/2 filled with chopped Cilantro and on top was a slice of a lime!!!!
When the bowls of soup arrived our eyes nearly bugged out of our heads!  It was AMAZING! So amazing that we told our waitress to tell the manager and she got him for us!  Alex is a very concerned, very gracious manager. He was so happy that we were so happy!

You MUST try a Frozen Mango Margarita!  Again, the best we've ever had!!!!
By the way, the Pork Carnitas were very good also, it was just that my husbands eyes were bigger than his stomach and I was so very happy with my Albondigas Soup!

If you like really good Mexican Food, go see Alex and tell him Joe and Monica sent you  :)
