What a great way to start the morning.  Food was hot, good and the service great. Many different choices and also have it your way which we did.  had the breakfast burrito with your choice of 4 items for around $4.50...  The food was so fresh we had to wait a few minutes to eat because it was so hot (not spicy).  Unlike Filibertos the food had lots of flavor...  Great place to eat...
