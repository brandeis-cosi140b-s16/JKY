Breakfast burritos are GODLY!!! Huge, cheap, flavorful - combined with their fresh diablo or tomatillo salsa makes one of the best meals you can get. Better yet, they're served all day until late night closing!

Cheap, awesome Mexican food with a drive thru open as late as 3am, Senor Taco has always been worth the drive for me. From carne asada fries to shrimp tacos, I have eaten here dozens of times and have never had anything but great food.

There are various happy hour specials and deals to make your meal even more affordable. There is literally nothing on the menu over $10, and most is between $5-7.

My personal recommendations are limited to breakfast burritos since their classic menu is pretty damn good, but try either the Hash Brown burrito or the Chorizo and Egg. Heck, get the double wrapped Grande if you want to kill your stomach. The California Surfing burrito is also killer, shrimp and carne asada. Take the hit to your calories, because this place is probably the best Mexican I've had in miles.
