I ordered basic  huervos rancheros with rice. 
The entree was served with slices of meat which appeared to be ham(not sure) on it which I didn't care for, so I took it off. The entree was also topped with cooked slices of fresh mushrooms, green peppers and yellow peppers.  It was very good.

 Everything seems to be homemade even the corn tortillas. 

Service was excellent even though they got slammed right after I was seated.

There are two small dining rooms.

Definitely will return.
