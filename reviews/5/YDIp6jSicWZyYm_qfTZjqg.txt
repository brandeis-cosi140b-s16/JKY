Has got to be the best breakfast burrito place in Maricopa!!  I have been on a vegetarian diet  lately and my favorite burrito comes without the bacon - eggs, potatoes and cheese with all their yummy salsas! I go here usually once a week and the staff is always friendly and regardless if you are taking out or eating in they give you free chips and the salsa bar (which has tons of selections)! Love this place :)
