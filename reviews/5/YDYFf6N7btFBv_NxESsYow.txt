This place is way too yummy! Super flavorful! We have tried just about everything on the menu and enjoyed it all. If you're looking for the flavors of most typical Mexican restaurants in the Valley, this probably won't be your kind of place. Runny black beans flavored with anise, firm shredded Oaxacan cheeses, spicy salsas, bold and unique moles (some more bitter and others sweeter), charred tlayudas, and even some household favorites of mine such as enfrijoladas and entomatadas. Our latest creation is french fries smothered in mole and topped with shredded queso oaxaca (not on the menu, but can be special ordered). Soooo addictive and great prices too! The only downside that I can possibly think of is that it can get a bit toasty inside, but definitely worth a try!
