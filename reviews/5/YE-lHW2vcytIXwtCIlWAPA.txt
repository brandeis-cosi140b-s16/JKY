I am not a harsh grader on Yelp so I have many five star ratings, however I would give this place ten stars as the service and food is that good.  I wasn't expecting much, and did not know about this place, but their cornbread is amazing!  Then I ordered the artichoke mac and cheese chicken, which is seriously in my top 3 for best things I have ordered in my life.  If you come here, order this as you will not be disappointed.
