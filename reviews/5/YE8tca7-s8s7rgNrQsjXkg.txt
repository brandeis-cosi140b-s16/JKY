We've been here several times... every time it's delicious! 
We've tried chicken, pork and beef tamales. My favorite are the pork tamales (they seem a little spicier than the beef) and my hubby's favorite are the chicken tamales. Plus, it's decently priced - as of August 2013, I can get a dozen for about $16.

I will keep coming back.
