we've been here a few times and the food always hits the spot.  good mexican food.  i've had the crazy gringo burrito and the fish tacos and both were awesome.  my fiancee loved the bean & cheese burrito.  in addition the guy behind the counter is really nice and welcoming.  i know everyone has their particulars about good mexican but i recommend trying this place.
