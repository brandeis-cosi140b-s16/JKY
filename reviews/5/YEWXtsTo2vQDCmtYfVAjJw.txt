I call this place the little gem in my neighborhood.  My guy and I walk to Asi Es La Vida from our place and are always warmly welcomed and provided excellent service.

We haven't been when its been very busy -which makes me sad, as I'd like to see the place with a line out the door - but this kind of adds to the charm because you're almost guaranteed to have a nice relaxing lunch or dinner.  I really enjoy the atmosphere too!  The bright colors and busy walls are distinct and its very small and cozy.  

The food - I've had maybe 5 or 6 different things off of the menu and have never been disappointed.  I'm not a big mole fan but I still really enjoy it there.  Everything is bursting with different flavors.

Don't get me started on the watermelon water - I probably average 4 glasses each time.  I just can't stop myself!  It is so refreshing!
