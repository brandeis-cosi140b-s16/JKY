This Taco Bell location is the BEST in Las Vegas. The customer service is beyond awesome. Everyone is so happy and friendly and so helpful. They do things really fast and neat. I never open a taco from here with things falling out of its shell ever. They wrap it nicely. Food is really consistent and hardly any mistakes with long complicated orders, if anything they remake the entire order for you with a smile. I am extremely satisfy with their service
