Wow! Just discovered this place. SUCH great fresh food. Really loved the guacamole and the fresh vegetables, which were "just right." Manager also was super friendly and doing a great job. Insisted in giving me a free drink after some confusion with my card. My new favorite. And I like it way better than Chipotle. Food is just BETTER, somehow.
