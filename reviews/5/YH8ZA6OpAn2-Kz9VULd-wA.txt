Ate here today with the hubby and this place is awesome!  Great Mexican food not spicy but they have a great spicy green salsa!  Yum the burritos are awesome and covered in green chile so yummy!  The combination plates are huge and the rice and beans are delicious will be back to post pics!  (I ate my food too fast)
