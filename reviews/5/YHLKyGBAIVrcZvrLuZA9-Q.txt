This place definitely deserves the 5 stars. When I write a review, I take everything into honest consideration. Starting with the customer service, everyone is super friendly. I'm a very picky eater and don't trust many places but I knew right away this was a good place to eat when I saw how clean everything was, the salsa bar, the counters, soda machines, everything! That gave me a huge relief and built my trust immediately. They have a huge menu to chose from, the food is delicious and very affordable!! . I've liked everything I've tried so far and particularly LOVE their California surfing Burrito it is amazinggg! Unlike many other fast food places that may serve the food cold, the multiple times that I've visited Senor Taco my food has always been really warm and that's something I always look out for. This location has only been open for about a month and every time I go eat there, there are always lots of customers which that alone speaks for itself. I am a very satisfied, this place not only met but EXCEEDED my expectations and I definitely recommend anyone to eat here, you won't regret it. Two thumbs up!! :)
