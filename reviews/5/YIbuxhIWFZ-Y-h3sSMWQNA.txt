I think I'm addicted to eating here.  First off, I don't understand all the complaints on here about the place.  I know good Mexican food and this place has REAL good food.  Is it the best? No.  Is it REAL good? YA!  My favorites are the chorizo, egg, and cheese burritos, the shredded beef burritos, and the fish tacos.  It's really good and I recommend it.  No, I'm not related to anyone.  Work at UW...
