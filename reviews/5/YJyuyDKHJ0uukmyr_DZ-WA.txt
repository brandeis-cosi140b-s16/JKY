Great service, interesting menu, awesome happy hour. I love the beautiful patio and atmosphere.

The salsa is very fresh and good. Portions are large on both good and drinks.

I got the crispy chile rellanos recommended in another Yelp review. It was wrapped in a won ton shell.

Beans are good. Everything is fresh and opulent if slightly bland.
