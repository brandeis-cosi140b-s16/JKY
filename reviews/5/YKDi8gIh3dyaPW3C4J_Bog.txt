I would have to agree with Lauren F., that this place garners some seriously unnecessary hatred! I had a blast here, the service was friendly, and dammit, IT DOES SMELL SO GOOD IN THERE! Someone please let me in on the secret! 

Sure there were a few groups partying pretty hard for Sunday Funday, but hey, to each their own... didn't bother me one bit! Also, I can't imagine what else would be on the telly, in place of the "obnoxious" sports that someone previously complained of! What would you rather be watching kind sir? Or was it ma'am.... 

All in all, it's an incredibly attractive space, and Tempe should consider itself lucky to have such a well thought out concept. I can't wait to come back!
