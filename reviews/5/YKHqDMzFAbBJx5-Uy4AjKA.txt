What makes Qdoba better than Chipotle?

You can get queso on your burrito.

Seriously, Chipotle, why no queso? That seems pretty standard to me.

Qdoba is just a chain, and it's owned by McDonald's.  Despite both of these issues, their burritos are just awesome! Simply, effing, delicious.  And filling to boot.
