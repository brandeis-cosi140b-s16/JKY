My roommate and I discovered this treasure on accident, but are so happy that we did. This is my favorite burrito place in AZ. I have only ordered the chicken burrito, but would eat it every day if I could live healthy off of just that. I have no reason to even try any of their other items because I am in love. So is my roomie. Cafe Rumba simply outflavors any other southwest/mexican restaurant I have tried out here, and believe me, Burrito Tuesday every week adds up to a lot of places! The roomie and I both reccomend this place to EVERYONE, though we can only speak for the chicken burrito and chips and salsa. Nevertheless, we are in love with Cafe Rumba and wish there were many around the valley.
