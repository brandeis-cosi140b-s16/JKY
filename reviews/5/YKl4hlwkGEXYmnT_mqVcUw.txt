Great atmosphere,  staff is friendly we just stopped bye to get some Mexican food and the experience was awesome.  I recommend everyone to eat here.  Best  mexican food in phoenix,  ate there last night and wished we went back tonight unfortunately we went to another mexican restaurant closer to our hotel and was very disappointed with not only the food but the price and service.
