What the *bleep* is wrong (and by wrong I mean AWESOMELY RIGHT) with you, Pittsburgh?!

It is a well-known fact that Mexican restaurants all across the nation have a tendency to stuff you with food, enticing you to eat a veritable smorgasbord of cheesy, meaty, spicy goodness piled high on plates the size of hubcaps until you surrender to the inevitable food coma and wake up two days later STILL REALLY FULL.  I figured that Cocina Mendoza would be similar in this respect.  Except that I'd forgotten that THIS!  IS!  PITTSBURGH!

... which means that their "Meal for Two" specials are completely misleading, unless by "two" you mean "two veteran champions of the International Federation of Competitive Eating".  For the rest of us mere mortals, it's more like a meal for 4 ... or 6.  And how tasty the food is!  Crunchy, meaty, dreamy taquitos.  Lovely fajitas with tender chicken and succulent marinated steak.  Quesadillas that must have been half an inch thick at the very least, oozing with lovely queso.  And refried beans and Spanish rice so tightly packed into their to-go containers that you swear that the wonders of modern compression technology (here's looking at you, Lempel-Ziv-Markov) must have been involved somehow.  Glorious!

My wife -- who is herself an accomplished Mexican cook -- comments that the food is very "homemade" in nature, prepared with love by people who obviously care a lot about food.  She likes one of the salsas in particular so much that she wants to go with me to see if she can get the recipe from the cooks there.  That's high praise coming from someone who was taught by a Mexican housewife whose food was the envy of the entire neighborhood.

And now, as I sink further and further into my food coma, I repeat: what the *bleep* is wrong (and by wrong I mean AWESOMELY RIGHT) with you, Pittsburgh?!
