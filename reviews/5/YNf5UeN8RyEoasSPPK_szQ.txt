Excellent place, 5 star plus. Is neat, clean, friendly staff and Great food and I mean it. We went there for dinner last night and loved it.
It is a small place and location is different but don't be fooled by that.
No doubt best Tacos in vegas and their salsa is original recipe and so delicious.
You must try this place.
