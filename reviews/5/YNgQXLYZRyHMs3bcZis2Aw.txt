This place is pretty hidden up in the North Lake mall area, but it is great!  I did not have high hopes for it, but I have been there 3 times now, and each time has been awesome.

The Margaritas are huge! (order the Cabo Wabo margarita)  The juices are fresh and the tequila is strong.  Two of these will set you up nicely for the evening, and they aren't even that expensive.  

For food, the queso is delicious, but the real highlight is the steak quesadilla.  The steak is delicious and has soo much flavor.

I love coming here, even though it is 15+ mins outside of the city.  It's under the radar, but I will keep returning.
