I was visiting on business from Wisconsin and met up with my wifes uncle John from California and we went hunting for authentic Mexican food. 
At first I yelped a place in the ghetto that was closed up, prostitutes and drug dealers on every corner. 
As we were driving back toward safety, I saw this truck under bright lights with a tarp and make shift tables underneath with people sitting and eating. I didn't care if we got mugged, I was hungry and there were plenty of witnesses. Neither of us speak Spanish, but the old dude in the truck spoke just enough to take our order and money. I had a ham and avocado quesadilla and Uncle John had  a carne asada burrito. His stuff looked so good I decided to try that too. It was a little bit-o-awesome. 
And they have this avocado sauce that was so smooth creamy and good. You would be a total moron not to eat here if you are in the 'hood.
It sits near the corner of VanBuren and 16th St.
