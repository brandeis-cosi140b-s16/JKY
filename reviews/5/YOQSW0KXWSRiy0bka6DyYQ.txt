So much awesome for so little cost. Every time my parents come to town, we eat here nearly every day. Delicious meats, but chorizo burrito "with everything" is my favorite. Also love their fruit drinks - watermelon is unbelievable, strawberry equally lovely. And last but not least, must exclaim the awesomeness of the FREE tomatillo salsa on every table.
