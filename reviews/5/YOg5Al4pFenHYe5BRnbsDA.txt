We were unsure about coming here because of some of the reviews. I'm so glad we came though! The food is on point. We had the fajita burrito and chicken tamales. We also tried three different margaritas and they were the best ones we've ever had. Our server, Brian, was fantastic!!!!! So nice, very attentive, and he seems to love his job. Highly recommended.
