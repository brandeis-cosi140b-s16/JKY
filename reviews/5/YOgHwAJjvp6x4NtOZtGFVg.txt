One of my favorite little spots in Las Vegas at the hard rock hotel. I absolutely loved the Pink Tacos, very tasty and different. Also I was a huge fan of the Wet Burrito. Place has a great cheap Happy Hour as well which is a awesome thing to have in Vegas a Pink Taco a Beer and a shot of Tequila. When I go back to Vegas I will def be stopping in here.
