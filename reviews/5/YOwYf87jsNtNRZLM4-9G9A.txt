I was skeptical but this place exceeded my expectations. They charge for chips and salsa (something about that bugs me) and that is my only complaint. 

Found a parking spot right out front, right away. We had a large party so we called ahead. Our table was ready when we got there. The staff was really friendly and attentive. I felt like they took really good care of us without hovering the party. Drinks came out fast (Good beer selection actually). $3 Two Hearted Drafts! The margaritas were outstanding, in my opinion. They have a salsa bar which is a huge plus. Chips were fresh, so was the guac. My tacos (El Pastor, Carne with a Verde Sauce, and Chipotle Beef) were not very authentic but I was expecting that since its Tex - Mex (this isn't a complaint). Anything they lacked in authenticity was a twist to make the food more interesting. Prices were not bad at all. Try the pickled vegetables; they are shockingly good. (I can't believe I wrote that). 

Overall a good spot to try for something different.
