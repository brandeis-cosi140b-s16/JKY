Exceptionally clean, well maintained, and beautifully decorated. MTV-'80s music playing overhead (good thing I like it). Employees who waited on me were helpful and super friendly. Food is inexpensive and surprisingly good for being fast food. I frequent another Filiberto's in Sedona, and this one puts that one to shame for its ambience and service. Just wish I could find some napkins around here!
