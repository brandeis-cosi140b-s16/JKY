They put crack in the chips, I think (not really).  I've heard rave reviews from friends and colleagues.  As usual, I live close by, but I just hadn't found the magic moment when the stars aligned to try it out.  Suddenly the time came, and boyfriend and I parked right in front of the place and marched into the crowded restaurant.  We told the cashier that it was our first time.  She answered all of our questions.  I opted for the fish tacos - best price I've seen outside of Mexico!  And damn they're good!  No breading but they are delicious!  The "strips" are the best!  I've tried replicating that snack at home, but it's just not the same without their hot sauce.  Yummy!  And what a wonderful, cozy location!  We'll be back again and again.  (We've already been back twice.)
