This is the best Mexican food in Vegas! The menu is simple and the food always tastes fresh. Their meat is cooked fresh and tastes amazing! This place is usually crowded around lunch time and dinner time, and for good reason. It is a bit expensive and they charge extra for guacamole, but their pork bowl is definately worth the price!
