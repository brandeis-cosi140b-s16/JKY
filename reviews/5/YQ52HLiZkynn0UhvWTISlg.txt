Looking for a fun, creative atmosphere with amazing food? Anyone that visits Charlotte, NC or recently moved here needs to visit Phat Burrito. Hands down the coolest, yummiest place that sells literally "PHAT" burritos, quesadillas, salad bowls, and tacos. I consider this whole in the wall restaurant a land mark in Charlotte, NC. 
I enjoy eating any of the BBQ Steak entrees and plus they have a salsa bar where you can choose salsa flavor from mild to hotness. The burritos are big enough to share, but why not get your own because leftovers are a must. Not sure if their company makes their own bread, but its the freshest burrito I have ever eaten. Have a sweet tooth? The deserts are worth a purchase from cupcakes to brownies this place does no wrong. The atmosphere is relaxed with textured walls and art. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and laid back. I at least come here once a week for my BBQ steak fix and the prices are decent, but worth the money! Best Tex Mex in Charlotte!
