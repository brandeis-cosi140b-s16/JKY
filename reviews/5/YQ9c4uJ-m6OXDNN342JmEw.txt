Had a lull in meetings and was in the area so I went out to the Village at Lake Las Vegas for lunch. I went to Sonrisa Grill. I ordered the two tacos with shredded beef. They came with rice and beans and of course the customary chips and salsa delivered to the table while you wait. The food was good, reasonably priced. My bill for lunch including my soft drink and fried ice cream was $25.57. One thing to note though. Unlike other places, only your first basket of chips and salsa are complimentary,  they charge for each additional basket of chips and salsa they bring out after the first. Another thing I noticed, for a Mexican restaurant,  they had a lot of American dishes on their menu and only the Mexican basics like tacos, enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, chili releno,  etc on the menu. Still, great looking place and really great, friendly service.
