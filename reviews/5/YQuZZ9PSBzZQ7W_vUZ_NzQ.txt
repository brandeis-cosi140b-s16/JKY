1st time here.  My husband and I stopped for lunch today and this place is really kept up. I ordered the carne asada torta and man was it very filing, I had a hard time finishing it.  My husband ordered the same with 2 carne asada tacos on the side.  They have a salsa bar with fresh pico, cilantro, limes, salsa, and onions you can top your plate with.

The carne asada was so delicious!  I work near the capitol and already can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.

Prices are really reasonable and the customer service is awesome.  They walked up to our table and offered us refills, boxes to go, and even take our empty plates. If you are in the area this is a must stop.
