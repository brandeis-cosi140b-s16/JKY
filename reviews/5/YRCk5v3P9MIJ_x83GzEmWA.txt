This Qdoba is just like all the others, as far as food goes.  The meat is great and they have a better selection of salsas than Chipotle.  The queso is amazing, every time.  Go here hungry and in the mood to consume a large burrito.

The only nice perk of this particular location is that it has a big open window that looks onto Fish Hatchery Rd.  Not exactly a great view, but it does make the place look really big.  During the summer it is fun to see the mix of pedestrians that use the road, as this location is right on the edge of the yuppie and ghetto parts of Fitchburg.
