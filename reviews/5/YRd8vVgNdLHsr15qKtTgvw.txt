"Andale" is what you yell at you tummy to speed up digestion, because you're going to want seconds, thirds and fourths. 

This brings me back to San Diego, which in my opinion is where the best Mexican food comes from outside of Mexico. Andale is a no frills kind of place, no decorations on the walls or crazy loud music; the main focus is the food. 

I finally made way in here for lunch, because the call of the taco is strong. I sat down was given free chips and salsa, which surprised me; normally smaller places like this don't off this satisfying starter. I ordered two carnitas (pork) and two carne asada street tacos, fully loaded. Which means, cilantro, onions, two types salsa, all on two corn tortillas. These were amazing, loaded with tender meat, tons flavor, and just enough spice. This is how street tacos are supposed to be, made with two tortillas for durable food holding and no cheese. If you go to a taco shop and they put cheese on street tacos, you may want to reconsider your dining option. 

I also ordered a green chili pork tamale, which was cooked perfect. This was a homemade masterpiece, freshly unwrapped and served up. The maze wasn't too dry and the meat inside melted in my mouth. Simply a beautiful plate of food.  

As I wrapped up my meal, I noticed that they have a "happy hour". It changes everyday, but for twelve bucks you get an all you can eat food option. The day I was here it was chicken mole tacos, which includes rice and beans. If I wasn't about to burst I may have ordered some to go.  

True taco lovers... you feast awaits you!
