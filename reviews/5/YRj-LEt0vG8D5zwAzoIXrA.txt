By far one of the best restaurants I have eaten at! I got tacos (#1 Alambre) and my bf got the seafood chile relleno, our faces said it all when we took our first bite.. It was delicious! We got a michelada and  it was ok... Not the greatest but it wasn't bad either. We are definitely coming back to T&T!

P.S our waiter was really nice and very attentive.
