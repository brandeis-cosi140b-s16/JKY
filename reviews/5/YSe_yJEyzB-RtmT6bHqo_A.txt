This is the real deal Mexican Food. Someone compared it to TexMex? I havent had anything this authenticate since I was in Mexico. Dont go to a Mexican restaurant and expect them to serve Americanized mexican food.  Go to Chipolte for that. The atmosphere was wonderful. FULL of mexican decorations and not just the common maracas. Place was quiet, and the view fantastic. Tables were NOT back to back. Plenty of room to walk around if you wanted. Also, as you come in the front door, you can see the kitchen and watch them cook through the glass. They have a large bar which I plan on going back to try very soon. Service was great until after we got our check. Took server 10 minutes to come grab our card so we could pay. But other then that, he was there checking in on us every 5-10 minutes. Highly Recommend!
