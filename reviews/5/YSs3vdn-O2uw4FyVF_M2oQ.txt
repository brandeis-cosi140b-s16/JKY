Very nice people! Very patient. No attitudes here. Usually the flavor of an enchilada stems from the meat, the sauce and cheese, but the tortilla flavor stands out at Gadzooks which is delicious and memorable (50/50).  I also appreciate the honest service. I heard a server say to a patron in front of me that the red sauce by itself doesn't taste as good so it's better on the enchilada. Again, nice people. Worth the trip. Worth the wait. I'll be back!
