Finally stopped in after seeing it all the time. I'm so glad I did, definitely my new favorite taco spot. We ordered the tacombo with 2 carne asada tacos and 2 pastor. The tacos were perfection in my eyes. The perfect street taco. We each topped them with cabbage and salsa from the salsa bar. The salsa was amazing. We also ordered the ruby roll. It had shrimp and avocado wrapped in FRIED rice. Best idea ever. They brought us a spicy mayonnaise and a soy sauce.. The mayo was to die for. Prices were right, service was great. I'll be back next week!
