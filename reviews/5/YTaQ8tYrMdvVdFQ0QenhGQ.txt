Raised in MX border for the majority of my childhood, I grew up eating tacos and all kinds of mexican food whether it be home cooked or just food stands. I can count in one hand the restaurants that serve tacos that hit closest to home and this is one of them. My favorite item is the Vampiro, I order two mimimum when I go but everything else is just as delicious. I live in Phoenix/Tempe so this place is quite the drive for me but very well worth it.
