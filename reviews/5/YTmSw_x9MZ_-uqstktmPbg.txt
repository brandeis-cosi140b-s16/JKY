Good sushi - tastes fresh and portions are very good sized. The sushi burrito concept was new to us and the reason we went in. It was actually pretty cool. We felt like we had something new wrapped around an old favorite. It's more of a fast food or diner vibe than an upscale sushi place but the food is a good value and tastes good. Sometimes quick and casual it the right fit. I have a feeling we will be back here regularly.
