This review, and the five stars that come with it, is for one thing and one thing only: A cocktail called "Picoso".

Coda and I had a light dinner and drinks here on New Years Eve 2010, and I have l been craving this delicious beverage ever since.  Every single sip was a delight. When you drink as much as I do, it's easy to get bored with the usual "interesting" cocktails. I mean, how many places are going to carry Pomegranate Margaritas before people STOP getting excited when they see it on a menu?  When I say people, I mean me. I would literally take an IV of Pomegranate Margarita, I love them so much, but they've become so standard, I needed something new.

This drink they call "Picoso" was interesting enough to be actually memorable. The fact that I'm even using the word "memorable" in relation to New Years Eve is unheard of, considering I haven't remembered a New Years Eve since 1999. The hint of jalepeno was the perfect compliment to the muddled fruit and tequila.  This drink was enough to cut through my alcohol induced amnesia and take it's rightful place in my memories of fantastic drinks past.  I'm not even mad at the fact that it probably played no small part in me losing track of time and being in the restroom when the clock struck midnight. Oh well, I probably wouldn't have remembered that anyway.
