loved the tacos, the salsas and the owner Francisco aka Pablo was super friendly and nice. He talked to me a bit, told me about how his family runs the place together. The charros beans are excellent, add some cilantro and onion along with the chips and yu got yourself something there. Back in the late 70's and early 80's my family used to go to Juarez for the best tacos, these reminded me of those. Now that Juarez is a danger-zone, Kissi will be the spot.
