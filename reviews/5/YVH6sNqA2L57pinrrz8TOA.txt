I had the sausage breakfast burrito, with all the fixings. This is hands down the best breakfast burrito I have EVER had, and don't start me on the tortilla, that was equally just as amazing! And to top it off the homemade hot sauce was divine. I have never had a breakfast burrito that has tasted so fresh, and didn't leave me feeling like I just ate a bunch of grease!
