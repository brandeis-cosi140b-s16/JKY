La Takiza has the best tacos in all of Las Vegas!  I have lived in Las Vegas for 4 years, and have searched all over for the best tacos.  I was so happy when my roommate and I stumbled into this place when we were looking for a place that was in the same plaza, but was closed.  This ended up being a great find!  La Takiza isn't the cheapest, but it's certainly the best.  I usually order the daily special, which is two tacos of their choice with beans and rice for around 6 bucks.  My favorite of their tacos is their Al Pastor, but their Chorizo are also very good.  The Al Pastor is perfectly seasoned, and is served with a little bit of pineapple salsa which really accents the spiciness of the pork.  The tortillas are always warm and soft, yet hard enough to hold your taco.  I have tried almost everything at La Takiza and have been very pleased with everything, but I would suggest getting the Super Taco with al pastor!  
If you love tacos and live in Vegas, do not be alarmed by La Takiza's random location, go there!
