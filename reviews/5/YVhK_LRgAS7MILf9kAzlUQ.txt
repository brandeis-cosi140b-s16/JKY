I've eaten here a few times over the past month, and I have to say each new item I try is my new favorite.  This place does what Mexican restaurants I grew up eating at growing up did - unpretentious, high quality honest food.  Finding the place isn't the easiest as they are literally tucked in between a sandwich shop and animal hospital, totally invisible from Scottsdale road because of the Denny's out front, but once you've found it, you don't want to go to any other "taco shop."

I've tried a few different taco's, next on my list is their fried fish, can't wait.  Their carnita's they crisp up a portion when your order it, so it's a bit crispy.  Today I had something I know I'll order again; shrimp fajita burrito, enchilada style with green sauce.  To Die 4!  I've spread the word at my work as well about their very reasonable catering as we've become tired of the sandwich and pizza staples in the area.  

Check this place out, support your true local mom & pops over the other chain "taco shop" in the area, you will not be disappointed.
