Fabulous authentic flavor tucked away in a corner near Uptown Alley. If you are like me, you are most likely tired of looking for the best place to have a good Mexican meal. The flavors, the atmosphere and the owner make this a fun place to go with friends, family, business groups or just you. The wait staff is always friendly, the service can be a little slow especially on nights of new movie premiere's. We love to go for a late lunch or dinner after the dinner rush, which is usually about 7pm. The bar is always full of people, the buffet is always available. It's just a good place to go if you want fabulous food. They do not use lard in their beans, which makes it more fun to eat them and not worry about the waistline. Can't wait to go back! Their Burrito Supremo with chicken is amazing.
