I'm sorry to disagree with you all but I feel the "new" restaurant is better, more consistent, and friendlier since the changes. The churros are AMAZING!!! Fresh, soft, delicious! The serving sizes are certainly more consistent, previously I either got no meat, or way too much in my tacos. I pretty much always enjoyed my meal there but now I can't wait to go back!
