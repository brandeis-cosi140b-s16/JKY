Wonderful. Authentic. When we want real Mexican food we head straight here. The tamales are so delicious. The sauce is so mild but rich-it's the perfect compliment. The atmosphere is great. Service spot on. Can't ask for a better dining experience. It's a great, casual, meet up with your friends and enjoy a few margaritas kind of place. Great lunch specials too. I just don't think you'll be disappointed. Live music on certain days too! Open late.  ¡Olé!
