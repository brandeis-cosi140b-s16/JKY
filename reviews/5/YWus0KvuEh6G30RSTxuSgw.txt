The food here is yummy for the money :) I tried the Birria de Chivo (lamb in a tomato type of gravy), came with Rice and Beans as well as a stack of small, thick flour tortillas...all for $6.75. The lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth....totally delicious and definitely ethnic Mexican cuisine at it's best!
