It was so good yesterday I had to return. Best Torta I have ever had. Love the pulled sweet pork. What do you get for $8 a great Torta with fries, a clean environment, and a spotless restroom. The staff are very friendly. You also get 5 homemade salsas to choose from. Also, you food is served on a real plate, not a box or a plate towel.
