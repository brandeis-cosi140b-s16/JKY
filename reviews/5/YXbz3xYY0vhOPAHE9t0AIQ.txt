Found this place via Yelp as I was looking for some good authentic mexican food in Scottsdale area.  Was pleasantly surprise with this place - tucked away in a small strip mall, the place is clean and the owner is very friendly. Lots of options on the menu - I opted for the steak fajitas with flour tortillas.  The steak was very tender with just the right amount of seasoning.  Perfect sized portions and the guacomole had a nice spice to it.  I will certainly be returning and recommend that you check this place out!
