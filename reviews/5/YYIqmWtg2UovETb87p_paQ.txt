I love Tamales, so when I saw a local Tamale shop i had to give it a shot.  When you drive up in the strip center you see nothing but ALL CAPS - TAMALES.  I assume that you can't have that be the biggest thing on the wall and it can't not be good right?  I'm no Tamale expert by any means, but I decide to go in and grabbed 3 chicken tamales, one for me and 1 for each of my dudes in the office.  As I drove back to the office in anticipation I was just getting anxious.  I quickly devoured mine and I was not disappointed!  No sauce was necessary, but it was moist and the chicken had good flavor.  I quickly asked one of my co-workers if they would let me commandeer theirs b/c I just needed to have another one and gladly enough he was willing to part ways with it.  Before he let me have at my 2nd Tamale, both my teammates gave their stamp of approvals on the Tamales!   I'd go back if/when I'm in the Mesa area!
