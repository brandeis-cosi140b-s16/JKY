This place has great food and service!! I'm from Los Angeles and this is the spot where me and my family always go to when were in Las Vegas. They have the best Mexican seafood in town. The plates are delicious and well priced. The micheladas are the best that I've tried so far! So if you're in Las Vegas go to this restaurant you won't regret it.
