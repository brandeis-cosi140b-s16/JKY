Richardson's burnt to the ground, but Dick's still erect!
Well thank god for that, because Dick's has the best brunch menu in town.  The adovada and tenderloin benedict is so amazing it'll make a straight man say that he loves Dick's.
The fresh squeezed OJ and ambiance makes this my favorite brunch spot ever.  Just walking through the doors on a Sunday afternoon is almost enough to cure my hangover..
I love Dick's.
