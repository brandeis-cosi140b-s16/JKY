not the typical mexi food... this place is more like gourmet style mexi food. and delicious. 

way out in east mesa (the boon docks as far as i'm concerned), this huge rest. gets packed every weekend. this is seriously some award-winning food. like the pan seared chicken in ancho chile peach glaze, or the chicken mole. i believe all their ingredients are organic, but i can't seem to find anything to attest to that online, so don't hold me to it. if you want yummy, upscale mexi food, this is the joint.
