Came here for a quiet weeknight dinner with my girlfriend. The place is family owned with fantastic service and wonderful, authentic tacos. You can tell they care about their food and how it tastes and looks! I had 4 different tacos containing chorizo, beef tongue (delicious!), barbacoa, and pork. My girlfriend has fish tacos which she expressed a love for as well. At ~$2.00 per taco or less it would be hard not to make this a regularly visited place to get great food.
