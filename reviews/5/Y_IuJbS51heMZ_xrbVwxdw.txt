Wedge is a restaurant that serves Mexican food, but served and plated creatively.  

As an appetizer, we ordered a tamale. To our surprise, the tamale came with pickled cactus (which we thought was green beans).  I was happy to see the pickled cactus because this side dish is more in line with authentic mexican food

I ordered a steak torta and it was packed with flavor and the steak was nice and tender.  

The dishes are reasonably priced. I thought the food and service here were really great. Plenty of street parking and free in the evenings.
