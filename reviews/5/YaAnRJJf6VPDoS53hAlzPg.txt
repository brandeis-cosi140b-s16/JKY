This place is adorable and delicious. I'm pregnant and pretty much nothing tastes good, and yet this was amazing. That made a huge impact on me. I got the super burrito with chicken, and from the first bite, I was happy with the world. Ingredients are fresh and the food is amazing. The restaurant is also clean and the staff is nice.
