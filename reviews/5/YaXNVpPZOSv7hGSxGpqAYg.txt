I know it looks like a hole in the wall, but the food is out of this WORLD. I was introduced to this place by some co-workers who are very familiar with what good REAL Mexican food is. This is it, we have been going back religiously since... The mocajete (i think), is this bowl of seafood tomato sauce, spices and cheese that is made and served in a lava rock bowl, it is still boiling when it makes it to the table. Not only is it HOT but it is also SPIIIIIIIIICY! Delicious....
