This place is consistently great. I've brought many people here, and I've always loved it. I'm not even a big fan of Mexican food, but man I love the Ranchera steak torta. Just thinking about it is giving me cravings. 
You won't find tortas like this anywhere else. Since eating here, I've started looking for tortas at other places and I'm always disappointed that they're either not there or they're terrible in comparison.
