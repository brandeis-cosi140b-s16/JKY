Ah, the go-to place for day drinking and ditching classes with my classmates in medical school. Future doctors of America, right here, baby! The menu offers standard Americanized Mexican food fare, but there's just enough variety to have something for everyone. On the days I thought it inappropriate to return to class smelling of beer, I would turn to the horchata -- fresh and delicious, every time. Like fricking clockwork. The food is fresh and, magically, not heavy. The salsa bar lets you dump on as much diarrheaogenic hot sauce as your asshole can tolerate, and the chips must be made fresh because nothing that good comes out of a bag.

Regretfully, I am virtually never in the northwest valley anymore, and have enjoyed the Caramba experience maybe once since graduation. This is tragic. Why can't Caramba force Mi Patio out and set up shop there?
