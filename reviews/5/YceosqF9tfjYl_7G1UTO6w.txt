Sunday Funday brought me here and damnnnnn I thought Rickys Tacos had the best chicken tacos ever, this place just became my #1 spot for chicken tacos!!! Everything tastes like street tacos in Cabo, expect you in Scottsdale!!! They are like crack I crave them all day and night....Im about to get my taco full now as we speak....
