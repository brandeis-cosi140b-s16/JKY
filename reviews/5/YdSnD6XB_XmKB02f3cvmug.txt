I hangout in Chandler a lot and me and my friends love to go to local places like Moreno's Mexican Grill. It's a small place and when you walk in it looks really clean and welcoming. The employees there are happy and inviting. We go about two to three times a week on average to get hot dogs. I cannot get enough of Moreno's hot dogs they are so delicious and have all of my favorites on them. A Sonoran hot dog from Moreno's has saut√©ed onions, beans, tomatoes, mustard, Mexican crema, and the hot dog wrapped in bacon. 
 You order your food inside but your hot dog is made outside right in front of the restaurant. Only the hot dogs are made outside though the rest of the food is made inside. Anyways, the hot dog is made right in front of you the man asks "con todo?" meaning with everything? I usually get it with everything. While he is preparing the hot dog you can smell the all of what he is putting together, it smells so good and when you see the finish product your mouth waters. As I take my hot dog back inside to eat, I cannot wait to dig in!  I get so guacamole, chile, napkins, and a fork to eat everything that has fallen off. I begin to eat and a flood of different flavors overwhelms my taste buds, all coming together to form a perfect blend of deliciousness.
 As I finish my hot dog I start to feel full and satisfied with what I have eaten. I love going to Moreno's for the hot dogs. And it is open late, therefore on the weekends when you are out and about and need to get something to munch on. That is tasty and affordable you can hit up Moreno's and get yourself a Sonoran hot dog!
