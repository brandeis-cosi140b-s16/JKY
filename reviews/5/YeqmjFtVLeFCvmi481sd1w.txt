I don't know why I've waited so long to write this review - guess I was just too busy stuffing my face with the amazing food at Desnudo Tacos.   I've tried all the different types of tacos on the menu  - carnitas, mushroom, carne  and can't decide which I like best. I keep saying I'll order one of their other menu items, but when the waitress walks over I always go with the tacos.  The chips and guacamole are great - although sometimes the guacamole is a little spicy for me (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy).  Because I"m a wimp I love that the taco sauces are mostly "on the side" so I can have my food the way I like it and my spice loving friends can have it with a kick they love. 
I'm so glad I live close - because  I may just have to have tacos for dinner - or maybe I"ll get something else on the menu.
