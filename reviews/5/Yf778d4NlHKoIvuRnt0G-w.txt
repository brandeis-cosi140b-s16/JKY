What you've heard/read is all true, this place is terrific. $1 street tacos were all amazing -- loved the Al Pastor, Carne Asada was wonderful, Chorizo was excellent, and the Fish my wife ordered was as good as any I've had. The Mole plate was to die for; a little spicier than usual, but rich and complex.  Delicious churros stuffed with flan and drizzled (honey? caramel? don't know & don't care)  As promised, the owner/operator is just a sweet, funny bear of a man.  Order at the counter and he'll bring you your tray.  Taste is right up there with Fuego Tacos and La Condesa, but a lot less expensive (four of us ate wonderfully for $25).  Eat there before word gets out.
