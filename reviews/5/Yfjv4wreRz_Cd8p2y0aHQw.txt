This is my husbands and I go to place for great Mexican. Excellent happy hour, tasty margs and large portions! I love the pork chili with a fried egg on top, also the Mexican pizza with pork is HUGE! Love the patio in by the fire place in the winter and the bar area is a great place to kick back and meet up with friends. Tacos come a-la-cart or with rice and beans and there are about 30 different kinds to choose from! If your into tequila they have just about every kind. Staff is friendly and fast. All I know is when I suggest this place for dinner, everyone always is excited to go!
