Nice Upscale Mexican Food. The food is very clean tasting with complex ingredients not heavy and greasy like your average run of the mill Mexican joint. My husband said it was the best Mexican food he ever had. We went around 3 pm and it was a dead, we were the only ones there. The waiter said it is super busy at lunch and at dinner time, next time I would go during those times, skip the middle of the day. 

Otherwise a great dining experience!
