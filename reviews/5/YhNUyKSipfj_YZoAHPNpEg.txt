Move over Rubio's cuz this shit was good! 

I was in the area and had only been here once after they opened years ago. 

I had a fish taco, and carnitas taco, rice and pinto beans, chips and salsa. 6 bucks 

The fish was a deep fried white fish with a nice light peppery batter, cabbage, cilantro and Baja sauce. Excellent. The fish had flavor, the batter was light and crisp, the sauce was good. 

The carnitas was pork, cilantro, and pico. REALLY good flavor. I had mine with the HOT sauce which was not too hot. 

The rice was, well rice and the beans were really good too. The chips were fresh and the salsa choices were interesting. I had mango salsa which I used as my dessert. LOL 

The service was excellent, very on top of it. The place was kept clean and the salsa bar stocked. I will be back. maybe next week.
