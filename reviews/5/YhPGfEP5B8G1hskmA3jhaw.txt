Pinches Restaurant is what comes to mind when someone mentions container park. Besides the crazy slides they have that's waiting for a lawsuit cause all the kids that comes out says "ow I hit my head but it was fun" 
Anyways its a bit pricey but AL PASTOR with the hottest sauce they have, CORN ON THE COB and horchata to wash it down. Bomb! ~Fin~
