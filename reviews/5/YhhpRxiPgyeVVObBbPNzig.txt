Seriously. Seriously. This place. I just can't. Their food if stoopid fantastic. I actively have to talk myself out of going sometimes cause I would be there everyday (I do go once a week though). By far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I've tried about 1/2 of the menu so far (only half because I have some favorites that I HAVE to have when I'm there) and everything has been amazing. I will warn you though...if you are considering the Carne Asada Fries...prepare to share or take some home...it's massive. If you are visiting Vegas - it's so worth the Uber or the cab cost to taste this place!
