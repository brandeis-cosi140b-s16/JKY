I love this place it's awesome ! Yes sometimes some of the tables might be dirty is because weekends are supper busy . But the food is great no place like it real Mexican food ... 
The chilaquiles are the bomb and the tacos with barbacoa even better for lunch . The Asada is great also ... To me there is no place better in phoenix !!!!
