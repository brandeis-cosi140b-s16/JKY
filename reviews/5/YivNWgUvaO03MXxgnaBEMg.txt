I love this taco truck!!! The tortas are the reason we go! Food is great, prices are great, the guys that run it super duper nice, they are open late, & when you're drinking this absolutely hits the spot!!! Check it out you wont be disappointed!!!!
Dont forget to try the green sauce! Its freaking amazing!
