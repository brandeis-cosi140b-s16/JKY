I love this place! Your food is crafted right in front of you,  and you have the choice of different types of meat.  You can also order your burrito enchilada style, and it's absolutely amazing!  The only draw back was the price,  expect to pay about $11 for a burrito and a drink.  However the burritos are huge and could easily be eaten in two meals,  or shared.
