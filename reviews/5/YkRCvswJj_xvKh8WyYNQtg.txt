My favorite Taco Restaurant.

I LOVE the panuchos! (the pink tacos). The tortillas are made fresh-constantly. The food is very good. The salsas available now are (in my oppinion) not as good as they used to be five years ago, but the flavors are distinct and delicious including the verde and chipotle of the three given.

Once we went in and they had available sword fish for the fish tacos. Increadable!

I must go every time Im in Vegas.
