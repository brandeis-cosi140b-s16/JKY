Great place, great Flavours - 7 chili, cilantro and strawberry salsa are must try.  In my first visit, I tried chicken tinga and a burro, the meat was well cooked and juicy. 

Place was small, but nice ambience. 

The neighborhood was litle shady but  the quality of food defeats all those negative factors. 

Definitely recommended.

Ps - the place is open late till 11pm, even though yelp hours shows 9pm.
