Delicious, authentic no-frills Mexican food in a commercial strip, right next to the east side Woodman's.  We went in on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty, but the welcome from the family staffing the bakery/restaurant was warm and friendly.  There are menus and there's table service.  We had carnitas (a weekend special) and the blackened fish and shrimp tacos (they'll give you one of each if you ask).  Both were great  and the two salsas offered alongside were fresh, complex and tasty.  And you can't beat the price!  My favorite Mexican in Madison; we'll definitely be back.
