Everything I would hope it would be!!  The person that helped us brought us several samples so we could pick exactly what we would enjoy which was wonderful since this was a one shot situation (we were on vacation).  Very unique and fun food experience.  The cookies tasted like sopapillas which was a fun suprise.  SOOOO GOOOD!!!! I heart this place and wish it was in Denver (or where ever I live).  YUMM!!!!!!!
