Can't come to Arizona without hitting up a Macayo's.  Growing up, we usually ate at the Central location.  Back in the 80's I was enrolled in their Birthday program.  So special, they'd send me a Birthday Card, guaranteeing me a free meal and special toy.  So personal!  

We frequent this location now because my parents are Sun City Snowbirds.  Food is fantastic, consistent through the years!  Go to meal: start with chips and HOT salsa (if they don't initially bring it, just ask,) a cheese crisp; then for the beef chimi (soo delicious, crispy outside, juicy inside, and lovely red sauce topping--can't go wrong!!)  Husband's fav right now is the  chicken poblano, side of sour cream.  And they always have fresh iced tea.  This place can get packed nights and weekends.  We love middle of the afternoon visits, in between lunch and dinner rush.  It's quiet, service is very relaxed, and we can hear each other.  This last visit "Ate 0710" waited on us.  Very pleasant and attentive.  Our meals are always so big, there's plenty for a second meal. "Ate" was considerate enough to box and bag our to-go's.  We bought some extra chips and salsa for our trip back to The Bay Area.  Another successful meal and service!!  See you guys in a few months!!
