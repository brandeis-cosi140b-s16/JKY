When first visiting Gallo Blanco in 2009, I would have definitely given it 3 stars. Service was very spotty and the HH was a lot more limited. Now, after visiting this place countless times for brunch, dinner and HH, I really do think it's an affordable, reliable and delicious destination that makes sense for a lot of different types of social situations - from a meal shared with my grandmother to a spontaneous HH with friends. As many reviewers have mentioned, happy hour is fantastic here, with tacos from $1 - $2.50 and great drink prices. Here are some of my favorite food and drink items (keep in mind that I'm a pescetarian, so meat didn't make it on the list!): 

*Agua fresca of the day w/ or w/o vodka
*Picoso (tequila, pineapple and jalapeno) 
*Micheladas (make 'em bloody for a great hangover cure)
*Bloody Marys (they make them with dill for an unexpected but fresh twist)
*Elote (Mexican corn) with cotija cheese and cream 
*Shrimp tacos (amazing, juicy shrimp) 
*Chilaquiles (the sauce used to have chicken but they now offer a vegetarian version)
*Chopped salad

One other awesome bonus is that the bar will wrap up food to go if you'd like to take up to the roof. Get your drink in a plastic cup and you're all set!
