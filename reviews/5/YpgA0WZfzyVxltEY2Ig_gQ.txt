Wow!!!!

My boyfriend suggested this place and when I asked him the type of food he mentioned something about burgers....after taking a look at their reviews on Yelp figured it would not hurt to check it out.

The service was great; our waitress was extremely friendly and prompt with getting us refills on our chips & salsa - which we needed a lot of because they were amazingly good. The salsa had the perfect amount of seasoning to make it spicy enough to have you going for more without burning your mouth off. The chips were warm out of the oven and I could have ate a basket full!

They offer Sangria (white or red) by the pitcher - sure enough we ordered a red one. It was really good and I was pretty lit after my first drink.

I had the Chimichilada - you get a choice of beef or chicken chimi, I had the beef and you also get a portabella mushroom enchilada. This dish was delicious and will go back for more. You get a lot of food on this plate so you will more than likely have enough for lunch the next day and it was just as divine a day later.

My boyfriend ordered the Blue Adobe Hamburger which was voted onto Phoenix's top 10 - hence why I thought it was a burger joint.

We had a wonderful experience, amazing good and will be frequenting Blue Adobe more often.
