The food here is Da Bomb!!!!
We tried all the tacos, they were all great!  My fav was the Al Pastor, the meat was a little crunchy and very flavorful. A must!!!!
The chorizo taco was also slammin!  
They have great micheladas, and an extensive tequila menu. 
Oh, I almost forgot the Mexican corn on the cob, order this!!!!!!  The corn on the cob was so freakin good, great amounts of cheese and spice.  
The best part was our friendly bartender, he was so cool and friendly. I was at the bar alone with him for a bit and he was attentive and knowledgeable about tequila and cocktails. I love great service and friendly servers. They make the meal sometimes. And he made my time at this place memorable. 
This place is gonna be my "go to" spot for tacos!
