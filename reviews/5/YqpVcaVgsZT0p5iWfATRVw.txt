We visit the north Scottsdale location.  Every time we go, one of us orders the carnitas.  So good and a large portion.  The duck enchiladas with mole sauce are wonderful.  We have also had the fabulous lamb shank.  We have probably tried more items on this menu than most restaurants we frequent and honestly, everything is wonderful.  The depth of flavor in the dishes is amazing.  This is not smothered in cheese bland Mexican food.  This is authentic. The service is always great too.
