Three words you need to know... PORK BELLY TACO! 

The best taco I ever ate. I stop in for lunch to treat myself when I'm on that side of town. Lucky for me, today's special was the Pork Belly Taco. Order one along with the Buldogi meat taco., which was good, but could have eaten a dozen of the pork belly. 
Sweet tender meat with slaw wrapped in a corn tortilla! 
This was a special, hopefully it will stay a special, or make it on the menu!

Again I ordered the won-tons, which you can't go wrong.. the meatiest wontons you will ever have.. As usual chips with salsa and guacamole served when you sit down.. all fresh and delicious..
