This place has some seriously amazing Mexican food. Folks... Mexican in my book does not usually equal "five stars," so listen up.

Casa del Sol has your classics (enchilada, fajita, tamale) plus some more "gourmet" style dishes that mix it up with unusual ingredients. Everything we tried was fabulously fresh and flavorful... the trifecta of "F" adjectives.

We tried the "burrito tropical" with pork (mango, pineapple, and Caribbean spices integrated with more typical burrito ingredients) and the "Playa del Carmen" fish enchiladas and highly recommend both. Everything was served at just the right temperature, salt level, etc. The meat (and all the other ingredients for that matter) seemed to be good quality, which is rarer than it should be. Even the rice and beans on the side were tasty.

Our server was really, really, incredibly enthusiastic. It was odd to me that someone was so excited to be at work on a Monday night, but what the heck, I'll take it.
