Delicious food and great service. I had no issues at all. I had never gone to a Chipotle before so I wanted d to try it out. I asked the worker what they had and he gave me the run down. He wasn't rude at all, he was very helpful in fact. I ended up getting a steak burrito with some black beans, lettuce, and sour cream. Delicious as heck. I'll be going back whenever I have the time.
