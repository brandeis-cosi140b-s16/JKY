FINALLY, Mexican food to rave about!

Those that read my reviews know I don't get too excited about Mexican food.  I feel most places do it the same, just "ok".  I never eat Mexican food and think, "omg this is good".... that, is, until now.  LuLu's totally does it for me.

It's a little, unsuspecting taco shop that has daily specials, Mexican drinks/deserts/specialties.  Their prices are not cheap, but not expensive either.  Tacos are $1.50, Red Chili plates are $8.99.

They make everything from scratch, and you can tell by the quality.  Their salsa bar is incredible and they do breakfast.

For those of you who do not eat wheat / gluten, they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can make dishes such as Red/Green Chili plates without flour, just ask!  Awesome!
