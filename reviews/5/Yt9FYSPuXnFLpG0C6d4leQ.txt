It really doesn't get any better than Crescent! I have been saving up all these wonderful things to say in a review about Crescent Ballroom but, if I wait any longer I will never write it...

Every show, every experience at the bar, every encounter with the staff, it all just gets better all the time. Something in the water perhaps? 

This venue is the tits! The show room is so intimate. You can get up close and personal with your favourite artists or chill back in the stadium bleachers There's not a bad spot to stop and listen in the whole place. The sound, the lights, the temperature! Its all oddly perfect. You are never really standing on top of someone else and I really love that. But some sold out shows do get packed.

Los Dias de la Crescent was such a stand out event for me this past year. Really a unique experience at a venue other than a park. 

They have a good beer selection! Though they don't have Hop Knot on tap I can order it in a can or, in lieu, grab an Odells on draft. 

I have not had a chance to order food from the cocina but I have tried the nachos and they do not disappoint!

I try to see at least two shows a month here. No reason not to! So many great artist and at such an intimate venue. Stop over at Stinkweeds, pick up some tickets and get your bottom to a show!
