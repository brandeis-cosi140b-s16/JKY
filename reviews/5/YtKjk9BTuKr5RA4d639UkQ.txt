I stopped in for the first time a couple weeks ago, and was extremely impressed with the place. The carne asada tacos were amazing - perfect flour tortillas, and a nice topping bar, including some delicious hot salsa which might catch you off guard if you're not used to "hot" actually being "hot".

The other meats are delicious - the pork, beef, turkey, cabeza, and cachete are all fantastic. This was the first place I've tried cabeza and cachete, and those are now my two favorites.

The people are friendly, service is fast, and prices are very reasonable. Definitely my new lunch spot.
