Talk about WOW this little hole in the wall on Maryland Parkway and Exley is one of the best if not top hidden gems in Las Vegas  when it comes to mom and pop Mexican food joints. I highly recommend the chicharr√≥n tacos and as for sauces I recommend the habanero green sauce but try at your own risk as it is spicy it will definitely get your blood warmed up.
