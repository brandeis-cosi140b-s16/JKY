This is the best Mexican food you can get in Chandler considering the they are THE Mexican place to eat in chandler. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and a few times it didn't agree with my taste buds but I'm like that, I'll try anything once even if I don't know what I'll like about it. Your only here once so make sure you try everything. 

I've been eating at Serrano's since I made my way to Phoenix way back in 98 both Mesa and Chandler

Chris B, there is a del taco on germann and gilbert that would be better suited to your level of taste but they don't serve beer. 

As for the adult video store next door, you could really do yourself a favor and spend some money in there. If, for no other reason than to rub one out and relax, you, really sound like you need to. 

Its a great place to eat. Friend or foe I tell the truth.
