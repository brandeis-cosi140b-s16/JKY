AMAZING AUTHENTIC FLAVOR!! 
We pretty much had a taco of each and on some we had double.... The head and tongue have outstanding flavor and there barbacoas are the bomb!! Carne asada is very delicious and kept me wanting more.... The owner "el chino" is very welcoming and more then great customer service skills! We will definitely be back!!!
