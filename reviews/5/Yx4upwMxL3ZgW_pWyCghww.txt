We had a fantastic time at Chayo!  The location is great, food and drinks as well. The guacomole with the pomegranate on top os killer. Best part was the service. Our server, Christina was amazing. She was on task and cheerful! It always increases my excitement about a restaurant when the service is great. The carnitas tacos with a big sangria makes for a fantastic flavor combination.
