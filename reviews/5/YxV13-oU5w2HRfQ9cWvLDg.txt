Decided to try this new place and not disappointed.  We loved the atmosphere and remodel they've done.  Very comfortable and welcoming.  We sat at the high tables, which we enjoy, but didn't feel like we were in the bar. 

The salsas were good and spicy too, but not too hot.  We each tried something different and all 3 dishes were quite different and all tasty. The blue corn enchiladas with the Christmas style as they call it (both red and green sauce) was the fav at our table. 

We'll definitely be back for more food,  margs and Negro Modelo in tap!
