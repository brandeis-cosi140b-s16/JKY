lobster guacamole is amazing it sounds strange but its soo delicious plus their chips are fresh and their salsas are great too. 

i love their seafood tostadas they're a fantastic summer dish but id eat them in the middle of february and be just as happy. 

don't get the cucumber martini its sweet no bueno
