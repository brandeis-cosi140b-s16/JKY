This place never disappoints me. This is the first time I went during their Bloody Mary bar for Sunday brunch. The service was immaculate, the food was awesome, especially the grilled pork my wife had....it had excellent flavor. I must say, I made a really good Bloody Mary. Their baked goods like the muffin I had and the cornbread my guests had were DELICIOUS. The waitress was excellent as by brother-in-law asked if the burgers were messy and she picked up on the hint and brought him a "messy" burger with LOTS of BBQ sauce. To top it off, the hostess sat us under the flag of my home state.....TEXAS!
