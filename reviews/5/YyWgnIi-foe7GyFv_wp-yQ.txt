Best Mexican food in Madison. I got the Mexicana enchiladas and the breakfast burrito and they were delicious. Both tasted great heated up in microwave later. Food tasted fresh and the rice was not dry like you get at some places. Very pleasant staff and I will be returning many times in the future for the food that I had. Was extremely happy after eating here.
