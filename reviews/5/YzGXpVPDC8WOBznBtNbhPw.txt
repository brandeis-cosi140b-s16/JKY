I'd highly recommend this Mexican food. My family and I go at least once a week. Their hand made sopes are delicious it comes with beans, choice of meat, lettuce, cream and cheese with the green spicy salsa (which by the way is the best in town!) We also order the tacos especially the pastor and lengua. The lengua is additional but they are very delicious- to die for! Their pambazos and the tortas are really good as well and goes perfect with their homemade horchata!! If you are looking for quality, cleanliness, service and good prices this is the place to enjoy!! It literally looks like a laboratory because of how clean and spotless it is inside. Definitely deserves more than 5stars!
