I wish I possessed the power to delete this place from Yelp and keep it secret. since I cant , I will share.

Others have said essentially disregard the visuals with this place. Fact. it is in the 'hood, has a downscale exterior appearance, limited parking, and a colorful human element circulating on the street adjacent to the area. Nothing dangerous, just colorful. 

Just park your sled and go inside.

The interior consists of a single room  of ~30'x20' with perhaps a total of ten 4-top picnic table/bench style tables. 

Wait staff brings menus. The fare is simple - flame singed animal protein ferried to your table on a small  sterno fired BBQ  contraption about the same size of a 12pack of soda cans.

We ordered a beef, pork and chicken paradilla, termed a half order. For $13,it arrives with tortillas, salsa,  lime wedges, and onion on the BBQ contraption which I surmise is a parradilla.

This meal would be a contender for my last meal if I were on death row. Perfect. Super tasty. Smple. Excellent value.
Free people watching. What more can a carbon life form hope for?

$19.36, with tax,before tip, for a sizeable pile of meat, a giant horchata and a giant soda.

If you want enchiladas, albondigas or a taco salad look elsewhere.

This joint does one thing, and one thing only, very well.

My ONLY complaint would be the tortillas and tortilla chips could be a bit better quality 
but things are actually fine as they are.

I hope the folks get rich and stay in business for many years to come.

Go, disregard the optics of the place, enjoy, and thank us band of swarthy reviewers
 for convincing you to give this gem a shot.
