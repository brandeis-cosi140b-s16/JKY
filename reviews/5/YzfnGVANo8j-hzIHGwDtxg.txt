We went there with a big group on Saturday night and it was awesome! The service was great despite the debacle that always comes with a huge group. We got a bunch of chips & salsa, guacamole, queso and flautas for the table and those disappeared. The guacamole is top notch with lots of avocado and the queso is probably the best I've had. I'm not sure what all is in it but it has a great flavor.

The beer selection is one of the best I've seen in town. They've got about 20 beers on tap and a lot more bottles. The beers on tap aren't your average beers either...they are hard-to-find microbrews and Belgians. The people at Tacos & Beer seem to know a thing or two about beer so they pick out the good stuff.

As for the tacos, I only got 2 since I was full from all the appetizers and beer but they were both touchdowns. I got the carne asada (a classic - and it was delicious) and the fish tacos. The fish taco was probably my favorite actually: big chunks of fish, tasty and crunchy veggies and a big dollop of guac on top.

Definitely recommend if you're visiting or a local.
