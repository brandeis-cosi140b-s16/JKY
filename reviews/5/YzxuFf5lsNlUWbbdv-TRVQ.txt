WARNING - this restaurant does not operate in a drug-free zone. That is the only thing that explains why they can serve up Mexican food that tastes so good that it is addictive. If the DEA ever raids the place and prevents them from spicing their food with crack, than their food will start to taste like all of the other places that attempt to serve Mexican food. 

We ate a taco, volcanoes (tostadas), huaraches and carne asada. You could not go wrong with anything they served up. The only downside was the lack of parking. Come prepared to wait for a seat in a small crowded diner or bring a blanket to spread out on the ground outside for a picnic lunch. No matter where you eat, the food is worth the trip.
