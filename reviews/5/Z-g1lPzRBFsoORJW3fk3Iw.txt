Went for dinner tonight for the first time, and sat outside.  
As soon as we sat down, they brought out chips, salsa verde, and ceviche.  All very good.  The salsa verde is HOT. 
We did not order appetizers, as we had the things they brought out to us.
The menu is extensive, so be prepared to take awhile to decide!
For our entrees we had:
Me: Whole Fried Red Snapper, garlic style.  OMG, first time I ever ordered a whole fish, and it was SO delicious!  They also have a Whole Fried Tilapia, which I will try in the future.
Hubby: the Octopus, Diablo style.  He loved it!  I tasted it too, and it was very good, and when I've had octopus in Mexico, I did not like it.
For drinks, we didn't have anything fancy.  Hubby had a Dos Equis, and I had a Pina soda.
So, needless to say, we will return, and probably very soon!
