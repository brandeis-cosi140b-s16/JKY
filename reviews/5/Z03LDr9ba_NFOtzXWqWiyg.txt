Awesome, awesome, awesome. I tell everyone I know in the Phoenix area that they neeeed to try this place.

After my last review, Katie reached out to me about the issue with my CC and promised to make things right on my next visit. I am not local to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and really had no plans to come back in the immediate future, so I thanked her for reaching out but didn't really expect much to happen. 

Fortunately I got the chance to be in Phoenix for a couple days just a short month later and I knew I would be hitting up Cien Agaves for my tinga chicken quesadilla and house margarita. After sitting down and ordering I mentioned Katie and my server sent her right out - she was awesome and very accommodating and made true on her promise.

I can't speak for the full menu because I literally order the same thing every time (I know - how boring,) but I would expect nothing less than greatness from this place.

The only issues I have are:
1.) I can't go on a regular basis
2.) They don't sell the "green salsa" - seriously y'all need to allow me to order this or share the recipe with me because I am obsessed with it. 

Thanks again Cien Agaves, I can't wait for my next impromptu Phoenix trip so I can come back!
