I came as part of a big group - we estimated 30 but came with 40, about half an hour earlier than expected, and we were still received very well by the staff. Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and told us about their specialties and informed us about the vegetarian options. She was very nice and patient to all of us, continually making sure we were refilled with horchata (free refills on horchata whaaaat), salsa, or chips. I got the Alex Tacos and asked for no spicy salsa on them, and when I got my food she brought the salsa in a bowl on the side for me to try, and I ended up loving it! The tacos were also loaded up and overflowing and every plate was very hot to the touch, so no one got cold food or left hungry. The cebollitos on the tacos were so amazing! Finally, she brought each table boxes for leftovers and our checks before we asked for them.
