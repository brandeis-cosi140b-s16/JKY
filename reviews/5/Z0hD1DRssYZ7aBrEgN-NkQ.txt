I thought we were going to have traditional tacos. There's nothing traditional about this place. I loved the Chipotle Cherry Steak taco, Guild Chicken taco, Yucatan Shrimp taco, and Street Corn. Great service. Great atmosphere. In an old church that was built in 1955. Come for the novelty, come back for the food.
