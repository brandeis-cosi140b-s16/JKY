First time i have ever been here. They do not take reservations.   However,  you can call 30 min before you arrive and they will put you on the waiting list.  We did not and we only had to wait 30 to 35 min for a booth. It was worth it!!  It is decorated very nicely.  You do feel as if you are in a cool restaurant in Mexico. I  love coffee with Mexican food and theirs was really good. Chips and salsa bravo,the salsa is great!   I got one of the best Mexican dishes i have ever had. Salmon enchiladas with Avocado sauce and mango chunks. Delish!   My date got Carne Burrito with rice and black beans.  Lots of food ,we took it with and all really good.  Service was nice. Too bad it is so far away from where i live. But, i can't wait to go back. This would be a great place to take out of town visitors.
