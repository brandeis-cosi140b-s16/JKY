We've been here five months spending time and money seeking a Mexican restaurant. This. Is. It.

For Tejanos, there are no migas, no fajitas, no beefy chile rellenos. But the core cuisine is here. 50 years authentic.

They serve Jarritos; they have menudo, lengua, fideo, etc.
They have sopapillos del cielo! Con angeles cantandos! 

It is quietly outstanding; muy sabroso. Vamonos!
