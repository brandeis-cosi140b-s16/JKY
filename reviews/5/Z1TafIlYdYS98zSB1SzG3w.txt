I've eaten at Que Bueno several times, and the food has always been great! I would totally recommend the Sanchez Special, which is enchiladas in a special cream sauce, or the shrimp burrito, especially if you like some spice! The fajitas are good too and my dad practically scraped our bowl of spicy bean dip clean. The beer is served really cold, which is quite refreshing, and the margaritas have always been good as well. I am so confused by some of these negative reviews. They sound like nothing I have ever experienced at this restaurant. I would recommend Que Bueno to anyone looking for some good, authentic Mexican food.
