I don't know why I didn't write about this place before.  It's a regular haunt of mine.  The owners who are always mistaken for regular staff because of "working" so hard and not just "managing" make this restaurant fabulous!
     First the menu.  I haven't come across anything like it to compare it to.  The Chef is actually from France.  I say this because he constantly comes up with different food choices not expected from someone trained to cook in Europe. More West by Southwest than European.
    Favorite Must Haves: Lamb Malotes, Prime Rib Tacos, Frutes de Mar and their desserts.   They offer "bite" size of most of their dessert menu so that you can try more than one.
    When the weather is nice, they have a HUGE outdoor patio on the lower deck and when the evenings are nice an upper deck that looks over the views of Carefree.  Thursday nights include live Jazz musicians.
    I think the thing that hooked my hubby and I was the first time we were ever there, "Tim" our bartender leaned over the bar, shook our hands, asked us our names, told us his and treated us like family.
We've been going there three years now and they always remember our name!
    If you have a special event that takes a party of five or less, call for a reservation and ask for the table in front of the fireplace by the front door..  They won't guarantee it, but will give it to you if they can.  It's the best spot in the house!
    Did I mention they make an AWESOME red sangria?
I could write on and on... you just have to check this place out!
