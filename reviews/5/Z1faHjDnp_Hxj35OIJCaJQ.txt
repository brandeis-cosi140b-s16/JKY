The best steak tacos and tostadas that I ever had. I purchase 5 because I was very hungry, they are about $2 each. A good tip: If you go with somebody, one should make the line and the other one should find a table. Because this place is always full, that way when the order is ready, both have a place to sit and eat.  Great place to eat real mexican food. Absolutely Delicious!!
