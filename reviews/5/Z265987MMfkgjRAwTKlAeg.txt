This is my second time to visit this restaurant! The food was a bomb! I tried the fish tacos first and it was amazing flavor! Second time I come to try the carnitas which is shredded roasted pork with flour tortilla aside. I am in love with the green sauce! This sauce is no spicy at all which is my favorite. I couldn't ask for more because the serving time for food was super fast. I don't have to wait for long time to get the food. I highly recommended everyone to come to this place! Enjoy it guys!
