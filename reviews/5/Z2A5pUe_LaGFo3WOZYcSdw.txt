Best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  The arroz con pollo is awesome (chicken in rice with a red sauce on top of melted cheese).  They have some tacos which are not on the menu which are my favorite. They ar called tacos de asada and they bring 4 with a small bowl of beans on the  side.  There enchiladas are excellent as well as their burritos.  To drink try the Horchara, a Mexican rice milk drink.
