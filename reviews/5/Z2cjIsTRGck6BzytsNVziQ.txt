I've only been to the drive-thru at this place and always order the menudo on the weekends. The problem is they always run out by the early afternoon . . . so I call them to save an order for me.  They are always cooperative and the menudo is stacked full of tripe.  The broth is perfectly spiced-up.

I cannot understand how they can sell this wonderful dish (actually a quart) for $6 and change including tax.  Spectacular!
