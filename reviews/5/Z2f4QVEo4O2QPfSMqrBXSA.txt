Man the staff her is great. I felt like they were family. The chips were refilled, the drinks were topped off, they check in several times. 

The chips and salsa were great, get the hot salsa. 

The beef taco had flavor... imagine that. The green Chili burrito was a perfect companion to the taco, rice and beans. 

I loved it!
