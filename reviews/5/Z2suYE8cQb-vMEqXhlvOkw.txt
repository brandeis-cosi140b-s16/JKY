I cannot believe China Poblano has such a low rating.  I have always loved Jose Andres and have never been disappointed by any of his restaurants.  China Poblano was no different and is now my favorite of all of his restaurants (I've previously been to Zatinya, Oyamel and Jaleo in DC).  I went in December of 2012 while staying at the Cosmopolitan.  It is a very casual place with a fun, relaxed vibe.  We ordered the Golden Pigs (lightly fried BBQ pork buns served with condensed milk) and Har Gau for appetizers.  My boyfriend was skeptical of the milk being served with the buns but they were delicious!  The perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty.  For our entrees we ordered one carnitas and one lengua taco which were both perfect in every way.  The waitstaff was quick and friendly, the food amazing and the prices extremely reasonable for Vegas.  I am returning to Vegas in July and this is the first place I am seeking out for lunch.  I would highly suggestion that every one give it a try.  You will not be let down.
