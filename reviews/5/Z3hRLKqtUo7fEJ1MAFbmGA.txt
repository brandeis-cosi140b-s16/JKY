Flickas is great, we get the softball team to head over after games on tuesdays to eat up some of those shrimp tacos that are so damn good.
Everybody is really nice that works there, talkative; $2 Coronas are good and cold and there's always something good on the TV's if you want to watch sports.
Chips and salsa are super good too.  
I like it cause it's not a typical snobby scottsdale place and the mix of people and ages are pretty diverse.  You've gotta love the salt water aquariums too.  
Anyways - check it out - good stuff.  And if you see the crazy guy with shoulder length hair - that's Flicka - he's super talkative and a really nice guy - say Hi!
They have a site but it needs some web developer love from me:  http://flickasbajacantina.com/
