Reading the other reviews I hate to sound like a boken record,but this is hands down the best Mexican food in C-U. The wife and I are such regulars we get the same waiter every time, we sit down he comes over say hi, and the usual? We say yes and drinks, large guacamole, red&geen sauces, and of course salsa, and chips show up.Half the time the chips are still warm and the guacamole is always fresh to the point we have been told it will be just a minute on the guacamole he is making it.The only downside is location it one block off campas so when the kids are back it can get very very busy.Parents weekends, football weekends forget about it.But most of the time there is no wait or just a few minites. Timing is everything a little early a little late you do better. Great food, service and its real cheap what more do you want? I'll tell you, I want them back in Rantoul where they started right at the end of my steet! Stopped in for dinner on Saturday and got the word they are coming back to Rantoul. It will be great to be able to walk to the restaurant again instead of driving almost 40 miles round trip. Oh no not coming back. We are back to the truck now and then.
