Pollo fundido is an amazing dish here! Shreaded chicken in a lightly fried flour tortilla topped with a creamy jalape√±o sauce (not hot) and cheese. This is just decadent! A side note very much worth mentioning is the attention to the Mexican rice....it is among the best I have had. So many restaurants just throw together a mess that is just a waste of space on a plate, I feel that skimping on the sides is about as bad as a dirty restroom! Come here and eat!
