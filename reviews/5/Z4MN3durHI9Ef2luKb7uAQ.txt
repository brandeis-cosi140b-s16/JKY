Great Food...Great Service

Once again I am reminded why I stay away from Yelp.   Completely irresponsible reviews by complete idiots.

This food is delicious and the service was unbeatable.   We had stacked enchiladas and the chicken tacos.   

With tools like Brandon K, Terry S and Liz D lecturing restauranteurs on how to execute their business its not hard to see why Yelp is dying the slow death that Angies List is.


GREAT FOOD......oh and head over to TripAdvisor.com to avoid the Yelp assassination squads.
