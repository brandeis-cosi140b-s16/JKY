Phenom. 
The food is always fresh and well seasoned. A good selection of Tequila. 
Every meal that I've had has been just fantastic. The carnitas and the fish taco's are very well prepared. It's fresh, the beans are fresh as is the rice. 
It averages about $10 a plate but worth it. This is how really good Mexican should be. 
The salsa bar is excellent: you have about 5 different types of salsa from which to choose. All freshly made. 
I can't say enough about the flavoring of the meats and fish. 
Decor is a somewhat minimalist/modern, probably to attract a happy hour crowd. They have TV's for your viewing pleasure. 
Service is friendly and quick. 
I've only been to the Chandler location but will start going to the one in Scottsdale. 
Good food. You won't be disappointed.
