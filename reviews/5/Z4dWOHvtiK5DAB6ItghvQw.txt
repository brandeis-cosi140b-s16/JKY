Top notch Hispanic food. The best I have tried personally. Prices are reasonable; definitely affordable  and the decor and vibe is great. Romantic date spot.  My gf and I come to Javier's all the time (Newport Beach location). Las Vegas location has same quality of food. But the prices are about $5 more. Come here and enjoy it
