Out of all the other Roberto's shops in the area, this is my favorite one. You haven't tried nachos until you've tried roberto's Carne asada nacho (get it Togo, you get more out of it ;) other than that, they have beef & chicken tacos which are deep-fried and stuff with almost all the condiments that Mexican sides provide. Also, the chimichangas meets all needs for a hungry customer.
