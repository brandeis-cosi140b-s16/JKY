Let me just say I first tried Rubio's in San Diego Co. where the Rubios I visited the most was down the road from their corporate office on Yarrow Rd. where they hold the taste testings..and they give you 3 gift cert. for $7.00 each. Can't beat that! I've tried all kinds of Rubios up & down san diegos coast and I never liked the veggie tacos.. till I ordered them @ the sunset location. It was so good it was even better than the gourmet shrimp - - which  is my most recent fav.. right behind the fish taco especial .. which the best one was on Sycamore/ Hwy 78. I'm not a fan of the chipotle salsa but I love the green and the Hot salsa. and even the mild. my only thing is the salsa is kinda runny - compared with Baja Fresh's Salsa.. but I prefer the food @ Rubios.. so I alternate btwn the 2. they are right across from ea. other This one is right outside sunset station and baja fresh is inside the galleria mall ring circle. If you are in the area.. these are must trys.
