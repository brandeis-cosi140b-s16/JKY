If you haven't been to Maize, the question is why?  Fantastic food! Quesadillas, volcanes, tacos, tlacoyo, nachos - all so good! It is really mostly a carry out joint, so I don't fault them for limited space at all. Better to start out small, grow a reputation - than look for a big space to begin with.
