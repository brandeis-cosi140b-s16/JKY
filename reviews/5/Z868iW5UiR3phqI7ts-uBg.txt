Came here for lunch. The place was quiet, very large clean when I got there they were cleaning. Its bright, cheerful and everyone was so helpful. Ordered chicken taquitos what I always get. They were fantastic, fresh cooked correctly. Lots of fresh salad and guacamole on top.The guacamole was almost flavorless but the salsa added with a little salt made it perfect and all was right in the world again. Anytime Im in the area and craving a taquito fix I will definetly be back.
