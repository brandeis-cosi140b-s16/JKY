I LOVE this place it is so addicting! It is always pretty busy and the space is small but it is sooo worth it. The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich, their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo, lettuce, tomato, their homemade salsa and onion. My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta, a bowl of their AMAZING pozole, and a couple of Carnitas tacos. Flavorful, affordable, delicious! Enough said.
