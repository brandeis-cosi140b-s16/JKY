What can I say about Gallo Blanco.  The food is always awesome and very non traditional.  Great place for a first date, meal with friends and family, or just for happy hour drinks and appetizer's.  The best part are the urinals in the men's room. Very popular place that everyone has to see, I always have to take the women in to show them cause they all want to see the unique urinals.  It's OK.... everyone does it!  I know the owner and the several of the staff of the hotel and they are all awesome and this is the best kept secret for hotel lodging and eating in Central Phoenix.  Very Highly recommended!!!!
