I LOVE this bar!  This is a wonderful place to go with a mixed group of people that want to have fun and meet lots of crazy people.  I've met some crazy people here and I always have fun!  Drinks are well priced and never weak.  I've taken lots of out of town friends here and everyone has loved it!

This is a must stop in Scottsdale!
