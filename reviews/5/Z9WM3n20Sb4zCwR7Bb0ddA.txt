I have been waiting to write this review until I was really inspired, because I wanted to do this place justice. 

Sitting at a coffee shop, a little wired, listening to some amazing Explosions in the Sky in my headphones, I finally feel I'm ready. 

The bad: North of McDowell. I mean, this place is supa close to me, so I'm happy, but I really wish this place had a sexy downtown location because it is so freaking good it would blow up if more people were near it. I feel the location, although keeps it a hidden gem, also repells people from going, although let me be the one to tell you, it shouldn't! You NEED to go here if you are chippy and salsa person. Bottom line. Not optional. The absolute BEST in Phoenix metro ever. If you disagree, hit me up and I will pay for your meal. I'm not kidding. I believe in it that much. 

The good: The Salsa bar. Jesus Christ himself would call this Salsa bar a miracle. From reds, to greens, to peanut, to hot, to mild, chunky and smooth they have everything, hand made from scratch and incredible. The flavors actually rotate so some times you'll go and get a new treat to try. Most of them are inspired by regions of the world and have salsa flares about them. I can't stop, thinking about it now. I may leave this coffee shop and go there for lunch today now... 

The gourmet tacos. Incredible, large chuncks of savor steak, giant shrimp (yah I know that makes no sense), and great corn tortillas make this no flour boy a very very happy camper. 

Obviously you'll need to choose the right salsa to add on top of your already incredibly delicious taco, but choose wisely. The flavors are already perfect. 

I hope this review has done it justice. It's incredible and needs to be in your rotation. Especially if like taking your friends out to new places they have never been before.
