Nothing short of amazing. I was impressed with the atmosphere from the second I walked it with the love music. When I heard about the Pomegranate Guacamole, my first thought was another booshie spin on a classic Mexican dish. Needless to say I was blown away. They had an amazing selection of tequila and drinks I order a Victoria even thou it wasn't on the menu. Considering it just became available in Phoenix this year I understood.  For my main course I choose Tacos de Cochinita Pibil. Normally I am left still hungry when ordering a taco platter this is not the case with these small tacos stuff with all this with wonderful ingredients fresh and flavorful. Great service, great food and great ambiance have made Barrio Cafe my new weekly must go place!
