Started with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice! 
For my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail) 
The manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food.
