Hidden in a small shopping center on Odana road - I thought it was just a grocery store. Little did I know, hidden more into the back is a restaurant! And, oh boy, is it worth it take a peek in there!

My sister introduced me to this place after being told it was one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Madison.  You know it's authentic when you're the only English-speaking customer in there.  O-M-G and talk about the price is right. Our order came to around 18 bucks (with drinks!) and we really could have cut back on a few less tacos - probably making a regular meal here around 7 bucks each; still leaving you full and satisfied! Who can beat that? Their chile rellenos are my favorite - YUM! But they are only served on the weekends. Mmm...I would like to go there right about now.  Oh, and service is always so great! Enjoy - and thank you Tienda Los Gemelos for being there for me when my tummy needs you most!
