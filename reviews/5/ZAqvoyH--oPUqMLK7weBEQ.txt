Delicious food and it's fast and fresh!! I'm so glad they opened up Taco Taco in my neighborhood. Everything I've tried is super tasty. I love nachos and I think theirs are especially good and they aren't a soggy mess, the chips stay crunchy and the toppings are yummy! One of my favorite things about Taco Taco is the salsa bar! I believe they have 8 different kinds of salsas to add to any of their delicious items.
