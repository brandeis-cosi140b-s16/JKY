We are locals and had family in town last week.  They stayed a few nights at Red Rock and we met them for dinner.  With the many options to choose from I am very  glad we picked this place.  Autumn greeted us at the door and was pleasant, friendly and very accommodating.   Had Christopher as our server and was even more impressed.  He not only provided fantastic service, he was engaging and humorous. Tough to find this level of satisfaction anywhere nowadays.  We will be back!
