We agree that this is really good Mexican food.  Nothing fancy....just the way authentic Mexican food should be.  We had carne asada and carnitas tacos and a green chili beef burrito.  Excellent.  Very friendly (and fast) service.  Wish we lived closer but will definitely be back next time we need to go to Food City for their awesome house-made tortillas and salsas.
