We found this place thanks to a coupon from the Entertainment Book.
We had gone to the area for a special occasion and wanted to have dinner on the way home.
We didn't think much of this place initially as it is a tiny location, and you order at the counter.
However, the staff was very friendly and accommodating to our special requests. I had a green chile plate as I was trying to avoid tortillas. Hubby had a chicken chimichanga.

I liked very much how they presented my food, and also that they use real plates, very big, nice and colorful plates.

We did like the complimentary chips and salsa.

I think they did charge us a fee for paying with credit card, but we didn't mind because their prices are very reasonable.

Also, I did love that they had 'low carb' tortilla options in their menu. That is what got them the 5th star : )
