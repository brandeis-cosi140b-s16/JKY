This was my first visit to Texicali and I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE....Sweet Taco Jesus! I ordered the Bacon Guacamole Dip, the flavor was amazing!!!! Even though I picked a few dark peppers out (just to be safe) for my entree I ordered 4 Tacos all on flour tortillas...I would highly recommend ordering the Carne Asada and Smoked brisket, Best tacos ever! Also the ambiance here is too cool for school! There's a motorcycle displayed in the center of the bar which adds a funky edge. All the staff members are really nice and quick on their feet my food was out within minutes...I cannot wait to go back! Thanks to everyone here tonight
