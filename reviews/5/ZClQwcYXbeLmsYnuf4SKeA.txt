Terrible name, great tacos.... You would never stop here if it weren't for the great reviews.  It went through some new ownership but the food is the same which is GREAT!  I have to order 4 tacos pastor each time because they are pretty much like crack cocaine for me.  I have tried a few other items here and although they are good I always go back to the pastor tacos.  This is a tiny place next door to the 7-11 and you will probably drive by this place because it is so small and there is not much parking so be careful when you go here.  Do yourself a favor and stop here for some tacos, they are small but are phenominal!
