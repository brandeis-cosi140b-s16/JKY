Walked in somehow thinking the place served BBQ.  *Wrong* I had the special... 4 tacos for $5 bucks.  The gal behind the counter took my order, and brought the drinks to the table, along with a couple of servings if the very best pinto beans my Texas bred behind has ever eaten.  The tacos were amazing, the place was military clean, and the service could only have been friendlier if a Labrador puppy wrote up my order.  

Can't wait to go back.
