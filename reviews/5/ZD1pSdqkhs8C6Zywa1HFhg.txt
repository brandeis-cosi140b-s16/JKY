If you're coming for lunch you need to be here between 11-1130 or you'll be waiting in line. Every time I've come here I try something different and every time I leave satisfied and happy. Great portions and my bills have all been under $10. The owner is always walking around and chatting it up. Good business practice. 
Food= good
Service= great
Price= awesome
The sauces are really great too!
