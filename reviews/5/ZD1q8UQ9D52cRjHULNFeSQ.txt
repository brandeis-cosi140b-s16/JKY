Came here as some friends wanted to bring me here as I've never been before. 

The staff was very nice and were always there if you needed them. They have a wide variety of food to chose from which is great! The chips and salsa are good as well as their guacamole is outta this world. 

The quality and quantity of food was excellent! I'll be visiting here more!
