I have been to Chuy's 3 times so far and every time its been great!  The service was good and food was wonderful.  I would suggest going early as the place fills up fast (they were full and on a wait by 6:30).  Obviously they are doing something right if people are willing to wait an hour to eat.


I don't recall the wait times for my drinks/food as there was so much to look at and keep you occupied while you wait as well as the free nacho bar - YUM!  Our food was served before we knew it and was excellent!  Hot, fresh and very flavorful.

This is definitely my restaurant of choice for Mexican, and I will continue to dine there even though its a 30+ minute drive for me.  Definitely worth the drive!
