I decided to try this place on the strength of other yelpers and it was close to home!!  We were very pleasantly surprised upon entering from the back that it is a large and very clean restaurant.  We went up to the front and told Juan that this was our first time and he instantly began explaining the process and getting some samples ready for us to try.  We got some al pastor, carnitas and steak samples.  I went with the al pastor tacos and the bf got a tripas burrito.  He can be very picky about food and loved the monster burrito they made.  Service was fast, the food so fresh and so many choices available that I can't wait to go here again.  The prices are very reasonable and we were more than satisfied with the experience.  They have a large selection of meats and vegetarian choices.  This will be my go to place for tacos from now on!!
