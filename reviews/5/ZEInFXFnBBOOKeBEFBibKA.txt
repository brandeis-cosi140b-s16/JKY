every thing i ordered I loved. Chef Jose Andres knows how to do it right (like his trendy Bazaar restaurant in L.A.) Very casual. Remember that this is a tapas style place, so most dishes are small. Order the cochinitas (the best), BBQ steamed buns. the Lotus/pea shoot dish was surprising good. Noodle bowls good too (but large). Cocktail Singapore sling is fantastic. warning guys, this drink comes with a dainty umbrella.
