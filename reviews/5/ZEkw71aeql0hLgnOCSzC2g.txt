My husband and I came to Mesa for a convention.  We wanted to eat close to our hotel which was on Main Street. Thanks to fellow yelpers we chose Mangos.  We both had the special which was steak fajitas.  Our food was served hot and quickly after we ordered.  The customer service was outstanding.  We will go back again before we leave town.
