Two dozen times eating and never a bad visit! Green chili fries very good!! The beer is always cold , staff always friendly and remember you if you become a regular. The place is a little small so if you see a table you better grab it. Don't be in a rush to get your food because nothing is pre made. So have a drink enjoy your company or make a new friend.
