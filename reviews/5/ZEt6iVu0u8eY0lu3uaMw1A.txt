It was strange to have a burrito shop inside a gas station, but that doesn't really detract from the food. The place is clean and service is really quick. The lady that served me was nice as well; she was polite and gave my order with no problems. I ordered an Arizona burrito which only took about 5 minutes; it was nice, hot and fresh.

If you don't mind eating at a gas station, then Filiberto's is a good place to get some authentic Mexican food.
