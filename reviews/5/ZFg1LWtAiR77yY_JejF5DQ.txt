Love Q-doba!  The young man working there washed, and dried his hands before serving me.  I get the burrito bowl, brown rice, black beans, double guacamole, double veggies, lettuce, and double hot sauce for $7.80  At Chipotle, I get attitude, and the double guacamole would mean my bowl in almost 5 dollars more!  No thank you.  The service is always 5 star.  They also have nearly 100 beverages to choose from.(so much more than Coke products that Chipotle has)  It's good qulaity food that doesn't cost a fortune!
