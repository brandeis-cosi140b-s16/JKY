Found this place my last day in Vegas. Why didn't I find it earlier?!? It's a drive-thru open 24 hours! They serve huge portions at cheap prices.  Had a bean, cheese, rice, etc. burrito, and it was awesome!!!  Half was enough for 1 meal so I saved the other half for later. 

I give it 5-stars for being tasty, big and cheap.  It's 20 times better than Taco Bell.  If you're looking for fancy Mexican food, this isn't the place to go. But if you're looking for delicious, fast, cheap food -- go here!
