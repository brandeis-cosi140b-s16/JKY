You had me at "Mezcal Old Fashioned". Also at "tacos". I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed each visit. The barbacoa, and al pastor tacos are usually my go-tos, and both are delicioso. Last time, I ordered the veggie taco, and it was so tasty that I considered ordering at least a dozen more even tho I wasn't even hungry enough for the first one. *Hunger is of no concern when tacos are involved. The mango jicama salad is fresh and tasty and they have a unique selection of draft beers which is fun for those who like to explore outside of the Corona bottle. And ultimately, the best part is getting to sit outside, eating and drinking and good-timing, on the patio just like the good 'ol FF days.
