We've been coming to Hal's for about 10-11 years.  They used to be at 35th Ave & Northern - but lost their lease to a Title Loan business......  
This is their NEW location at 51st Ave & Northern.
But it is the same "old place" in atmosphere and menu items.
Come enjoy a LARGE margarita and try the Hal's Chicken (or Hal's Steak, or Hal's Shrimp). -or just about anything on theior extensive menu.
It's all good and the staff is authentic and friendly.
Tell em Gary sent you!
