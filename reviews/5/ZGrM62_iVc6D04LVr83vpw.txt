First time trying this place after hearing so many great things about it and it did not disappoint!! I called in my order since I was going in on my lunch and good thing I did. I wanted to just get a plain carne asada burrito with rice but the employee advised that I should get the California burrito with carne asada and boy was that a great recommendation. The burrito was so good and had so much flavor kinda reminded me of a burrito back home (Los Angeles). I'll definitely be going back real soon!!
