I should start by saying that I am a huge fan of Rubios in general so I normally wouldn't rate an individual location. This is the exception. The location on Ray and Power Rd is consistently awesome. 

If you like the food, and who doesn't then you will be happy to hear it's always great at this location. What sets these guys apart from the zillion other locations is the service and the facility. The restrooms are the cleanest I've seen and when you have a 5 year old that metters a lot! The service is second to none. Every single time I have been here,p probably 20 or more times now, I get a smile, a thank you, a perfect order and they go out of the it way to make sure everything is perfect. 

Well, lunch just arrived so I better get to eating! Viva Rubios!!
