It's always interesting how everyone has their go-to mexican restaurant...mine, hands down, is Fiesta Cafe. I've been going here since I was a little kid and it's difficult to find another restaurant that can compete. I love how their salsa is always fresh, service is AWESOME, their margaritas are great (get the don julio blanco and you won't be disappointed) My favorite dish is Tacos Mexicanos with chicken and a side of rice with white cheese sauce...mhmmm, delicioso!
