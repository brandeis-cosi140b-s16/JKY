This is the least authentic Mexican food ever short of wrapping sliced cheese and jelly beans into a fruit roll up.  HOWEVER, you don't go to Mad Mex for authentic Mexican food, you go there for delicious fusion burritos, cheap and deadly margaritas, and loud music.

I live in California, home of the burrito, and I still miss Mad Mex.  When I get a chance to come back to visit Pittsburgh, I make a point to enjoy myself a red velvet burrito or a dance marathon burrito, and of course a Mad Mex Margarita.  I was pleasantly surprised last time I visited to find the new no smoking policy here.  Anyways, this place is great for half-price food and half-price margaritas.  It isn't just because I was in college either.

I would also mention here, that drinking 33oz of generously tequila-ed margarita isn't the best (and certainly not the worst) idea before attending your ex's wedding.  If you decide on this, I'd recommend not breaking the seal and making sure it isn't a catholic wedding first.
