Despite being not being on the Strip any longer, this taqueria is still ahhhhmmaaazzziinngg. I was surprised that even though this spot is off the Strip, tourists were still jam packing it to get their infamous adobada AKA al pastor tacos. I of course had to get at least 3 of those bad boys along with a half order of the carne asada fries. I definitely recommend getting the half size because the full order will feed a small army. In addition, they carry the Orange Bhang drink, which I can only ever find in So Cal and now in Vegas. Though you'll  have to fend for a table if you dine in, once you indulge in some Tacos El Gordo, it'll all be worth it in the end my friend.
