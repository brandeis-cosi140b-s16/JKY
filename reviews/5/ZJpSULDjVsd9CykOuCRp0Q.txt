Best idea of this year!  An El Pollo Loco in West Las Vegas!

They just opened and the place was PACKED.  I couldn't help but thinking that we would wait at least 20 minutes for our food. To my surprise, it came out in less than 10!  It was very, very quick.

Plenty of seating space.  Friendly empmloyees that come around asking if you need anything and they even come around with a tray when you're done eating with napkins, mints, toothpics, etc.

Its like a fast food restaurant with waitresses, but not really.

The food was awesome. I got the #7 Grilled Chicken Salad. It was awesome.  The mint-green dressing and the roasted corn on the salad was most memorable.

My friend got a Chicken Avacado Wrap and he thought it was good.

The drink choices are good.  They have the Low Calorie Lemonade from Minutemaid and then they also have CHERRY COKE!

I'll definately be coming back to this place soon.
