This place is amazing! Rib eye tacos (7.49 for four) and flautas ($7 for four) were SO good. Condiment bar was awesome and everything is so flavorful. Best Mexican food I've had in a while and tastes just like Mexico!! Will definitely be coming back many times! Also their soup and ice cream was so good! And it's affordable!
