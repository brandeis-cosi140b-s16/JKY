I LOVE Casa de Lara Fitchburg. It's better than the downtown Madison location when it comes to service. They have great margaritas, great food. My now-husband and I had our first date here and it was a regular stop while we lived in Madison. Grab dinner and then go to the nearby Star Cinema for a movie - it's a great Friday or Saturday date night!
