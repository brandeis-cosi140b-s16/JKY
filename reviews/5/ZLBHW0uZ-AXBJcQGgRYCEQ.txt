This little place is AWESOME!

Nuff said.

But, if you really want to know...My fiance and I went here on a sleepy Sunday night when we were too tired to cook anything...and darnit if Costco wasn't closed to pick up a pizza, so we headed over to 16th street to see what new place we could find.  We were first given a bowl of chips and salsa.  The salsa looked like a mix between red and green salsa, and since I have a weird aversion to green salsa, I hesitantly tried it.  It was delicious, as were the house-made chips.  We ate two bowls immediately because we couldn't stop.

After asking the waitress what was best, my fiance decided on the spicy marinated fish, and I on the garlic shrimp.  Holy crap, it was delicious.  The garlic sauce for my shrimp covered everything, from the beans and rice to the secret fries beneath the shrimp (which magically didn't get soggy).  My fiance said his fish was the best he's ever had in America.  Mine also came with tortillas (I chose flour), and they were great, like the kind my mom bought from the "tortilla lady" back home.

We were so full we couldn't move afterward, but I woke up in the morning craving the garlic sauce again...

The place is small and quaintly decorated, like something you might find in a small town.  We saw lots of families and tables of friends come and go.  The best part is, you don't have to sit and awkwardly wait for your check.  You check out at the desk.

I highly recommend this place for some great mariscos.  I don't know how it could have been any better.
