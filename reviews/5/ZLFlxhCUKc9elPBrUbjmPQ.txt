This place has been pretty well reviewed already, so I'll just had one note: you have only 6 days left to stop in and enjoy some of the best margaritas $5 can buy. 

I went here about a week ago with a large group, and apparently during the month of May, each drink on their entire margarita menu is only $5. The list is quite extensive, I recommend the Prickly Pear of the few that I tried (OK, maybe more than a few. What? I had to take one for the Yelp team, and find out which was the best!). They have some great appetizers, too-- like the brie and mango quesadilla. Get in there now for some cheap drinks!
