Went to pre-opening.  Sensational menu of Japanese and Mexican inspired dishes, many featuring elements of both.  Two chefs, one from each tradition.  Owned by Jerman Aseo (surely spelled wrong by me), of Central Bistro and Local Bistro.  The drink menu is terrific, too.  We enjoyed bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, crispy pork belly sushi rolls, sake and sesame Japanese eggplant, chicken mole, sliced 35 day dry aged New York strip steak, sliced over fresh mushrooms and a coconut milk sauce with roasted leeks, tuna ceviche tossed in Aji Amarillo sauce and served in a coconut placed in an ice bowl, hamachi sashimi in a mysterious green sauce garnished with micro greens, and many more.  Tried a Magic Mojito, made with frozen horchata and loads of fresh mint, and a Passion Fruit cocktail with Mescal, passion fruit juice and ginger beer in a copper mug.

Service is well trained and savvy.  Interiors are high end design, with innovations such as a green grassy perimeter fence on the patio hung with giant, framed mirrors, movable shade screens that enclose the patios while misters and massive air conditioning capacity cool both indoor and outdoor space, and a huge man made tree in the main dining area.  Exhibition kitchen.  

Located in a new strip center at the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Drive.  Entrees are smallish plates best shared with your table mates.  Prices ranged from $8 to $18.  

Well worth a visit to experience the innovative menu and expensive buildout.  Acoustics are good, not too noisy even when full.
