I Love Loco, the patio is great for people watching, the staff is friendly and I always get great service.  The food is FANTASTIC!  The salt & pepper wings are my favorite, which is weird for a Mexican restaurant but I swear you have to try them.  The fish and beef Tacos as well as everything else I have had so far is super yummy!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place too everyone!
