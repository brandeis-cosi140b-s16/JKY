-2nd best burritos I've ever had here (nothing to sneeze at though since I've tried a lot of stands, restaurants, and hole-in-the-wall-type taco joints. They're still certainly really really good without a doubt, just the place that's #1 is really really really good and has the advantage of being a full-size restaurant).

-They're open 24 hours.

-Their stand/tent is really nice. It even has TVs so you can watch ESPN or other sports.

-Prices are fair, especially for how good their food is.

-The guys who run it were nice and cool too.

Overall, it is everything you could want in a taco stand and a pretty easy and well deserved 5-stars.
