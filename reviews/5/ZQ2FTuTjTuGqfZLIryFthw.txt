Wonderful staff and great food. Love the specials. The salsa and chips are great. I had tacos for my meal and I will say they are the best I have had in along time. I tried some of my husbands burrito (steak) and it was very good. The spice was just right. I would recommend you stop by and try it out. We will return.
