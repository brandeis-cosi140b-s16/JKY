Because of some bad reviews, we almost didn't stop here, but, I thought that because it's in my community, and had a good happy hour deal that maybe I should make my own decision. The food and drinks were really good. Our server Jane, was super cool and very nice. Good times. I had the grilled mahi tacos, my friend had the pick 3 tacos ( she had chicken and steak) she said they were both very good. The atmosphere is great. We were outside on the upstairs deck, very nice.
