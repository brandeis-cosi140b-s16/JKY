YIPPIE!!!! Our new family favorite restaurant.  We are now eating her about once a week.  They close currently at 6pm so call ahead if you are running late or keep that in mind.  It is a mix between a Mexican & BBQ restaurant.  Their salsa and homemade BBQ sauces are so delicious.  I recommend the Steak Burrito with Green Chili Sauce.  You can order the salsa in different sizes to take home to enjoy.  This is a small family run place.  It is not open Sunday.  Saturday they cook special bone in RIBS.  That is the only day to get the ribs.  They do not have restrooms unfortunately but who cares the food is AMAZING and the price is unbeatable.  I HIGHLY suggest trying it out you will be so happy you found this place!!!!!
