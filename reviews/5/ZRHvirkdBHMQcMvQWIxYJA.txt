This place defines customer service. Wow wow wow. First off let me just say that this is my second yelp review about this place and rightly so. Not only am I a true repeat customer as I have been in numerous times after my first visit i feel like I'm now a friend of of the establishment as I know some of the amazing people that work there. One person in particular continues to stand out as AMAZING in everything he does. That is the general manager Justin. When I first met him I thought I was speaking to the owner as he has love and respect for what he does that is out of this world. This man bleeds tequila to say the least. His knowledge of the product is out standing. I have learned so much from him about not only the different kinds of tequila but the history of tequila in general. I used to come for the amazing tacos, great atmosphere, and good vibes, but now I come for the knowledge and history as well. This is all thanks to the GM Justin. Its incredible what he does for this place. Truly incredible. Taco Guild has a customer for life in me. If you haven't been GO. You will not be disappointed. If you don't know Tequila and want to learn about it, have a seat at the bar and allow Justin to paint a picture for you. 

Justin thank you for the hospitality. If you ever open your own place, not only would be amazing but you would have me and my friends as regulars!
