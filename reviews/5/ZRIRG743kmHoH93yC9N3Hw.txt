If you ever have the distinct pleasure of being in Scottsdale as I was please stop by The Mission and request that "SAM" be your waiter. My wife and I received the best service we have ever received from "SAM". "SAM" is the most personable waiter I've ever had in my life. I would return  to The Mission every time I'm in Scottsdale!!! Not only was "SAM" great but the food was excellent. The chicken tacos were mouth watering. The margarita was excellent, Hat's off to the bartender and last but not least the Pumpkin Bread pudding that was recommended was so good I could have slapped my Mama!!! No, but really.. I'm not that crazy. I don't even like pumpkin but this was excellent with the gelato.... I can't wait to come back to Scottsdale in November just to return to The Mission and I will call to make sure that "SAM" is there.
