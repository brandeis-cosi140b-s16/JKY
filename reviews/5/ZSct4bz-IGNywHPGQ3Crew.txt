I went to Patron for lunch today. I had been to the other location in Monroeville so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised. My server's name was Jerry and he was excellent! I havent had lunch service that good in a very long time. The chips were great! The salsa was a little on the mild side but thats to be expected living in Pittsburgh. I ordered the steak fiesta burrito with rice and beans. The burrito had plenty of steak and was topped with lettuce,  tomato and sour cream. It was very fresh and had great flavor . The rice and beans were very good too. I will definitely bring the family for dinner soon.
