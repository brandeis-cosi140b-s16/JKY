This place was amazing.  They came out for my son's first birthday party in April.  We were looking to make everything easier and not have to worry about cooking for 50-60 people.  The two individuals that came out to prepare the tacos were very good.  They were on time so I didn't have to stress, and the food they served was delicious.  We had 4 choices of meat to choose from, rice/beans, salsas, other sides, and horchata.  There was definitely enough food to go around.  My guests enjoyed it very much!  I would absolutely recommend this place if you're looking for a smooth/stress free party.  Thanks Hector and team!!
