This place has authentic flavor! The spicy level for the hot sauce was REAL forehead dripping sweat spice. Lol I liked it. 
Our server was awesome (man with tattoos, forgot his name) he described dishes we questioned and also gave us details about the family owned restaurant that's been around for ages!
