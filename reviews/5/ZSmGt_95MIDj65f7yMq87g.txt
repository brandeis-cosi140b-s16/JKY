No matter what time of day, this is the place for filling, hot and delicious Mexican food. There's just something a little better about this particular establisment... Perhaps it's because they remember us when we visit or the food is always fresh and hot right off the stove! You can't go wrong here, make sure you get the Carne Asada!
