My children have food allergies and the crew behind the counter were so helpful and nice.  The food was very flavorful and delicious.  The salsas were amazing and some of them I would pour on top of ice cream as a dessert!  We tried each of the items with the steak, chicken, and Kalua pork and loved each one.  They all have distinct flavor, which I would suggest to sample to find your favorite. (For me it's always steak).  We tried the coconut bark which was a dark chocolate toffee taste of decadence.  The employees were extremely friendly and made us feel very comfortable for our first time.  We will be making a return trip (probably tomorrow!).
