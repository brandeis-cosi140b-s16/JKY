Arrived at Toros not knowing what to expect. Walked in the door and was promptly greeted by Dusty Lee. Was almost stunned at how friendly the service was.  She immediately asked what I wanted to drink and I was served quick. My friends arrived a bit later and we all enjoyed a great time at the bar. Gene the manager was great. Thumbs up for Toros!
