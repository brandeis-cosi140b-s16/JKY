Mad Mex Shadyside is our favorite spot to drink and get food we know we're going to love. I would bring friends here from out of town because I know they'd enjoy the atmosphere. I enjoy getting to sit outside or with the large doors opened. Definitely a great location and even better place to grab drinks!
