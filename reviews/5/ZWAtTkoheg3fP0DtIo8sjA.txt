What a great place! We went with a party of 9 tonight and had the best service. Chips and salsa were out quickly and the margaritas were on par. My favorite part of the meal were the fish tacos. They are amazing! The sauce on the tacos was delicious! Thanks for the great service and food! We will be back!
