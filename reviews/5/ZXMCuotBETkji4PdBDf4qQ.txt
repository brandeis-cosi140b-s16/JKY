Ah Jalapeno's.  I love this place.  The first time I came here was probably in 2000 or so.  Very little has changed since then.  All of my favorite menu items are always waiting for me.  The famous Green Corn Tamales are to die for, the Enchiladas are my comfort food, and no one makes a better chili relleno.  

The place is family run and you can tell.  All of the staff work as a team and they treat you as one of the family as well.  There's a sort of effusive happy wholesomeness of good company.  

Don't miss the delicious home made chips (especially the flour ones), but don't eat too many either otherwise you won't be able to finish your main!
