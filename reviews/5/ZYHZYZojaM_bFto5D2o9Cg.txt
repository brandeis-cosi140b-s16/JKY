This was the exact restaurant we were looking for as we just moved to the area. Every bite was delicious. Chips & dips were yummy, tamales, shrimp quesadilla & street tacos were awesome. We even had left overs from the lunch portions. Server was friendly and service was quick. Great lunch spot! Definitely going back again soon!
