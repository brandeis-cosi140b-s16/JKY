I LOVED their great personalities, everyone was very great!!  They helped me place my order, were very wonderful!!  Of course the burrito was GREAT!!  I was bummed my phone coupon was no longer valid when I went to check it on my phone for buy one burrito, get one free just last month, but I love their great food and their great staff made a great difference!!
