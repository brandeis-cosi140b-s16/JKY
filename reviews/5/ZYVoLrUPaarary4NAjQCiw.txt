**Summary**
       - Tacos - The Adobada and Lengua are two must haves. After that, as long as you steer clear from the Tripa and Sesos, everything else is pretty good.
       - Ordering - You grab a tray and you go up to one of the three guys and order your tacos. Adobada is on the right. Carne Asada is on the left. Most of the other ones are in the middle.
       - Neighborhood - This place isn't in the greatest neighborhood. However, there are mostly families in there and it's well lit so you should be fine.
**Ordered**
       - $2 Taco De Adobada (Spicy Pork) - The greatest taco I've ever had. It's cut from a giant rotating pork wheel. Genius (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=KTg0vlPNZqaZC4m7oh1nKw).
       - $2 Taco De Lengua (Beef Tounge) - It tastes like very tender beef. It's delicious and a must try.
       - $2 Taco De Asada (Carne Asada) - It's good carne asada, but there are definitely other things to try.
       - $2 Taco De Buche (Pork) - Tender, but not as good as the adobada.
       - $2 Taco De Cabeza (Cow Head) - It's just like regular beef.
       - $2 Taco De Tripa (Cow Intestines) - I was expecting tripe like in pho but got intestines. I found out that tripa didn't translate into tripe when I got home. Regardless, I didn't finish this taco.
       - $2 Taco De Sesos (Cow Brains) - This was also a miss for me. 
       - $10 Adobada Fries - Best in a group. Skinny fries covered with adobada meat, cheese, guac, and mayo. It's delicious but will also slow your insides down for the next couple hours (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/CiYLq33nAyghFkUR15pP-Q?select=h3ntc5q93sgsWcQUOofnZQ).
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but this little taco stand has turned me around.
