This was our first time at Serrano's and we loved it.  My lady gave the shrimp burrito a 9.5 and i'll give the pork in green sauce  a solid 9.  Its worth mentioning  that the Horchata rocked my world and salsa bar was indeed an asset. We finished up with the flan which also received a solid 9 from both of us.   

Customer service was excellent.  We totally screwed up the order/pay/sit protocol.  Without missing a beat, the young man working the cash register, graciously became a waiter, just for us (we had explained this was our first time).  As a parting gesture, he was nice enough to pay for our drinks. 

I think we just found our new "Mexican place".
