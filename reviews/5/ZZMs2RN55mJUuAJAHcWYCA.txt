This place has the BEST Tacos Al Pastor in town. Had been coming to this place since 1990 when my family and I first moved to Phoenix. Since then I'd been trying other places but nothing compares to this place's tacos Al Pastor. Another one of my fave are the tacos de tripa and lengua. I hadn't have menudo here for a few years because I live far from this place but if menudo still tastes as I remember them it's so worth for you to try it if your some where near by early on the weekends.
