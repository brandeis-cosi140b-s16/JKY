I had previously rated the Atwood location, and given it 3 stars because of the uniformly terrible service.  I have since eaten at the University Ave location.

ALWAYS GO TO THE UNIVERSITY AVE LOCATION.  Avoid the Atwood one--you'll sit there with an empty margarita glass for 20 minutes while the servers ignore you.

I love their fish tacos, particularly the shrimp ones.  I haven't eaten anything there that wasn't pretty good.  Coming from Missouri, I don't assume that I'll get corn tortillas without asking, but I can understand being annoyed about getting flour as the default.  The food is really good, and at the University Ave location, the service is excellent--we were seated immediately, our waitress was extremely attentive, and I was amazed at the speed with which our entrees were served.
