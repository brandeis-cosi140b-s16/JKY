Cilantro's has been impressive in a few of the dishes I've tried. Theirs tacos of course are delicious.  Has the shrimp cocktail and finished it to the very end not even juice left. Ate the torta and was finger licking goodness!! Had even the caesar salad no piece of lettuce left behind along with the great flavor.  Btw, this wasnt all in one sitting. Each plate has inticed me to keep coming back and keep trying their menu.  They have a little bit of something for everybody. Can't wait to try the next dish. Thank you Cilantros!!
