Always loved Carlos OBriens when they were at Scottsdale Road and Bell Road.

I pretty much get the #9 combination with a green burro and substitute the tostada with another taco to give me 2 tacos.

I love their open face cheese crisp and the Pollo Fundido which are 2 chicken chimichangas with sour cream and cheese on top.

Their complementary chips and salsa are great but don't eat too much before your meal arrives so you.

This is my go to mexican restaurant when my family can't decide where to go even though my kids don't care for mexican food a great deal.

I could probably eat here everyday if I could.

Live this place and glad they opened back up in my neighborhood area.

Will be back very soon or when we are near by.
