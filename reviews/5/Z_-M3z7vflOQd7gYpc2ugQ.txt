My boyfriend and I went here for the first time with a groupon and found the food to be fantastic! He had the Aztec chicken- thought it had good flavor and spice and the side of red chile potatoes were amazing. I had the cheese enchiladas with the red pepper sauce and rice and beans and found everything to be very flavorful. For those that like spicy salsa, go for the habanero salsa- super spicy but super delicious. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. Very cute ambiance as well!
