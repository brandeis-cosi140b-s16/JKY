What a wonderful restaurant! I think it's the best service I've received anywhere in Phoenix. Janet was our server and super friendly and helpful, and everyone else working was also so very nice. I really liked the International Appetizer, which included egg rolls, chicken tenders, onion rings and french fries. It was hard to decide what to eat since everything on the menu looked so good and there's such an assorted genre of food to choose from. I will definitely be back! And they deliver within 3 miles of the restaurant, so it's good for a night in too.
