At noon, my husband and I had our first lunch at Red Estilo Mex.  However, this definitely will not be our last.  Our food was the best Mexican food we have had in Arizona.  It by far beats anything in Tucson and Phoenix.  Service was prompt and friendly. Food was very flavorful and portions were more than ample.  So glad to find this restaurant!
