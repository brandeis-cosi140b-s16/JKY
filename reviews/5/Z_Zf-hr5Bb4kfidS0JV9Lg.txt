This place is small and almost hidden in a run down shopping center - would not have found it if we were not looking for it.  The dining room is small, casual, and intimate.  Waitress was attentive and refilled our drinks without us having to ask.  The chips that come to the table are still warm and taste homemade.  The sauces they are served with are both flavorful - the warm bean dip is the best and the salsa is fresh with just the right amount of spice.  Main courses ordered: pork carnitas, shrimp enchilada with a cheesy cream sauce, and sizzling shrimp fajitas.  Everything came out quickly and very hot.  All of the food was flavorful and everyone was extremely pleased.  We all left way too full!  To top it off, they have 99 cent house margaritas everyday - you cannot get any better than this place!
