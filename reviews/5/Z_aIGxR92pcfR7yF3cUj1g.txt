A neighbor of mine had been telling me about this place.  We live about 45min away.  I was in the area and stopped in for lunch.  I'm a sucker for street tacos.  It is the first thing I seek out when in Mexico or any hole in the wall.   This place was awesome!
Tortillas were being made next to me while I ordered the daily special 3 tacos.  I had the Cana Asada.  The meat was lean and had great flavor.  The Salsa bar was the best I have seen.  Drink selection was great! The help your self warm chips were fantastic.
Big Fan!  I will be back
