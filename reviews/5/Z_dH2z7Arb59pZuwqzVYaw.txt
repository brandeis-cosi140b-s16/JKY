I've been here twice now.
Here is my recommendation:
If you're feeling tacos, get the tacos- delicious.
But get the BOWL!!! 

So tasty and filling! Plus you have leftovers for lunch!

Drinks are delicious too, I liked the Mexican mule! But then again I am Mexican and anything Mexican is always great ;)
