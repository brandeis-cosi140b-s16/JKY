I don't even live in Phoenix, but when I am visiting, I go out of my way to eat here. The Veggie Mixto burrito is seriously the best burrito I ever had. I am utterly addicted to this place. The secret is the re-fried beans. Most restaurants just put pinto beans in their burritos, but the re-fried beans are key, and their flour tortillas are the best I ever tasted. If I could give them 10 stars, I would.
