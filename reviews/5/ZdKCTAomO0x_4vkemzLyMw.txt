Reyna has the best sit-down Mexican in the city. I really enjoy the margaritas, which as quite generously portioned. I always try one of the fruit flavors, and ask for them "less sweet." The bar staff is always accommodating to my request. The restaurant is pretty new, and the environment is nice. I love the Mexican pine tables and chairs, and the art is always a great conversation starter. The chip and salsa sample lets you try the best of the salsas from Reyna's. I normally go for the Chile Rellenos, but everything I had tried is well cooked, flavorful, and interesting. I have taken many guests here, and definitely recommend.
