This is good food. I had the chicken chimichunga meal. It was BOSS. My wife had two carne asada tacos (I'm sure that it's spelled wrong). We are both full and very happy with the food. It's a very small place that is clearly family owned, grandpa is in the dining area, mom and dad are in the kitchen, and the kids are all there too. I felt welcome and not at all intimidated by the huge menu because they have a picture for everything dish. This is my new go to place for awesome Mexican food, that is well priced, delicious and filling.
