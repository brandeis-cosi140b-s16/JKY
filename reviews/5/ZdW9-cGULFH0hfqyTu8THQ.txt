I love this little hole in the wall. Don't be fooled by it appearance. I ordered steak and cheese breakfast burrito. Wow, nice big burrito. Everything tastes so fresh.  Here is a pro tip. Asked them to wrap it in their whole wheat tortilla!  Yowza, one of the best brekky burritos I have ever had.  Great local shop
