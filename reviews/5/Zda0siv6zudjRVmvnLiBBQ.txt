Growing up in Southern California this was a place that we would definitely stop and eat at quite a bit. I haven't eaten in this place for many years being that we moved out to the Midwest which I wish they had these in Oklahoma City. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu I always go for the three-piece combo which I highly recommend come on Oklahoma City bring one of these out to our place
