While staying at the lovely Clarendon, my husband and I dined at Gallo Blanco everyday, several times a day. Because we stayed for almost a week, we tried almost everything on the menu.This place is amazing, reasonably priced, and a must see if you are in Phoenix. Some of our favorites on the menu: elote callejero, carne asada tacos, ceviche, guacamole, chilaquiles verdes, and the pollo asado. Nothing we tried was anything less than delicious. Months later my husband and I both keep randomly saying, "I wish we were at Gallo Blanco!" I think it is safe to say that we will be back (every single day) when we return to Phoenix.
