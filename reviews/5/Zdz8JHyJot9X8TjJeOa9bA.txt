Wow...what a nice surprise!  Chips and salsa were great, even though I usually prefer my salsa spicier than what is offered. Desert Fire Pasta was EXCELLENT, and sons loved their pork enchiladas and chicken quesadillas. Limit Two margarita was awesome (Top Shelf Conmemorativo).   Highly recommended - great food, reasonably priced, and outdoor seating wonderful!
