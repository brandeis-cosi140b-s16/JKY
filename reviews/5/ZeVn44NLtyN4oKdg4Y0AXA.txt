Been to numerous Filiberto's(es?) in the Valley, this one is definitely the best, hands down. Totally agree with what Kayla R. said. 

The ladies who work there are super-duper friendly. I only go there once a week; nonetheless they always remember me and what I ordered! Amazing people.

The Arizona burrito (steak, cheese, potato) is sooooo good. I really love how they are never stingy with their meat. And on Mondays, they have 99cent rolled tacos. I don't eat corn tortilla, I don't even eat their regular tacos (which my brother loves), but for some reason I absolutely love their beef rolled tacos. They are so generous with their cheese and by the time we got home it would be all melted on top of the three rolled tacos.MMMM

Their carne asada burrito is great too! Oh, and their carne asada fries! Sometimes it could be a guacamole overload. If you don't like that, you can ask them to put it on the side. 

A special that is not on the drive-thru menu is the Texas burrito. My brother is absolutely in love with it. It is a chicken burrito with sour cream. It didn't sound appealing at first, but when my bro insisted, I tried it, which turned out interesting in a good way. BTW their burritos are not expensive at all, $4 something each. 

Since I love spicy food, I always get their super hot red salsa. They also have the green salsa, and the brown mild salsa. Pickled carrots, jalapenos and onion are also available for the customers. 

Next time when you get a burrito, try this: take a bite, when you get to the meat part, put some onion on it, pour some hot salsa on it, take a big bite and enjoy. And that's what heaven is like. 0=) Except you don't have to wait, b/c it's 24/7! Woohoo!
