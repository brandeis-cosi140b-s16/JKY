First visit was awesome!  Chips and three types of salsa and all three were delicious. Had the pollo asado tacos which were moist and tender.  The owner came out to check on the meal which is always nice I think to have a connection with a local restaurant owner.  The ambiance was very casual and the music was great too.  Definitely returning with more friends!!
