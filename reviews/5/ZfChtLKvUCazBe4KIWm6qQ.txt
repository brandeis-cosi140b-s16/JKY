I practically go here every single day for the Chipotle Shrimp bowl.

Best Pico de Gallo I've ever had, and the guacamole is DELICIOUS!

It's right down the street from my work, so like I said, I'm there almost daily for lunch.

The manager that works the lunch shift is super nice and attentive, and everyone's working hard and they seem to care about what they do and enjoy it. Great customer service.  Really nice staff.

Love this place.
