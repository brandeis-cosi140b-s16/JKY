I used to live in AZ...I worked graveyard at a call center. NOTHING beats one of their burritos at 2am when most everything else is closed. I live in San Jose, CA, now where Mexican eateries are plentiful, and nothing beats Fil b's. I just landed back in PHX, I am on my way there now. BTW, putting some with dry ice to preserve it is an excellent idea to take some back to Cali.
