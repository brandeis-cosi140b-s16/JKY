I've been coming here since I was 16 and it had a different name and owner. The food is not amazing it's unbelievable. You really do get the family vibe here. The food is authentic and the owner and her family are authentic. The owner is a wonderful person and very welcoming. 
My favorite is the green chimichanga. Hmmmmmm. If you can't handle spice don't get it but if you don't get it you're missing out. Everything is good and will beat out any of those large restaurants by far.
