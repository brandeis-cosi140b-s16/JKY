Thank God!!! Finally I discovered a great taqueria in this city. LA mexican food is the best and I miss it every second of every day. This place can satisfy my need for tacos til I can get back home and stuff my face. 
I've never understood how a city with a large Mexican population could have such awful Mexican food. Like that nasty place that starts with a R....., people like that here and have the nerve to call it Mexican food. Listen, if you think Mexicans eat carne asada fries you should be punched.
