Best appetizer in the city.

Me and my family have been eating here since they opened, and that was around 20 some years ago.  Without fail we have always had the melted cheese appetizer.  It's a combination of a few types of cheese served in two different sizes depending on how much you want.  Let's make this clear.  This stuff is a heart attack in a hand pressed tortilla.  It probably takes years off your life but the taste is worth it.  

Perhaps it goes along with the tradition of melted cheese but I dont think I have ever ordered anything other than the bistek tacos.  I will admit I think they used to be better but I still they think they are quite good.

There is better mexican food in the valley that I am sure of, however between the personnel tradition and the melted cheese appetizer this place is still one of my favorites in Phoenix.
