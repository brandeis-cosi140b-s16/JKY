My husband and I can't say enough about how much we love Si Senior. More authentic than any Mexican restaurant in the east valley. We often take our out of town company there when the want good Mexican food and when they're back in town again they ask yo go back. The four dips/salsa. Served with fresh chips are always a treat. Each meal includes with sopapias (?) which are hot and delicious. We recommend the green chile - our favorite!
