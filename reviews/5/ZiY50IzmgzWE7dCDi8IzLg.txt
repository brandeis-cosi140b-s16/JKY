After a long night of drinking and partying we couldn't figure out where to go because the restaurant the driver recommended was closed. We found this place and it was great. As soon as u walk in u get the smell of authentic Mexican food. Everything we ordered was great! Portions n prices were great!  Great options great service. We are from out of town this was our first time here highly recommend.
