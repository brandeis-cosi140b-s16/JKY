I've lived in Phx for years and never heard of this place. Must have driven by this place multiple times without ever stopping. So glad I stopped in today.

Very clean. Excellent service. Excellent food!! Excellent hot sauce, if you like spicy stuff. 

Rosita's Place is casual dining. Shorts and flip flops are fine.

I'll definitely be back and recommend others!!
