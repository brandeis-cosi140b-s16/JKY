Love eating here whenever I'm in the Henderson area the food is really good kind of expensive but you get your money's worth for what you pay for my favorite is the Carne asada burritos and the Carne asada tacos and the cheese quesadilla that in itself is big and you get more for what you order I like this place and it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at and the food is always delicious and it's worth the drive if you live on the southwest part of the valley or any other part of the valley I recommend you come here if you are looking for delicious Mexican food as you won't be doing at all.
