The food here is amazing. The guacamole with bacon was fabulous. The tacos were really great! I had carne and swordfish. Also tried the lobster tostadas which were just ok... The cocktails were amazing though. My only complaint is that this restaurant gets incredibly loud when it's busy, but I didn't think that was worth taking away a star. Oh and keep in mind this may be Mexican food but don't expect cheap tacos, they're $15 for 4, but very delicious. Highly recommended to try this place!
