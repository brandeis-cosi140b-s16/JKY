My husband and I walked by this place 7 or 8 times, and finally decided to try it one night when we felt like the walk to the Luxor for Tacos & Tequila was going to take too long (I was getting hangry, and food needed to be acquired ASAP).  We had been laughing about the serious lack of customer service we had been receiving all over Las Vegas, but when we came to Hecho, we were really please with the hospitality we received.  Roberto was our server and he was awesome.  I got the Hecho Casa margarita on the rocks, my hubs got a shot of Don Julio and a Modelo Especial.  We got the table side guac, and it was amazing!  I worked in a Mexican restaurant for 3 years, so I am pretty picky about my guac.  We asked for it to be on the mild side, and it was heavenly.  We split the steak fajitas (also amazing) and they gave us flour and corn tortillas since we preferred different types.  The steak was perfect, really juicy and tender.  

We had been thinking that the guac and fajitas may not be enough food, and we were planning on getting desert from the froyo place outside Hecho, but we were both so full that we didn't have room.  

This was the best meal and best service we had in Vegas in the last 2 trips that we have made, and we will def be coming back again when we come back to Vegas in December.  Also, for one appetizer, one entree, 2 beverages and a shot, the price was only around $68... Which was pretty cheap compared to the other places we ate and what we got for that price.   

When we left, every person that we passed said goodbye, and thanked is for coming.  It was a nice change from the other places we had been.
