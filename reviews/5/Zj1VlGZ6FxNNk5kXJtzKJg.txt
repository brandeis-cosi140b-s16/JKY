We were searching for a spot for lunch during a training. We chose Dick's On fellow yelpers suggestions. The atmosphere was funny and cozy. The menu is full of delicious southwestern fare. I ordered a specially created (by me) hamburger and fries. It was fresh and delicious. My friends also enjoyed their food. The enchiladas were particularly tasty. This is definitely a great place to try. They have some great daily specials.
