My favorite thing about all of the Two Hippies restaurants is the lemonades. They are so fantastic. 

I love the beach house specifically because I love that I can sit outside on the eclectic deck and eat my tasty beach food. I love the chicken quesadillas here, I could probably eat about six of them in one sitting, just because they taste so darn good. 

The staff is awesome and funny. 

My advice, though: Do not come to this specific location on a school day around 3:00. All of the Xavier students are just getting out of school and SWAMP this place. It's already extremely crammed in the front of the building. Do not put yourself in a crammed building with 25 15-year old school girls... it is extremely hard to move.
