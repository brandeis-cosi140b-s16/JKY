From the moment I walked in, Taylor and Kat were extremely inviting and friendly!!!! Taylor was extremely confident, sharp, and personable. "Service is black and white, hospitality is color," I found a hostess that left not only a good impression, but a lasting impression. She is absolutely likable with spark. Compassion, enthusiasm, team player, and polished are just a few of the many attributes that come to mind when it comes to Taylor and Kat. She is truly a valuable asset to this restaurant and I will continue to be a repeat customer and spread the word about this place as long as she continues to work here. Best hire ever!
