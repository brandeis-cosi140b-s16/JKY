Pulled up to the scene, checked in, got 10% off my whole bill! BOOYAAAAAAHHH!!!!! Thanks Yelp! When I got the outstanding notification, I ordered the Jalapeno Margarita. Not too bad, I think I've had better. For my meal I had the Camarones ala Diablo. I was informed (warned) by our waitress that it's the hottest item on their menu. She was not lying. This dish could qualify for Cooking Channel's "Heat Seekers"! Our waitress also said my eyes would tear up and I would break out into a sweat. All of that didn't happen. Although, my nose did run. It was HOTT! I enjoyed Loco, good food, chips and salsa and a lot on the menu. I just wish it wasn't so dark inside. Nice place for some South of the boarder cuisine.
