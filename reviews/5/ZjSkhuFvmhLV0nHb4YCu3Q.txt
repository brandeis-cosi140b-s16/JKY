Tired of fast food, so I asked my cousin (a local) for recommendations on grub. He took me to Feipito's and i wasn't disappointing.I was skeptical on ordering Horchata (some places don't get it right) but it was great. I ordered a two taco combo (carne asada) and the portion was huge! The carne asada was fresh and the tacos were bigger than expected. I loved the side of beans and rice. Got the most out of my money here. :)
