I've been here around five time or so and never had a bad experience.  The service and food have always been consistent.  Love the shrimp (the best), steak, and lobster tacos.  Lots of complaints here due to small portions, but usually the four tacos you get per order are enough to fill you up.  Don't expect buch of sour cream, lettuce, and whatever else you get at a typical Mexican chain restaurant.  This is a hip place and the food and drinks are reflective of that.  Not super fancy, but still a fun and cool place for great flavors.  Lucky for us, they're opening one at the Green Valley Ranch this spring.  Can't wait.
