Been going here since the Change from Armando Brothers as that place is HORRIBLE  !! Hands down Way better now! I get the shredded beef tacos almost every morning, in fact I turned my whole office on to this place and they all go there now.

Good pricing, huge burritos, VERY friendly staff, and a willingness to substitute and flexibility to make the customer happy. If you have a couple bucks and are in the area give this place a shot. I personally love the tacos with red sauce! 

5 stars cause I do do anything halfassed
