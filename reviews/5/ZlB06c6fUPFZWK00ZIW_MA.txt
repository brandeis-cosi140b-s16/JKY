Good: If you want flavorful family made food that is a mix of asian and mexican at a low price then you have found your restaurant! I love to come here about once a month and everytime I am fully satisfied with the food and the great customer service. The family who owns the restaurant is very friendly and cares about their customers.

Bad: Can get busy at times (especially around lunch time) but what do you expect when the food is so good? I also wish they added desserts to their menu!!
