A rare thing in Las Vegas these days: A bargain. Business takes me to the Mandalay Bay convention center often, and the Border Grill is one of the few celebrity restaurants here (featuring two Top Chef alumni) that provides consistent quality at a price that doesn't send your jaw dropping to the table when the bill arrives. Fresh, refined Mexican cuisine, with familiar items for the less adventurous and plenty of intrigue for foodie types. Also a great bar with fantastic sangria.
