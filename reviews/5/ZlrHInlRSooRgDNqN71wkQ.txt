KISS- Keep It Simple, Stupid.

This applies to a lot of things- apparently food can definitely be one of those things. Just three things on the menu makes things uncomplicated- but you really can't go wrong. With the prices being so affordable, we tried all three, and were happy with everything. The topping bar made it easy to customize, and the service was fast and friendly. 

So I'll state the obvious, yes- it's in the hood. Well, get over it. It's worth the drive into the cuts and nobody tried to mug us (even though we parked in the porno store parking lot). 

My *only* wish would be for some chicken to go with that first rate beef for those of us who only eat beef on a rare occasion, but I can't really complain. They do what they do and they do it well. Thanks Tacos Sonora Grill!
