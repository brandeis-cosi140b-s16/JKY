If you're looking for authentic Mexican food it's probably not the best spot but they have amazing lobster tacos. I'm seriously giving this place 5 stars because our waitress Christina was the best, she has such a great vibe which made this place such a good experience. Thank you Christina for such great service! Btw...Their drinks are pretty great, they have a full bar.
