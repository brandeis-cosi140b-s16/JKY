Very good food,,,, and lovely service. The owner is super cool comes up and is very friendly so does the main chef which you don't see much anymore. The only thing that will go negatively against this place is the location. Next to the Gentlemen s club on industrial road is not the best place.  Other than that once you walk in it is super classy. The food is ORGANIC and the prices are great.
