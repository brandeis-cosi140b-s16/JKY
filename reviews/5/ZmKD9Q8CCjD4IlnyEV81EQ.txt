We walked in and we were immediately greeted by the general manager. He was excited about their new appetizers as a happy hour special. He mentioned that they had live music, too. We decided to try the Guac-a-dilla as a starter. Both girls wanted the black bean tostadas. I reminded them that was a Saturday special. The manager said that he could talk them in to making it. I ordered the Pollo Diablo as a burrito and the Jerk Chicken as a quesadilla.  BOTH EXCELLENT! It came with black beans and rice. The black beans are creamy, a little sweet, and just enough back heat! Topped off with the best snicker doodles in town! If you haven't been, you gotta get to this place!
