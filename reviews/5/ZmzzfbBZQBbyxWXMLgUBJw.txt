Having lived in San Diego for awhile, I know all about the "Bertos".

There's a billion of these types of Mexican food places in San Diego: Adalberto's, Himiberto's, Wookieeberto's, Ernie and Berto's....

Okay, so the last two I made up, but there's still a billion Berto's variants in San Diego.

"But what about my experience in Vegas", you ask?  I'm getting to that.  After a night of drinking, I stopped by Roberto's in the Sinclair gas station.

It's the same stuff.  The same blessed stuff as I'd find in San Diego.  And the rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole are just as good.

So is this food merely tasty only with the extra alcoholic kick?  I couldn't help myself.  After being reminded about how enjoyable the flavor was, I went back without drinkage, and still just as good.

The food is value priced, tasty, and consistently dependable, right down to the little salsa bar.  It's not gas station fare.  It just happens to be located inside the gas station.  Don't let the setting scare you off.

It's not life changing, but it is good fast food, and a nice continuations of one of my old late-night traditions that has carried over to my new hometown.

But after a late night of socializing, there's not much better that hits the spot.
