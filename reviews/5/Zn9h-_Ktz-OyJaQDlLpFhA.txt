FINALLY! Best Burrito in Madison. The midwest is sloooooowly (painfully slow) catching up to the west coast and understanding the importance of the 6th food group, Burritos. Carnitas with all the helpings, extra spicy onions and salsa verde on the side is my go to. The tortilla is right, the meat, bean and rice ratio is right, the condiment distribution is right and the roll is right. Its cheap, fast, delicious and the owners/workers are super nice. We need 8 more places like this spread throughout madison and a truck for late night.  Also putting chile verde on the menu would make my year lol.
