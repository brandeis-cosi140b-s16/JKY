Me and my girlfriend had a group on for this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  It was about 10 at night and I ordered the Mexican pizza.  I can honestly say that I had a good experience and the waitress was awesome.  Her name was Imelda.  My drink never got below the halfway mark and she was there on point.  The music was a little loud but it was tolerable.  I would definitely eat here again.
