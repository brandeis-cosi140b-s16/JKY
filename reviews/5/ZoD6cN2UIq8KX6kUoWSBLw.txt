This place is legit. I grew up in LA and this place makes the closest thing to what I get in Cali. 
The Nachos: they make it right, no fancy melted shredded cheese, they use the melted, runny oh soo good glowing orange cheese sauce. 
The Tacos: Carne Asada is done right, good flavor and nice texture, they chopped it up in small bits so they are easy to eat. 
I live across town and still drive out here cause it is that good.
