This is a family favorite! We have been coming here for the past 15 years and it's our favorite place to bring people from out of town when they want an authentic dish. The new places popping up around downtown Gilbert, though trendy, can't hold a flame to this place. The food is delicious! Their Gordo Burritos are only $6 and they are HUGE. My teenage son loves them. It's a family owned establishment and that's hard to come by these days.  I absolutely love their homemade Horchata, no mixes here! There is a reason Lulu's has been around for almost 25 years, trust me, it's delicious.
