The nachos are life changing.  We live down the street and have started ordering here at least once a week because we just can't resist real food that is so delicious and fresh tasting.  The California burrito (with guac & fries) is really memorable for its flavor and texture.  The meat is savory and crunchy, the guac is generous and creamy, and the fries and fresh pico de gallo make it so fun.  You won't regret grabbing dinner here - unless you want to avoid getting addicted to good Mexican food.
