This place has the best enchiladas in town. From their cheese enchiladas to their spinach enchiladas to their machaca enchiladas they beat all. They have a great cheese dip or queso dip.... They also have a machaca chimi that is not on the menu but you can order it. It Has a brown jalape√±o gravy that has a great flavor.... Then for desert I recommend the fried ice cream... The best !!!!!! Their salsa and hot sauce are very good as well.... A must try!!!
