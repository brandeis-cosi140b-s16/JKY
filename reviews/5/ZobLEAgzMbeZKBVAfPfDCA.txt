I started writing this review about 20 minutes into my visit. Came here for happy hour and was pleased to find great value for the drinks. The service was friendly and knowledgable. I had a Jamaica Margarita, which was very tasty. Their salsa is fantastic. Would definitely go again! 

...Again, did I mention the salsa??

For food, I tried the chile relleno and chicken nachos off of the HH menu. Again, was very impressed. Really great, authentic Mexican food. Seriously,  I was super happy I stopped by.
