I've been to several wanna be authentic Mexican  restaurants here in Pittsburgh.  So my husband and I were kinda hesitant to stop at Cocina Mendoza, but it was a really nice surprise! ! 
Cocina Mendoza has really good Mexican beer   
( micheladas), and real Mexican food !!
My husband had the carnitas plate & he was very happy. 
We really enjoyed the food & the service. 
Very nice, humble,  attentive and CLEAN! 
we will be back soon!!
