Having lived 6 (long) years in El Paso, we've been disappointed by most of the Mexican restaurants here in Scottsdale...until now!  This place is the real deal...everything homemade, with great service and fantastic food.  We started with delicious homemade tomatillo salsa, followed by the best chile rellenos I've had in town.  Chilaquiles were fantastic as well! Great value for quality...can't wait to be back!!!
