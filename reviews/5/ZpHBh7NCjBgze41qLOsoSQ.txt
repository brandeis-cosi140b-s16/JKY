If you are into Chipotle, this place is a close relative, right down to the looks of the menu up top when you walk in!  Though, it is a bit cheaper, and has cheap ($2) beer selections!

I went here upon the praise from my boyfriend....he seems to really love it, and he wanted me to check it out because of my love for this kind of food.

The one thing I really loved about this place is that they have fish as an option!  I asked, it's Tilapia.  And tasty!  I had a salad topped with Tilapia, tomatoes, olives and both their medium and hot salsa.  The guy who prepared my meal warned that the hot was REALLY hot....I don't exactly agree, but I prefer my food realllllly hot.  The addition of jalepenos on my salad would've been nice!

My guy loves the tacos....that's his go to.  And says they have $1 tacos after 4pm.  They just had a Groupon as well.  For $20 we got 6 tacos, a salad and a drink.  

If you like quick (and cheap) Mexican, check it out!
