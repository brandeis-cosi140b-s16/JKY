I went here last weekend & tried their Cecina A La Tampiqueña. It's a thin seared seasoned sirloin with sautéed mushrooms & bacon & Mexican cheese with chilies, onions & red enchilada sauce WITH a side of beans & rice, whew! I thought it'd be weird because of the bacon/cheese BUT OMG sooo good! The sirloin, though thin,  was very flavorful & the chilies gave it a kick! The rice was traditional Mexican rice & the beans pinto but they were seasoned well. It could be I LOVE me some Mexican food or it could be that my waitress was such a sweetheart but I will def be back next month for my bday. I hear they have a tequila club (hmmm lol) as well as karaoke on Saturday for those of us that are brave lol, whatever the case I'm a fan :-)
