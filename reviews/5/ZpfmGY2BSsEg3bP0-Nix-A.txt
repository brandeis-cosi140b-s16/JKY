As a semi-regular of the location in Elizabeth near my home, I was very happy to see another one open closer to my work. Although with traffic on Independence, the one in Elizabeth wouldn't take much longer to get to. This place is brand spanking new and was nearly spotless. 

The staff was extremely friendly, including the manager who stopped at my table twice to make sure everything was good. The nachos I ordered were HUGE. I would say they were piled high to almost the height of a basketball. And at $6.95 including protein, they were a a steal - had enough to take home for a second meal. 

There's the reliable salsa bar with several good choices and my favorite which has pineapple in it. They don't have alcohol yet, but the craft beer and cocktails should make an excellent addition when available for those that go at night. 

The other positive was the kitchen is a little more closed, so you don't end up smelling like tacos the rest of the day. Look forward to visiting again soon, when I feel brave enough to take on Union Co. Traffic.
