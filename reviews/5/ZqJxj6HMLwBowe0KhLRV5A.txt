I've been so disappointed by the past few Mexican restaurants I was starting to feel like maybe my tastes had changed.  Well y tastes hadn't changed, i was just eating a lot of crappy Mexican until I found this place.  
My car dealer is down the road and I didn't want to wait there for service and then I found this place while walking by.  

The chips are perfect.  Crispy, but still a bit of firmness to scoop up salsa.  The salsa has cilantro which I love.  If you think cilantro tastes like soap (it's genetic) I have no time for you.

i ordered the mole poblano (chicken mole).  The chicken fresh, not like it had been cooked hours ago and dipped in mole at the last minute.  

The decor is clean and bright.  

I wouldn't even say I liked it because they Americanized it.  I think it's pretty authentic since I'm the only one in here who speaks English as a first language

This place is great!
