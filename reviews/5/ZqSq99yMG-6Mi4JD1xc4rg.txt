Fellow green chili lovers unite!  Just tried the green chicken burrito here...delicious!  Just a little heat on mouth watering green chili flavor - muy bien!  

I watched their service line for an hour.  Man, did they keep it moving!  Yet, still made everybody's just the way they wanted.  Obviously, a lot of regulars here, and for good reason.

Gotta love these little hole-in-the-wall diamonds.  

Will bring my hungry teenagers here next time they ask for Chipotle.  Much better!  And small local business.

Make sure to get your frequent guest card because you'll be back.
