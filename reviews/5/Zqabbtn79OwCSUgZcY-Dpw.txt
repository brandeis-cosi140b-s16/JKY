I recently returned to the valley and found this gem in my old neighborhood. 
Every dish my wife and I have tried has been great. Excellent spicy salsa! Love the ceviche appetizer and seafood entrees too.  
Clean, bright and cheerful d√©cor combined with a great serve staff make this my go to Mexican restaurant.
