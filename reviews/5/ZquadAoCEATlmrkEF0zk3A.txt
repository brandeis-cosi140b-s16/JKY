Fliccas bar is a fun place to go. They  have live band and/or a  DJ playing all kinds of good tunes all night long. Great buffet during happy hour(On Fridays) and a great menu of good baja/Mexican food. The drinks are a good price too!!! Pool tables  and an out side patio that will blow you away. There is a lot of fun people;lots of good-looking females :) ...and they're friendly too.
So I give it 5 STARS for sure.   Flickas!!!
