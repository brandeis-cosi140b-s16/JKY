I'm going to go ahead and rate this like the FAST FOOD restaurant that it is. The food is good as far as fast-food goes, and I have always had a great experience with the staff (even on my 3am trips). Regarding the getting sick thing, personally most fast food leaves me spending more time in the bathroom than normal, so I cannot comment on that. 

I would recommend it if you are looking for fastfood, but it is fast-food.
