Happened to be in Tolleson today at lunch time and decided to give Tamales Guadalajara a try.  I definitely was not disappointed.  I ordered my favorite plate - a green chili pork burrito, enchilada style with sides of rice and beans.  The green chili was spiced just right and I love the fact that the burro was made with fresh tortillas and had cilantro and fresh onion in it!  It was wonderful!  The portions were so large, that I took over half the meal home for dinner.  My 1-year-old granddaughter loved the refries - she ate them all!  I'm an Arizona girl and love my Mexican food.  This is a restaurant that I would definitely go back to!
