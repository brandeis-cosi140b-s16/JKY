Okay i intern next door and showed up real early to my meeting and was hungry so i decided to walk on over there and grab a bite.

WOW so worth it! the owners are sooo friendly and were talking to me about how everything is made fresh and "all natural, no msg". They also gave me horchata "rice water" which was a homemade recipe and amazingly delicious. I hate horchata normally but this one i could drink all day! 

To be honest i am glad i stopped and finally found phoenix's good and authentic mexican food. (it isn't good if it isn't authentic).

oh yeah, i got the breakfast burro cause i was itching for some eggs this morning...i am pretty sure i found the place i want to try menudo at..

I am going to be back... A LOT
