Don't judge a book by its cover! 
This taco shop is located in a questionable area but it's truly a gem and easily the best taco shop I've been too! 
EVERYTHING is fresh and absolutely delicious! 
My family and I tried everything except for the vampiros. The meat was so juicy and tasty and the homemade tortillas were stellar. 
The service was great! A definite place to swing by if you're in Phoenix!
