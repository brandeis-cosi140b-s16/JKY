I really think that Baja Fresh has got it going on.
Every time I have ever gone to one any where,I am always impressed with the food. 
The condiments are always fresh and good, you can package it up to have as much as you like. 
Everything is cooked fresh while you are there, and I have to say it is really very good.
I have tried several locations and love them all. Staff is great, the place is always clean. 
You get a lot of food for your money.
Plus they do coupons a lot. Sign up on line at their website and they send them out all the time. Gotta love this place.
