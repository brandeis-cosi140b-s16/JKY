Everytime I visit Arizona, I have to eat here!!!! Their machaca beef chimichangas are excellent! Top it off with their margaritas is even better.  Their free salsa and chips are so good too! Their prices are inexpensive and their servings are humungous! You can't go wrong here. Great family atmosphere. I wish they can deliver to me in Los Angeles lol.
