This was the first meal we enjoyed when moving to Arizona and it really sealed the deal. The food was incredible. The best Mexican my party had ever had. I enjoyed the signature dish as recommendation of the waitress and was extremely pleased. The guac was out of this world. You couldn't be disappointed coming here. Must visit.
