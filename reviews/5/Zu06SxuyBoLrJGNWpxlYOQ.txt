I have been eating at Little Sombrero since high school and the food is delicious. This place has been using the same proven recipes for over 40 years. For those who have eatin here know how delicious the Mexican food is, from the bean burrito enchilada style to the green chili chicken enchiladas and everything in between but I want to talk about my meal today. I ordered the double cheeseburger and a side of onion rings, I know a burger from a Mexican restaurant but let me just say "Wow" the best burgers in town handsdown. The bun is perfectly toasted the patties meaty and juicy and the crisp lettuce, onion and tomato made this burger package a top old fashion homestyle burger. I know it may be hard to pass on the Mexican food and order a burger but if you haven't tried the American side of the menu I challenge you to try it!! Viva Little Sombrero!!
