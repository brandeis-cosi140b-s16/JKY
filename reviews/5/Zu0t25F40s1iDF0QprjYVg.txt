It has taken me way too long, as in forever, to finally dine at Barrio Cafe.  Our lunch visit with another couple yesterday (Saturday 1:00 for reference) was outstanding.  Service was impeccable, staff 100% friendly, decor intriguing both inside and out, and most importantly, THE FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE.  This is not your average Mexican-food joint.  Menu is really unlike anything I have ever experienced.  Everything on the table, from the guac to the esquites to the pork to the salad to the mole...supremely satisfying and even better, exciting.  

My only regret?  Seeing Chef Silvana hanging out there as we were leaving, and me acting like a starstruck tongue-tied nerd, trying to express myself in front of this talented Phoenix culinary rock-star celebrity.  She and all of her locations and creations are a Phoenix Point of Pride.  Just wish I could have expressed myself better to her face...

Run, don't walk, to Barrio Cafe.
