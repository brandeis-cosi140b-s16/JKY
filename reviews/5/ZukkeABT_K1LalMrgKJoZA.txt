I've tried many of Mexican places in my day and this place is surely the best I've found I'm Charlotte thus far!  Their green chile sauce is amazing!  I went in with a group of 5, 3 being newbies and they all replicated my order and cleaned their plates!  (Green Chile Enchiladas, substitute flour tortillas vs. the corn)  Ironically I ran into some other first timer friends there and they also left with a full stomach and empty plate. This isn't a Tex-Mex high dollar place... This is an authentic place that gets it amazing at a good price!  

Their .99 2-5 pm tacos during the week are also a steal!
