La Condesa is without a doubt one of the best Mexican establishments in all of Phoenix.  Their salsa bar is one of our favorite parts, with so many unique flavors to choose from and each one is delicious.  We have had everything from their tacos, burritos and quesadillas and all have been a hit and would certainly order again.  Besides the fact that the food is wonderful - so are the staff.  They are very efficient and easy-going.  They have great recommendations and work very hard.
