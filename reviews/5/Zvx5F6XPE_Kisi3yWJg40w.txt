To have the ability to accommodate a 35 person reservation on a Friday evening is to go above and beyond in their ability to provide good service. We had 2 servers who worked VERY hard to keep our drinks full. Our food was served hot, on time, and the could not have been better. 

Our fajitas were DELISH--to the point where all of our first timers in the group said they will DEFINITELY be back.  

Thank you Fajitas for going above and beyond!
