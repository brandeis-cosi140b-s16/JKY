I like that this one does load up on the food because the one at west gate skimps on all the food and I feel ripped off. When I got to the cashier I asked if they had military discount and he said no I'm sorry but thank you for your service. Then at the end of my transaction he put a cup and chips in my bag and said "drinks and chips on me because I really appreciate what you do." I just thought that is awesome customer service. I didn't expect it and was very thankful!
