I cannot believe I am giving Dos Gringos 5 Stars, but you better believe I am. Why, you ask, is this Cenpho junkie giving an EXTREMELY Tempe bar five stars? 

1. The one and only fight I have ever been in took place here. (yes, I won) 
2. I got trashed the other night for $5. 
3. You are inside and outside at exactly the same time. 
4. They have ample bathroom stalls in the women's restroom. 
5. There are bowls of limes on the counters. I hate asking for lime. 
6. I get hit on at least three times before I finish my first drink. 
7. They have live music. 
8. You can get molested in public without being arrested 
9. I always get carded.
