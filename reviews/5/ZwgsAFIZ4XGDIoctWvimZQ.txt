It's a chain, but it's cool. The staff at the South Blvd location are funny and outgoing. They make standing in line for 5 minutes fun if that's possible. Barbacoa beef is awesome and it's my only choice when I go there. Add a little cilantro rice, pinto beans, cheese, corn & tomato salsa and a dash of sour cream...heaven! The size of the burrito is well worth the $6.25! 

Dear Chiplote...I'll see you again soon!
