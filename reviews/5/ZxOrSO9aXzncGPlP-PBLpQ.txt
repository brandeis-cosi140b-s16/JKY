Stumbled upon this by accident, we were going to Z Chicken across the street not knowing that Z Chicken is closed on Tuesdays.  BF was hungry so we stopped here.  We both love Mexican food:  he is Hispanic, I lived in Mexico for over a year so especially he can be picky about the food.  I learned  how to cook chile rellenos in Mexico and mine are pretty good but the plate he got at Super B was almost as good as mine.  He loved it that the beans were not refried, they were whole pintos like frijoles de olla, and the 2 fat chiles were made with pasilla chiles.  I tried a bite and I liked them a lot!  I had a breakfast burrito with bacon and it was pretty darn good.  The salsas are made in house, the bf who drinks hot sauce like juice said the red was pretty spicy and the green I tried was flavorful but not spicy.  The food was plentiful, service was fantastic, lots of seating, very clean!!  We enjoyed our meal here and will definitely be coming back to try other dishes!!
