Espos is a taste of Mexico without the danger of Mexico ;)
I've been eating here for a long time and really glad they have opened back up. I've pretty much eaten all the different items on the menu. I don't think they got their beer license back yet or I missed that on the menu. Don't let the look of the restaurant fool you. The food is better then fancy Mexican food places. The portions are really huge so it's easy to over order. I usually split something and add a cheese crisp or something with my fiance. The employees are always beyond friendly too. Restroom is out back in a separate building. Kind of weird but it looks clean so don't freak out. 
Enjoy.
