By the reviews, I would more than likely never would of come here. But I was visting my best friend and his wife. And this is where they go every Friday for happy hour. Maybe because they are regulars, they get treated better, I don't know.  But our server was on point all night.
The beers never got empty, I don't drink much, I only had 3 beers. The beers only came to $ 11.00. 
His friends food, looked really good,  I believe a steak quesadilla.
I meet 2 of the owners, they seemed very nice. 
I really like when harley riders and those people in cages (vehicles) can be in the same bar.
It was a great night, always is, when with my best friend.
