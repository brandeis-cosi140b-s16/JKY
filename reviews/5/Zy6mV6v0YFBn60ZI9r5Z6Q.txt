We were just driving around trying to find good Mexican food and decided to stop here, the food was very good! We wanted to try a few different things so we had Carne Asada tacos, Carnitas Tacos, Carne Asada Sope and a Al Pastor Sope. Also my husband tried a Carne Asada Torta and everything was So good. We can't wait to come back.
