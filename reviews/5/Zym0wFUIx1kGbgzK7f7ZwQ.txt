The gorditas are awesome :)  I've tried the asada ones and the carnitas both were amazing! The quesadillas are big and also very good.  I tried the hard shell tacos and honestly I wouldn't try them again... Only one side of each tacos was hard :( the other side was soggy.  The teenage girl that works there is always friendly and good with getting the orders right but the past 2 times I've gone she wasn't there and my orders were wrong :/   I love the menudo on the weekends!! The salsa I'll give that a 2 out of 5 stars.  You must try this place if you're looking for real Mexican food.  First place that has authentic Mexican food out of the 10+ places I've tried based off of yelp reviews.  Its a diamond in the rough. Ohhh and before you go be sure to check their hours! Some days they close super early. Btw the only thing carolinas has better then this place is the hard tacos..  Not many people are use to real Mexican food and for those people maybe Carolinas, taco bell and del taco might be better...  This place works with the flavors of the meats and ingredients ^_^ not fake or processed food.
