I've been to Sal's five times and have yet to be disappointed. I follow their Instagram pretty religiously and marvel over their seasonal specials. It might be a problem, but when you try Sal's, you'll understand.

I've started out with the burrata every single time and can't shake it. It's probably my favorite dish in Madison. Everything about it screams fresh. The cheese is homemade, and they pepper the plate with roasted garlic and seasonal goods. My favorite burrata plate had picked radishes and asparagus. Killer.

I've had a variety of pizzas there. The daily specials and the pies listed in the menu are always amazing, but I highly suggest building your own tomato pie. The sauce is out of this world, and most of their daily specials skimp on the red sauce to highlight seasonal ingredients. You can choose from traditional toppings like basil and roasted red peppers to quirkier ingredients like mango and figs. The meat and cheese selection is killer, and I'd recommend putting either the beet or japaleno pesto on yours. Both are unbelievable. In fact, this ENTIRE PLACE is unbelievable.

My only critique about Sal's is that it is way too small and the one time I ordered a taco, the fried alligator(!!!!!) was a little too greasy. I can't NOT give this place five stars, though. This is an irreplaceable spot in Madison.
