I haven't been here in almost 8 years. 8 years! I recently moved back to the area and thought I'd make another visit. I am so glad that I did, because I remembered why I used to come here 8 years ago.

The staff is very friendly. Brought my mom in and we were seated immediately despite a busy lunch crowd. We were presented with chips with salsa and refried beans. The chips are round and oversized and very good. We almost ate them all before we could order! Had to slow down to save room for the main course.

I ordered the grilled vegetable burrito and mom ordered the shredded beef taco salad. The grilled veggie burrito? OMG was is it good! I believe this is what I ordered 8 years ago and absolutely loved! Mom was a huge fan of her taco salad as well. The portions are so oversized that it's impossible to complete. That's never a bad thing, especially when you can take home leftovers.

I wil most definitely make certain that it will not be another 8 years before I come back to this place. This is by far the best Mexican food I've had in a long while, and I've tried a few of the other big names and Ma and Pop spots. I highly recommend you give it a shot. You'll be surprised!
