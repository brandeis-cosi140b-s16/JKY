I've been here once and the food is pretty good.  We got 3 different burritos.  My husband didn't want anything, so the kids and I cut the burritos into 3 and I got to taste each burrito.

Each were really yummy.  I think one was a chili relleno, another carne asada, and chorizo and egg.  Each burrito was $4.95.  They weren't gigantic burritos like Filiberto's, but they were a good size.  

It took them awhile to make them, but well worth the wait.  The place was nice and clean and no real issues.
