I've been here many times and have yet to be disappointed! My boyfriend and I love this place because of their delicious tortas. They have variety for different types of sandwiches. They also serve ice cream and tasty fruit juices. 

If you're looking for an inexpensive place to get your torta fix, I recommend this place!
