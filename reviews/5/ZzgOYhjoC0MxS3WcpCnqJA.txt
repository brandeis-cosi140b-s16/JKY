I've been a fan of the chicken tacos, the side salad with cilantro dressing, and the chips and salsa bar.  It all changed today when I ordered the shrimp and avacado quesadilla...  Oh man, was that tasty!  I loved it...perfect little grilled tortilla with goodness packed inside...The shrimps are good sized and grilled...delicious!  I'm going back tomorrow for more!
