Thrilled that this place is now at Pavilions.  It is not only convenient, but extremely cheap and quick.  The food is fresh, and the portions are huge.  I was always scared of this type of place but am now a fan.  My only complaint is the drive thru is slow, but the service inside is fine.  Have actually found myself eating here weekly...
