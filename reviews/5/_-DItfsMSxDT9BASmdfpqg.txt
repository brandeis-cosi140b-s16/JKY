Black Chile...I'm a fan! Service was great! Food was amazing!!

Have a friend that eats there religiously and he recommend the burger; said it's way better than Zinburger. Our waiter recommended the fish tacos. So glad he did!  I have had fish tacos from probably more than 100 restaurants and Black Chile hands down THE BEST! I read the review from the pregnant yelp junkie below who didn't like them. I think after the hormones settle she should take another crack at them. My wife thought pickles tasted good in ice-cream when she was pregnant. Anyways....

Go eat there. Have the fish tacos!

Almost forgot. They carry every Tequila known to exist on earth! Next time I go, it will be on a day that I don't have to worry about a hangover the next morning.

Yelp should add a 6th star for this place!
