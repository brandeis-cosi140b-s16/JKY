If you enjoy freshly made burritos this is the spot.  Every burrito is made from scratch including the tortilla that they roll and cook right in front of you.  Since they have opened I've tried the Chorizo & Hash, Bacon & Hash, Breakfast Barbacoa, Bean & Cheese, Chipotle Pulled Pork, Chile Verde, RCB, Mole and the "the Dan" Double H Carne Asada. I am partial to "the Dan" as traditionally I am a Carne Asada fan but my favorites have been the Chile Verde for the lunch option and the Chorizo & Hash for the breakfast option but you can't go wrong with any of them.  I was also surprised with the amazing flavor of the Chipotle Pulled Pork and the Chicken Mole.

The owners are amazing people and they truly understand what fresh, homemade, delicious food is all about!
