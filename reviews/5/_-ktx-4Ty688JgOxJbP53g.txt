Yelpers looking for a cozy Mexican restaurant should add this establishment to their list of go to places.  It's a new restaurant located just off Tropicana Ave by the airport.  Tons of parking, and easy access. 

We made a reservation on Yelp for a party of 6, and upon arrival they had our table ready and waiting.  Our party was running late so I took the liberty of having a few cocktails in the Loung Area which is just off to the side of the restaurant.  They have a few gaming machines to keep you occupied.  Very clasy looking bar with a friendly bartender. 

After being seated the service was prompt and attentive, drinks and the food came out quickly.  We tried the guacamole that's made table side, success!  Taste was right on. 

I had a steak dish with some sweet potato fries, the steak was a little dry for my liking so I asked for some cilantro butter and that pairing was delicious.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.

We had Caramel Flan, and a few other things for desert. The Caramel Flan was AMAZING. So perfect, didn't leave that nasty bitter after taste you usually get. 
The manager and owner greeted our table with warm smiles and a sincere thanks for being among the first customers.  The bill was reasonable for a party of 6. 

If your looking for an elegant Mexican food experience, off the strip, somewhere you can go and converse without tons of noise and distraction then this is your place.
