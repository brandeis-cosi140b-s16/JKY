Whever I feel the need to gorge myself with the most stomach-twirling food, I head down to good ol' Roberto's! Not just any Roberto's, it has to be the one on Eastern only. Only here do they really know how to make a great steak enchilada or burrito at four in the morning. Apparently this isn't a secret though, because everytime I arrive, fully hungry (and fully loaded) there is always a wait...but hey, it's a small price to pay for perfection.
