Love this place. Whenever I go to Vegas, I'm prepped to drop a couple hundo at whatever, no expenses are spared when it comes to fun. But this shining jewel on the strip is where I can get a great meal at a fantastic price.

Tacos are $2 or $3 each! Tons of meat choices: carne asada, chicken, lengua, shoulder, etc. They make them right in front of you so it's nice and hot. 

There are canopies outside for you to sit which are a godsend considering you're in the middle of the desert and it gets toasty. 

This place is a bit far from the Cosmo, Caesar's, and the like. Closer to Circus Circus but if you're itching to save some bucks on your food, then there's no better place.
