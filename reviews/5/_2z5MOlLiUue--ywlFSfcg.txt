My fiance had been on the road all day, by the time we booked a hotel and made it to La Poblanita it was already past 9pm. When we arrived the restaurant was empty, but Raoul had an energetic welcome for us and made us feel welcome. He excitedly went over their specials and we were happy to have him as our server. He even showed us this cool decorative trick that you can do with the paper from a straw. He even took a couple photos for us. Thanks Raoul!
The food was the most authentic Mexican I have had in a long time, since being in Miami I guess. 
Chips, Guacamole, Salsa, ALL ON POINT! My fiance enjoyed her huge margarita, To be honest I cant remember the names of our Entrees, but i ASSURE you!!! all the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. A picture speaks a thousand words, so you can check out the photos I post of our meals. 
I also appreciated that the portion sizes weren't ridiculous. Some places act like you need to always serve 1lb rice and beans with every plate. Quality trumps quantity!
