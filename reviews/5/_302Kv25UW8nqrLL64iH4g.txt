My husband and I were ecstatic (no understatement) when we found they'd reopened!  I feel like we're coming home when we're greeted with a smile, handshake, and a heartfelt "welcome back!".  The service is great and the food is even better than before!  No other Mexican restaurant can compare to my experience at Viva Mercados.
