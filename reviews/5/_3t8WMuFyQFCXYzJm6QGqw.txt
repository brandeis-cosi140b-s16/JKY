#currently sitting at the bar. A little skeptical about this place being all organic and GMO free. I'm all about the movement so I was a little scared. Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever eaten! Chips and salsa to start and you can taste the natural. The queso fundido was so fresh I have no words! We shared a carnitas taco plate and it was amazing! I've never been a fan of flan but Chef Paco brought one out for us and let me tell you not only can he sing but he makes a mean flan. A MEAN FLAN! This is definitely a place for all! I can't wait for my next visit! Excuse me there is one more carnitas taco and she's looking at me weird. I gotta handle my business!
