Los Burritos has excellent Mexican food. It's authentic, great tasting, and at a reasonable price. 

This family run businesses will deliver tasty food every time without fail. So far I've ordered the burrito de carne asada and the burrito de pollo, each have been great! Just realize that they typically come with rice and beans in them, ask if you don't want them added in there . 

They definitely take pride in the place, it's nice to see pictures of the family inside the restaurant itself. Definitely recommend this place!
