Where else can you order brains? Delicious. Tripe was delicious!

Come on it was beautiful, textural heaven in my mouth. I watched a video on youtube about labiaplasty (come on we all end up on parts of youtube where we ask ourselves, "How did I get here?") had the tripe and it was nice. If it was chewy it would be hard to eat after watching labiaplasty, I'm just saying.
