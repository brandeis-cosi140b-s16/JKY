I told the guy at the drive-through window that this place will get a 5-star review so this is to keep my promise. This place saved my friends and I from the brink of starvation after eating micro-meals at a different local Italian restaurant. Fast service, got the order right, right down to the sauces. I love you Taco Bell!
