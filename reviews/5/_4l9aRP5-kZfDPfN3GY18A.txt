Dick's is as good as it gets for breakfast, brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner, or reverse happy hour.. Basically, for everything!

The Bloody Marys are made in house, and the homemade red chile is definitely a part of it, as they are SPICY! Not really into bloody's, but still want to try one? Get it in a short glass, that way the vodka:mix ratio is better and you can still enjoy a yummy drink! Wine, mimosas and bloodys are $5 until 5:30 every single day, and man can they add up! It is just so intimate and cozy, you never want to leave the place!

My favorite dish for brunch is the Richardon's Combo, which consists of a pork benedict, asparagus and two chicken enchiladas. I like to swap my enchiladas out for turkey or shrimp, but they're all yummy! For dinner I either go with the Pinenut Crusted Seabass (seasonal) or the Dick's Surf & Turf. The Surf & Turf is a 6oz filet topped with 2 bacon wrapped shrimp alongside chorizo and bean flat enchiladas. SO GOOD. If I wasn't on a juice cleanse right now, I would have already called in my order to go. 

The only dessert option is flan, and.. well.. its flan. I don't know, you be the judge!

FYI- It is called Dick's Hideaway because it is HIDDEN. It is located on the northwest corner of 16th street and Bethany Home Road, inbetween the hardware store and Lucy's. It does not have a sign. Please, please, do not read this review and then call the restaurant to ask where they are located. These are ample directions!
