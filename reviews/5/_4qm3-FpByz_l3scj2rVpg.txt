I think I just died and went to Chinese food heaven...or maybe it's Mexican food heaven...nope, it's snicker doodle cookie heaven. Not one complaint about Chino Bandido, great service and amazing food. The chile rellano is like nothing I've eaten before, whatever the coating they use, I want to bathe in it. I'm really not one for fried or extra cheese, but that is exactly what it is and I would eat it again and again and probably again. The only difficulty here: getting up to leave, now that is one full stomach.
