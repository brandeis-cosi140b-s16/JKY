I have been here several times and it never disappoints. Service is always fast and friendly. The two salsas they serve taste very fresh. The burrito California with chicken is incredible and the portions for every entree are very generous. Although I am fairly new to Charlotte I have been convinced that this is one of the top Mexican restaurants in the city.
