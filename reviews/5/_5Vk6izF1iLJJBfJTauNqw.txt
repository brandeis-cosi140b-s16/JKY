Amigos has some really delicious food! They have a friendly staff and have a variety of food you can choose from.

Their food is really delicious and I'm not going to say that it is super healthy but you can edit your order to make it healthier if you would like. Their california burrito is really delicious as well has their tacos and other burritos, especially their breakfast burrito. 

Highly recommended!
