It's been a year since I have been in and was stoked too see that our favorite bartender is still working here! Last night we gathered for a retirement party and Ashley took wonderful care of us! Have great bands here and makes any happy hour Friday enjoyable! Ashley gave us samples of the confession and we loved them so ended up drinking the night away with those! Thanks saltys staff for making our night memorable!
