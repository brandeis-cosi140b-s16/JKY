Finally good Mexican food inTempe! The best meats I've had since I left Texas. They smoke all their own meats, it was amazing. We will defiantly be back often! Marinated chicken tacos and carnitas were divine  very attentive owners as well and wait for it.... It's BYOB and right next to a liquor store.
