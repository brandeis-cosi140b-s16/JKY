I had an outstanding first experience here this past Monday, partly due to the fact that it was "Free Fry Monday" where you get free fries with any burger purchase before 3pm.  Since they took care of the fries, I opted to add the Niman's Ranch bacon to my burger, and forego a delicious looking milk shake... this trip.  I learned that they have a gluten-free bun option which is a pleasant surprise for an in-and-out style burger and will try it on my next trip.  The staff was extremely pleasant - welcoming on my first visit and I'm pretty sure every single staff member asked me what I thought and they even addressed me by my name.  I highly recommend this place and will be back!
