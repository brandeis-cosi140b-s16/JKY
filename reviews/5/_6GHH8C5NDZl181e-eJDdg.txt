Me being Mexican... I am very picky when I go out to mexican food places. I came here on a date and must say I was pretty impressed. To start we just had some good ol' ch chips and salsa. They gave us two different kinds of salsa a green and red. They were both really good. For dinner I ordered the carnitas plate... Basically pulled pork Mexican style.  OMG.... They were so good! They tasted like the real deal. Definitely going to go back and try other items on the menu . I'm giving 5 stars just because my dish was as close to authentic as you can get!
