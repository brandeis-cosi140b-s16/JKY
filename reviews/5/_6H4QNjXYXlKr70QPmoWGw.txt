I cannot stress enough how amazing this place is. The spicy pork taco was our absolute favorite, and when I say favorite, I mean we stayed in Vegas for four full days and went to this hole in the wall place four separate times for their tacos. We had dinner at really nice places and paid $200 for our meal, and this place outshines all other food on the strip at $2 a taco. I mean it. Go here. I am never going to be happy with another taco once I leave here. Absolutely amazing.
