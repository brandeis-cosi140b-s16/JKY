Best Mexican restaurant on the West side.

Excellent combination of taste, service and atmosphere. I tried the Carne Asada Steak Chimi and their spicy salsa was to die for. You must ask for it though!

The staff is extremely courteous and small details like keeping my glass full of water at all times really impressed me.

Live Music by Toto was really pleasant while we had our dinner. We were told that he is there every Tuesday for their taco Tues. What more can I say....love the colored chips, I think it was very festive and flows with the Mexican them. There house salsa was perfectly balance.
