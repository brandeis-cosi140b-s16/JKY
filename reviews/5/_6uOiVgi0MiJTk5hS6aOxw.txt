Previous reviews from other Yelpers did not disappoint!!! This place is awesome! To begin I am an avid promoter for non gmo foods and I have been looking for a great restaurant here in Vegas forever and I believe I have find it! 

The food here is clean and amazing!  The flan is to die for! On top of good food the service is great! Kai, Roman and Chef Paco took care of us from start to finish! I give this place two thumbs up and a round of applause! Great job Eldorado Cantina we will be back!
