if i could give more stars, i would! Mex is a family favorite for us... this place was recommended to us while we were here for our fist vaca in AZ. i thought we were lost because we drove through a neighborhood to get there, but sure glad we made it! This is definitely the spot if you like your food SPICY/HOT! and if you don't like too much fire, there is plenty of other items to choose also, i did. we only like to try off the "chain" type places, and like to get as many different ones in.. this one had us reeled in 2 or 3 times in our one stay... we couldn't stay away! the prickly pear margaritas is a a flavor we haven't come across anywhere else since... they were the best I've had... and for dessert... SOPPAPIA's all the way! if your gonna ruin ur diet w/ dessert, u have to do it right, and get them loaded with everything! they are like warm, soft pillows of heaven in your mouth! ITS A MUST! most places they are usually fried flat and to a crisp, and just so-so... here, you'll eat them til u hurl!  I KNOW!
