We had heard this was an exceptional place to eat and it certainly is.  I do prefer ground beef tacos but the shredded beef came out just fabulous.  Will be back to try rest of menu since we just moved to the area.  
We had good service and when we went to eat outside and all the tables were cleared but dirty (its 3pm and no other customers) a lady immediately came out and washed a couple of tables.  Not all of them mind you, but at least we had a clean one to sit at.

Loved the salsa bar.  Great green salsa.
