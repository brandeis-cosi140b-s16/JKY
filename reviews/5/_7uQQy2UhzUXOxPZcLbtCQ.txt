They get 5 stars as since we discovered Mexquite we have been at least 6 times. Great service and the food is tops in the fast casual category. Kids love the quesadillas with chips on the side. The best thing is the choice of meats, if you can imagine it they probably have it.  Queso is a nice touch and guacamole is done right. Service is great and they go out of their way to make things as you like.
