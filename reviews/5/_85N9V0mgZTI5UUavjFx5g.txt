OH MAH GAWD!

Normally I don't *love* tamales because they are relatively dry, but when I saw The Tamale Store selling Tamales at the Downtown Public Market I just had to try one. They have three regular vegan options in addition to two dessert vegan options, and 5 vegetarian options.

So, I decided to get a hot Southwest Chipotle and ate it at the market, and got an additional 6 frozen; a combo of Southwest Chipotle, Pumpkin, and Sweet Corn.

Well, these tamales are freaking delicious. Incredibly moist and flavorful, but with very few ingredients, and you can pronounce all of them! 

Their website touts "We use only the freshest produce and extra lean meats. We never use lard or shortenings. We never use preservatives!!" It is OBVIOUSLY true.

I love The Tamale Store!!!
