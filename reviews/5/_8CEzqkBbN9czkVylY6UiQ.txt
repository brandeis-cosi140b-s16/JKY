Grilled shrimp tacos and 3 item combination everything was delicious and the service was good as well. Shrimp were cooked perfectly, pico de gallo fresh and the chicken in the enchiladas was tender. Only complaint the red enchilada sauce was half assed and like many mexican restaurants the table salsa was lackluster but overall the food was good.
