I find myself at Faustos probably once a week, the atmosphere is great. if you want real Mexican food this is the place to go. it makes Roberto's look like trash. the workers in Faustos are extremely friendly yet kind of hard to understand due to their thick Spanish accents,always happy to help. you can eat a full meal at Faustos for probably around $5 or $6. and trust me they will not sell you short, they will pack your burrito or tacos fat. would recommend 100%.
