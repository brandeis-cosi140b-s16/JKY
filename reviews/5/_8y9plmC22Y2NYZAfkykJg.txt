Been going here every now and again since they opened but have started going fairly frequently the past month or so. Everything is always fresh and has great, authentic flavor. Have had the adobada, asada, chorizo, chicken and shrimp. All were tender, moist and delicious. The sopes are great and burritos are a great value. Will continue to come here in the future!
