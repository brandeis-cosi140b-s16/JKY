When we are in the area of Fountain Hills, we Always eat here. They have gluten free red sauce enchiladas, I love them.  We have been to the other location as well in Cave Creek. The food here is so good and many things to choose from that is gluten free.  We have never had bad service here. Chips are nice and thin and three different sauces are really tasty.  They have outside seating and when its in the cooler days, they have space heaters all over. I especially liked it outside because there is a chef out there preparing all kinds of things on the grill. You know that smell, it just pulls you in. That's pretty smart selling point, lol
I recommend trying one of El Encanto locations, the food is Delicioso!
