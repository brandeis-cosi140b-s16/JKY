What an awesome place! 

Tacos El Jefe's is located in a small free standing food court. It's an off the wall location as it's simply a food court that houses 4 - 6 small food concessions.

Anyway, the prices are very reasonable, the service is great (you can tell that your business is appreciated) and the good is amazing. Big portions, great taste and awesome salsas. 

On a side note, it's worth mentioning that all of the concessions look amazing. The only downside is the common area needs to be better maintained. It kind of smells and the floors are really dirty. They really need to address this.
