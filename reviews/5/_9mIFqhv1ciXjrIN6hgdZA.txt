Stopped by Pink Taco before the Santana show, great happy hour deals. Chips and 3 Salsas were fresh and tasty! The guacamole seemed over priced, but was worth it! Burrito Mojado was great! They had some new drinks on the menu, I had the Chupacabra...SPICY!! but loved it... not for the weak. Wife had the Pink, which was watermelon and mint, very refreshing. Great attentive service, highly recommend.
