I need to preface this 1 I love spicy Mexican food 2 I have eaten Mexican food all around the United States. This is not my first rodeo is what I'm trying to say As I walked in the door the manager shuffle his feet quickly to meet me and take my order. He greeted me with a smile and made me feel real comfortable kind of like an old friend. I asked what was in the Machaca burrito he was very detailed as to all the ingredients I was really quite impressed. I was impressed that he knew all the ingredients and that he wasn't upset or short with me for even asking. I asked for it to be spicy and it was perfect I had the green enchilada style my machaca burrito I had spicy green salsa everything was wonderful fresh and tasty I would highly recommend!!!! It only took 4 min to get my food. :-)
