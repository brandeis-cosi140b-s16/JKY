Came here after a recommendation from my sister who lives nearby. We came in and were seated right away. Our server was very polite, personable and attentive. Right as we were seated, we were immediately given chips and house made salsa. The salsa was unique and had a great kick to it (not too spicy though). I ordered cheese and beef enchiladas and my husband ordered a beef burro and a red beef tamale as a side. Everything was fresh, handmade and really exceptional. Our dinner even came with vanilla ice cream! This is clearly a family owned and operated facility that takes immense pride in their work and family recipes. We will definitely be back!
