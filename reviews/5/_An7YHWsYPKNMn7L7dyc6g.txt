Went back again and can't get enough of this place. It just seems to get better. Tried the fired rice kimchi with bulgogi and a fried egg and was knocked out. Can't beat the food. Everyone in our party fought over the bulgogi nachos and homemade sauces. Tried a fusion flauta and it was delicious. Their passion ice tea is refreshing with no caffeine and free refills. The bulgogi sliders were huge, covered in their slaw. Gave it 5 stars the first time and Komex continues to impress.
