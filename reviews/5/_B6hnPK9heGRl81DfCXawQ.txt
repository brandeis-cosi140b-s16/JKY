Since we were staying at The Boulders we decided to try this place. For some reason we didn't go there on a previous visit.

Right off, my wife fell in love with the chips and salsa. I too thought it was amazing. NYC Mexican food is as far from Mexican as Chipotle is to Taco Bell. Everything was so fresh and well prepared.

I was recommended the braised beef tacos and the enchilada for the wife. We both really loved it so much. I was quite surprised about her liking the food since she's picky when it comes to veg food flavors.

I highly recommend this place if you're anywhere in the area. It's a bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth going if you're there.
