We had a great dining experience...it is so hard to find good Mexican, especially in the South Side where there is a Mexican restaurant on every block...this is by far the best!

Service: Great, the hostess was very friendly and welcoming, our server Drew was amazing, warm, genuine, hip, attentive, never an empty glass, new the menu, very nice.

Atmosphere: Awesome, dark, with lots of fun lighting, not tacky though, really cool big round booths, cool bar, high tops, fun and trendy, good music

Food: Actually very good, I saw "actually" b/c I didn't expect such good food from a South Side bar, but it was very very good. Lots of unique taco selections; mahi mahi with pineapple salsa were great. BF had brisket and fried jalapeno tacos which were fantastic. The Trio dip appetizer was nice, salsa, guac, cheese, all fresh and super tasty. Very impressed. 

Drinks: We stopped in quick, no time to drink b/c work, but I am dying to try their nice margarita menu...good happy hour specials. 

Super cool place, will definitely be a new go to spot!
