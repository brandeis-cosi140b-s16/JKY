This was my first time trying the queso truck and it was better then I ever expected. We found them on Instagram and tried it out when they were near our home. We had 5 ppl with us and each of our orders were delicious. The warm churro chips dessert is now one of my favorite things and their fresca strawberry agua in mason jars was so good. The food was made quickly and the lady running the truck was very friendly. I would eat there again.
