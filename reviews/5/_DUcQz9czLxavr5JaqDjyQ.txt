We just recently moved into the area and immediately began scoping out the local eateries.  I love Mexican food and after a quick yelp/google search this place caught my attention.  I wasn't disappointed.  I brought my kids (ages 2-8) with me and we were all happy.  To make matters better, it was Saturday and happened to be happy hour ($1 street tacos).  The street tacos were delicious (and I sampled some of the kids food from the kids menu, the flour tortillas are amazing).  I went again for lunch by myself the other day.  You get the picture.  It was great.  Will definitely be a regular spot for me.
