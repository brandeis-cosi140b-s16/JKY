So Phat Phrank's new hours are 7am - 7pm M-F, 10-3 on Saturdays, closed on Sunday. But the best news of all is that breakfast items are available all day (at least on Saturday!). So I finally got a chance to try it! And I can testify that Phrank is a VERY nice guy, the food is stellar, and the service was extremely friendly. Sometimes food is so good, I actually laugh out loud, and I can say my chourico breakfast burrito today made me do just that. What an enjoyable experience! This place is busiest during the weekdays, so check it out after 4pm during the week, or anytime Saturday, and I hope you love it as much as I do.
