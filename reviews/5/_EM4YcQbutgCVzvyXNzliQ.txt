I'm a local and make the drive to the strip for El Segundo. Super conveniently located on the east end of the Fashion Show Mall, so perfect for a quick bite while shopping or a nice night out.  Very friendly management and staff...Vegas is usually unbearably hot in the summer so they've always made it a point to be sure we were comfortable and not sweating into our food (always prefer to dine on patio).. Plus their guacamole is delicious (they let you choose how spicy you want it--perfect for me). I've gone there at least a handful of times and never regret it when I leave, except for overeating! :) 

p.s. Go for the fish tacos in a lettuce cup and a margarita.. Nom Noms :)
