I'm just going to be honest here - this is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.

I know, I know. It's not a divey Mexican place, and how can a slightly more-upscale, sit-down place be my FAVORITE with all of the mom and pop joints around? Plain and simple, it's awesome food in a fun atmosphere, and it just plain tastes the best. The table-side guacamole - Perfect. Adding pomegranate seeds? WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!? Not to mention the house salsa, which is delicious, and the fresh-made chips! (Yummmmm....)

Seriously, so good! And the carne asada is the BOMB. If I know I'm going to Barrio Queen, I will literally fast all day for the opportunity to gorge myself on this dish - it's my favorite, and I still have a lot left to take home! The Barrio Pollo burrito is phenomenal too - it's like a chicken pot pie in a burrito. How can you say no to that?!

I often take friends and family from out of town to Barrio, and it's always a huge hit! I'd definitely recommend it for a nice, more intimate Mexican dining experience!

The only suggestion I have is that the service is sometimes hit or miss... I've had great servers here, and I've had some who didn't see us at the table for 15 minutes after we walked in the door. (This happened last night.) There are a few who could be a little more attentive, but on the whole, great place!
