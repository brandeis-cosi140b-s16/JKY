We really enjoyed our time here. Very friendly, efficient service and a cool ambiance. 
I ordered the hearty Queen's Salad (Baby greens, grilled chicken breast, apples, roasted tomatoes, toasted pecans, queso fresco, and roquefort cheese with a sweet and spicy vinaigrette. Garnished with pomegranate seeds). It was excellent.
We all ordered lunch-time Happy Hour margaritas, which were $3.50 at the time. The Barrio Queen provided us with good food, service, and value. Who could ask for more? We shall return.
