8/23/14. Yea!! We went back and they are open.. The Owner talked with us and they had an Emergency. Im glad they are still here!
I tried the Green Chili Plate that has Pork, rice, beans and Flour tortilla. It was Delicious!! My husband had the Carne Asada Tacos and Bean and Cheese burritos. Loved it!!
Cant get enough of this place we will be back. They may be small But they know how  to Cook Mexican Food and the Customer Service is Fantastic!!
