The main cook knows my order by heart, some of the counter staff know it as well. I always get it cause its always awesome, steak burrito with WHITE CHEESE beans rice and pico  all inside. Its very important you say white, its way better in my opinion than the yellow. The beans are always warm and the rice is always soft, the steak is always good. Pico is pico so lets not go overboard here. This beast costs me around 6 bucks but its always worth it!

But how do you make this place even better? Now they have a loyalty card program at this location!!! Every $50 you spend get a free meal(usually burrito and can of soda). Thats awesome, i usually come 3 times a week anyways, but now theyre making it more worth it!  Its open 24 7 and always consistently quality. Some cooks make better(bigger) burritos then others but thats everywhere.  Only thing that really matters is they all taste delicious...
