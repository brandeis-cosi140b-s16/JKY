I have been going to Monterrey since they opened nearly 20 yrs ago. The food is excellent. My favorite is the chimichangas both chicken and shredded beef but I have tried nearly everything and its all good. Love the fajitas, beef or chicken (skip the shrimp), tacos de asada, pollo con crema, pollo con queso, as well as any of their combinations. Oh, and you can't go wrong with just a couple chicken soft tacos ala cart, they are delicious. For those who have complained that it's not authentic Mexican food - your point is? I have been to at least 20 Mexican restaurants in Charlotte including many "authentic" ones where they don't even have an English menu. I like some of the food at these places but always come back to Monterrey.
