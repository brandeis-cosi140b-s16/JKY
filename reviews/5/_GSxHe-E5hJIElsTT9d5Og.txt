It's more like a fast food restaurant. You order and pay for your food at the cashier counter and pick up your own food at the pick up counter. I ordered the Chicken Sizzling Fajita, it was very tasty. There's a salsa station which I like the best that you can pick whatever salsa you like.  Also, we came for breakfast, it's cheap and tasty.
