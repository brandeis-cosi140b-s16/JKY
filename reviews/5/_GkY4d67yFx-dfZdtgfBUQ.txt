I don't know how anyone gives this place less than 5 stars, the food is the best we have had at a restaurant in a long time, it's authentic, homemade, and yes it is a mom and pop shop...which makes this place even more inviting, the owner came around to speak to every table. Would absolutely come back here, and only here for Mexican food again.
