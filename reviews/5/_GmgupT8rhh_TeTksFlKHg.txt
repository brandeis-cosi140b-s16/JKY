Love this place! 

Garcia's is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here. Fresh ingredients, hot and tasty food, decent service. To start off, we love their chips and salsa and bean dip. These items alone are worth the visit! Chips are served hot along with fresh salsa and a spicy bean dip that I think they make, and if they don't, it's still really good! 

The menu is pretty standard Mexican food items. I usually go for the Grande Burrito. It's made with fajita meats and veges. Comes with Charro beans and rice. Served with Guacamole and sour cream. The fajitas are excellent too.
