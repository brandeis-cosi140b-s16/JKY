Stopped here on a trip to Great Wolf Lodge with our two girls. 
Had the Mexican Buffett it was great. All food was fresh and they paid close attention to keeping the Buffett refilled w fresh authentic food. 
Great stop with great good and friendly efficient service.  
Will def stop here again.  Great prices too!!
