Upon arrival, you are given a newspaper with Glendale news from a many years ago. Mine was a 1967 front page newspaper, inside which guests will find the menu. I really enjoyed this feel, made you feel almost like you are at your own kitchen table. Older interior but kept clean, very nice homey feel-very welcoming atmosphere. Servers are all smiles and very kind, mostly women, at least in the morning when I visited. Play oldies music in background, easy listening. 

Average plate price looked to be in the 7.50 to 10.00 range. Has full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. Meal came out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Benedict for 10.49 (yes more expensive than most but sounded so good). Potatoes not as crisp as I normally like but tasted fresh which is most important. The fruit was fresh, crisp, and cool. The eggs Benedict were good, just slightly, again, not as crispy as I would prefer on the English muffin. The meal I selected had green chillies, pulled pork, and of course a poached egg. I never had this before and would probably order a bacon or sausage Benedict instead next time, simply because that is what I am used to for breakfast taste. Overall, however, a tasty meal with a drink that stayed filled.

I would certainly come here again; the lunch menu looks very appealing to me with fresh sandwiches and salads. The menu has a "little less" section for seniors or people that don't swallow as much food as the average joe. Those prices are in the 6.00-7.50 range. They also have a conference room for guests with large parties. I saw some family or company meeting at 8:30am on a Thursday! I was surprised, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Again, overall a very good experience. I am very glad it was clean and welcoming.
