Stopped in today & had a Carnitas Taco.
I will say a little greasy!
Salsa station has delicious roasted jalape√±os & 4 yummy salsas. They have one that is a creamy texture, possibly mixed with sour cream & very good! They also offer hot carrots & an onion mixture @ the bar too!
Best Filiberto's I've been to yet!
Clean restaurant, good service, fantastic tasting food @ fair prices.
Will be back to try more on their menu!
