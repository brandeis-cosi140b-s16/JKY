I just ate at the El Dorado Cantina and it was so freaking good! Sean the manager came and greeted our table and made us feel super welcome. The service was amazing and the food was even better! Organic GMO free Mexican food? Doesn't really get better than that. The street tacos are on point, and so is everything else. Check the place out.
