The first time, I went through the drive-through and discovered the speaker/microphone is terrible, and they got my order wrong but the food was delicious. Every time since, I've parked and walked up to the window (the window is open 24 hours) and ordered there, and they've never gotten my order wrong since. (so, pro tip: don't use the drive-through. Walk up to the window.) It's good food that leaves me feeling good -- real Mexican tostadas and tamales like the kind you can only get from authentic Mexican food places like this.

I also discovered tonight that they have REAL Mexican cokes -- you know, the kind that can't be bought at grocery stores in the US. The kind that has good caffeine and REAL cane sugar instead of the American corn syrup crap. They're $2.50/bottle but it's a real nice luxury treat. Mexican coke doesn't leave the sticky feeling in your mouth like corn syrup coke does.
