Arrived Saturday afternoon when no other diners were in the restaurant at the time. Jose was excellent and most professional.  The Cheese Crisp was perfect golden brown; blanco menudo was loaded full of meat and a HUGE bowl of it; the tacos were full of lean shredded beef; I believe the cheese enchilada was the best I've ever eaten; the green chili burrito was excellent.  We absolutely loved everything single thing we tried.  My only disappointment is that they are closed so early through out the week - or I would be there again, and again, and again.
