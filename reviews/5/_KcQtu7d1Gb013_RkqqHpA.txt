Wadaa is attached to Barney's Boathouse and is both delicious and an incredible bargain. The menu consists of only two items, steak tacos and chicken tacos. The meat is marinaded beautifully so the flavors are intense and satisfying. And they are only $2 each! Incredible bargain! Cheese is an extra buck. You really will be blown away by something so tasty being so inexpensive!

It isn't advertised but they will also make you a quesadilla for the same price as a taco, and I find them a bit more filling! So if you want to get something a little bigger for the same price try one out!

You really can't beat this deal in oldtown and they are superb!
