Not only is the food delicious, but I also feel good after I eat it.  Tacos aren't health food, but at Taco Taco they actually make food from scratch.  No frozen sysco food trucks make deliveries here.  The workers here take pride in what they do and it shows.  The salsa bar is incredible.  Only negative is figuring out the ordering, which is a little confusing on your first visit.  However, the people who work here are so helpful and friendly that even that slight negative really doesn't matter.
