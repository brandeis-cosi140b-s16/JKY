I was a bit skeptical at first, with me being a picky eater, but I managed to love the food here. 
Right when you walk in, you might notice that the place is surprisingly clean for a Mexican food place (no offense!). They were constantly cleaning the tables and floor as customers walked about. The only issue I really had with the establishment is that you couldn't smell the food. It smelled like cleaning supplies. I know it's not really something I could complain about, it just sort of takes you out of the experience. 

The food though, oh man, the food. I had their "Daily Special No. 1", a wet bean and cheddar burrito, along with an order of French fries. First off, it was cheap. It included a small drink (free refills) with the food and it only costed about $4.50 total. Most of the items on the menu were fairly priced, and pleasant. Second, the food tasted wonderful. The burrito I had was huge (maybe about 12 inches long and roughly 5 inches wide), and the amount of French fries was astounding. I only managed to eat about three quarters of the burrito and barely any of the fries. It was all delicious. 

To sum it all up, I will definitely be coming back! A+!
