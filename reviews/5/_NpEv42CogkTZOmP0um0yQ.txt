We are from California and discovered this place the last time we visited. We are back again and decide to stop in on 6/20.
The food here is killer!! Just like home! FYI- Real Quac-
This time we were in I had the combination plate with the taco & enchilada. The enchilada sauce is very tasty ( most places it's very bland). You can have shredded beef or chicken or one of each if you ask!
The Horchata is one of the BEST tasting ones I've had..
Salsas are good and chilled at the salsa bar.
Hot carrots prepped & pickled in small bags upon request, they are good.
Everything that my family and I have ordered here is sooooo delicious..
Large portions for the price too! We always end up taking some home.
We really enjoy this place and will be back again & again.
The owners are very nice and accommodating too, such a plus!
