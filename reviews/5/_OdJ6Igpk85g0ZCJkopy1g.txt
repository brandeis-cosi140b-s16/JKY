Delicious, authentic, fresh food in an attractive place with great service. Handmade tortillas, smoky salsas... Just great. The beans they bring out at the beginning are also tasty - don't pass them up.  This is more a taquer√≠a with better decor than the typical NC tex-mex place. 

Beer list includes some fantastic imports ( e. g. Victoria) that most Mexican places don't have. Don't miss their horchata, either.
