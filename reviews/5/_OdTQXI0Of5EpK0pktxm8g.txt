I don't go out much as my home is my haven, but you know those things called friends.. They insisted I must check out this place out; that I must venture forth through the gates of my home in Narnia to the lands of Sitara. I finally succumbed when three beautiful things were brought to my attention, Food, Hookah, and Alcohol. I gallantly departed my humble abode only to be welcomed by a pulchritudinous environment and upbeat atmosphere where 5 star worthy dishes of food and drinks began to fill our table. Then it came. The Grand Daddy Master of Puff. Never before have the people of Las Vegas had the opportunity to smoke the quintessence of elite hookahs, yet here it is laying upon my table. A plethora of interchangeable flavors call out to you and conglomerate into elegant shisha filled bowels, loaded by masters of there craft, ripping clouds Zeus himself would be envious of with ease. There is no Las Vegas comparison; you too must venture forth to the lands of Sitara and find yourself flabbergasted by this epitome of a Hookah Lounge.
