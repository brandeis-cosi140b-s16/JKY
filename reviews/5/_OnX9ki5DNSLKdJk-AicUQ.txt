It has become a family tradition to have dinner here when we drive up from Vail, Az to Visit our family.  Yesterday confirmed that we could never go wrong.  A couple family members ordered their favorites,  like chicken quesidillas or fajitas, but my daughter and I broke with the norm and feasted on the new Del Mar Sampler.  Quite possibly  My all time favorite eat-out dinner.  Paired with the Mango Margherita,  oh my!  Worth driving the 90 some miles just to eat here.
