Ordinarily I would never review a restaurant where I had eaten on its first day of operation.

But I'm going to make an exception for Taco Taco, because this place is LEGIT.

The standard by which I judge all other tacos in Las Vegas is Tacos El Gordo, and specifically the adobada that they roast all day long on a spit.

Well, taco fans, I can tell you that the pastor here ranks right up there. It's a little bit less spicy and a little more cumin flavor than the pork at El Gordo. I can't say it's better than the best but it's right up there. And like El Gordo, they make their own tortillas fresh right behind the counter.

The pollo taco (an option absent from the TEG menu, incidentally) was flavorful as well, and the asada was savory and tender but the real standout was the soyrizo taco.

You heard me. Soyrizo.

Vegetarian options at Mexican restaurants typically make me feel like I'm missing something. But not with this. The flavorful, spicy fauxsage comes out topped with black beans - the perfect complement.

Best of all? You can pimp out your meal with your choice of eight salsas and two kinds of beans, plus jalapenos and cebollitas.

On the whole I'd describe Taco Taco as a hybrid of the authenticity of TEG and the attention to ingredients and health consciousness that you find at places like Zabas or Chipotle.

I don't often find myself on the east side these days but it's good to know an awesome taco spot is there when I do make it over.
