Started as a small taco shop by a missionary to Mexico and has expanded several times over the years. You will not find one bad or so-so item on the menu! The meats are simmered over many hours to perfect flavor and temperature. 

The Plato de Carne is quite a large portion too. They have several different types of salas so you have to ask not only the "hot" one but there's a habanero that is many levels higher than that! 

One of my all time favorites in the heart of Mesa.
