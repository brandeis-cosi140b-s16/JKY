Excellent menu of traditional Mexican cuisine.  We had a group of 12, everybody ordered something different.  Everything was great.  The staff was friendly, the service prompt.  I had the carnitas, they were moist and flavorful.  This place is off the strip but not too far.  I would highly recommend it.  We come here every time we visit Vegas.
