Holy guacamole! This place is like my Abuella's house! The food is so fresh and gives you that homemade vibe. And their salsa, I can't even... It's so delicious that I want to set up some sort of cot and live here so I can eat this food every day. The service is fantastic and did I say how yummy the guacamole is? Because SHIT! It's sooooo good! Please bring your bff here and tell your mom! And text me because we are prolly here already! Fuck. I can't stop cursing because this place is so good!!!
