I love this hole-in-the-wall (literally)!

I was in Phoenix for a conference, and had some downtime to explore the local neighborhood. The hotel staff from the Hilton at Squaw Valley were kind enough to provide me some transportation to and from this location since it was within two miles from the hotel. But naturally, I had chosen this little gem because of the awesome reviews on Yelp. I'm glad I was not steered wrong!

The first thing that caught my eye was the door. There isn't a sign on top indicating it's Dick's... instead you have to just know you're stumbling through the right door. Immediately as I entered, I could smell the delicious hints of roasted meat. I quickly found myself a seat at the bar. Dick's Hideaway is small. The max capacity of the entire room must be around 20. 

There were maybe four or five tables, and then the rest were bar seats. Fortunately there was a seat left for me. 

I started off with a local craft beer: the Prescott Amber Ale. Mildly delicious. A good pair with meat. 

My main meal? The New Mexico Burger: an all angus medium rare beef patty, New Mexico hatch green chile underneath a cheddar cheese layer---all in-between two local buns and with a side of handcut fries.

Yum! My burger cravings were being satisfied! 

Alright. So this isn't necessarily the best burger I've had, but this was definitely flavorful and hit the spot. Overall, everything was well worth the price and the trip over. I would definitely recommend this little restaurant if you're looking to dine in by yourself or with a small group.
