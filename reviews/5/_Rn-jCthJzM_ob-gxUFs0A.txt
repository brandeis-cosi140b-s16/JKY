Nacho Daddy is my favorite place to go whether it is for food, drinks, or just to hang out and mingle. I've been coming here since I moved to the Henderson area and it felt very welcoming. I refer to it like cheers because the bartenders and servers made a point to know my name and who I am. I usually don't even have to ask for a drink because they already know what my favorites are. It really helped my transition to a new area. In a place where you wouldn't necessarily expect people to care as much, Nacho Daddy is definitely THE neighborhood place to go.  They also have excellent food and craft beers that I can't find at other places. Definitely check it out.
