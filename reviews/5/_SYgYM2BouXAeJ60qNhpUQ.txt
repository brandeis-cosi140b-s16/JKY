Since they opened, the food has been consistently fresh and awesome! 
The restaurant is tucked away on the west side of the Fry's Plaza, sooooo if u blink u'll  miss it. 
It is a small place but very clean and bright. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The FREE chip and salsa bar is a nice "added" feature. If u eat n, u also get FREE drink refills.
The food is all cooked to order, hot , fresh and FAST. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent. I especially like the fact that the burritos don't drip oil/butter/grease while u are eating them. Everything is seasoned just right, and they have a salsa for every palette, from mild to "make u sweat" hot. 
DONT PASS THIS HIDDEN GEM UP!!! I hope they can make a go of it and be around for a long time. 
PS- This is not a big place, it's made for quick, fast, REALLY GOOD mexican food , like mom makes. A neighborhood cantana/cafe.
