I seriously can't believe I haven't ever written a review of my favorite Mexican place in the entire world! Not like this place is still a secret, which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere. 

I should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting. But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's. I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions. The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult! 

These have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico). 

The wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive. 

They have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered. 

I could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)
