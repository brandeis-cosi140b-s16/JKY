I don't like Taco Bell very much nor come to Taco Bell often.  I get constantly reminded why I don't eat here thirty minutes after I finish my food at ANY Taco Bell.

This one.  This Taco Bell is a pure gem.  I'm not giving this place FIVE STARS because of the food, I'm giving this FIVE STARS because it gets wild here! 

If you like to people-watch college students in Tempe, you need to come here!  The staff are incredibly helpful and are patient, even under the hectic circumstances.  This place deserves a good rating.
