If you're a fan of Macayo's like my elderly parents, you will not like this place. Mom & dad don't want to go back here.

That's fine because it means more food for me when I go. :)

The server sets everything up by explaining that they're more of an interior Mexican restaurant so things aren't necessarily spicy. However, most of the food that I had came with a healthy burn so don't think you're in for a gringo experience. The bean dip was a nice touch and the salsa was excellent.

My only quibble with the meal was I expected more of a stack from the stacked enchiladas. There's only one layer to them. I expect a couple of layers when I order something like that.

The margaritas aren't cheap but they're good.
