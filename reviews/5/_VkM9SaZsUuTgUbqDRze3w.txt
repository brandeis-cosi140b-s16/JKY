The best black bean burrito to be found in Madison.  Spicy, but not a bio-hazard. Silky,  nicely textured filling- just the right amount of cheese, I'd say.  An excellent rice and bean accompaniment.  So affordable, I hope they can sell enough of them to pay for their remodeling. Very tasteful decor!  (I was covetous of the lighting fixtures.)
