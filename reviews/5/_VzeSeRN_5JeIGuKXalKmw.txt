I have been making two or so trips to Verde a week since they opened. I'm still a huge fan of the green chile. I also enjoy the Verde salad with their chicken. My wife just wants a side of the beans and a tortilla. the food is consistent, excellent, and affordable.

The other night we were having some friends over for dinner and I just ran out of time to cook anything myself. I never noticed their family sized takeout menu before. I went ahead and ordered the Green Chile with rice, beans, tortillas and salsa. It was so much food - easily feeding four adults. It was only $14. My wife and I don't need that much food very often but it is an amazing deal.     

After dozens of visits I have yet to have a bad experience.
