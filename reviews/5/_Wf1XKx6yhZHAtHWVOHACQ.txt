First time here. 
I had the guacamole dip which was very good.
4 street tacos, 2 carne asada and 2 al pastor. It is hard to find a place with good al pastor tacos and this is the place. My agua fresca had a natural flavor and i could taste the little pieces of pinaple. Service was excellent. 
One thing i feel they should improve is their salsa, the one they give you with complimentary chips. Other than that 5 Stars
