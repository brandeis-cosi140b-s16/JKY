One of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles has made it to Las Vegas.

The vibrantly colored, upscale Mexican restaurant with cuisine created by celebrity chefs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken has been a legend in Santa Monica for decades, but they recently expanded their business by opening a new restaurant in Downtown LA, sending a food trucks out into the streets of Los Angeles, and launching a location in Mandalay Bay. I'm happy to say that the Vegas version of the iconic restaurant lives up to the reputation of the original created by the "Two Hot Tamales."

Stuffed Plantains, Chile Rellenos, slow-cooked Carnitas... the menu is made entirely of perfectly crafted Mexican deliciousness. And their strong, flavorful, and Margaritas are unforgettable (unless you drink too many, in which case you'll forget more than the drinks you had at the restaurant).

The Mandalay version also features the same energetic and colorful graffiti art  on the walls that the Santa Monica version is known for, with views of Mandalay's pool area.

I love The Border Grill so much and the Vegas version does not disappoint.
