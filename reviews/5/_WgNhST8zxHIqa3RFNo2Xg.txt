This is by far the best Mexican food in town. My husband and I have wanted to try it for awhile but I was always a little scared because every review kept saying how different it was and I'm a bit of a picky eater. But OMG its freaking amazing. Get the Al Pastor, whatever style you want, but definitely chose the Al Pastor as your meat. We've been here twice now and have loved it both times. It's very clean, staff is very friendly and accommodating, food is amazing and they have a great salsa bar. What else can you really ask for?
