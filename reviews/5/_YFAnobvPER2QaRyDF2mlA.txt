Brandon and Tyler were totally awesome they hooked us up with some great food. I'd take a picture of my food but it is all gone. The Ono Nachos with the Kalua pig is to die for, I love the aloha spirit that consumes the place and food. Great atmosphere and great culture, makes me feel like I'm on the island.
