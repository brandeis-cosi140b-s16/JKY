This is one of the best Mexican food places in the entire state. Fountain Hills is lucky to have this gem. They started in Cave Creek and expanded to three locations after building thousands of die hard fans. The chips and salsa will give you an immediate idea of the treat that is in store next. The Pollo Funditio and Carne Asada are magnificent. The seating is extra comphy too. To put it bluntly "I love El Encanto".
