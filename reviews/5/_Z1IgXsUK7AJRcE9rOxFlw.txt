Filibi's is the BEST! Came here all the time with my best friends for a reliably great meal. Obviously, some say come post 2am after a good night out but I say you can come anytime - early morning, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, pretty much any time of day or night. My favorites:

Custom Order: Bean & Cheese Burrito with lettuce, tomato and sour cream inside the burrito made enchilada style (man my mouth is watering thinking about it!)

I also like the nacho's and quesadillas...and if you are really hungry their chimichunga's are great too. Rice is good but only when doused with their awesome hot salsa! For me, its a must visit every time I come back to AZ.
