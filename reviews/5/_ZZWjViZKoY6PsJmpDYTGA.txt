We have been to this location quite a few times, and we love it. 

We've never had any problems, but this time my husband found a hair in his food. At first he thought it might have been his hair, but he literally had to dig it out of his burrito.  He was pretty upset because he was really enjoying it.  We called the waiter over, and explained what happened. He offered to take it off the bill, or just make a whole other one.  We got a second one to go.  The waiter also got the manager to come over and talk to us.  The manager was very friendly and apologized over and over. 

When they brought us the second burrito, it was already bagged and ready to go, and they included chips and salsa also!!!
