Best fish tacos in Charlotte! Having traveled to Mexico and experienced the way fresh, authentic fish tacos are supposed to taste most Charlotte restaurants just can't compare. But Cabo Fish Taco (CFT) nails it.

The NODA atmosphere where CFT is located is artsy and cool. Typically a younger crowd after hours, but very accessible and inviting.

With limited outdoor seating plan ahead, but it's worth it on a cool night.
