As always the chicken burro with the green corn sauce is the bomb! My spouse loves, loves, loves the green chili beef burro enchilada style. You can't go wrong with any of the cheese crisps!!! Coldest beer and coldest pint glass I have had in the valley. Thank you David.  Mary, our server, was awesome too!  We live in the neighborhood and have gone here 10+ years.
