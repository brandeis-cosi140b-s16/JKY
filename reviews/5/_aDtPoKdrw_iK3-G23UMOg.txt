This is the Mexican street food I've been searching for in Las Vegas. And I didn't expect to find it in such a touristy area, but there it is. Everything I tried here was great. It reminded me of the Mexican food they have in Tucson, AZ. Which is a huge compliment cause Tucson is almost in Mexico location wise. 

I got the vegetable torta and it was AWESOME. It's not what you typical led expect because the bread wasn't fried and was more like a pocket they put all the fixings inside, but it was so so good! The tacos, guac, chips, salsa... You name it, it was great.

The place is small and definitely a hole in the wall, but thats what I look for when I'm trying to spot good street food. Take a chance on this place, it's fantastic.
