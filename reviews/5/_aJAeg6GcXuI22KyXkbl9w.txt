My wife and I have been coming here since they opened.  They opened up close to our current residence and we have been trying to find a decent mexican place that was close to home.  And we found it. 


They start you off with some really tasty chips , salsa and bean dip.  YUM!

I have had the Chicken \ Steak Fajitas and the Carne Asada Burrito. 

I have yet to have a bad meal there , the food is amazing and the churros for dessert are AMAZING!. 

They are getting their liquor liscense soon , and i hope this will increase their busyness and they stay open. 

Cant wait for my meal there.
