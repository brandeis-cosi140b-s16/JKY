Being from San Diego, I am very picky about my Mexican food...Mi Tierra is the first place in Las Vegas that has held up to my expectations of good Mexican food.  It is fantastic!  I'm vegetarian and usually get simple items like bean & cheese burrito or chile relleno and they are excellent...but my fiance raves about their meat dishes.

The service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean.  The prices are very reasonable.  Overall, there is nothing to not love about it!!
