This restaurant is a refreshing step up from the typical Champaign Mexican experience.  I've eaten at BK three times and consistently was impressed with how fresh and tasty the ingredients were.  

The chips and salsa are very good, and each dish has had a great grilled taste.  None of that fast slop whipped together in 2 minutes.  Highly recommended for lunch or dinner.
