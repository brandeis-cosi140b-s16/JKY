This is my favorite place for mariscos (Mexican seafood), everything is fresh and delicious. My favorite dishes are the camarones de ajo, which is shrimp with a garlic sauce, amazing! They also have really fresh shrimp cocktails that you can get with shrimp or mixed with octopus. 
P.S. Just a heads up, the menu is mostly in Spanish, but they usually have someone there to translate for you.
