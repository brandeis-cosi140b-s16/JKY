So I was craving Mexican food really bad and from where I live, there aren't many choices. So I go on my handy dandy yelp and come across this place. All of the 17 reviews were 5 stars. I read a few reviews, looked at the pictures, and I was SOLD!  When I went inside, I was greeted with a smile by Esther. I let her know it was my first time here and she informed me that the red chili and the green chili were their best dishes. She brought me a sample of both. The green is a little too spicy for me (because I'm a big baby) but I decided on the red. Overall, the food was delicious. The ONLY two things I would change are the thickness of the beans (they're a little too runny for me) and the chips. They were too thick and a little overcooked. Besides that, amazing service and amazing food. I will definitely be coming back.
