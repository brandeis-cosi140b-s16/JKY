Rubios is my go to stop on Tuesday's for their 1.50 fish tacos! The staff is always really friendly, and food comes out fast. The food tastes great, they have an amazing salsa bar, and they actually include the lime with your taco! It may not seem like a big deal but when I get home and other places didn't include the lime, and I forget to ask, I just sit in the kitchen and cry....
