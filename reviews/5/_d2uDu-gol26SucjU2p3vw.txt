Omg!! Why didn't I know about this place sooner? I've driven past it for years in a little strip mall. Everything I've had is absolutely amazing. I had the Bulgogi rice bowl, pork belly tacos, and the pork belly musubi, all are so delicious. Whether you try the fusion food or straight Mexican or Korean you can't go wrong. I only wish they were open earlier so I could grab in the morning!!
