I have been a Menudo fanatic for many, many years. I've eaten it in various parts of Mexico, LA, Chicago, and Phoenix. I can without question say that the Menudo at this place is one of the best I've have. Don't be intimidated by the decor or location. Come and enjoy the Menudo and their other delicious dishes......YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT... If I could I would give this place 10 stars.... Buen provecho....
