Absolutely LOVE El Guero Canelo! Best Mexican hotdogs and their carne asada is delicious too. So flavorful! They have a lot of their toppings on the side so you can choose how much of which toppings you want on your dog. The guacamole is YUMMY! The owner is very friendly and was greeting everyone (that's something you don't see everyday). They came from Tucson and the new place looks great! So happy that they have a Phoenix location now! I will definitely be visiting often! More often than I probably should ;) Thanks El Guero!
