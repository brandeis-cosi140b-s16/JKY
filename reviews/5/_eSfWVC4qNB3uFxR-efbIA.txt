So a buddy of mine told me about this new little spot that opened up close to work and said the food was incredible! I had to check it out for myself and man was he right!! First thing I looked for was cleanliness and it definitely passed. Then I looked at customer service and there was two guys working and both were super friendly! Last but not least was the food and boy did they hit it out of the park!!! Food was incredible, I had the Cochinita torta and two chicken tacos!! Reminded me of my moms home cooking. Such a great place to get a quick authentic bite to eat before work!! They will definitely be seeing more of me.
