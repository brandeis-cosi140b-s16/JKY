First I must start off by praising the Yelp Gods as without them and my fellow Yelpers this review would not be possible. I first visited Phoenix last October and stumbled  upon a place called Del Taco. I now have moved to Phoenix and went on the hunt for Del Taco only to discover that my GPS lead me to a closed establishment (super sad face) I hopped on Yelp to see if I could find another establishment that served Mexican Food and saw that this place had great reviews and were close so I decided to give them a try and I totally do not regret it!

Usually when I go places I do not expect super large portions. I ordered a chicken supreme quesadilla, chips and guacamole, and 2 strawberry churros. When the man handed me the bag I was shocked as it almost didn't fit into my driver's side window. I ordered dinner for 1, not a Mexican Thanksgiving feast which is exactly what I got along with very friendly service!

Upon arriving home and opening the behemoth of a bag I discovered that the owners must've lived in Chicago at some point in their lives and mimicked their quesadillas off of their pizza. The slices were so big that I wanted to fold them in half like Chicago Style pizza but instead I opted to use a fork instead. I could only eat one and the flavor was amazing. The taste was authentic and has erased the concept of Taco Bell from my mind. The guacamole was one of the hugest portions I have ever seen from an establishment. It looked like it was atleast 2 guacamoles placed on the chips and the flavor was great as well although I added just a tad of salt. The churros were to die for and have ruined me for life. All in all that place will likely become my new home for my Mexican cravings! I am beyond happy!
