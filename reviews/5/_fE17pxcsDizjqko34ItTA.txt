My fianc√© and I love Abuelos!! You can get a high quality (non greasy) delicious Mexican dinner for two people for $20! It is reasonably priced, the food is excellent, and the servers go above and beyond to make your dinner a success! We have had numerous party gatherings here and every one of them was great! They also have gluten free options which is AWSOME!
