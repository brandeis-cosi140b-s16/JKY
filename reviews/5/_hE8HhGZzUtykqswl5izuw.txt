I've been coming here for YEARS (well, not this particular one, but you know what I mean) so it's a little surprising I haven't reviewed them yet! 

This location is probably the best one I've been to-service is always awesome (44th & Thomas sucks with service, as does Camelback & the 51!), location is great-never had any issues with finding parking (unlike the one at Chandler mall = good luck!), and the food is always amazing! 

So if you've never (**gasp**) been here before, it's pretty basic. They offer burritos, burrito & fajita bowls, salad bowls, and tacos (soft or hard, of course). Choose from chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas or vegitarian. Option of black or pinto bean. Salsa here is absolutely fantastic!! I ALWAYS get the corn & pico but they have a couple other options for those that like spicier. Obviously cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and guac are available to top it all off. 

I always get the same thing- steak burrito bowl (no rice) with black beans, corn & pico salsa, cheese, and guacamole. My mouth is watering just THINKING about it and I just ate here yesterday!! 

I love that they offer beer & margaritas in addition to the soda option-some days it's just necessary

The ONLY thing that annoys me (just a little) is that EVERY time I ask for guac, they inform me that it's $1.80 extra and is that ok? ugh. Obviously they musta had someone complain about not knowing, but seriously?
