This place is AMAZING! It a tiny little gourmet mexican restaurant right on Greenway and Tatum in the Safeway Plaza.

Carlos was incredibly friendly and made the experience that much better. I got to try the Green Enchiladas, Tamales, Beef Empanada and a Pumpkin Empanada. They were all delicious! 

Highly recommend this place both for the quality in food, service, and ambiance. I will definitely be going again!
