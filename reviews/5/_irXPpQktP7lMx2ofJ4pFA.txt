When you walk in the restaurant, it is plain and there isn't so much to see. BUT, I ordered carry out and the kid who took my order is so polite and smart since he remembers all my order without writing it down. And I ordered quite a few... Shrimp tacos, fish tacos, beef nachos, chicken enchilada, guacamole, and carne Asada tacos. They're all DELISh! You can taste the freshness of their food and made to order since I waited for awhile for my orders. I'm very particular when it comes to freshness of the food since I love to cook myself and I take serious on criticizing each dish.  Even their chips looks like they just fry them. Good amount of sauce on their enchilada and the guacamole is so creamy and tasty. All in all, I'm very satisfied with their food. Definitely a place you should try.
