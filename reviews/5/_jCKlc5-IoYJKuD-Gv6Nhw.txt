I cannot say much; however the brunch tapas buffet is amazing for the price.

There is a gigantic selection of different plates to try with items that include pork belly or breakfast nachos. With a big selection in mind, it is not a bad idea to go with a big group so that you can share and try a good variety of what they have to offer. 

Excellent Blood Mary's as well!
