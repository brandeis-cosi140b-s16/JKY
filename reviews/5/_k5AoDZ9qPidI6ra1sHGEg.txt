I don't know her name but there is a young woman who works there literally every time I go there and she is seriously one of my favorite people to exist. If she read this she would likely recognize the bean and cheese burrito with cilantro and a side of enchilada sauce girl who is always going there at weird hours after work looking a mess. I have an annoying order which she gets right every time. She is always super friendly and sweet. Fillis is always good but the reason I always go to that specific location is because she brightens my day up because she is just fabulous.
