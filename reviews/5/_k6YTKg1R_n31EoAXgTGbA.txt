Boulder highway is not exactly a food mecca, but at least one item on the menu at Pepe's tacos deserves mention. That would be the Machaca burrito - shredded dry beef mixed in with scrambled eggs, onions, peppers and tomatoes. This combo was perfectly cooked and their was not ounce of grease at all.  The burrito also had rice inside and i opted to leave out the beans and every bite was glorious. Fresh cold radishes were a good side and I also loved that the chopped onions and cilantro combo was available at the salsa bar, which is basically just a normal salsa bar. Machacha is a tough dish to master, but Pepe has got it down pat.
