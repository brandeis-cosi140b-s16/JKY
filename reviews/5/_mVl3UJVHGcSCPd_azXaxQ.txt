I often check the internet to see if by some miraculous act of god that Don Jose's has published their family recipes on the internet, or a cookbook, or SOMETHING to fill the void in my heart for exquisite Mexican Food.  

I couldn't agree more that Don Jose's was a true diamond in the rough.  Their enchilada sauce, cheese crisp, bear burros, tacos, hot sauce,  ALL OF IT was just fantastic!  I would gladly pay the extra $.55 for a bowl of chips now- HECK- I'd pay $5.00 for it!  I would gladly make the 45 minute drive each way for a Don Jose enchilada now.  

Oh well, I guess I'll just keep on praying for a Don Jose Miracle!
