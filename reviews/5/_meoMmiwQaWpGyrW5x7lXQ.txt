This was the best Mexican we had for the price. Clearly a local place and not fancy. They bring you three different salsas which were a great start. The waitress recommended the california burrito ... WOW! My wife had a great fish taco platter and our nine year old became a true Mexican food eater. As far as the margaritas??? Awesome!
