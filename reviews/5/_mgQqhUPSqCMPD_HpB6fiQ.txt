I came to Sal's to share a pizza with my brother and sister, excited to try something wildly exciting and new (I'd seen the menu earlier, and I was really impressed with how imaginative and creative the pizzas were). My sister, though, always the unadventurous eater, wanted us to get the Forza: what seems to be a simple pie with pepperoni, Gouda, Ricotta, and tomatoes. I begrudgingly agreed to what I assumed would be an uneventful and boring pizza experience. 

BOY, WAS I WRONG. The Forza, the absolute "safest" pizza we could find on the menu, was packed to the brim with flavor and quality. Deliciously sweet dollops of cheese perfectly balanced whole cloves of roasted garlic and juicy (but not too juicy!) tomatoes, making my taste buds practically break out in angelic song with every single bite. I will definitely be coming back here to try the creative and inspired masterpieces of culinary recipe that originally drew me to Sal's, like the Carbonara, the Fig and Bacon, and probably all the rest of the menu as well. 

Also, the pizzas? They're absolutely gigantic, considering their low price and high quality. I had so many leftovers to eat and it was awesome. I love leftovers.
