Ambiance was great. Love the remodel. Had some slight service issues, but definitely will chalk that up to the amount of people that were dining and the fact that it appears to be all new staff. 

I had the fajitas and they were great. A touch on the salty side, but a great portion and great flavor. My wife had soup and loved it. 

We will definitely be back soon!
