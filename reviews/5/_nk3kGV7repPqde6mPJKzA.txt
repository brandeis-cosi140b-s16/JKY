One of my favorite little local restaurants! The street tacos are amazing.  I love the cultural variety they bring from south of the border.  The art and atmosphere are hip but not pretentious.  And the salsa bar is stocked with 20 different unique flavors. Watch out! Some of them are very spicy! Small inside so there was a wait on Friday night, but the service was fast and friendly. Love this place!
