El Toro is great!  We came here on a Friday night and while they weren't busy when we arrived, they were able to seat our party of 7 quickly.  They also allowed us to split our checks 3 ways, which gets a huge PLUS in my book.  Food and service was excellent.  

I look forward to my next return to El Toro II.
