I have been coming to Macayos since I was 6 years old.. I'm 28 now! I use to frequent the West Charelston location during breaks between classes and the family and I live by the Cimmaron location. The shredded beef chimi is always my favorite. Love to start with a TCT and dip it with beans and guacamole or skip the nonsense and just order the Baja Pizza App. Miss the Andes Mints and Flamboyant costumes but the food has always been consistent and delicious for over 10 years. Now only if they'd add chilliquiles to the menu id never have to go to Casa Don Juans again.

Cradle to Grave Customer,
