Jump right in the margaritas are fine! Its a restaurant with a lot of character. I came on karaoke night which was done completely in Spanish! How awsome is that. From just walking in the door could tell this place wasn't you average Mexican spot. The menu offers what I took to be more traditional Spanish dishes and not just chimis and taco salads.  The service was prompt and adequate to be fair I came late night. I got the milanesa....AMAZING. DEEP FRIED STEAK.  The food put me over the moon and the barkeeps were on it. The food is worth what you pay for. The amount you get on your plate is enough to feed a small family and a horse! Well maybe not the horse too but you won't leave hungry. All and all the restaurant is worth your time believe me you won't be disappointed.
