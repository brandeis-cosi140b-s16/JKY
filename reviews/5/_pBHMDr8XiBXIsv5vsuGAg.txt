I met up with a friend after work over here at Otro Cafe. We sat outside since it was so beautiful, since the hot summer days are no fun to sit outside! We shared their quinoa salad and it was so light and refreshing! We each had a 2 tacos and I had a carne asada and one shrimp taco! They were both oh so very delicious! We had some chips and guac and I loved how their green and red salsas came those plastic squeeze tubes! :) I would recommend people to check this place out!
