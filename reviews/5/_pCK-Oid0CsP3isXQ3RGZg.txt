I don't like Burritos but for some reason I love Chipotle's burritos. I always get the same thing: Barbacoa fajita burrito with the cilantro lime rice, black beans, mild salsa and corn salsa. Of course, can't forget the spicy salsa on the side. Yum! For a chain restaurant, it's good, fast and cheap.
