Amazing service, fantastic food, and my only complaint isn't even a complaint: I was too full by the time the main entree came out. lol They give so much complimentary things: grilled jalepeno and onions, bean dip, chips and salsa, soup , and dessert. All complimentary! 

 The staff made my family and I feel right at home and they were just warm and always kept our glasses full. Which is a difficult thing because we drink a lot of water/tea when we eat and always run into trouble with other restaurants not filling our glasses enough. The food was great and I can't say enough wonderful things about this delicious place. Do yourself a favor and go!
Dang I want to go back again cause I'm hungry and want that same service as I had last night
