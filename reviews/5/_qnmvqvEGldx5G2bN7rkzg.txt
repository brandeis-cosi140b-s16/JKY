Let me just tell you... adobada tacos.... BOMB.

It's great authentic mexican food. Super yummy. It gets really busy at times but service is super fast. You just stand in front of the line depending on which type if meat you want. I would suggest standing in the adobada line!!! 

My friends and I always come here late nights. 
If you want mexican food I would come here!
Better than Fausto's and Roberto's. :)

5 stars for sure!
