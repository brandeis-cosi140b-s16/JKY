We're going to keep this simple......OK? 

Do you love Mexican Food? Do you like a small family feel when you go eat? 
Go to this place! Everything is made with love! I walked in, and the owner was there and made my food to order. Had a nice talk with him about Phoenix in general as he basically said he opened his restaurant because Quality Mexican Food can be tough to find in the area.(Most great Mexican places are on the West Side) 
Its about a mile away from my house, and I will be back for sure! 
Fantastic Pastor, great Cabeza, and carne asada made like a backyard cookout!
