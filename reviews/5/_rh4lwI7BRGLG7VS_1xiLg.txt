I've been here a few times now because we enjoyed it so much the first time and I honestly can't wait to go back. Location is not great and even living in the area for years never though of trying it but glad I did. The waiter was quite talkative but he really made the experience fun. He had recommendations from the menu and we ended up ordering the red chili Colorado which was defiantly one to go back for! We also tried the fajitas which were great and my son tore up his chicken taco plate and he isn't much of a Mexican food type of person. Defiantly recommend trying this place out!
