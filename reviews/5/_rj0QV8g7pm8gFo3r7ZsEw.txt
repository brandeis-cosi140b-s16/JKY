THE PLACE FOR SOME GOOD MARISCOS!!  Great and friendly service.  Pretty good quality seafood for the amount you're paying.  Started with some chips and salsa--and I must say that's some good homemade salsa and chips.  I had the vuelva a la vida (shrimp, octopus, oyster seafood cocktail).  I love to throw some Chalula and squeeze two lemons in it. So damn good, cold and refreshing in the summer time.  Also had their michelada (bloody beer)--a definite must!  They have the bottles sugarcane Coca Colas.  Also tried their butterfly fried fish--which tasted amazing.  Tasted like pancakes with grilled onions and side of salad, rice, and tortillas. Such a far drive from where I live, but I will definitely go back.
