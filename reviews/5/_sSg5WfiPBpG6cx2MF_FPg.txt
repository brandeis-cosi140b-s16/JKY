My kids wanted to go back tonight and I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing service we received after having been sorely disappointed with the service during our previous visits in recent times. We were seated with Kyle and he was very friendly and attentive. My kids even loved him. Kyle even helped accommodate my son's special requests. Being exhausted, I was especially appreciative of his willingness to make sure everyone was happy. I called the manager afterwards to compliment Kyle because he certainly deserved the recognition.
