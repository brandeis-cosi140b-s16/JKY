Love this place, I've been coming here fairly regularly for about a year.  The food is always great and the service is spot on.  My two favourite dishes are the Carne Adovada plate and Ruben's Chicken-fried Chicken.  The food definitely is New Mexico style and has a good kick to it, so be prepared for some spice.
