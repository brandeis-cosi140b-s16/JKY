YUM!

Pros:
- really tasty food... like... really tasty
- the chips & salsa come with 3 different salsas, each better than the last!
- the tacos are sort of a build-your-own-taco style, and it's awesome
- our waiter and the manager were very gracious in letting us use their printer so we could use a restaurant.com coupon
- had outdoor and indoor seating

Cons:
- you have to pay for chips & salsa (but they are bottomless)
- it's pretty dang pricey (get yourself a restaurant.com coupon!)
