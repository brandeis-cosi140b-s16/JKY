They have massively awesome margaritas, and are super vegetarian friendly. Had the vegetarian fajitas, and my wife had the chicken burrito.  We both had the black beans. The service was fast, and the staff made a point of making relevant suggestions, and letting us know things we didn't even think to ask. Food beats the hell out of the other Mexican places in town.
