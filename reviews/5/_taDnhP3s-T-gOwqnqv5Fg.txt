Just ate there last night, and I've gotta say, the queso dip gets me every time!  There are several things I love about Moe's:
1.  The kids always want to go because of the cookies
2.  The queso dip has no MSG
3.  The meat is hormone free, the other food is all natural
4.  They always greet you when you come in
5.  The price is great!
We eat at all the locations around, and this one by far is the cleanest.  So if you like burrito bars, and want a little more selection than at other ones (I love you, too, though!) and that queso dip is calling your name, then Moe's is a great choice.
