This is our go-to drive-thru for yummy chicken salads (because we'd rather be golfing than cooking)!

Their cilantro dressing is delish, salads are always fresh, and service/food has always been very good for drive-thru fare!

It's the healthiest fast food option we've found, and the drive thru moves really fast even with a line.
