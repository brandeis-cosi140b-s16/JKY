This place looks pretty rough from the outside, and is easy to miss. On the inside; however, it's quite comfortable and nice. I'm a fan of Horchata in general, but I have to say La Condesa has the best I've ever had. Also, they managed to change my opinion about Mole with their Mole Chicken taco. 

The salsa bar has no equal! Cilantro Salsa, Jicama Salsa, Peanut Salsa, the list goes on an on. You can experience what seems like enless and amazing combinations of flavors.

I'm definitely going back!
