Freaking awesome. Nice to find somewhere that knows how to cook fish.  Chips and salsa are the only item that I'm not a fan of....but you don't go to a seafood place for chips and salsa so it's irrelevant.  Soups are fresh and we'll prepared with a fresh plate of add ins everytime.  Fresh oysters with a nice surprise...shrimp, fish,onion,avocado on top.....yum.  Love all the different ways they prepare the shrimp and fish. If you have ever been down to baja Mexico, Puerto Penasco, Keno Bay, etc...this place will bring back those memories. This place is the real deal with great food and friendly staff....plain and simple.
