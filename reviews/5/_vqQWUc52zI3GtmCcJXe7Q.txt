Delicious!  Just absolutely delicious!  I knew that although its still on the strip, there ain't a gringo in sight.  The first thing you'll notice upon arriving is the aromas of freshly made tortillas, al pastor, asada, grilled scallions & peppers, and a long ass line!  Once you combat the line of indigenous personnel and finally get to order, go hard guys...go hard!

Our spread consisted of al pastor, tripas, lengua, & stomach....all of which are gracefully wrapped in freshly made tortillas that melt-in-yo-mouf!  I couldn't stop talking about these tacos even weeks after my virgin visit, but has since been a must have every time I visit Lost Wages.  

Don't let the long lines discourage you, as a delicious reward will be awaiting at the end....oh did i mention they give you complementary grilled scallions and peppers?  And as much of it as you want!  Having said that, be sure to chase each taco bite with a slurp of grilled scallion "noodles" and a grilled pepper.....you've now discovered the best fucken tacos, prolly in the wasted state of Nevada!  Pictures are included...
