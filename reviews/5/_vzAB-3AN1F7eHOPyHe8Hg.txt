Wow. This place...is super good. Sometimes you just have to get a little off the strip to taste really good (and cheap!) food. Now first off, I'm from California..so the access to Mexican food is easy, but even with all the good places i've been to in L.A. and San Diego, I was blown away. It's a must to visit this place every time I go to Vegas.
