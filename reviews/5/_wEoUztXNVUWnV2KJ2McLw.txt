Best Mexican food I have had since 1999, when I moved to AZ from Texas!
My Fiance` and I have been researching / tasting different authentic Mexican food restaurants for our wedding reception and Espo's uses the best quality ingredients and the food is delicious hands down. The prices are reasonable and Leon "The Owner" and staff are awesome and friendly. We highly recommend calling Leon for a sampling and meeting for your wedding.
