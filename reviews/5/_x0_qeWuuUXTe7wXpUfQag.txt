Yes indeed! This is by far the most authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted in the US. Born in  Chicago but raised in Mexico, this is why my taste buds are very familiar with Mexican cuisine. I ate the Mole Verde and it was fantastic. Besides the great food and margaritas, the place is just amazingly stunning! They have this gorgeous art work that is a wooden piece of Mexico history... I cant find words to explain so please feel free to check the youtube link below you will not have regrets it!
