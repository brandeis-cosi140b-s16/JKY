Cocomo Joe's is a great shady cabana getaway when it is 110 degrees outside. And right near the Desert Ridge mall, close enough but not too close. I am a huge fan of the habanero wings with wasabi dipping sauce on the side. They are seriously hot but sweet and really are what wings are all about- don't order them if you are a wimp, get the sliders. They have 32 oz mugs of beer, and that puts out a lot of fire.
