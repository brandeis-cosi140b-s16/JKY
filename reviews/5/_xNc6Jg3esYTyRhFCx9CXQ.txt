Roberto's is always the place to go in Vegas when you are low on money and very hungry. Sadly I was almost always both of those while I was in Vegas. LOL! My favorite was always the chicken chimi. This thing could fill King Kong up on a hungry day, and I hate to admit this but I loved how greasy and unhealthy it is. Go chimis! Go Roberto's!
