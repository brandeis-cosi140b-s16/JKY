I retract my past review ....very very tasty and delicious! 5 stars! I had a chicken burrito chimi style, and 2 carne asada tacos, both fantastically seasoned! I will be a return customer for sure! 

The staff is very friendly and they take a personal interest in their customers. The girl at the front counter remembered me from my last visit, even though it was some time ago. Another customer came in while I was deciding on what I wanted to get, and she remembered that customer as well! A+ service and quality!

Good place to go for lunch or dinner, rather you just want a nice place to sit and eat, or you are in a hurry and want something fresh and delicious!
