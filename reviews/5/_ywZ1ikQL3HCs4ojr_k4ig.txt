Awesome, new 2nd location of my favorite taco shop in Las Vegas.
Not much more to say than I've said in my 5-star review of their original location - I refer to this place again and again as my benchmark for street tacos and nachos.
Service is professional and friendly, and their fresh-made salsas are spectacular.
If you've got your favorite LA taco spot, you will be more than happy with this one.
Keep it up guys!
