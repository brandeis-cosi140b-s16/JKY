I must...type...fast...slipping into...a nacho coma...  Not sure what this guy puts on his chips but they're like crack.  
Let me start by saying that I'm a Southern California native so I have access to some of the best Mexican food/tacos/salsas, etc.  Rosarita's makes their own (delicious) salsas and all orders are made fresh for you.  I had the Super Nachos with Chicken and a Salmon Taco with Carmelized Pineapple.  Delish.  
I seriously can't stop eating these chips. I hope I brought some stretchy pants with me.
