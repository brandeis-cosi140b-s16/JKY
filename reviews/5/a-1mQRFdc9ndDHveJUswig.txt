The search for awesome tacos led us here. The appearance may be unappealing, so you MUST overlook that. It is simply a food truck in an empty lot, with some tables with benches under blue tarp for shade. The truck is painted with "Taqueria La Hacienda," located just east of the ally next to The Meat Shop at 2nd St. The tacos come with your choice of meat, plus onions & cilantro. Everything is chopped tiny, which is a plus for me. They have guacamole, red, and green sauces in squeeze bottles. Didn't try the green, but the red and guac are both good. The al pastor is the BEST I've ever had. It was so crispy and delicious! I wish I had a burrito full of it! The asada was also good, as well as the lengua according to my husband. The drink selection was okay: regular Coke cans, bottled water, Mexican bottled Coke (YUM!), and a few different bottled Jarritos. According to their menu, they have breakfast items as well. They are there Monday-Thursday 8am only until about 12pm/1pm, but weekends stay late into the night (2am-ish I think). This is definitely the place to hit up after partying on Fri/Sat nights and well worth the drive from the north valley!
