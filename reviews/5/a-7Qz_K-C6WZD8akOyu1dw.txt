Today we had a meal par excellence at Condesa!  My sister and Mom raved about the restaurant and I was excited to go.  I noticed some of the prior reviews had so-so service but my experience was very good. Our party of 5 was seated promptly and chips and drinks brought out pretty quick. The salsas were great but I liked the pecan salsa the best. My wife had chicken mole tacos which were tasty and even the beans have that authentic mex taste that is hard to find. Quesadillas were interesting and almost pastry-like in presentation, I had the Argentine beef w
Chimichurri sauce and it was awesome. A overall great experience and we shall return. Oh and margaritas were NOT from crappy sweet mix. Fresh lime juice and authentic!!
