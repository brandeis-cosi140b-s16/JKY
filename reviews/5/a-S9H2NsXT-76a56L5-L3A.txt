Legit! That's all you need to know. This installation is in very laid back neighborhood, some out door seating, perfect for dinner with a margarita, any day. I had combination dinner with chicken burrito and beef flautas. I was so full. Our company ordered a dish with shrimp and poblano in cream sauce, can't remember the name of the dish, but it was Awesome!! Their margarita was okay. Not enough kick for me. Honestly, I liked presidente from Chili's better :P
