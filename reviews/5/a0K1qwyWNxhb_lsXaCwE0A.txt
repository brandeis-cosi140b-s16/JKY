really liked this little gem in the middle of a seemingly" ghetto" strip mall...would have never found it if we weren't looking.  Went on a Fri nite- place was packed..and by place i mean they have 3 sit down tables and probably 8 spots at the bar.  Tiny Tiny Tiny..and rather loud- but great ambience.  Food was OUT OF THIS WORLD.
I had the Taos Combo( special)- steak quesidilla, grilled shrimp and sausage....i know it sounds boring- but clearly i cannot remember all the wonderful details or it would sound a lot better..just know it tasted great.  We also ordered the Trio( chile relleno, tamale and chicken burro)- delicious..rice and beans also to die for.  Took half of it home as portion sizes were huge  - Very extensive and decent-priced wine selections also
