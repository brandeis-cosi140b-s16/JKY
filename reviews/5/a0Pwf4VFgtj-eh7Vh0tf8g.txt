When it comes to nightlife I usually hit a dance club, but a friend of mine decided to switch it up last Saturday and do Sandbar. Having never been there I thought a restaurant would be an odd place to spend a Saturday night, thankfully I was wrong!

The bouncers at the front managed the line very well, they were efficient and friendly. Once in, the place itself was colorful and very lively. The crowd was young, mostly in their twenties with a few older groups. The bars are huge and there is an actual dance floor (which I was surprised and greatly thankful for). The drinks were normal priced and the bartenders that helped my friend and I were very sweet and nice. Great security and bartenders, overall wonderful staff and service. 

There's indoor as well as outdoor seating and outside there is actually sand which I thought was cute hence "sandbar." Although it was raining that night, the rain didn't fly  in or get us wet, the heaters were also on and were placed strategically well around, keeping the place consistently warm despite being opened to the cold and wet night. The bathrooms were clean and brightly lit to be able to fix makeup and check yourself properly. 

The crowd was good too. We weren't harassed and we were able to keep our spot by the bar without any problems. Overall, everyone seemed nice and chill.

Oh and the DJ was great! There was a mix of electronic music as well as hip hop throughout the night.

It was a good night. Although, we were there just to drink and dance, not really to eat - so next time I'll try actually ordering food, seeing how this place is a restaurant. :P
