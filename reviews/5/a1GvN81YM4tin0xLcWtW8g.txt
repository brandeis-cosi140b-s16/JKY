Now we're talkin.  Came back here with my brother here on a Sunday evening.  The Yelp hype has made this place a heck of a lot busier than it was last time.  This time I skipped the fish and went straight for the meats.  5 street tacos plus a side of rice and a small horchata all for $12.  I went with a different meat for each taco (carne asada, cochinita pibil, spicy chicken, el pastor, and carnitas).  Topped each with cilantro, veggies, and some cheese.  Absolutely fantastic and at a great price.  The menu is a little more organized and expansive than the last time I was here so it seems that this place has gotten in a groove now.  The staff was just as friendly and the setup was just as quirky as my first visit.  So yes, now I'm a believer.  Great tacos, great prices, great hidden gem.  Viva Los Santos!
