This is one of my absolute favorite mexican food restaurants. My family has been eating at the original location about once a week since 1997 of 1998.  We now go to all the locations, just depends on where we are in the valley. There has not been a thing on the menu that I have tried that I did not love. If you are looking for fresh, fast mexican food this is definitely worth the stop. My favorite is a bean and cheese burro and a beef taco.
