Have come here a few times and the food is great, the salsa is great (especially the green) but more then all of that, the service is great! Most of the time you go, Maldonado is there and talks with random customers often. It really has a neighborhood type feel when you are there and talking with the various staff members. 

In fact, today is a late Sunday night and I was dreaming of a mucho macho burrito but looked at the clock and realized they closed in 25 mins. I jumped in the truck and was there in about 2 mins. I could tell they were wrapping up for the night and I didn't want to be the guy who places a last min order, but before I could even ask if they were done for the night, the guy behind the grill walked over to me and asked me what sounded good tonight! I mentioned a carne asada burrito with tots and his eyes lit up, to which he responded "I live to make that burrito!" He throws the tort on the grill and asks me "do you want it a little special?" I was intrigued and absolutely obliged. He handed me a cup and said "go to the salsa bar and give me a few scoops of the green." I watch as he constructs what could only be described as a chipotle sized burrito and he even threw in some extra rice that they had! He artfully layered together tortilla, tots, meat, green salsa, queso, and rice.....talk about legit! 

I haven't even bit into this amazing burrito yet, but was genuinely impressed with this gentleman behind the grill tonight! I was kind of expecting the staff to be short with me due to the late night order so close to closing, instead I was treated to a pleasant conversation and deluxe carne asada burrito with tots! Top notch!
