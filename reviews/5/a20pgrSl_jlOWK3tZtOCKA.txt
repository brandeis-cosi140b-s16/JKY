So Yummy!  and the decor is awesome!!!  Though it can get pretty loud. 

This restaurant was my first experience eating Fried Ice Cream!  All I can say is wow!  What a creation!  Drizzled with a little honey and I'm in heaven. 

Their fajitas are so good and the grilled leeks they include are also super good.  I've never had fajitas with grilled leeks before.  I also LOVE their quesadilla.  

Just remember they are CLOSED on Mondays.  I seem to always forget that and must crave Mexican on Mondays because every time we pull up on a Monday we both go awwwww in unison.
