A few days ago I was walking to Bob's copy shop and was looking for a quick lunch spot, this was an amazing choice!  Apparently the new owners picked up a taco restaurant that failed miserably... This place will be here to stay because of their great selection, incredible tacos, and prime location for the drinkers of the town. 


Tonight I came here with my girlfriend because we have been desperately seeking good quick Mexican food in Madison for years - we have finally found the perfect place!  Tacos with such great flavor that overeating is an assured fate...

Buy 3 tacos get beans and rice for free - three tacos with beans and rice will feed two people, probably get a fourth taco though if sharing.

Great sauces, especially the quote warm avocado jalape√±o salsa verde!

The veggie taco is a bit spicy - and I told them to never tone it down because the flavor is great; be warned though... Three veggie tacos would light most people up.

Can't wait to come here again!
