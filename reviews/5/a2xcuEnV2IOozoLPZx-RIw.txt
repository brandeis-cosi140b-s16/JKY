Came here because of a bad experience at florindinos... ( I should have known better) the food here is always amazing.  The staff is very attentive and the place was packed! (it's almost 2pm on a Wednesday!) my server was busy with larger parties but my drink was never empty! (Araceli) I've never had a bad experience here!
