Ok, so for the most part of the almost 26 years I have lived here in Mesa I never knew there was a Mexican Restaurant at this location. Now I know this is a new owner as of this past January and was under a different name, but come on. I used to go to the Chinese Restaurant right off of Gilbert in the same shopping plaza, this place is kinda hidden, but wow I think you will all like this place. 
Once you walk in, it is a bright and colorful decoration, bar to the left and main restaurant ahead and when it cools down a patio out to the right outside the restaurant. Very nicely decorated patio, I must say, I can't wait till it cools down. 
On to the food.... I got the tacos and my girlfriend got the chimichanga and that came with fresh salad and fresh meat and vegetables in the chimi. The tacos were just as good. The manager of the place, Everett was probably one of the nicest guys, not fake either, which is a change for the restaurant industry. Cause you know how that goes, How is your meal, folks. Like you really give a crap, just shut up and let me eat in peace. This guy really cared and wanted to help grow this business. He also introduced us to the Michelada con Cervesa, A fancy way of saying adding your beer to Clamato Juice, lime juice, hot sauce, soy sauce and pepper and other seasonings, WHICH was awesome!!! Never would of tried it, Thanks Everett!!! 
Good Luck with the place, We will definitely tell everyone we know and recommend this to all. Please drive pass Serrano's and Tia Rosa's and check this place out. 
Great flavor, Fresh food and not watery and running all together on your plate, like the normal places.
