Ranch Market rocks!  I swear, this is the coolest place, it's like a big Mexican circus.  I could hang out in there for hours.

The best deal that I've found there is the roasted chicken.  For about five dollars, you get a whole roasted chicken, some tortillas, and some salsa.  Buy a little cheese, an onion, and some sour cream and you've got yourself a little taco bar to take home and eat with some Dos Equis.  Sweet!  Since I'm all about the bargains these days, this is one of the best places to go!

A definite five stars as far as I'm concerned!
