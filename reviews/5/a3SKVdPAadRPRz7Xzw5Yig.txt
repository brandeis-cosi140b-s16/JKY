I love Mexican Food and Chinese Food and who would've thought... together? 

The place looks like a taco shop in the ghetto but who cares. The panda is wearing a sombrero and has a mustache and is holding a bowl of rice. The lady lets you sample some of the favorites which is unique because most restaurants you're stuck with guessing. 

I ordered a jade chicken quesadilla and ginger chicken with rice and beans. The food is amazing and whoever thought of this idea is genius. They give you a cookie with their order but my friend ordered "snickerdoodle" because it sounds funny. It was a cinnamon cookie.  

And their on the wall it says "The Great Wall of Chino." Someday I'll be on that wall :)
