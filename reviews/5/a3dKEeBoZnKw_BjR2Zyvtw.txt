Their food is delicious and decent priced! Close to where we live which is a major plus! We got the asada nachos which were huge, California burrito which was huge as well,  and asada mini tacos all were very good! The sauces were good as as well. Way better than all the other mexican places around. I just wish they had the carrots!
