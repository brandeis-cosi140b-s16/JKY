In a sea of Mexican Food restaurants this one is a treasure.
It's Santa Fe style cuisine which is a very nice change of pace.
I've been two times and have tried at least 5 different dishes.
The food here is QUALITY! Perhaps one of the best places in the valley. The ingredients taste fresh and the flavors are unique and over the top delicious.

The chile relleno is amazing. The perfect balance of crispy and cheesy.
Their pork adovado is amazing and anything with it is astounding. 
We even took our 3 year old and the typical kid menu of chicken fingers tasted like quality. 

The inside is clean and has some nice decor that's funkier than your average south west or mexican decor. 
Service has always been quick, friendly and very eager to talk about the menu. 

This is the new place for taking out of town guests and family.
