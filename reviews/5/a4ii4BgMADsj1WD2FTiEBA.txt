I have only been here once, but I really liked it and will be going back soon:) 

I met some friends here for happy hour one Friday after work and totally love it. They have awesome $5 plates in the bar and the portions are enough to share. We had the bacon wrapped scallops which came with four different sauces, they were excellent (and I'm not a big fan of scallops) and the mushroom and brie toasts (you can't go wrong when brie is involved). The food was awesome and the bartender recommended a glass of Cabernet for me, which was perfect. He didn't try to sell me on anything, he just listened to what I like and suggested I try this one. I wish I could remember what it was called, I guess I'll just have to go back. 

The ambiance is cool, the bar is downstairs, very cavern-like, I dug it. It is definitely someplace you could get cozy with your date, there is a big fireplace and lots of dark booths. The only complaint I had, which didn't even really affect me, it was so dark upstairs that I would not want to eat dinner there. It took my eyes a good two minutes just to adjust after walking in. I don't know how the staff works in that environment, but the bar was not as dark, and of course that lighting is more appropriate in an underground bar. 

The staff was really friendly and talkative, they were engaged in conversations with all of the guests sitting at the bar and they seemed to really enjoy being at work....rare in the service industry. 

Definitely check this place out, just don't sit in my seat at the bar.
