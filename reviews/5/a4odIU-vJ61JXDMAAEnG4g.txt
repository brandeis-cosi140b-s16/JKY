Never would have walked into this place on my own but fortunately was with some trusted friends. Wow. What a hidden gem. Food so flavorful and just the right amount of heat in it. Have been back many times and even if I lived more than a mile away, would still make the trek here. Definitely worth it and prices so low, you can still fill your gas tank.
