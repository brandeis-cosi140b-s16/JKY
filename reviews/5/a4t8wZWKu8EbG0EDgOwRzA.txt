Wow! Who would have thought...amazing BBQ and good burritos inside a small shack in a remote orange grove? Very, very good 1/2 pound pulled pork sandwich and good but spicy sauce. Definitely going back...probably tomorrow -- only negative was they forgot to put slaw on my sandwich and charged me for it
