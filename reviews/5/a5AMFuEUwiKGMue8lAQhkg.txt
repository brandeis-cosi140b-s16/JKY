I was staying at The Clarendon for a trip in Phoenix recently (always a pleasure staying there, I love it!) and I got to experience the Clarendon Kitchen and C4 for the first time.  The last time I was at the Clarendon this restaurant and bar were not in place.  

So I had two primary interactions with Clarendon Kitchen and C4; one was the room service food and the other was the rooftop bar (amazing!!).  Let's start with the food... I generally like to order different items on a menu if I'm staying at a place for a while because I like to experience the variety.  The first time I ordered from Clarendon Kitchen I though the Chorizo Mac and Cheese and the Southwest Chicken Wings looked really good so I ordered them (admittedly a little bit guiltily because they're not exactly on my diet).  My goodness... they were delicious!  In fact, I loved those items so much that I ordered them again the next day, breaking my own rules.  In addition to the great food, the people who delivered the food were very nice and friendly and the service was extremely fast.

While staying at the Clarendon I had some people come to the hotel to meet me for drinks.  We went up to the rooftop bar just as the sun was setting and the bar was opening.  I cannot begin to describe how nice it was; the view was amazing, the weather was perfect.  Seeing the gorgeous pool down below and all of mid-town and downtown phoenix all around... it was amazing.  The bar wasn't super fancy, but the decor was very nice, the bar tender was attentive and the prices were even good, especially considering such a fantastic ambiance.  

I couldn't possibly recommend a more fun, funky and beautiful place to bring a group of friends or a date for a drink in Phoenix.  You can really soak in all that Phoenix has to offer.
