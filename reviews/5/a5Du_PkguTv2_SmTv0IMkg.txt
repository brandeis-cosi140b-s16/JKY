We love Los Tacos. We used to get the steak tacos with everything on them, but have recently switched to the burrito, as it is both cheaper and more food than two tacos.  I've had most of the meats, and would recommend the steak over any of the others, as it is more flavorful and better seasoned.  The only down side is that it's a  little pricey for what you get, especially if you add avocado (even though they are VERY generous with the amount of avocado they put on the tacos).
