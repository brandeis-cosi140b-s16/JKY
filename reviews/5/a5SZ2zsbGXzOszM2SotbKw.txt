They seated us within a few Minutes which was nice, they were busy but not packed. 
Our waitress (her name wasn't on the check and she did not wear a name tag) was very nice and helped me by explaining the vegetarian options. I got the tofu torta and it was awesome! I love when people are so helpful in explaining menu alternatives. My friends really liked their (meat) dishes as well.
