Started coming here 25 years ago with my grandparents. It's still my go to today for authentic Mexican food. When I lived in NY for 5 years, one of my first stops every visit was here. Or my grandma would pick up a huge order from here and we'd go at it around the family table at her house. We don't go for the ambience, but the food is fantastic. They keep it simple, and the staff is always very nice. Love their beef hard tacos, the cheese enchiladas, and there is nothing like their chips and hot sauce. Get a dozen flour tortillas to take home, they'll be gone in no time. And the price is perfect! Highly recommended!
