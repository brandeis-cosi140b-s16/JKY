I'm a Vegetarian so I'm always happy when I see the word "Veggie" (in any language!) and the Vegetariano Burrito totally fit the script.  I came here after school one day with only a few dollars in my pocket hoping to find something that was a little cheaper than the $600.00 cookie they sell in the University cafeteria (I'm kidding about the price ...but seriously it's like this big *hand motion* and stupidly expensive...!)

Anyway.  
I was extremely happy to find this place a few blocks away.  I used to take classes at CSN (it's right across the street) so I can't believe I never noticed it before.  So I went inside and was extremely pleased with everything.  The place is clean and the staff speak English (always a plus ...though I do speak pretty fluent spanish so I guess it really doesn't matter lol.)  

The Vegetariano Burrito was extremely tasty.  It was BIG too,which I liked, especially for the price.  I'd reccomend it even for meat-eaters.

I've since come here almost weekly (or more) and they've always had my order quickly and never gotten it wrong.  Oh, and try the juices on the counter - their Horchata is very good, but I'm a big fan of the Naranjo myself!!  (They also have a TV with various Spanish soaps playing...if you want to stick around.)
