OMG! 
Just moved to the neighborhood a week or so ago and had a craving for fish tacos. I knew this place was up the street so I stopped in on my way home from work.
The Fish Taco plate was reasonably priced at $6.19. The little waitress at the drive-thru window was a doll. Asking if I wanted hot sauce I responded that I  wanted the hotest they had.  She gave me both the red and the green telling me that heat was relative and to try both. Fair enough.
When I got home and opened the to-go container I was greeted to 2 HUGE tacos and a generous portion if refried beans and rice. I tried the beans first, cause in my book it you can't get the refried beans right the rest if the meal with most likely suck.
Lemme tell you...these were the most flavorful refried beans I've ever had! Anywhere. Including my own.
This was going to be a great meal!!
The fish tacos were made of cod fried in a light batter with pico de gallo, shredded cabbage, and a spicy cream sauce. Heaven! The best I've had since Denver!
The meal was so good I finished the entire container, and that never happens.
Try this little Mexican place, I can only imagine everything on the menu us this good. And trust me, I will be trying everything!
