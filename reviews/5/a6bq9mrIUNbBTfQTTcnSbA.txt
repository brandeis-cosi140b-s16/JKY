This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant in the valley.  The chips and salsa are just the way I like: chips not too thick with a good amount of salt; salsa is chunky and flavorful. I've had several things on the menu, but my favorite is the nachos with machaca beef.  Service has always been good every time I've gone.
