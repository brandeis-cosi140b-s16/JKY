This place is SOOO GREAT ! My friend brought me here swearing the albondigas were good since I know of no place anywhere that can make them good and she was right ! Its like being home! I also tried some of their green chili burrito which also was great! It is just a little hole in the wall mexican place.. but its hard to find a good mexican place - it really did not disappoint and I look forward to going here over and over!
