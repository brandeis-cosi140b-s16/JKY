2nd trip for breakfast! Wow even better. It was early Saturday morning after I finished a project in the neighborhood so I found myself all alone in the place. Greeted right away. Had my favorite huevos this time with chorizo. Wow spicy good enjoyed every bite. Still have a the navajo taco on my bucket list. Maybe tonight. 

Greatest green chili in the valley hands down!
