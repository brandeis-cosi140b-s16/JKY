This place was a very pleasant surprise.  Im one of thoses pickey eaters that always has a problem with their food.. That is, untill I went to the Carefree Station. I sat in the patio area which is more of a shaded garden and quite beautifull at that.  Being the picky eatter that i am, i settled on the breakfast burger.  When it arrived I was quite taken.. Instead of your average bacon and egg burger with patato chips, i saw before me a veritable artistic masterpiece. To my delight, it tasted every bit as good as it looked.  Each bite was a culinary symphony of flavors.  All of the ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection.  Then, to top it off, there was the artisan bun... Well i must say that it puts me at a loss for words, something that rarely happens.. Aside from the beautifull food and ambiance, the friendly server's and final price made the whole experience seem magical..
