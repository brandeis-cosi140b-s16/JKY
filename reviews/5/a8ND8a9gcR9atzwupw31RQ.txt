I went to this place for a late breakfast. i was craving some menudo. but when i looked at the menu i sooo wanted to change my mind. some of their tacos and buritos looked so delicious. but i stuck with the menudo. boy i was not disapointed. this was one of first times i took a sip without adding anything. and it was perfect. well seasoned.
i just added the norm some lemon and cilantro. the only thing was i would have liked more meat in my bowl. other than that i will return.
