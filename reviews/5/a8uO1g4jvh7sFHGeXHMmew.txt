I was visiting from L.A. and my friend said he'd been there and thought I would like it. Ok. I have my faves: I'm a fan of chile rellenos, I like hard shell tacos and my regular order is a chicken enchilada with salsa verde. Which one, which one.... All three! Piggy. It was the best taco of my life, fresh made tortilla slightly pinched in at the top with A+ cheese and fresh, cold lettuce and a large amount of deliciously prepared shredded chicken. I wanted more than one but then.... I had ordered a taste of the mole and was blown away by the fresh spices I could taste, definitely NOT a mix. Chicken enchilada was served with a skirt surround of melted cheese that was so beautiful I'm sorry I didn't photograph it first. I took half of that home with me and intended to do the same for the chile relleno, but I couldn't - I ate every bit but for a little taste to my friend, and it was not small. You go for the food, right? They serve Negro Modelo and the best Mexican food I've had in a very long time. I cannot recommend this culinary fix enough. Not that I'd move there but you Phoenixians are lucky to have this culinary treat and with such reasonable pricing.
