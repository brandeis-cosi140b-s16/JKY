I had the coltel de camaron and on the side I also ordered 2 tostada de ceviche thinking I wasn't going to be full. And boy was I wrong I was stuffed. When my tostadas came out I couldn't believe how big they were  I'm used to getting little ones and this was big. They put alot of ceviche!  Worth the money. I've never been here since I'm from az and I had a good experience
