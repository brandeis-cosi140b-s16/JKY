Don Jose is my FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant in the valley!!!! I've been eating here every week since I was 5yrs old. 
The service is great the quality of their Mexican food compares to none, and more affordable than any Mexican food restaurant in the area! 
The owner, Matt, is extremely friendly and cares most of all for his customers.
It's great to see its still ran by great people for all these years.
