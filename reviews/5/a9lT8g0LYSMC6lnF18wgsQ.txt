After a meeting this morning decided to stop for lunch on the way back to the office . . . and decided to look for something in the area.  Found a Chipolte restaurant on the the southeast corner of McDowell and 7th Avenue . . . hadn't been in the area in a while, and was I surprized to see all the new business.

First the food . . . Had a Chicken Burrito Bowl with rice, corn, cheese, lettuce, and hot salsa . . . full of flavor and the perfect size for lunch.  Also had some chips . . . they tasted fresh and wre nice and crispy.

The lunch was a good four plus stars, but the astmosphere and vibe will all the restaurants in this little area definately pushed it up to five stars . . . can't wait to go back and try out one of the other restaurants in the area.
