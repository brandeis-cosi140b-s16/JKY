We came for dinner and it was delicious.  Everything was fresh and the restaurant very clean.  My dinner companion was unfamiliar with Mexican food as he is Dutch, and the waitress very kindly let him sample their drinks - horchata, jamaica and agua de tamarindo.   I had the ceviche which was amazing, and my companion had enchiladas. He practically licked his plate to get every last drop.
