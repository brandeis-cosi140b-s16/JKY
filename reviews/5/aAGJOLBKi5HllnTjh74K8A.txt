I'm new to Arizona and originally from Chicago so i'm use to the Mexican style of food (Barrio Style).  I've tried several restaurants in search of something that comes close to the flavors of barrio style and not the southwestern/baja mexican fusion i've been running into.  I may have gotten lucky but my first experience was truly delightful.  First, the service was slow but we were in no hurry.  Our waiter was kind and pleasant to my family along with the rest of the staff.  I asked for his recommendation between the Shrimp w/Diablo sauce and the Chicken w/Mole sauce.  It's always difficult to turn down Mole but i followed his recommendation to try the shrimp.  It came with 8 Jumbo shrimps with this incredible diablo sauce.  The sauce was well balanced with tomato's, onions and spices and with a squirt of lime, the flavors just burst in my mouth.  It all came together with the rice and beans and had to take a moment with each spoonfull to enjoy all the flavors that were in each bite.   The spicy sauce, the acidity of the lime and the sweetness of the shrimp, the perfect combination.   Usually most places do not give enough sauce but this dish was drowning in this unblelievable sauce.  It was spicy but not overwhelming, perfect for my palate.  To complete the dining experience, you have to try the fried ice cream.  A sweet sugar dusted fried tortilla bowl containing a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in corn flakes and fried, then drizzled with chocolate and caramel.....ingenious concoction!  I'm am looking forward to going back and trying the Chicken w/Mole and hoping to get the same experience.
