Ok, I have dined here for many, many years (under new ownership) and the thing that keeps me coming back every time are the chips and salsa.  Hot, and fresh chips with just the right amount of saltiness, with salsa that includes a multitude of ingredients, I can honestly say this is the best salsa I've had at any restaurant, period.  As much as I frequent Mexican restaurants, or visit Mexico for that matter, that says a lot for Rancho.  I will drive out of my way just to have a basket of warm tortilla chips placed in front of me with fragrant, almost spicy, salsa to accompany it.  But this is just the precursor to the meal.  The "Chili Relleno" is phenomenal, light and fluffy with a smattering of cotija cheese on top--an excellent dish Rancho has continued and mastered. The guacamole is seasoned perfectly with chunks of tomato and avocado and is gourmet and creamy.
On to the main dishes, and to many patrons delight, the Carne Asada and the Fajitas Ardientes are decidedly authentic.  We'll start with the Carne Asada, generous portions of beautiful Angus Beef that slice easily with a fork.  Tender, and a secret recipe guarded well by the Chef, the Carne Asada receives the most compliments and rave reviews from everyone.  The show-stopper is Fajitas Ardientes--flames shooting high from tequila and a marinade of adobo sauce, and varied spices always turn the heads of restaurant patrons.  And who doesn't love tequila?!!  
Now, for the best part.  Sunday is a very generous CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH!!  Inexpensive, a HUGE assortment of hot and cold stations such as an omelet bar, taco bar, menudo, fruit stations, waffle stations, desserts, and agua fresco.  Did I mention Champagne??  If you're lucky, mariachis will serenade you, but only if you want them to.  Otherwise, they're unobtrusive.
Visit Rancho Papa Chulo's and try any of their amazing dishes.  Seriously good food and friendly staff!
