BEST. TACOS. EVER.

There used to be located on the strip by the Wynn but that one closed down :( anyways I came here around 3am on a Saturday night, or well actually Sunday early morning and the place was still pretty packed!! That's how you know the tacos are amazing. 

Anyways, onto the tacos. I got an asada, adobada & lengua. They were all DELICIOUS. And I need to say that I am not a fan of lengua. For some reason, it does not taste good to me. But the times I've tried lengua, which isn't that much. The 2 times I've actually really enjoyed lengua was from this place. SO GOOD. 

They make all of their tortillas from scratch too!!
