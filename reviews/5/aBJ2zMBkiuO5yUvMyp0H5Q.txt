It's been a while since I've been to On the Border. I think it was when I was in college when I first went and it was pretty wack. It was beyond wack... I couldn't believe this place existed. I guess they did an overhaul on the menu... perhaps I have the restaurants confused... oh well... This day! Kat made the experience and food great. Sometimes when the food is okay, the staff makes the people come back. Kat hooked us up with extra and gave us tips on the food. I've been here a couple times but this time was the best. I customized my fajitas and got the pulled pork and grilled chicken. I put the saut√©ed onions, peppers, guacamole, sour cream, refrained beans, queso, shredded cheese, and salsa. 

Yea... I'm one of those people who puts a lot of sh*t in my eggs... But I like it. Chips and salsa are good. Definitely coming back to this location, especially if Kat is here.
