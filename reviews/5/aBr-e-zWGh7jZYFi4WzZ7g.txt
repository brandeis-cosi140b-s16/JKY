They're just so nice here. And it was just so clean. And so very close to the Mesa Gateway airport (not like, walking distance at all... but once you leave the airport you're pretty much there) and I'll be darned if a big ol' burrito isn't what you want when you get off of the plane.

So that's what I had a few weeks back. I've been exploring lots of local businesses in the area, but I gave the old standby another taste-a-roo and it was good. I always go with the Especial burrito. It's packed with lots of stuff, the least of which is guacamole. You can add guac to anything, but this is truly especial. I go with the chicken, but not matter the protein, be sure to get the green sauce from the salsa bar and slather it on.

I've had many a good taco from these guys as well--those fish tacos are the real deal. But for me, post flight, it's all about the burrito.
