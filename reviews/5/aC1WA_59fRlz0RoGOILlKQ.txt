I used to pick up nachos once in a while from El Pollo Loco and thought they were the best I'd be able to find at a drive through fast food joint.  Then I tried the nachos at Filberto's and thought they were infinitely better.  THEN one day I tried the ones at Betitos, and those are my new standard for greatness!  They're amazing!  It's also hard not to love anything that comes in their delicious tortillas.  There are still a couple things on the menu I like better at Filberto's, so my recommendation - go to both places, order everything on the menu, and enjoy the process of discovery. ;)
