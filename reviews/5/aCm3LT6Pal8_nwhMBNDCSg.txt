I'm a huge fan of Blue Adobe, and have been for years.  The food is consistently fresh, delicious, and as well as unique compared to the dozens of other choices in the area.  The owner Michael puts his heart into his restaurant and his committment and passion comes accross not only in the food, but in how well he treats his staff and his customers.  If you haven't had the opportunity to enjoy Blue Adboe...I highly recommend giving it a try...it's earned a place in my top restaurant recommendations in Scottsdale.
