El Rico's Dos is a perfect example of what traditional Mexican cuisine should be. They offer all of the everyday Mexican dishes like enchiladas, tacos, chimichangas and anything else you can think of. I haven't found one item on the menu I don't like.
Their chips and salsa are delicious and bottomless. One can get carried away if not careful :] If you like salsa with a kick ask for a side of their hotter salsa. It packs a real punch. 
They offer an array of bottles beers along with a selection of fine tequilas for margaritas or on the rocks if thats what you like.
Also if you decide to stop by on a Tuesday they have a special including $2 tacos and/or Tecates. You can't go wrong with this incredible deal. Their shredded beef and chicken tacos are excellent. 
This establishment is very family oriented and the owners care deeply about customer experience and satisfaction. So don't be surprised if Rich the founder of El Rico's Dos stops by your table to ask how everything is. 
In conclusion this restaurant is by far one of the best Mexican joints I have visited. I have never had a bad experience here and I most likely never will. 

P.S. Their Queen Creek location has recently closed down but this location serves everything the other one did if not more.
