The Hotdog de Sonora Torta was delicious!  I definitely appreciate how they thoughtfully combine the traditional with the modern.   My server was the sweetest little bohemian angel.   The place has good vibes,  good parking and it is very reasonably priced especially considering it is good quality food that tastes like it came from my nanas kitchen!  I am definitely coming back to try the nopales and Cafe flan.
