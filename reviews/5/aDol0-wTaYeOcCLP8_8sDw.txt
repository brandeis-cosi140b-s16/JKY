I wasn't even hungry but ate a burrito, chips and salsa and a combo platter. That's how good the food was! 

My cousin, who lives in Anthem, mentioned that Roberto's had been on Food Network. There was no line, luckily, and I was ready to wait for the food. 

I ate the carnitas platter and the carne asada burrito. Wow they're tasty. And I loved seeing all the beers on ice at the counter.
