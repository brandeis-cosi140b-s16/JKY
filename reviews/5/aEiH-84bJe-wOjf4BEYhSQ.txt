My brother and I came back into town from a long day of snowboarding in UT and wanted some wholesome healthy Mexican food, so we hit up El Dorado Cantina on a recommendation.  We were not disappointed.  The food was top notch and the staff is super friendly!  Our server was Annabelle and she was super friendly, professional, and took care of us until we left!  Many thanks!  We also met Jesse (manager) and he was super cool and made sure we were well taken cared of.  Melanie (the GM) also swung by our table to make sure everything was in order.  Chef Paco also came out and greeted us!  The flan is his grandmother's recipe and it was so creamy and delicious and I definitely recommend it to finish off your meal.  No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed.  On top of that, everything is organic!  I'm definitely coming back when I go back to Vegas!
