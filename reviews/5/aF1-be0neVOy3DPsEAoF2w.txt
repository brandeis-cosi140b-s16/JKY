Went with a friend who raved about the nachos. I saw the taco shells being made fresh and so I decided on the 3 chicken taco meal. The pico was filled with jalape√±os and fresh tomatoes. 

The nachos were piled with well seasoned black angus steak: carne asada. The chips crispy. 

The "b4" breakfast burrito has chorizo, eggs and potato. It was delicious and came with an horchata.
