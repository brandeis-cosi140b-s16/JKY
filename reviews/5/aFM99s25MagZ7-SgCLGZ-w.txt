This place is so good! Very authentic and great prices! 
I had the chicken chimichanga which was awesome. It came with rice, beans, and pico on the side and it was plenty of food for one person. 
My friends had the beef tacos and they also looked amazing with just the right amount of cilantro. Just make sure you ask for cheese if you like cheese on tacos like I do.
I would defiantly eat here again and for the cheap price why not!
