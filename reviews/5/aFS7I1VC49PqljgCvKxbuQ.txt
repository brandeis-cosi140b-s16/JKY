Food is just too awesome. Highly recommend! Tortillas are handmade which makes it even more awesome so let's add more stars.shrimp Coctel is a plus and the tacos is just yum yum crazy. love the chile rellenos but not a fan for the red sauce but decided to try it and it's actually pretty good, kids loved the quesadilla, so if your looking for a new frequent place to eat this would be the spot.
