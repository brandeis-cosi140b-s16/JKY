After dinning at this place over the last year and a half as my last minute effort to actually gets dinner in a pinch (some nights) that won't blow my nutrition plan, I can confidently say that this is the best location in the city! My order is always accurate, the food is always hot and fresh and the people are always prompt and courteous. 

Kudos to El Pollo Loco for stepping outside the norm of fast food and offering things like the chicken avocado bowl and the chicken and shrimp platter served with broccoli! So good and so right on. Also, the sauces actually are fresh and made with real ingredients with real spice - it's tastes authentic rather than pre-fab out of a package.
