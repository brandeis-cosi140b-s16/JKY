I usually can find something wrong in a restaurant, and maybe I will after a couple of visits here, but so far, I love this place.  My husband is a OTR driver so when he comes home, I will yelp out as many new places as possible.  Since we recently moved to the east side, and were lacking a Mexican restaurant, this became the last search.  Casa Ramos was found, and I remembered why chain restaurants were so under rated.  

We came in to a near empty restaurant about 6:00 pm on a Tuesday.  Immediately, I got scared.  However, we were greeted right away and after a quick photo opt with the cut-out cardboard (cheesy but way fun) we were seated in a booth. Chips and salsa were served within a couple of minutes and our drink orders were taken.  Salsa was great, chips were warm (maybe not super fresh, but not mediocre or stale either...I would just say, not made in house). I ordered my "first time" Mexican dish...a tamale.  This to me is a true testimony if I will love a place or not.  My husband order a taco, enchilada plate (I order a flauta and taco also). The food came out and was fantastic.  Meat was juicy and seasoned great.  My tamale came out almost perfect (good masa to meat portion, not killed over by sauce and cheese).  Everything tasted phenomenal.   Rice and beans were good too (I'm not really a bean person, but I still ate a few bites).  The service was attentive and cordial.  I really have no complaints.  I'll probably go on the weekend, just to test out service, but I can't wait for this gem to be our new favorite Mexican restaurant.
