I've eaten their food so many times in the past few years I've lost count. Not everything is perfect (chicken wings are the only ones that come to mind), but most everything I've had I enjoyed. Chicken enchiladas? Thirty times enjoyed. Classic tacos? Yup. They cost an extra buck or two but its worth it.
