My wife and I decided to try El Conelo we were very pleased ,she had garlic shrimp and I had butter flyed shrimp with a very good cheese sauce.both were extremely good. We will be returning soon.The wait staff seamed kinda like they had tunnel vision,but the food out waighed this problem.I think I will try the 7 mares soup.
