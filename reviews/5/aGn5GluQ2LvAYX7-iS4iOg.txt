Huuuge portion!! I went here for lunch and ordered the chimichanga. The portion was huuuuge! I put a dime in the picture for scale! I got it with shredded chicken and I loved it! My experience was good, but the plastic utensils were very small, so it was a bit difficult to eat such a large chimichanga with a tiny fork. Also, the guy who I placed my order with, didn't offer if I wanted to order a drink, and it didn't occur to me to order any, so I just wish he kind of upselled more. I would definitely recommend the restaurant! And don't forget to order a drink!
