One of my favorite lunch spots. Green Chile is very good. New Mexico style. The green Chile burrito with beans is cheese is how I like it.  Red isn't bad either. Chimis are delicious. Love the shredded beef tacos. But if you just feel like beans....get a bean and cheese burro. Omg the beans are so delicious. Home made just like they are supposed to be. Beware you will get very sleepy after eating. Not good if you are working after a good lunch here.
