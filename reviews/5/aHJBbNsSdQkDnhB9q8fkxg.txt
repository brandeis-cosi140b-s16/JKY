Great burgers I had the Brulée burger it was the very good, I would add another patty for a buck if your a big eater, the Beachhouse burger protein style was also very tasty according to the other diner.
Tried the sweet potatoe tots & they are very good too.
Very good ingredients used like brioche buns the pickled onions are great with egg on the Brulée burger!
 My only gripe is, They need to hire a bus person to clean outside tables up and help inside also to clean up along the way,& clean the outside trash can and pick up baskets. You guys need pay attention to those cleaning details or your turn folks off even with such great food!
