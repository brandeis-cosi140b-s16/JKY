This place is great.  We were greeted and seated immediately. Chips and salsa arrived immediately after seating, along with a request for our drink orders.

The food was delicious.

My only complaint was the greasy smell on my clothes when I arrived home.  Apparently, the ventilation system could use a little improvement!
