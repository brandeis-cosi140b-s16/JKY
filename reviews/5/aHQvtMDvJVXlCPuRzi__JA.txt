Had lunch there today and really liked the food. I had the street tacos which were a pretty good value. I had the Tacos Al Pastor, very tasty and affordable. Atmosphere wise it was like being in a Mexico. Probably not a place you would take your girlfriend for a romantic dinner but if you are looking for some good street tacos this is a great place in Chandler.
