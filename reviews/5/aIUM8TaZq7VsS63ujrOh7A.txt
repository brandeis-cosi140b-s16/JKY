We saw this place on our way home and decided to give it a try..
The place was spotless! Great vibe upon arriving. Staff was excellent and very attentive! We ordered a plate of nachos  and the  #2(enchiladas with a beef tacos.) The tacos shells are amazing! Loved the food. My daughters new favorite place. We will be back!
