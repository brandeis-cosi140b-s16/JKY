Why five stars? Great food, outstanding service, plenty of parking in the back, and best off all, super reasonable prices. 
for the guy with the Salsa picture, take the picture with a full bowl, not after you finished it...
Some of those over priced restaurants can take a lesson on how to treat customers.
