Great food for the price.   Love that children under 6 get a free quesadilla when you purchase a meal and eat at the restaurant.  Love their salads.  My favorite thing is the Stevia sweetened Strawberry Lemonade.  I haven't been anywhere with stevia sweetened drinks on tap.  Super yummy and no sugar.  Gets super busy here during peak lunch and dinner time.
