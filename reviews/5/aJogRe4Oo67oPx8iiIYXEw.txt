I know this is a family owned business of 4 locations. I've been a fan of El Sol since 2000, 9 years I've been going to this great little place in Chandler, AZ.  The Bakery was once featured on The Food Network.  Every Christmas I get many of my families favorite Mexican cookies and send them home for the holidays.  I tell everyone I know about what great Breakfast burritos, tacos, tortillas, chips and salsa they serve.  The bakery goods are fresh and yummy everyday.  Never had a bad experience in the 9 years of visiting.
