This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  We went last night and had an amazing meal with friends.  It's so authentic that you will want to bring a friend who speaks spanish along with you.  But you can get by with only english and so don't let that stop you from going.

The atmosphere is kinda divey, but still pleasant.  Beautiful, colorful murals on the walls and loud mexican music.  There were mexican soap operas playing on the TVs....not what I wanted to watch, but I am not their avg client!

I had the fillete de chef and it was PHENOMENAL!  baked fish (flounder? it was so buttery and smooth) topped with octupus (perfectly cooked) and shrimp (slightly tough) in a wonderful, light-tasting cream sauce with bacon in it.  Wow, I just loved it.  Had leftovers for lunch today and it was great.  

My husband had the shrimp bacanora (sp?) and it was divine.  A wonderful cream sauce with Bacanora (an agave liquor).  Highly recommended.

My other friends had shrimp in green chile cream sauce (excellent!) and a whole, deep-friend red snapper that was good but a little on the dry side.  For appetizers we had ceviche tostada (excellent!) and the little peppers stuffed with shrimp and wrapped in bacon and bathed in a salty soy sauce (very good!!). 

I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to go back!
