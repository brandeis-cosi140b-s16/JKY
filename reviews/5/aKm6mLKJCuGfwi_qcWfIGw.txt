Me and my boyfriend went here for lunch thought we would try something new, its very much like Chipotle but I would say way better, the food tasted so fresh, way fresher than Chipotle. 

Dont get me wrong im a big fan of Chipotle but this place was very mom and pa store, the employees very friendly,and there was not a huge line like at Chipotle. Overall I loved it :)
