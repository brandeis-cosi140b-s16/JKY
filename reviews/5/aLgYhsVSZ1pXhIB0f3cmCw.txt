Thank goodness for Las Cruces bringing the best Mexican food to the valley.  I lived in Las Cruces and I'm telling you they have THE best Mexican restaurants ever.  Si Se√±or in Cruces is not even one of the best ones, but it's way better than anything I've had living 10 years in Albuquerque.

From the signage in the front, to the moment I walked in the door, it looked like the one at "home".  Just like I remember it.  Love the picture right in the front with the Organ mountains in the background.  Ok, ok, enough reminiscing, onto the food.  I loved the salsas.  Haven't had the green chile salsa in a while, but it was yummy.  The red was hot, a good hot.  I ordered a combo and everything was just delicious.  I honestly judge a true Mexican restaurant by their rice.  It's been a while since I've had some decent rice and this one was very tasty.  I wish there had been more on the plate. And lastly, the sugary sopas were the icing on the cake.  Finger licking good!

So glad this place is here, a bit of a drive, but totally worth it to me to make me feel like I have something just like home.
