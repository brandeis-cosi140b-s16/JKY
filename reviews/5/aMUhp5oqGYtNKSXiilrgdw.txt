Yo Rita continues to be my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Gourmet tacos, creative cocktails, delicious chips and salsa as soon as you sit down, and fantastic, consistent service.  

The portions are not small.  These are tacos, folks, so they aren't burrito-size.  They are stuffed with enough flavorful things that normal people don't need more than 2 or 3.  My standard order is the chopped salad (changes seasonally, always amazing) and the chorizo taco.  This is enough for me, especially with chips and salsa.  This is perfect because I don't leave so stuffed with food that I'm in pain (I have no self control).

Beer selection is always nice.  They have several drafts, including East End Big Hop (my favorite).  The cocktails Yo Rita's offer are really unique.  We always get the Moscow Mule, which is made with Natrona Bottling Co's Jamaica's Finest Ginger Beer...the best I've ever tasted! 

Please go and check Yo Rita's out!  You won't be disappointed!
