They totally deserve every star, I don't just throw around 5 star reviews, they earned it! Was in the mood for some yummy veggie tacos, but wasn't willing to spend much money. Also wanted to find a place that my friend who eats meat would enjoy as well. Was the perfect place for us!
We came at 6pm on tonight (Sunday), and I was surprised to see that the restaurant was completely empty. The people working behind the counter were great, let my friend sample meats before she decided on the green chile beef. I of course got the veggie tacos. Also splurged and got some guac, chips, and a side of rice and beans. This ended up being a ridiculous amount of food and my friend and I were really full haha but totally worth it. I got everything that wasn't meat on my taco, except for the sour cream. It was so so good. Especially with the guacamole and salsa on top. My favorite salsa was the mild, my friend preferred the green salsa. She also said her green chile beef tacos had the perfect amount of spice for her, enough to be flavorful but not so much that it was overpowering. The chips were good strong chips, perfect for guac-eating purposes. Beans and rice were super delicious! 
The decor is what made the restaurant awesome, I loved all the pink and glittery stuff. Record wall was awesome and the "no nuts" bathroom sign made us laugh. Also the music was fun! Atmosphere was great even though we were the only people. Loved this place, can't wait to return!
