Went here for a work lunch once after seeing their Organic gmo-free billboard.  Thought I was in the wrong place at first when I pulled into the Sapphire parking lot, haha, and was a little worried about what I would find.  Turns out - what I would find was a really chic restaurant with delicious food.  The service is ok, I haven't been blown away by any of the servers (but the service wasn't bad either) - but both times I've visited thus far, Chef Paco has come out to introduce himself and thank us for our patronage.  It's really nice when Management takes an interest in their guests like that.

Now we do Margarita Mondays at El Dorado.  Mondays are 50% off everything for locals.  The house margarita is made w/ good clear tequila (not some cuervo crap like most places).  You can get a pitcher (which is normally $32) for $16!  Two of us got 2.5 margaritas out of the pitcher.  So $3 per delicious organic margarita?!  Yup, I'm sold!  You can also add some organic fruit to your drink for a little more.

The food is fantastic as well.  The shrimp tacos were the bomb, my friend had a dish where the shrimp was served in 1/2 a pineapple.  Amazing presentation and soooo good.  The flan is TO DIE FOR.  Seriously, try it!  If it's your first time, you get a free flan when you check on Yelp.

Mondays have gotten really popular now w/ the 50% off for locals deal, so I would recommend a reservation.

PS - they have plenty of vegetarian options and are happy to make these items vegan upon request.
