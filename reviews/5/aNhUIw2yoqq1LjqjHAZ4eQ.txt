it's hard to find mexican restaurants that are not greasy.

well, we found that at el mesquite.  there chips are great and they keep bringing them out.  the salsa is more chili powder and hotter than average.  the food is great.  i have not had a bad meal yet.  the prices are reasonable and the service is great.  my only beef is they charge for soda refills!!!  that sucks.

the location is in the very corner of a strip mall and kinda hard to find if you are going for the first time.
