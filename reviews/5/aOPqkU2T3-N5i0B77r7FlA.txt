Was here on a Sunday evening with a large group-about 20 Wild Dining gringos-and boy, how we feasted! The decor was pleasant, the service attentive (we kept the two servers running, but they never missed a beat), and the food ... simply wonderful. For a pig-out $20, I had a Negra Modelo, horchata, two cheese crisps (huitlacoche and pumpkin blossom), two tacos (lamb and tongue), and flan, plus some of the best chips and salsa ever. I had three extra meals from the leftovers, too. 

- The cook said the greenish salsa is just jalapeños and oil. Oh, my, I MUST learn to make that. The other salsa seemed to be chipotle. Neither is for wimps. Don't ask for mild salsa here, there isn't any. But the slow burn of both hotties is fantastic with the mildly salted chips. 
- The cheese crisps were not what I was expecting. They're empañada-like, fried but not heavy. I liked both.
- It's worth going when they have lamb. Mmmm. But my favorite was the tongue taco. The little cubes of meat were as tender as anything I've ever eaten. And there was plenty of cilantro, onions, and the salsas to dress them up. 
- The flan was rich and dense, I definitely recommend finishing your feast with it. 
- I just can't say enough good things about the service. Twenty diners is a lot to keep up with, and they were unflappable. 

We're already talking about how soon we can return to El Tlacoyo. We agreed that you could dine here repeatedly and naver duplicate a meal-and I expect most of us will be testing that theory.
