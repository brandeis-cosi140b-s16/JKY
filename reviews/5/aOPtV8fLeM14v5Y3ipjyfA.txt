We just finished dinner at Manuels for a last minute family reuinion.  They were very accomidating to the 20 of us.  Also, at the end of the night my father paid the tab, he did not realize that the gratity was already included.  The staff followed us while we were saying our goodbyes.   He told my dad that he had over paid the tip and allowed him to run the tab again.  We thoght this was very honroable.
