Hello Inquisitive Connoisseur,

I have literally consumed thousands of bean & cheese burritos between the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas since 1998 (the first year I lived independent of parental support), and Rolando's easily sets the industry standard in my humble (and accurate) opinion.

I've been a loyal customer since 2004, and we're at a point in our relationship where they actually start preparing my bean n cheese burrito immediately after recognizing my car in the street (which is both flattering & embarrassing at the same time....but in a good way, of course).

I highly recommend Rolando's to the sophisticated yet fundamentally simple consumer in you that values originality and authenticity; and whose taste buds have developed and evolved far beyond overpriced "burrito-mills" like Filiberto's and Federico's.

...and If you really want to enhance the experience, I strongly suggest getting a large Mt Dew along with your bean & cheese. They uniquely compliment and enrich eachother in way that only soulmates can truly appreciate.
