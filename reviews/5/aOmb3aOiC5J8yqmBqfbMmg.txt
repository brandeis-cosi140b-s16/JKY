I am confident in saying this is the best fast-food Mexican restaurant I've been to.

Good quality food
Good amount of food
Good prices. 

Food is just a little of a wait, as they make it upon your ordering. Order at the counter and they'll bring it to your table with silverware too. Four different choices of salsas that are all more flavorful than other places I've tried.
Especially enjoy the enchiladas (3 +rice &beans $8) and of course, carne asada fries (around $8). Blows Roberto's out of the water, that's for sure!
