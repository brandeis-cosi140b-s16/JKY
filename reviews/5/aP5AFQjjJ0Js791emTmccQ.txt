I will never go to another Bertos brothers establishment again for a breakfast burrito. These are fresh made and not greasy at all! Plus they let you pick more than one meat, my husband's favorite combo is bacon and chorizo. I'd like to try their other menu items but the breakfast burrito is so darn delicious!
