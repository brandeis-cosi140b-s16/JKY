Life. Changing. 
 
That is all the description I can give. The deserts, sandwiches the entr√©es even the drinks. The portions? If you can finish just HALF of the La Merced Sandwich you are a beast. 

The service is very good. Your server will notice if you are done with your menu or if your drink is low. 

This is not Sanoran Style, which is great, too, but omg I am like a pregnant woman about this place. 

I am sad (but full) when I leave. I memorized the address to this place the first time I found it. I am not the guy that remembers things like that, trust me. 
 
It makes me want to move to Mexico City.
