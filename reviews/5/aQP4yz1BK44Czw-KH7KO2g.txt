My family and I have been here several times.  When they first opened I definitely felt there was room for improvement.   I strongly believe they listened to their customers and made those changes.  I usually order the Chicken Fajita burrito.   It is my favorite and very tasty.  Their Margaritas are a little pricey just as everywhere else, however they are strong and big enough to where I just need one with my meal.  I would recommend to everyone that has been and wasn't impressed to give them another try!  The staff also has always been very accommodating.
