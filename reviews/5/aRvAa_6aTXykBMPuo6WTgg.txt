This is truly the best Mexican food I've ever had--high quality dishes with fresh ingredients.  They served large portions at a ridiculously reasonable cost, and I've never had such good service from the staff there.  They went out of their way to serve me with style.  Even though I have family in. Charlotte, I might have to come back here just to come to Las Margaritas!
