Just came here on a date night and I must say, DELICIOUS. Between the homemade soups, Chicken fajitas (they're to DIE for) and the fresh guacamole, I will absolutely be here again and again and again. My boyfriend was happy as they had plenty of protein rich foods for him to choose from (not easy to find usually). Service was consistent and made me feel at home; unfortunately I was too full for dessert, but the table next to me had a friend ice cream and I couldn't stop staring. I'm walking out now feeling as content as ever.
