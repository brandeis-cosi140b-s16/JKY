Ssshhhh! Don't say another word! You had me at....fresh brewed iced tea.  I've never eaten here but kid you not the iced tea here is good enough to be considered as good as any fresh brewed tea you would find in the South.  As a Texas boy I have need to regularly partake of fresh iced tea. This place has iced tea that would launch an army.  Drive thru is convenient and the service staff is awesome.  Speaking about the iced tea, I easily give five stars.
