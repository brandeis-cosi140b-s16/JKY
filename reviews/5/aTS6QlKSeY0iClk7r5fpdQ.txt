Been going here for years and love it! Best chips and salsa you will get in the east valley. I always end up eating a whole bowl before I even get my food! Also there's nothing better than a mango margarita with some fish tacos while sitting on the patio. Great atmosphere, friendly employees. Highly recommended!
