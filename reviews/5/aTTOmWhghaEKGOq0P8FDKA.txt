Mission: Delicious Latin tapas and beautiful french Decor make this place lavish and fun...I love sitting at the bar and having fun with friends or sitting in dining area for a romantic date.Every plate might be small in quanity but packs the most flavorful indulgence with quality :0)
One of my top 3 places in all Scottsdale!
