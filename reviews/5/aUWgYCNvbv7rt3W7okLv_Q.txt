I went and didn't know what to expect. I gravitated towards Maki Taco...and boy, did I make the best decision or what? All I can say is YUM, YUM, YUM. I actually went against the grain and got the Chicken Hibachi. DELICIOUS. I was so mad at myself for not getting two. One for now, and another for after I eat the first bowl. It was so so good! I highly recommend Maki Taco. I know, I went to a Taco truck and didnt get a taco. But the surprise was on me.......Hibachi at the Taco truck was just what I needed.
