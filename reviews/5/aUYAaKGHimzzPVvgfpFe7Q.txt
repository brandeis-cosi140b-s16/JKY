El Pacifico is my 'go to' for Mexican seafood.  I will warn you now, if you're not familiar with 'street' mariscos places, then you might not be happy with this place.  It sells seafood by bulk, and fresh fish and shellfish, and so it has the scent of the business.  It's also 'down home', with vinyl checked table cloths and inexpensive tableware.  There's also TV and music, which can be loud sometimes.  But the food is muy bueno!  The seafood has always been invariably fresh and top notch.  I will even order oysters here without even a second thought.  I especially recommend the 'el pacifico' style.  The campechanas are 1st rate.  If you like Mexican seafood and go here for it, I think you will be VERY happy with this place.  It's a family run joint, and serves families...so if you're allergic to kids beware.  The folks here are attentive, the service is pretty good almost all the time.  The other patrons are often pretty friendly too, and on more than one occasion I've been sent drinks from other family parties, and returned the favor, too.  They have a good bar here too, with an excellent selection of tequilas.  But be aware that some 'American'  cocktail standards aren't normal in this kind of context, so don't be too picky if you order an Old Fashioned or a Rob Roy....  But the standard Mexican types have been perfecto!  So if you know Mexican street seafood..and that's what you're after, I give this place the full 5 stars.
