Super friendly staff,  Mexican and Salvadoran fast food.  Great prices. Perfect for lunch. 

Had the chicken taquitos dorados,  they are topped with shredded cabbage,  Mexican cheese (cotija),  pico de gallo salsa, crema mexicana (mexican sour cream).  I got sliced Avocado on top.  Good and crunchy.
