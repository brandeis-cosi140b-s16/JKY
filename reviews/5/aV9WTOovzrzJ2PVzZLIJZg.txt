Can I give them 10 stars?? My fiance and I tried this place for the first time last night and we were overly impressed. 
The menu has TONS to offer at very affordable prices. Check out their daily specials!
The food was delicious and plentiful portions... have I mentioned the affordable prices? All natural/very fresh ingredients too. Can't beat that!
The service was outstanding. It's so refreshing to go out someplace where the staff is friendly and helpful. I love it when I go somewhere and the people I interact can put a smile on my face. This is that place!
The hot sauce bar is great. Tons of choices, self service and way better than any hot sauce I've had before and I LOVE hot sauce...I eat it on everything. 
Thank you for the awesome service and amazing food last night guys. You guys definitely earned repeat customers and we will be sure to spread the word!
