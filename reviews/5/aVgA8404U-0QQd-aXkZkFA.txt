I have no qualms about giving Rokerij a five star rating.  I  have been here dozens of  times over the past several years.  It doesn't matter if you're seated downstairs in the cozy, darkly lit bar or upstairs where you can watch the chef's make quick work of your order in the open kitchen, you can expect friendly service, a fantastic wine list, and very tasty food.  I also love that I can walk into this restaurant and never feel over or under dressed whether I'm wearing flip flops and jeans or my cutest party dress.  The prime rib has been my favorite lately.  My boyfriend and I generally split it and are both very satisfied by the huge portion!  Their soups and sides are all to die for and their veggie selection is generally very fresh..  I'm a fan of the brocollini and asparagus.  I enjoy taking out of town guests to this little neighborhood gem and love that they serve food later than most of the North Central corridor restaurants.  Hats off to you, Rokerij, keep up the good work!
