I've been watching this place under construction for the past couple of months just waiting for them to open.  I caught the soft opening yesterday afternoon.  I was able to try the al pastor and el gringo tacos.  The el gringo is a specialty taco created by one of the Anaya brothers, Javier.  The flavor profile on el gingo is like no other.  Simply put, AMAZING!!!  So good in fact I brought my whole family back at 5 when they opened up with the full menu.  We did a nice tour of the menu.  We had the cheese quesadilla, asada quesadilla, asada fries, pollo mole taco, adobada taco, another gringo taco, the potato and manchego cheese flautas (AMAZING), and one of my wife's favorites the street corn on the cob.  To top it all off I came back again this morning to try their chilaquiles for breakfast.  It's about time we have a great authentic Mexican restaurant up here in the southwest part of Las Vegas.  They're located at the Gramercy on Russell between Fort Apache and the 215.  Come check it out and treat your palate!!
