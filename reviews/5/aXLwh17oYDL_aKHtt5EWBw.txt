Great googly-moogly, this place is awesome.  Absolutely one of the best burrito shops on the eastside of town.

If taquerias all carry a taste of their home region, Carlito's is the New Mexico taqueria and the theme is hatch chiles.  Spicy, delicious hatch chiles.  Red ones.  Oooohh ooooh ooohh, green ones.  It's a burrito shop.  And a damn good one, but what sets it aside as one of the best in town is the chile sauces.

The green chile sauce is exceptional.  So good that you don't even need a burrito.  Their green chile stew is spicy and delicious--with well-prepared potatoes and beef.  Mmmm mmmm good.

Add in the deliciousness of a tasty burrito--pork verde, carne adovada, carne asada, chicken.  Each one delicious.  And the option to get it smothered in cheese and the previously-mentioned delicious chile sauce.

Flat out one of the best taquerias in Vegas.  A must visit for a Mexican food lover.
