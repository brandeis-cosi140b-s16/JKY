Never did I ever think I'd give a ~fast food~ place 5 stars but this place totally deserves it. I was over at Sam Boyd for something, looking for lunch on my phone when I saw a solid set of Yelp reviews for this location. I went, and the kid at the counter ran me through everything on the menu, his favorites, his suggestions. I ignored all of them (sorry, I'm an idiot plant-eater) and went with the portobello & poblano tacos. To my surprise my meal came with 2 sides (rice and beans were my picks, duh) and it was all way delish. I stood around for a minute and the kid was like, "have a seat, I'll bring it over to you." What even??
