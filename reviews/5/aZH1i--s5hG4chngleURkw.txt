I'm a foodie, especially Mexican food, I've been looking for a new Mexican restaurant to call my favorite and this is it! Taco Tuesday and $2 mimosas are the best on Saturday and Sunday! I'm so glad I found out about this place from the #YelpgetsLucky event! I love the atmosphere and all the decorations! You'll get the best service from the bartenders! It seems like the waitresses sometimes forget about you, but overall a place I'll be frequenting
