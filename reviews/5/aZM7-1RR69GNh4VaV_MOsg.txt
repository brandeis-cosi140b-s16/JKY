This is the place for tacos! Let me begin by saying being i'm an L.A native, this place reminds me of the taco restaurants from back home. Their tacos "al pastor" are definitely worth trying. They do have a taco plate meal which consists of; a plate of meat (depending on choice) that is accompanied by onions, cilantro, and about 5-6 tortillas, therefore you can create/ serve yourself your own tacos as you eat. Their staff is very courteous and helpful. I would definitely be returning to this restaurant upon my future visits to Vegas!
