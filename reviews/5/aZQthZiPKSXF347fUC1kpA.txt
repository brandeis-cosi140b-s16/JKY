A staple- delicious and one of my favorite places to eat in town with friends. Everything on the menu is delicious, of the highest quality, and nicely priced. I have yet to eat something from hanshiktaco that I did not love thoroughly, especially the weekly specials. The owner can come up with dishes as unique as roasted turkey/sweet potato/Mexican gravy quesadillas, while still ensuring that every ingredient is of high quality and delicious. The most underrated food truck in town. If you haven't yet, try it!
