OG Tortas, this place is always on point, as authentic as it gets. Usually get the torta ahogada, it's a little spicy but really flavorful. Don't get me started on the agua frescas, GTFO!! Super refreshing and compliment the tortas to the max. Good salsas, place is always clean and the people that work there can not be nicer, come check them out or go get diarrhea at Taco Bell you lame ass!
