so two gringos walk into a mexican taco shop next to a mexican bus station....

badump bump.


OMG!! wtf have i been missing here. i got a carne asada burro and a soft chicken taco...

taco was awesome. the corn tortilla was soft, supple and tasted awesome. piled high with lettuce some sliced radish and i squeezed some lemon ontop. i murdered this taco. execution style. imagine finding a duffle bag full of heads in Juarez...well this taco belonged to one of those heads..understand?

the burro was very tasty. the meat seasoned well and only two bites did i find some grisly bits. the carne asada was rolled up with some diced tomatoes and a cup of pico on the side. 

i kinda prefer my CA Burrito with a heap of Guacamole like how FilliB's makes them. but this was really tasty and i will order it again...after i check out the other items on the menu of course. 

you will now find me here every saturday morning. 
the tacos at Tacos De Juarez will soon refer to me as the Chalupacabre.
