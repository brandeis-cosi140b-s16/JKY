Delicious. Fresh. Not greasy. Yummmmy.

You know how some mexican food places have great tasting food, but its really greasy? This is not that kind of food. The food here is fresh, tasty, it's just so beyond your average taco joint. Fish tacos are great, tacos dorados are excellent, chicken taco, carne asada taco are good.  Comfortable place to eat with plenty of booths. You order your food at the counter, pay at the counter, and pick it up at the counter.
