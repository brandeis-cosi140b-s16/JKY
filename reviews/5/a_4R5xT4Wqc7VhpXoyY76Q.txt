Love the location downtown at the Container Park, which is close to where I work (I can walk there).  When I heard they were opening down the street from where I live at the Gramercy, I was so excited!  We dined there today and it was as delicious as their downtown location.  

Hubs and I each had a few of their chicken tacos and their al pastor tacos.  We also split a Mexican Corn on the Cob.  

Service was friendly and our food came out quick.  They weren't very busy, they had maybe 2 other table, but their grand opening is tomorrow.  I hope they get enough business for them to stay there.  They are very popular at their downtown location.
