This is a crazy good "street taco" place. $2 at taco! The is the deal of the strip!

I love it SO MUCH! It reminds me of when I have visited Tijuana, then I found out that is where the original one is! YES - so happy!

Don't be put off by this place, it looks dumpy. Trust me, the food is super tasty.
The Adobada tacos are my fave! It is spicy pork cooked "gyro style" shaved off one taco at a time! Was also introduced to a "Mulas" taco here. Which is basically a melted cheese, meat of your choice taco sandwich - OMG SO GOOD!

Tacos El Gordo makes me one happy GRINGO!
