Ok, my family and I are fans!  I saw the yelp reviews and said ok I'll try it.  First off, the plus is that it's a stone's throw away.  I decided to call in and have a steak breakfast burrito.  I thought it was ok, but I don't like fat pieces and there were a couple but more melt in your mouth than rubbery.  However, my husband devoured it.  Yesterday we went in and I decided to have a chicken taco and try some shrimp fries, my husband had the steak fries and a steak burrito, my girls had chicken fingers and fries.  I took one bite of the shrimp fries and fell in love, I barely made a dent in them, before I started feeling full - there was so much shrimp!  So, I decided to try the chicken taco before I could absolutely not eat anymore.  The chicken taco is delicious with real white meat chicken and it was seasoned so well!  The taco is enough to satiate you! It's a great size with fresh ingredients.  My husband loved his food and usually can finish everything in front of him but even he was stuffed!  The girls loved their chicken fingers, even though not spectacular, they were very good and fresh!    So good, we went back today, for just enough food, as not to cause waste! We got a couple chicken and steak tacos with a side of rice and beans.  The rice was good and the beans were delicious! I'm already thinking about what to try next...Rivas is so good!!
