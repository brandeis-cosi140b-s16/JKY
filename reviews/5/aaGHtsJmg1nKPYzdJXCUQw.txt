I LOVE this place!!!  They are the best Mexican Food Restaurant I have ever had!  My family has been coming to this Restaurant since it was a hole in the wall.  We tend to go AT LEAST once a month to eat there - the servers all know my family at this point.  My family members all have their favorites.... mine is the #23 (2 shredded beef tacos, enchilada, rice and beans).  All the menu is pretty good but someo f my family favs are the Theresa's Special, Menudo (Red or White), Green Chili (excellent), Steak.... everything!  We absolutely love their chips and Salsa too!  I would recommend everyone to go.  Keep in mind this is more of Sonora Style Mexican food not other regions of Mexico.
