My boyfriend found this restaurant on Yelp because of its good reviews and boy oh boy it sure does live up to them! When we walked in we immediately got seated then shortly got our chips and three assortments of salsas.
Our entrees consisted of street tacos, salmon, and I had the veggie tacos. They were the best veggie tacos I had in my entire life! Super flavorful and filling.
I checked in here so I got a free flan :) I'm personally not a fan of flan so I gave it to my boyfriend. I got the fried ice cream. Delish!!

I will be back again whenever my Mexican food cravings kick in!
