Me and my boyfriend went here yesterday, we love our mexican food. Our bartender was friendly and  the service was great. The margaritas were made with fresh lime juice, and were very good. The food was great too, as well as the service. We will be going back there quite often. I have leftovers at home in my fridge, and can;t wait to get out of work so i can eat them!
