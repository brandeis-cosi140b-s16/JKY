Passed by this little "hole in the wall" dozens of times, never went.  Now I regret that.  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly.  It's a good sign when you see older Mexican ladies cooking in the back and patrons of Hispanic descent (ooh, that was really, really p.c.) at tables all around you.  The portions are sizable and the food tastes authentic.  The tortillas are excellent, large, thin, soft, warm.  Only tortillas that compare are Carolina's.  There were a couple food items that looked a bit different, maybe strange, but they were delicious.  The carne asada was like nothing I'd seen.  It looks like ground beef or some kind of soilant-green meat product,...sorry, sounds gross,....but it was really good and tasty.  I had low hopes for the guacamole when it came out and looked very smooth and maybe from a package.  But, I was wrong, it was excellent!  Beans looked a bit runny, but very flavorful and delicious!  Rice, excellent!!  Chicken asada, very soft and flavorful. The pico was super fresh and chilled,....salsa was fantastic and spicy.

Overall, I thought this was one of the best tasting Mexican Restaurants I have been to in quite a while and I already look forward to returning.  I'd definitely recommend it for out-of-towners looking for authentic Mexican cuisine, family fun, relaxing dinners or a night out with friends.
