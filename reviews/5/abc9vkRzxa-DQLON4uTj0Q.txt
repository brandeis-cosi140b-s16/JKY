Wow this place is great! Best mexican I've had in Vegas, by far. 

Got a Bloody Mary, hooooo boy was that delicious. 

Also don't underestimate the power of the free taco coupon. 30 minutes later and I am still feeling the aftershocks of deliciousness rumbling through every fiber of my body. 

Yes, tacos.
