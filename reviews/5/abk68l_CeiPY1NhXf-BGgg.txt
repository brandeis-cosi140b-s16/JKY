I'm so glad I looked through the yelp pics and noticed the pork belly on a stick! I didn't see it on the menu (the little insert was missing on my menu) so I asked the waitress about it. That was probably the highlight of our meal. I liked the burrito too, but the pork belly was the most memorable part of the meal.
