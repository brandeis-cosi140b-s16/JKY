First let me say that I was born in Guadalajara and I'm used to REAL Mexican food, now with that said. This place has the ABSOLUTELY BEST tortas ahogadas and tacos in Las Vegas, they are as close as it gets to my home town. This is a MUST try place!!!! Everyone here was so nice and helpful, I live in Summerlin and I am coming back and often
