I came to Sol because i had been searching The area for a good margarita, which is surprisingly hard to find, and let me tell you they did not disappoint. I had the Jalape√±o/cucumber margarita and it was amazing. The entire experience was great. Everything from the chips to my carnitas torta was amazingly good.
