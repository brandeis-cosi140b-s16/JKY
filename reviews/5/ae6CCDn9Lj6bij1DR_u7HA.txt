My 40+ yr old female body has been going wacko hormonal for Mexican food lately.  Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Los Favoritos has a 5-star breakfast burrito and I can't stop eating them.  They are $3.95, about 8-inches long, and packed with eggs, meat, and potatoes.  There are several choices, of which I've tried the bacon and the sausage.  

Two things really stand out to me.  First, the fillings are all mixed together evenly.  How often do you get a burrito and the eggs are all on one side?  See what I'm sayin?  Then, the bacon is crisp and the filling is not greasy.  How many times do you get a greasy, soggy burrito at other joints?  Way too many.  That is not what you'll find at Los Favoritos.  

The staff is friendly and the breakfast burritos are perfection.  If you like things spicy they can juice it up with peppers and hot sauce for you.  I get a little of their red salsa, which is more like a puree, and add a little while I'm eating it.  Livens it up with just the right amount of heat for me.
