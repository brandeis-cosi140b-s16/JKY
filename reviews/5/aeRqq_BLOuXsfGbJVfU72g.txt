Ive been here a dozen plus times and never left unsatisfied or anything less than stuffed.  The one on South Tryon is closer to me, so Ive been only to this location.  The hostess knows us well enough to know our favorite booth,  and the waiters know my spice level (which is pretty high).

Since I eat seafood and vegetarian exclusively, I just pay $1 extra to get the regular lunch combinations replaced with shrimp, not bad at all.  The rice and beans are bland, but upon request they give a spicy sauce that tastes much like habenero sauce to me.  Makes me sweat, but I love it!  Everything is worth trying once or twice or more, and portions are gargantuan.  Enjoy.
