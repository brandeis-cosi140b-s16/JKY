PVB is great! In a central location ( near PV Hospital) the menu as something for everyone in the family. I had the Beach Burger whcih was cooked to perfection. The brioche roll was just toasted and still so soft. Meat was flavored perfectly and cooked like I like it. My friend had the Parmigiana burger which was loaded with homemade sauce and tons of cheese. If you want something different and an over the top experience go for the french toast fries!  I'm going to try the taco's next time or one of their salads. Great prices, satisfying portions and casual attire is great for anytime.
