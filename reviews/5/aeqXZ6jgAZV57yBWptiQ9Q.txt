Plenty of choices in meat and salsas. They have barbacoa like that of chihuhua, mexico. One of the only places I know. Delicious! 

You can see them cooking up the meet from where you order and they have a place facing the dining area where someone is making the tortillas fresh. How awesome.  The have tostadas to snack on, and plenty of salsa to choose from their Salsa and Toppings Bar. 

they give you a number and then they bring your meal to your table.  I go there for the tacos, but they also have enchiladas, burritos, flan, rice, beans (refried and ranchero), and so much more.  Highly recommend!

Casual Dinning.
