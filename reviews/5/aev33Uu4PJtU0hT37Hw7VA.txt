Upward project has done it again.
We went to Joyride Sunday,early afternoon and had a great experience. Greeted by a friendly young lady, taken to a table,brought us a high chair for our 15month old daughter.
 Right away our server, Lori, came over quickly with chips and absolutely delicious salsa. I had been to another new taco restaurant the night before, but the salsa at joyride is far, far more flavorful.  We order right away, nachos, recommended by Lori. My husband loved them! 
I order carne asada torta it was absolutely perfect. My husband got chicken tacos. Very good.

Lori also told us that Joyride has a kids plate. Perfect!  A another helpful young lady brought over a adorable kid friendly plate with two chicken tacos, fruit and I order a side of bomb black beans, which my daughter loved!

Great service, everyone who works there was very  friendly and seemed eager to please there customers. 
I can't wait for our next  visit back to Joyride.
