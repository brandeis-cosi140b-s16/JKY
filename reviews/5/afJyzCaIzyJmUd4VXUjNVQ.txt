Let me preface this by saying that we just stopped by here on the way to another place but since we had some time to kill, we thought "Hey why not?"  We had two drinks and some chips and salsa but the people here were so incredibly helpful and nice, I had to say that Luis and his staff have the Customer Service side of things down pat and if the food is as good as the service, this restaurant should have a nice long life here.  I wish them well.
