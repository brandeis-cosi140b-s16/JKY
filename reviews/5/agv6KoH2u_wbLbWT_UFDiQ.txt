Alright people, this is as good as it gets in PITTSBURGH. You all know the city isn't the greatest with Mexican food, but this place is the exception. I'm from Los Angeles, the messiah of Mexican food...and I always go to Mexico City for their tacos. It's not as cheap as LA, of course not because of the lack of Mexican food in Pgh, but their wet burrito is pretty good, their beers are cheap, it's never crowded, they are super friendly and prompt with service, and I love their carne asada tacos. It comes with rice, which I'm not used to, so sometimes I'll ask for it with everything except rice. I give them credit for keeping their menu simple, authentic, and satisfying. I love that's in Downtown and walking distance. There's not much cultural food like them in downtown, so it is definitely appreciated. I've been to Las Velas and hated it and really, you can't compare this place to that when their dishes and way of serving food and preparation is totally different.
