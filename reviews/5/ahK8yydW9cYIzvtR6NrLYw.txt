These are the BEST Tacos Las Vegas has!

I was in the mood to eat REAL Mexican Tacos and I couldn't find a Tacos Mexico restaurant anywhere near me so I googled "Taqueria" and Tacos El Gordo popped up.  It had so many great reviews by people who have been there that my friend and I decided to go there for dinner.  We were so impressed by the Quality of the Food!! I had the BEST tacos de cabeza and the BEST tacos adobados I've ever had in United States. My mouth waters just thinking about their tacos now!  I will NEVER go back to Tacos Mexico because Tacos El Gordo has the best tacos in Las Vegas.  The restaurant was packed when we got there, it reminded me of In-n-Out during the lunch hour.  The restaurant is really clean and as soon as somebody gets up to leave the staff cleans the table.  YOU GOTTA TRY TACOS EL GORDO!!!
