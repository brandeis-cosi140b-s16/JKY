Being the whimsical guy i am, i decided to go for it with Gordas. I saw on Yelp that it had lots of positive reviews and there wasn't anything else nearby but fast food. The place was somewhere between Filibertos and Chipotle but in all the right ways. Fresh salsa bar was fresh! RC cola in the fountain: something you dont see often, but nice. I had the surf and turf burrito. It was huge like Chipotle, but tasted way better. It reminded me what Mexican food is supposed to taste like (meaning not some combo of trendy flavors like chipotle). It had shrimp, steak, mexican rice and perfectly zippy and fresh-tasting pico de gallo. The staff were really friendly and the food came out fast. Great lunch spot if youre in this area.
