Pros: Weekend happy hour deals, drinks, and BREAKFAST TACOS!!!

Cons: NONE

We go here almost every weekend now that they started offering breakfast tacos.  Eggs, little bits of jalapeno bacon, salsa in a corn tortilla = delicious!  Breakfast tacos are essential in Austin (and TX in general) and I've always wondered why all taco shops don't have them.

They also have cheap margs and a taco of the day for a couple bucks.  Two of us were able to have drinks, 6 breakfast tacos (they are street taco size) for about $20.  They also did a good job on the building, with big vaulted ceilings, and church-ie decor.  

John at the bar is always helpful and happy, and the rest of the staff are professional and polite.  Good job z tejas and co.
