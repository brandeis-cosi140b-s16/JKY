I can't believe it took me so long to go to Los G's (I don't think people actually call it that but I'm making it a thing).

Get the pork al pastor and chorizo tostadas (they're two different tostadas but maybe if you ask nicely they'll put both meats on one for you?). The chorizo is perfectly crispy and salty and AMAZING and the pastor tostada is a 10 as well. I prefer the tostadas over the tacos because I like the extra "mmfph" the crunch gives them.

Seriously, go now. It stays open late enough.
