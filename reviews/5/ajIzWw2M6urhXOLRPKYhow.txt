Really craving a good Mexican dinner, my husband and I decided to try Macayos.  We think we may have been here once last year, but the visit must have been unremarkable because neither of us can remember. However, we will remember tonight's visit. We've been traveling lately on our way from Ontario, Canada to spend the winter in Arizona and eating in various chains along the way and we decided to have a nice sit-down meal for a change.  This was excellent!  I took a gamble on the Sonora Enchilada sampler which consisted of three enchiladas, each with a different sauce and my choice of either black or retried beans.  I chose retried and they were delicious!   Piping hot (as was everything, which is a lovely change from most places) and topped with cheese, they were very tasty.  The bean and cheese enchilada was covered with red sauce which was mild, yet tangy.  The chicken enchilada was covered in their Baja sauce - a white, creamy cheese sauce with a little bite of Jalepeno in it - absolutely A1! And the third enchilada was filled with shaved beef and covered in a tangy green sauce.  Spanish rice was also on the plate but I was in piggy heaven at this point and rice was the last thing on my mind!  lol rick had one of their specials which included a taco, a burrito and an enchilada with re fried beans and rice as well.  His frozen margarita was huge, lovely and sour and went down very well!  We loved the Baja sauce so much we got some to go!  The service was excellent - our waitress was very busy but she checked on us often, was very pleasant and extremely helpful!  This is a place we will return to many times while we're here I'm sure.
