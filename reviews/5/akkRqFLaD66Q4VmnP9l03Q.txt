I have no idea about these bad reviews. I haven't met a single employee here that was less than stellar. Out of a the tons of times my wife and I have been here they have messed an order up two times. Corrected em both without a single blink. One of the times the guy came running out of the store after U.S. Because he caught the mistake before us. 5 stars easily.
