Drive thru gourmet burger place? hell yah!
Stopped here a few times while I was going to my weekly appointment nearby and was very impressed.. I've only ever ordered the burger.. add the yummy Niman Ranch bacon (extra, but seriously worth it) and I'm in la la land!  Their staff is very friendly and the food is made to order, seasoned *perfectly* and above all, delicious.  OH yeah, the fries are awesome... perfectly seasoned and just like I like them.
