OUTSTANDING crew that feels like you're seeing old friends, that's how happy they are to serve you. Very clean location, including bathrooms. It's usually cold in here, but Phoenix weather usually allows for seating in their humble patio anyway. Food is now entirely organic!!! As a vegan, I so greatly appreciate no cross-contamination issues and I never have to carefully hawk-eye the staff to ensure I'm receiving something I can eat. Portions are HUGE and I always leave with a Buddha belly. Who doesn't love Chipotle??
