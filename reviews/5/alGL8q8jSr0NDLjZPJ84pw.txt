I love Mexican food restaurants and I am always looking for a really good one.  I had dinner at Ocho Locos in Anthem last night and I think my search is over!  The food was excellent..good taste not too spicy.  I highly recommend the Triple Dip option for an appetizer.  Terrific guacamole and the bean dip is exceptionally good.  They make their own salsa on site and it was very good.  Great food, great atmosphere and the price is extremely reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food.  And a special shout out to our server "Sam" (Samantha) she obviously takes pride in her position and is an awesome advertisement for the many options on the menu.  She was lovely and attentive and has a great smile too!  I highly recommend this restaurant and plan on making another trip there soon!
