This place was great. Food made like my grandma makes. The fajitas had an abundance of colorful bell peppers, homemade tortillas. My pollo and nopalitos plate was so tasty, my son had beef tacos dorados. They were like my family recipe. Horchata was refreshing and not too sweet. Rice and beans are decent and the guacamole molcajete was Sooo delicious!!! Service was excellent! 
We will be back. Those margaritas are on my hit list!
