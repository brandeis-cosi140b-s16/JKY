I am completely in love with this place! They not only make the best tacos and burritos but el chino beans are to die for! I now have a true food addiction to this place and go a few times a week. They also offer turkey and chicken options if you don't eat red meat, which is a plus!! You leave craving more and without the feeling your pores are oozing grease. This is quality food and cooked/seasoned to perfection. I look forward to each visit and their staff is always so welcoming and accommodating. This place is a MUST stop and so reasonably priced as well
