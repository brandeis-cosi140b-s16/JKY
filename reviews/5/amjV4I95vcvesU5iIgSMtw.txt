We found Rita's via yelp while trying to meet friends passing through Phoenix heading West on I-10 from I-17. We are from Ahwatukee and it was 100% worth the drive! The staff was wonderful, polite and efficient.  The food was amazing! So much flavor and the portions were just right. 
We plan to visit Rita's again, despite the drive we will find time to go.
