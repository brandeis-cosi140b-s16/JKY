My husband and I eat here at least once a week, sometimes even multiple days in a row. I love their chicken chimichanga smothered in the best green chile sauce ever!! We have ordered almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed with any of it. Everything is delicious! Love, love, love this place!!!!
