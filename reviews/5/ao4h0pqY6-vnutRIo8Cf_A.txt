I ate their tacos twice in one day last week and enjoyed some today. Not for the weak of heart and it's nothing like Mad Mex. Real tacos, real Mexicans, really good. They're only a couple bucks a taco so if you haven't gone than you're a toy. Also a grocery store which has a really awesome selection of latino foods.
