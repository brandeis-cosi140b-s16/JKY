A friend of mine recommended this place and I finally got a chance to try it. It doesn't stand out like most restaurants so if you drive by it, you may miss it. It's a nice mom and pop store. 

Oh my yum! The menudo and pozole are delicious. The portion is pretty big but if you really enjoy the soup, you can get the bottomless soup bowl. 

I also got the Michelada here. They make it really well. 

You can tell that everything is made fresh. We had to wait a few extra minutes for our chips and salsa because they were making the chips!
