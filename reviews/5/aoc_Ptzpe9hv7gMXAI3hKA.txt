Impressive customer service, extremely generous portion of meat and fresh tasting ingredients. This was my first visit and I used the drive thru, which at first glance was intimidating. The list of optional but included ingredients was huge! The menu was actually easy to navigate and order from once I read it thoroughly. I went with the suggested "pig" bowl and was not disappointed. I will go spicier next time for sure, as the pineapple salsa was tame but tasty.
