I gave this place a shot because I've tried just about every taco shop within the area and wanted something new. I'm so glad I did. Their setup is simple.. Good meats cooked over charcoal grills that give it awesome flavor. They don't serve rice but do have beans and offer a bar full of fresh cut veggies and salsas. I would recommend this place to all my friends. Definitely adding this spot to my daily lunch rotation.
