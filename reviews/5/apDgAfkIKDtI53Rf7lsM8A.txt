Wow what a nice surprise Angelina's was to come across! I felt like I was eating pozole at my Nana's house. Great customer service and quick fresh quality food. There were even little tea light candles on the table for a comfy environment to just devour great food. We will definitely be back for another open faced supreme. We had it with carne asada and it was so tender and flavorful!
