Be prepared. This is not TexMex. This is not a chain. This is a FANTASTIC local establishment that offers an incredible latin menu that will inspire your taste buds. For example: I hate almost all guacamole. But when it's made tableside and I'm at Barrio Queen, it's simply the best! The ingredients are fresh, you can get creative with what you want in it - like who'd think pomegranates and guac go together? It's simply wonderful here. My husband is a green chile verde connoisseur and he's always impressed with the flavor of the chile verde and quality of the carnitas. When the weather's nice, I love the patio and having a cocktail. Their drinks are always made with fresh juice and agave nectar which makes the 1,000 tequilas they have behind the bar taste even better!

You haven't lived until you've had Cochinita Pibil. Order it. Eat it. Love it! Then come back and order it again!
