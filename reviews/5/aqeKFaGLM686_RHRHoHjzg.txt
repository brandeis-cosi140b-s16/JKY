This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. We always stop by here on our way back from the airport; it's a family tradition. 
The chips and salsa are delicious although I have to add a little salt to both. When I used to work near the restaurant I would have lunch at least once a week. David, the owner, was always there to great my party. At lunch the service was really quick. 
Now that I work on the other side of the valley I don't get by as often, but when I'm on that side of town I always stop by to eat. I love the Tostada Especial with Machaca Beef. 
Los Compadres is great when you have a large party. They are willing to seat you together and will also divide the bill into separate tickets. When it is a large group they are slower, but they make sure your class is filled and the chips just keep coming. Sometimes I get full from the chips before the food arrives.
There is nothing fancy about this place just good home cooked food.  A party of two can eat for under $20.00.  In this economy that is a fantastic value!
