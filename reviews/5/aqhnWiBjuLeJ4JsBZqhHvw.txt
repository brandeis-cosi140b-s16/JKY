I am always looking for good home made mexican food. This simple little walk up window, wedged between a car wash and a mini mart, is awesome. Fat meaty asada tacos with the perfect match of sauce, onions and tomatoes. I will be returning to this place. (and the gas station attendant said the 2 dollar Tuesday Tacos are a geat deal too!)
