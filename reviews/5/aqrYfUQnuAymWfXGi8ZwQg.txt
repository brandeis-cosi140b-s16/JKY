Dont let the exterior fool you, you will be glad you came in the door, if your a first trimmer let them know and you can sample some of their best sellers.  This place is one of a kind. Very friendly and helpful staff. The food is incredibly delicious. My favorite is the jade red chicken and teriyaki chicken with refried beens and white rice.
