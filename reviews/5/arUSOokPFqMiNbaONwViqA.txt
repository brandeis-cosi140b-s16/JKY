Fideo del Mar is simply the best seafood dish on the menu. I know, it's weird getting an Italian dish in a Mexican restaurant, but it's so good! It comes with pasta, shrimp, scallop, crab meat and some scallions on top. I have had the same dish at their Newport Beach location as well and it's consistently awesome! My bf has tried their Enchilada, Chile Relleno & Taco and he's very satisfied with it. They have pretty good homemade salsa as well. Very fresh and yummy. If you want authentic Mexican food with a more upscale environment then Javier's is your place.
