Mangos has a few things that make it as good as it gets! For starters, the food is phenomenal! It doesn't matter what you want, it will have flavor and incredible taste! Not just that, every time I come the waiter is attentive and genuine. During the cooler seasons they have fresh tamales available - first come first serve. 

Heads up it's cash only - but worth a trip to the ATM if need be.
