This is the best Mexican food I have ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix and had my first red chile burro at age 3 when the family owned La Palma restaurant on McDowell back in the '50s. I have never eaten a cheese crisp as good as theirs. Their red chile is superb. I moved from Phoenix in 1968 to go to college but come back as often as I can. After 60 years of eating there I never tire of it!
