I had been wanting to try this place for weeks. We actually just ended up here unplanned, this past Tuesday we were headed to Thai Grill but when we arrived there the closed sign was up with a note saying "Closed today Tuesday because the cooks are tired and need a break, will open tomorrow Wednesday" Okaaayyy?? So of course we were disappointed, we sat in the parking lot a min or two trying to find another thai place close by, I really wanted some Tom Kha soup and Larb.. Anyways, we didn't find anything and I noticed KoMex was right down the street, so to KoMex we went! Thank god we did, this place was AMAZING. We did have to wait for about 10 min, they were packed, it was around 12:30, so it was lunch time. Once we got sat they came right over to get our drink order and then asked if we were ready to order, only except we didn't even have time to open the menu, so we asked for a few minutes. 

We ended up ordering a half order of the Bulgogi Fries, a half order of the Chow Fettuccine with shrimp and 4 Bulgogi tacos. Everything was delish! My favorite was the Chow Fettuccine, so good. The only thing I didn't really like was on the Bulgogi fries, there was WAAAYYY too much cheese... if they would have put half of the cheese on that they did, they would have been better. Ill definitely be going back multiple times to try EVERYTHING on the menu.

Im giving 5 stars for the food and price. As far as service goes, it was eh, they seemed too busy to give proper service, and it doesn't help that the dining space is small and all the tables are a little cramped. The only other thing I would change is their hours, they definitely need to be open late, its the perfect place for drunk food.
