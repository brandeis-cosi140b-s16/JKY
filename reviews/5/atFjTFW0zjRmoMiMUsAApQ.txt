I love what they've done with this place. The decor is sweet in this small space. They have Nessalla kombucha on tap and the most unique pies you've ever known. Get there early, though, as the lines can be long. 

Don't worry, your boring friends can still order "normal" pizza, but this is the place to branch out and try new flavors, like Nami Moon Farms red harissa chicken, spruce goad salami, za'atar, tzatziki sauce and oyster mushrooms or Ssamjang marinated Acadian red fish and shrimp, smoked Gouda, scallions, micro shingiku (chrysanthemum), basil and tobiko. Whaaat?? Seriously, I don't know how they think of these combinations, but they have something different every night, and often have fun tacos too. They also make interesting desserts. Last night's offering was rosemary shortbread, earl grey buttercream with orange curd. I'm not sure what this is, but I need more of it in my life (and my belly).

They post their daily pies on Facebook, but you don't even need to read that to decide to stop in. Walk in, say you want the special and go with it!
