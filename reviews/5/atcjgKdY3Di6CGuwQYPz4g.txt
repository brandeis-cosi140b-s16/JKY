On our drive back to San Diego from Tucson, we needed to stop for gas and food. Being in the middle of no where, we were lucky to stumbled upon this spot. I got a egg, bean, cheese, and bacon burrito and was quite impressed. My mom got a Pollo Asada taco and it looked really good. The place was legit, clean inside and the staff was friendly. I thought the food was delicious and I wish the place was closer so I could explore the menu more. I would recommend to anyone in the area.
