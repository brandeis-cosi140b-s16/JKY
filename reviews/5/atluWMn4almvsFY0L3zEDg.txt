My husband and I found Tacos Atoyac and were big fans. A big part of it was Dan. He remembered us, and he makes the meal and experience. When he left Tacos Atoyac, it wasn't the same for us. Then we heard about Mucho Macho Taco. 

Walking in, Dan remembered us right off the bat. The food was amazing, and just like the name suggests, it's mucho macho! They did not skimp on the meat, using good quality meats packed with amazing spices. 

My husband got the carne asada burritos, and bacon taco (yes, BACON!), while I had the roasted turkey mole taco, braised brisket taco, and 50/50 taco. They were amazing, filled with huge chunks of meat! The horchatas were sweet and refreshing. 

This place is much closer to our house, and we can ride our bikes to it! Apparently, if we ride our bikes we get a free drink! We will definitely be back to devour more of these amazing mucho macho tacos!
