Bonita's is absolutely delicious!! We have been here a few times and have tried the carne asada burrito, fish tacos, breakfast burrito and the pozole. Everything is great, especially the carne asada!! Chips and salsa is delicious as well as the baja sauce. We've ordered to go and have also dined in. We'll definitely be back!!
