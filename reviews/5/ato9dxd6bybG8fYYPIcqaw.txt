Came for lunch and hubby had lunch special combo chicken burrito, ground beef taco with retried beans and rice.  I had enchiladas de Jaiba (dungeness crab, onion and tomato). Very yummy. Everything fresh and service was fast. Wait staff authentic. Authentic Spanish music played. Not a commercialized Mexican place. Would definitely come back.
