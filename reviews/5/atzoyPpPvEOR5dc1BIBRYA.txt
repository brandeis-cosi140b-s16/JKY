Great food every visit! I'm not sure why others are giving it such low ratings, but I've also never been to the other locations. I love the chips and salsa and the quesadillas are unbelievable! I didn't think the price was outrageous - $15 for two with fountain drinks. Atmosphere is nothing to write home about but gets the job done. Can't wait to go back!
