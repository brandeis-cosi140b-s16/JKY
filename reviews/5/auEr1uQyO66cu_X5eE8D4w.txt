This is Mexican street style food at its finest. I had an awesome burrito here. This is comparable to Chipotle but more authentic. The menu is basically $10 per item. They have tacos for $2/each but they are quite small and you would likely need 3-4 of them to fill you up. For Vegas standards, the prices and quality of food here is awesome.
