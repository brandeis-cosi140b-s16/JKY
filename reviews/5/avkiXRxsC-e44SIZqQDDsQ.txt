The search for my go-to Mexican restaurant has finally ended! 

4 different kinds of salsa, all flavorful, spicy and not watered down. When you dine in, you get chips and all of these delicious salsas in fancy bowls.

We had the tamale plate with tacos, carne asada and chicken, and a bean & cheese burrito.

All of this was amazing minus the grizzle in the carne. The tamale sauce (red) was phenomenal and the tortillas were all very fresh so the beans didn't spill out of the burrito and the tacos remained intact. 

Dinner and lunch plates came with a pineapple and orange slice and shredded lettuce.

Our server, Irma's daughter was super sweet and very friendly.
