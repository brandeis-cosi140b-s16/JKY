I have NEVER written a review, and even created a yelp account to write one now. So I hope this means something to someone. 
Tonight, I went to Chipotle in Tempe (Off Rural and Baseline) my 5 star EXCELLENT review was inspired not by how I was treated, but by how I saw the customer before me be treated.
The employee Iren, attended to the customers every need. The customer ordered for a huge group and had specifics about food allergies as well as other instruction. Iren consistently displayed compassion and patience for every single request. If I owned a company or was the employee in charge of talent acquisition I would approach him immediately Traits I saw him possess are not taught, and are hard to come by. I hope Iren is appreciated in his position. For he could without doubt progress.
