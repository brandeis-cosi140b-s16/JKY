I've been going to this location for 10 years. It's service and freshness are better than any other I've been to, and they keep the place super clean. Even the bathroom is clean! They don't jip you on burrito fillings or sauce/toppings, their tomatoes taste like tomatoes instead of hand sanitizer, and I think I've only had a stale taco twice since they opened. That's impressive on its own!
