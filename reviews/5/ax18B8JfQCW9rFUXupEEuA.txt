Wow!  I took my mother who is visiting from out of town for lunch and we had an awesome meal (chicken taco salad).  My daughter had the mini tacos and she loved them along with the rice and beans. The service and food was excellent!  The resturant space is very cool and trendy.  I plan to go back this weekend to have a few drinks at the bar, looked like a fun place to hang out at night.  I will be back for sure!
