I love the veggie burrito here. They make it huge and put sour cream, pico, guacamole, beans and rice. It tastes like an actual mexican burrito. Not fake like taco bell. The green hot sauce they have is really hot but so good. I cant get enough of it. I reccomend this place for sure. Great authentic mexican food.
