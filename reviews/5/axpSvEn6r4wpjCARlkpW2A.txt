This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. So much we just came here two days in a row. 

When you sit down they bring everyone a glass of water and chips and salsa for everyone which is a mild and a hot (which isn't very hot). The chips are thick with just the right amount of salt. I could eat them for days! The food is always piping hot and comes out really fast.

The service isn't always personable but it's always efficient. We've never had a bad meal or bad service. We'll definitely be back.
