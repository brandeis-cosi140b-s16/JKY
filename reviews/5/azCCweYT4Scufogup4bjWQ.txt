Just came here for my first time and it won't be the last. The woman at the register was very excited to tell me about the different options (tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc) and the different meats they prepare. She even served me at least 3 samples of different aguas frescas that they have as well.

In the end I went with a regular taco with pork al pastor. Rice and beans came on the side and I also upgraded my drink to an agua fresca trifecta of a strawberry, mango, and horchata mix. Very good! I'll be back soon.
