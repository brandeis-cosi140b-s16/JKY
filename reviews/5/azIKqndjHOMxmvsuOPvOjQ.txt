So tasty!  I swung by because I was in the area on a weekday and tried the carne asada torta.  So good!  The menu is really inventive.  He offers a chile relleno burrito, which is next on my list to try.  Super friendly owner.

But it's a bummer this place is only open on weekdays until 6pm (despite what Yelp says, it is no longer open on Saturdays) and is not close to my work.  I may have to force roadrunnerfood.com to pick up and deliver for me.  I foresee many cravings for this food.
