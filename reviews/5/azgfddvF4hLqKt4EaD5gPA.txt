Great place to grab a quick and cheap bite to eat! The prices are low and the food tastes much better than their competition, namely Filiberto's. While the default options aren't the most vegetarian/vegan friendly, they make it easy to customize what you want (I always get a bean burrito with rice and potatoes). The portions are huge and they have an open chips and salsa bar, with plastic bags and cups to take some to go. They're open late too (1:00 AM), so great when you need a late night junk food fix.
