Delicious!  Had the Camarones del golfo,  delicious creamy sauce, large prawns, chorizo, too die for.  Tamarind margarita,  nice and tangy.  I'm comatose! Ignore the bad reviews,  so they don't like the lighting,  they don't wanna put quarters in the meter,  they don't like the deco,  they hate coming downtown,  they want to order cheese tacos,  people please,  don't be a Steve.

This place is authentic southern Mexican food!!
