Hidden close to the Scottsdale Quarter, El Santo is a real gem and has a ton more to offer than just the pool parties!  My wife and I (late 30's) have been for drinks and dinner three time over the past 2 months and absolutely love the place for it's great food, sexy vibe and outstanding service. The interior has two enormous bars, a large dining area a couple pool tables, elegant lighting and rich design. 

Given the atmosphere, I assumed it would be a Hooters re-run and that service would be horrible.  Our bikini clad waitresses were genuinely friendly, attentive and offered great service.  As a Mexican food snob, I was surprised at the quality and reasonable prices for both apps and full meals.  Nothing fancy, but better than 90% of Mexican I've ever had.  Drinks are not off the charts expensive with beers going for ($4-5)

I'm writing this because we've been on both Friday and Saturday night and couldn't believe that the place was not packed.  Given the sign is not visible from Scottsdale Rd there's got to be more promotion!
