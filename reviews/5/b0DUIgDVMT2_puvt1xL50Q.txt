Folks I normally go out with finally agreed to try this out after a few prior suggestions.  None of us were disappointed either by the food, service or ambiance.  I had the fish tacos and I recall that someone else had the salmon and our plates were cleaned.  Will definitely return and perhaps enjoy the patio.
