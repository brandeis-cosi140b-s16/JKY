The day my nine year old granddaughter agreed to pay for lobster on the way home from school was the day we fell in live with Lempira Restaurant. Unfortunately the lobster on the sign outside was the only one available that day!
We didn't mind because, by accident, we found the best Latin food ever! Although we like everything that we've tried, the soups are are terrific. As stated many times before, the portions are large and the atmosphere is authentic.
So what, if waitresses can't speak English. I've never had a problem when ordering.
All of the friends and acquaintances that I have introduced to Lempira Restaurant have been over the top enthusiastic with the selections and atmosphere. I love it!
