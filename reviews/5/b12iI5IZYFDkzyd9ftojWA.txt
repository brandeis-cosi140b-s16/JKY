Have eaten twice now from this establishment and each time i have, a party in my mouth and tummy ensues! 
I have mostly eaten their fusion tacos, and I love how they cram those little tortillas with meat and toppings. I also love to substitute one of my tacos with a lettuce wrap, just to change it up a little. Yum! 
On both occasions, I have done take out so im thinking that next time will be a dine in experience, cuz if the tacos are tasty half cold, then freshly made must be awesome! Great food, great prices, and great customer service. 
P.S. Love their salsa, and always make sure to ask for the kimchi on the fusion tacos.
