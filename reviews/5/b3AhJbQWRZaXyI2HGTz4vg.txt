This place is a total hole in the wall haven. Their tacos al pastor are SO good!! I also ordered a burrito al pastor. The meat had so much flavor!! This place is authentic, flavorful, and has friendly employees. And, they have really good prices!! A burrito, 2 tacos, and a soda all for like $8 total!!
