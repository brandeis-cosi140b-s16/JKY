I have always loved this place and just got around to reviewing it. The service is always warm and the food is soooo good. Just really good, AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The owner is Argentinian and is very welcoming. My faves are the beef tamales and cheese enchiladas with a home cooked sauce that will spoil you off other Mex places. If you like hot, try the pickled carrots and peppers. The prices are very reasonable...for 2 combo plates and 2 drinks total bill was under $15 and the best part is you leave with a full tummy knowing you ate food that your Mexican sister-law's family would have made you. Ok that's just me :)
