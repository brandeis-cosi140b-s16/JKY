Great Mexican restaurant close to many shops and activities. We just ate there for the first time and enjoyed one red and one green chile combo dinner. We could have had tacos, too. The food was authentic, delicious, and tortillas very nice. They have bottled drinks, sodas and ice tea. The service was friendly and quick. The chips and hot salsa exceptional! We will for sure return.
