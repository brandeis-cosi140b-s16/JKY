A cut above other fast Mexican concepts, Cafe Rio is always a favorite place of mine to eat at.

When you enter the line the first thing you will see are the fresh tortillas being made by hand.  While 3-4 will be spinning on the wheel getting delicious, the rest will be in some form from dough mixing in a blender to partitioned lumps being prepared for the heat.  The end result is always fantastic.

The pork barbacoa is the signature meat here and its a favorite with most I know who eat here regularly.  It has a very unique sweetness to it that goes well in any form you choose to have it, be it a salad, burrito or even nachos.  You really can't go wrong with the other choices but the pork barbacoa offers the most memorable experience.

They have mild, medium and hot sauces here for your dish.  The mild is basically salsa verde and as a tomatillo fan its something I opted for often.  The medium is an oddly sweet but warm sauce, and the hot is your typical red.  

If you like a side dish, the chips and queso is also very good.  The queso is given in a very nice quantity along with a metric ton of fresh chips that aren't too salty.  Holds up well if you get it to go as the cheese will still be very hot when you get it to your table.

If you opt to order extra meat the entire staff will yell out "Exxxxxxtra Meat!!" which can be fun.

My favorite meal from here would be the fire grilled steak burrito, enchilada style with extra meat. with chips and queso on the side.  Mild sauce for a tomatillo day, hot sauce for a flavor enhancer mood.  

They also offer a loyalty punch card program, so if you frequent it you will get free meals periodically which is a plus.
