I take back a part of my last review. Nothing about it was false but I think the owners of JB are really good about listening to customers. I come quite often and I've seen noticeable differences. The portions are way bigger which is why JB deserves 5 stars. 

But anyways.. Jalapeno bucks is truly tex mex food. It has barbecue and burritos. The brisket is awesome, and I like the red chili burrito. It's different than any I've had before. They slow cook it all day so it's super tender and has a great heat. There's nothing else in the burrito besides the pork, unless you ask for cheese and beans which is why I say it's different, and I agree that it's kind of liquidy but it's really good. I'm not a fan of the other two burritos though but you might like it. The Mac salad is sweet, pasta is al debate, and is the best Mac salad I've ever had. Beans and rice are also great. The beans are the best I've ever had. 

As for the ambience, it's all outside so i prefer taking it to go. Service is also great. The couple/owner (my guess) is so nice and they always remember me! I can tell how much they genuinely care about JB. 

My complaints are that Mac salad can occasionally be too drenched in dressing and they don't have the best hours (although the lady there told me they'd be expanding to Monday's when it gets cooler!) 

Overall though the food is so worth it. It's worth trying out.
