I've only been to two Chipotles, so this may not mean much, but this Chipotle is great. The employees are really fast and nice, and the portions are HUGE. The customer service is stellar. I have only had one bad experience here due to a very unhappy employee.

When I finally tried their sofritas, I was stunned. I did not expect tofu to taste so savory. I only got the sofritas to avoid the meat options, not because I had an independent motivation to get them. Now, I can confidently say that sofritas are good in themselves. Whatever they're putting on these, it's ace.

I tire of Chipotle, but that's only because this is one of the very few places that you can reliably eat vegan on Green St. It's also really convenient that they serve beans because you can up your protein intake.

The lines get insanely long, so you should order on the app. You can set your pickup time to 45 minutes or more, so prepare to order ahead.
