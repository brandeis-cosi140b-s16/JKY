Amazing tacos.  Girlfriend had mini chimis and I crushed the tacos.  We keep finding our way back.  The Carne Asada actually tasted marinated,  while slightly grilled.  The meat is always juicy and done medium. They brought the wrong order out first time around, gave us that order,  then brought out the correct order.  Bartender was cool.  Great time.  Highly recommend.
