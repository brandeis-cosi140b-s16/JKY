This place has very good carne asada tacos/burritos, beans, rice, guacamole and the atmosphere is fantastic! Highly recommend for good food.  

Service on the other hand lacking.  They wouldn't do separate checks for our group, we had to get up and get more chips etc for ourselves and they did not come over to refill our waters until we were all done eating.  They never came to check on us while we were eating.  Then when the bill came they had added a gratuity of 20% which was listed as the highest on their gratuity list.  Considering the service they should have got nothing.  Would not recommend place for groups, we had 8 people in our group.
