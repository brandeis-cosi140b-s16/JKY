I would give this place 10 stars if I could. My dad was craving ceviche, so I decided to take them to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. There is a reason the reviews for this restaurant is so high - it has great food, great service, and beautiful furniture/ decorations. 

Before we received our order, we were given chips + salsa/guac. The chips were very oily and I wasn't a big fan, but that initial impression was soon overcome with the best tasting ceviche on top of a crispy corn tortilla. My mom, who isn't a fan of cilantro, said that it was the highlight of her meal. 

My dad and I decided to share the House Special/ Molcajete ($30 for two people), which consisted of shrimps, two tilapila pieces, two chicken slices, and two beef slices in green sauce. It came with corn tortillas, rice, beans, and salad. None of my family members can eat spicy foods, but there is also an option for the "Diablo" sauce, which I heard is pretty spicy. We were definitely not let down - it was just the right taste and the right temperature. My mom got the garlic shrimp (I think it was $13?) and the portion for the main piece was relatively small-medium in size, but it also came with rice, beans, and salad. She liked the clean taste.

The service was great; our waitress constantly checked in to see if we needed anything. The noise level was loud because there were constantly people coming in and out of the restaurant, but that signifies just how many people are fans of this restaurant. Also, for anyone who's curious, there are TVs (might be good for game-days).

At the end of our meal, we got a free coconut cake by checking in to Yelp, and the cream on the cake was delicious; the icing tasted like a sweeter version of coconut ice cream. When we were finished, we were way too stuffed. Dad said that we should come back again with the aunts - that's one of the rare times I've ever heard him say, "let's come back again". 

Highly recommended! If you like seafood + Mexican food, go here.
