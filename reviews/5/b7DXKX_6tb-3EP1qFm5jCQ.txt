Why can't you have an LA location?!
I seriously lay awake at night craving your three elusive salsas and undeniably perfect chili quiles.  I have spend many moons in rural mexico, mexico city, and tehuacan; nothing reminds me of my time south of the border more than Parrilla's Mexico city cuisine. 
What you must try...
chili quiles - best ever, just epic cheesy chips, sauce and goodness.
tacos - all there meat is chargrilled with a little bacon, peppers and onions. amazinggggggg
Chuleta Suiza - a real version of a quesadilla, there is something about the flavor of the pork and the cheese they use that makes me weak in the knees.  
Really any of the dishes they serve on a grill - Parrillada de Pollo and my fav ...
Platillo Mixto con Bisteck - Melted cheese with chorizo and grilled peppers topped with avocados, served with two charbroiled beef tacos. agggghhhhhhhh

Oh my god i cant even take reviewing this place, i am slipping into deep depression knowing i have to wait until Christmas to eat here again... oh the humanityyyyyy... btw the service is either amazing or sucks horribly but once that sauce hits your mouth (dirty) you wont care if Hitler just brought you more chips.
OHHH and make sure to get a Cadillac Marg, combined with a full meal  it has been known to educe a happy coma.
