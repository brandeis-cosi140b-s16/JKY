There are 2 of these carts in Vegas that I know of, and oh....my.....there is no better taco in my option. These are simply amazing. $1.50 each for small double corn shelled bites. The pork and pineapple are the best but the beef is great too. I wish I could review more but every time I go all I can do is stuff myself sick on the pork- unbelievably yummy!
