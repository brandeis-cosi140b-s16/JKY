The best Mexican food I've ever had!  although I haven't had that much experience with Mexican food (Wahoo's)  Haha!
But the service was very good and the food was even better!  
They give you chips and sauces.  Your meal comes with beans and rice.
I had fish taco's that were so good I stuffed myself and ate it all!  My husband had enchilada's and they boys had beef & pork burrito's.  No one had any complaints.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  I just can't get over how good it was.

We don't have anything even close to this in Hawaii!
