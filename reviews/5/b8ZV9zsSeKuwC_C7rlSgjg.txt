This is one of those places I hold very close to heart. I grew up eating here and anytime I come back to the valley it's a must stop. Today was that day and I can only say it's as good as it ever was. 
Old school, Arizona style mexican cuisine at its finest.

Thank you Rosita's for staying true to your roots and never compromising your quality.

5 stars isn't enough but all I can give.
