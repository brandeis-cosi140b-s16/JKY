Talk about integrity!  While ordering lunch on 10-12-2014 at 2:38pm, at Filibertos 17224 N 19th Ave, Phx., Az... I dropped over $200.00 cash on the floor without knowing it.  Fortunately Veronica Monrroy was hard at work cleaning the floors.  She found the money and brought it to me.  This is a fine example of integrity, honesty and good business.  Veronica Monrroy is also friendly and gracious in her work ethic as is exemplified by her kindness.  Not only is the food great and other employee professional and friendly, it is a clean well keep restaurant.  A customer and referral for life. Rick Melville
