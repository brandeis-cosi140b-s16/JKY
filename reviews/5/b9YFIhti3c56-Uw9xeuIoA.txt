For the last six months I have been intrigued by this little building with a sign reading "Coming soon Caldero."  Needless to say I wanted to see if this was just another simple Mexican Restaurant or something more.  After tonight I definitely believe it to be the ladder.  My wife and I had the Mole with Chicken and the Pork stuffed Poblano and I couldn't be happier.  I am excited knowing that this is within walking distance, but I encourage all of you to drive over and check it out.  Their happy hour specials are reasonable and you won't be dissappointed.
