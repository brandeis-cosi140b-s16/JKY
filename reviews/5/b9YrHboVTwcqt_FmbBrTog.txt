What a lovely spot for a lunch consisting of Mexican fare of quesa, tacos, salsa bar, strong sangria. Superb flavors and I greatly enjoyed the paintings by Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez. 

I finally had a chance to try horchata garnished with pecans, berries, cinnamon. I couldn't help but think about the tune by Vampire Weekend teehee 
Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco of corn tortilla stuffed with beer battered dogfish shark - nice and soft.
Maria Sabina Quesadilla of Oaxaca cheese with sauteed wild mushroom melange - crunchy and cheesy yummy! I'm glad my friend took me here while I was visiting!
