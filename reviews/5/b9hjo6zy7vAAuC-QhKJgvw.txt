Their tacos are great - prepared to order, and always delicious. But the popsicles -- OH, THE POPSICLES. My first visit here earlier this year, we did not get a popsicle and I'd been fantasizing about them ever since. We went here pretty much first thing on our most recent visit, and were not disappointed. We had the lime, coconut, and caramel and all of 'em were fantastic. I can't wait to go back!
