My friend showed me the Man vs. Food segment showcasing Los Reyes de la Torta and  so we came to Phoenix for SF Giants Fantasy baseball camp, we decided to try Torta Del Rey.  All the bragging about how big and tasty this torta is true.  I had a fabulous dinner here that was delicious, quickly served, and very affordable.  You would think that the torta would come with some tortilla chips, but no!  Instead, you get a side order of ruffles potato chips.  It's a great combination with the torta.  After a long day of playing baseball, I devoured the torta and the chips with ease.  

There are a lot of interesting choices on the menu and it intrigued me.  I wish I lived closer because I would like to try other dishes.  

Los Reyes de la Torta...absolutely the Kings of the Torta!
