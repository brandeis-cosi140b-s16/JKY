This place was great!  I wasn't sure what to expect based on such mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.  Great food, attentive and friendly servers and a nice atmosphere.  We went for an early dinner on a Friday with our kids and sat on the patio and everyone was SO nice.  Best Mexican food we've had in a while and in a great place!  The only negative I can think of is the parking, which can definitely get tight as the restaurant gets more crowded.  Can't wait to go back!
