We lived in New Mexico for a few years and one of our favorite places to eat was Garduno's.  When we moved to Las Vegas, we missed the food (Hatch green chiles) most of all.  It was such a joy to find that there is a Garduno's here too.  Their stuffed sopapillas are FABULOUS!  Their machaca is FANTASTIC!  The service is great and the salsa bar is yummy too.  Really a nice pleasant environment and prices are reasonable too.
