Edit: So on January 20th, this restaurant closed its doors after over 50 years of service. I just found out about this today because it's my birthday and I would usually go to Matta's on my birthday since it's my favorite place. Well, not this year apparently.

Fuck.

There is a Matta's Grill restaurant in Mesa, but I haven't been - I hear it's not the same. They are supposed to be opening the old restaurant at a new location at some point... in Mesa. I hope it's closer to me. 

Anyway, at least I can still order their salsa online. The thing about this place that was so great is that most Mexican food places can't get it all right... if they have good beans, their salsa is shit. If they have good margaritas, they have awful guacamole. If the beef is awesome, the chicken sucks. There's always something missing... at Matta's, they did everything right... their salsa alone is enough reason to go there since I have yet to taste any salsa from another restaurant that is anything other than either nasty mildly hot bean mush or else totally bland diced veggies. 

Matta's has a hearty fresh and reasonably hot salsa that is full of flavor. Aside from that, they have some of the best beans, guacamole, beef, and chicken in the valley... correction: had. It's also one of the few places I've been to where a simple cheese crisp is actually perfect and crispy - not just a nasty puddle of grease and crap melted cheese.

Anyway - in spite of the negative reviews, this place was fantastic and I really hope they reopen soon. The comments about it being trendy or just for white americans are absurd. It was quite the opposite of both of those assessments. There was never anything trendy about this place - if anything it was a little outdated. As for being mexican food for white americans - it was more flavorful than all of the authentic mexican cuisine I've had in my travels.

[End Edit]
______________________________________

Easily my favorite mexican food restaurant in the world. I've been eating here for over 15 years and I love this place to pieces. I buy cases of their salsa for use at home. I take girls here on dates only if I really really like them.

The seating and atmosphere isn't the best in the world, but it's appropriate and it doesn't really matter. The food is just so amazing. The customers are mostly mormon families with their 9 blonde kids or else elderly couples. It's not the most fun place to people watch, but the booths are private enough.

Just go eat there.
