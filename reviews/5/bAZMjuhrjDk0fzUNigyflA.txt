My first time here today. Let me start off by saying that I love a good carne asada burrito. I've had them at many different spots. Speedy's carne asada burrito was absolutely delicious. Definitely the best yet! I also enjoyed a chicken Taco. Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was also great. Very nice employee's. I highly recommend it.
