If you're looking for fresh, healthy, quick and tasty, The Blue Burrito is a sure bet. We recently tried the Shea/Scottsdale Rd. location (NE corner), which has a very attractive bar. The whole restaurant has a modern, comfortable, welcoming feel, but the long bar really caught our attention. It's the perfect place to come after work to enjoy a drink, some socializing, not spend a lot or wait long for your food.  We originally ordered only iced teas until we saw how reasonably priced the margaritas were, which were delicious and refreshing.

The staff was friendly, patient, helpful and exuded the feeling that they liked working there. I even chatted a bit with Memo the cook, whose open kitchen was clean and orderly.

As for the food, it's very satisfying and will cause next-day cravings! My husband orders the shrimp burrito, which is really big! I must have the machaca beef tacos and our little one likes the cheese quesadillas. The rice and beans are good sides, but the free chips,  pico de gallo and the available salsas are positively addictive! 

This location is now our favorite Blue Burrito :)
