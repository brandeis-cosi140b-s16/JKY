I took my wife to Patron for the first time last night. We both enjoyed the food and the service was excellent. It's disappointing to read all the negative reviews. Especially from people who grew up in parts of the country that offer "out of this world" Mexican food. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have had some of the best authentic Mexican food in the country.
 The manager is open to constructive criticism and is making changes. They are adding different items and taking a look at whats not working.  I think Patron is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh and will continue to get better.
