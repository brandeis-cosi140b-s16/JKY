I have been fortunate lately because most places that I've taken the time to eat at have been very good.  This place is no exception.  Great authentic Mexican food.  I had slow roasted pork tacos with incredible fries and chipotle ketchup.  Simple but great food.  The pork tacos were very tender and had just the right amount of spice.  My wife had an avocado, mango, shrimp, tomato salad with a vinegarette.  It was very tasty.  Again, simple and fresh.  This is the only place in the valley we've been where they can actually make a margarita correctly.  If you've ever been to Mexico they typically use quality tequila, fresh sqeezed lime juice, and and orange liquor (triple sec, cointreau).  The bartender here makes them just like that, no disgusting sweet and sour or other sweet juices.  You should be able to taste the tequila and just because there is tequila in the drink doesn't mean you're going to turn into a raging drunk and black out.  If you drink enough of anything that will happen.  A good 100% agave tequila adds flavor.  Try it you might like it.  He also gave us a great idea for making margarita's with tequila, lime, and a little agave syrup.  Cool guy and great idea.  You can buy agave syrup at trader joe's or fresh n easy.  We use 2 shots of tequila, 1 shot fresh lime juice, and 3/4 shot triple sec or cointreau.  However, instead of the triple sec or cointreau I am going to try 1 big teaspoon of the agave syrup.  Should be good.
