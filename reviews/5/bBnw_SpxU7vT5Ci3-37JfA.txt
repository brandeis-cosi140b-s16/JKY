Best Roberto's I have been to. I'm extreamly happy this location is close by. I've had some dreadful food from other Roberto's locations but I knew I would eventually find a good one and this one is it. I always get the carne asada fries and they are delicious. The meat actually seasoned pretty good, unlike other Roberto's. I have also tried the taquitos and burritos all very delicious. Love the horchata and the fresh pepinos, relish and lemon they have set for the costumers. I am very very picky when it comes to Mexican food, I have certain expectations and they sure make the cut.
