Another great addition to downtown!!! I love that they use the same kind of tortillas you would find in Mexico. Interesting history in this church. I love how they kept a lot of the original church in the remodel. At this moment I am eating their salsa which is perfect. Spicy but not like you ate the sun. The tacos are Mexico meets urban. Super creative. I'll be back for sure!
