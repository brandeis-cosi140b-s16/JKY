You ever have an experience where in the middle of it, you realize that you are at the pinnacle - the zenith - of that particular type of experience?  It was my last night in Phoenix and hap and circumstance led us to Barrio Cafe.  My Karma must be fabulous right now, as I tell you without hyperbole that it was the best meal I have ever had.

Filet mignon topped with Mexican crab meat and goat cheese coupled with two top shelf margaritas. I almost balked as I think the margaritas were $9 and the steak $25-ish (more than I'm usually inclined to spend) but hey - last night of the vacation so why not.

I tried to savor it, but I just wanted to gorge myself on it.  It was so tasty that words fail me.  I know that some day if I find myself on death row, this is the meal I will request.  I will not be surprised if the sheer ecstasy of the meal kills me first.
