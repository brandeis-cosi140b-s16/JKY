Absolutely love this Mexican restaurant.  This is the place to go for homemade food.  They have two salsas, I prefer the very spicy  salsa and the rest of family prefers the chunky salsa.  I love the enchilada's with red sauce.  If you save room for dessert they make great sopapillas with honey and butter, delicious!!!  Theresa always makes us feel like family when we go.
