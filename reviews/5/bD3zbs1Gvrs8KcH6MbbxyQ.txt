This was a first time experience for me and it was AWESOME! We sat out on patio (which is much quieter than inside) the weather was perfect, we sat with great company, had an awesome waiter and delicious food.  I really couldn't ask for more. I love that they had gluten free options too!  This will be a regular spot for me as long as I can sit on the patio.  I admit if I sat inside I might have a different opinion of this place.  When i walked inside to go to the bathroom I realized how LOUD it was inside. They definitely need to work on the acoustics to make it more personal for each table.  AND pretty please arrange your table better so there can be a more clear path to the bathroom.  All in all, this places deserve a 5!
