Can not give enough kudos to Pacos Tacos and Tequila. I thought we would never come across a decent tex mex in Charlotte. Yay! The Holy Guacamole done at tableside is perfection. They put just the right amount of salt and lime to get your mouth watering for one of their great margaritas and don't be afraid of going all in on the chili. It's a nice compliment to the avacado and not very spicy at all. We also tried the tortilla soup which was made in a nice light broth and chicken burrito that could have been shared by two men with big appetites and completely satisfied them. Overall the food was outstanding for Tex Mex and the price was great.  Our server was very friendly and the food came out right when we wanted it to. We also really enjoyed the setting. For me the only thing that could have made it better would be some Chili Rellenos on the menu, but other than that I was a happy camper. There has been a lot of thought put into the upfit of the restaurant space. We were seated in the back of the restaurant which has a great decor and nice natural lighting coming through its roof which is plastered with skylights. We all agreed this will become one of our regular Charlotte haunts. Thanks Pacos!
