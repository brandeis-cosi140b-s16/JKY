We were running an errand and stopped here for a bite to eat after work. Hands down the BEST Mexican food in Matthews and the best I've had in Charlotte! The portions are great and the food is full of flavor and quality. The chiles rellenos were really good and the fajitas were absolutely delicious. So glad we found this place and we will definitely be back!
