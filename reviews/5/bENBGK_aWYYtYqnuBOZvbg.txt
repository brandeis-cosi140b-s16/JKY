To the people crying about the neighborhood, seriously man up you lil bitches.  You think you getting $2 tacos on the strip or in Beverly Hills?  They gotta pay rent people.

The pork adobada is everything and more than what the yelpers here say.  It is the bomb.  The chorizo = bomb.  Lengua = bomb.  Cant remember the others but I have tried them all.  I stick with the adobada for the most part, why mess with a good thing?  The adobada fries are also bomb, french fries smothered in guacamole, sour cream, cheese and adobada how the hell can you go wrong? Answer: you can't! 

The one thing I would like to say as good as the tacos are, please please try the mulas.  IMO this is where its at.  The difference between a mula and a taco?  CHEESE baby.  Mula is two tortillas ( I get corn but whatever) with cheese and all the fixins loaded with adobada like a big taco sandwich.  I don't even get the tacos anymore I stick with the mulas baby.
