I love this place. The service is excellent and owner/manager, Peter, is great. Was here tonight and they had trivia night. Lots of fun. Plus they will change the channel on the TV to whatever game you want to watch. Happy hour goes until 730 and that is rare. The mni chimis are delicious and plenty for 2 people. The drinks are strong and the bartenders are great at trying new drinks. Its a nice place place to try if waiting for your movie to start. I will be back soon.
