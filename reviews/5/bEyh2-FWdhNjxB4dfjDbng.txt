Wow. Super amazed about how delicious this little hole in the wall place is. I had there fitness burrito that came with a whole wheat tortilla, chicken, guac, black beans. Delish. My boyfriend got the shrimp fajitas. Plus they have wifi so while you study , you can have a few margs! Ha. Very happy :) and our server was the sweetest.
