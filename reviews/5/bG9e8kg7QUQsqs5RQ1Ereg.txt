Living in Arizona for the past 8 + years, i have pretty much tried most Mexican food from the cheapest to the most expensive. 

However, on my last night in Arizona, my best friend suggested that we shall go to Abuelos. He told me that it was an upper end Mexican restaurant.

We went to the restaurant close to 10:00pm. and they were closing at 11:00. It was a Friday night. When we enter the restaurant, you will be greeted by a fabulous architecture, and interior design. The most eye catching design was the sky blue ceiling. It was a similar design you will find in Vegas. 

We sat and was greeted by our waitress. The menu has plenty of choices and everything sounds and looks really good. Then they serve chips and salsa. The chips was warm, thin and crispy, while the salsa is not any typical restaurant salsa. It has a decent amount of spice, heat and a flavorful taste of salsa made from fresh ingredient. Not like those in bottle. 

For those of you who visit Arizona once a year for Spring Training.. I HIGHLY suggest that you should go to visit the restaurant. It's located across from the Peoria Sports Complex. Nothing is better than some cold beer and great food after a day of baseball.

If i return to Arizona.. i will surely visit the restaurant and recommend it to other friends and family
