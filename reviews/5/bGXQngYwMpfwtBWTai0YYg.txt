This is by far the best restaurant in Henderson. Not only is the food fresh, but the menu is very unique. The service was impeccable. ! Everyone should give it a try, and support a local business owner at the same time. I had the scallops, and they were to die for. 

There were only a few other parties when I was there, but I think its because no one knows about this place yet! 

I'd definitely go back! In fact, I'm meeting a friend there this weekend!!
