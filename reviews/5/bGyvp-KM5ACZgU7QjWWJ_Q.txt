I ordered the chorizo (made in-house!) nachos and they were fabulous!  Enough food for at least 2-3 people.  My husband ordered a burrito and it was really good too. We ordered chips and quac and were pleased with both.  Tortilla chips were freshly made and perfectly seasoned. Portions were huge and the manager was extremely helpful with answers to our questions and made menu recommendations that were spot on.  We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu.
