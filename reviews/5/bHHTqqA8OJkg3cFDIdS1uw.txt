So my fiancee and I were looking for places to have our wedding dinner with our new joint families... We looked at all the usual suspects, JoÃ«l Robuchon, Prime, Twist, etc...

What we realized was... why go fancy when you can go big, and big Mexican style. We are both S.Cal kids and we realized that for the $1,000+ that our parents would spend on dinner for 7 or 8 at one of those places we could have 2,041 tacos... so we did that instead.

SO TOTALLY AWESOME. I suggest if you ever can do it, SPEND THE MONEY AND WITNESS 2,041 tacos. 

We are now looking for a lap band studio to help us with the weight we gained.

LOVE LOVE LOVE the "Dell"
