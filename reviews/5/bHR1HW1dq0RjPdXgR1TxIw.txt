Love the decor. Wait staff are super. Wow, the ribeye steak was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly. The chips and salsa were very nice. There are items they have not on the menu. Just ask your wait staff. Yes, ribeye is not on the menu. Amazing place. Soups are great and the presentation is wonderful.
