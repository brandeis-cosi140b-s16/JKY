Great food, great service, and wonderful staff!  We held my husband's 50th birthday party and everyone appreciated the relaxed atmosphere,  good food and excellent friendly service.  The restaurant easily accommodated our guests, dj and had an open area for dancing.  Their menus options were very flexible, making party planning easy and stress-free.   Their mango margaritas were a hit!  One guest liked the place and service so much, they booked their upcoming birthday event that night!  Thank you Bitzee mama's for all your help in making our party very memorable!  We will be back again! !!
