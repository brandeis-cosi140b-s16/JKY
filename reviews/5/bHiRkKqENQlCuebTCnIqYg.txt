Friendly attentive staff. Glass coke bottles like in Mexico :) caution! The habanero sauce they give you on the side is extremely hot. I put dots on my taco and my mouth was on fire! The taco was filled with carnitas. Great portion!! I was full of two tacos! I love little dive places like this. Great people, culture and amazing food done right.
