Wife and I returned with friends for our fourth visit. They appear to still be tweaking the restaurant and their offerings. Waiter was very friendly and efficient. Met the new Manager and he explained some of the changes. Very friendly and professional. 

Food was very well done as on all our visits. Will be coming back yet again.
