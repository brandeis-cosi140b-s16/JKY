My husband and I purchased a Groupon Now for this restaurant.  So glad we did!
The food is awesome!  The people are wonderful.  Super quality ingredients and everything is made fresh each new day. And as the owner said "there is love put into the preparation of the food". You can tell.  Sonoran Grill is one of those places that leaves your belly saying "Thank you for bringing me here."  Healthy, super tasty and not in the least bit greasy.
The only downside is that we live a long distance away and are already craving our next meal at the Sonoran Grill.  What the heck,  it's worth the drive.
