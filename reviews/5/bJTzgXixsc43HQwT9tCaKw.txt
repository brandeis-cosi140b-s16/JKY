This is a good solid little inexpensive hidden pizza joint. Everything is handmade right in front of you if you pop in, and they deliver as well. Celas's has been open for a long time, but hasn't ever appeared on Yelp. The owner is really nice and so I figured I would help him out and put him on the map. 

It's not a fancy place by any stretch - there are still a few small remnants of the Pizza Hut this used to be, and it isn't candles and tablecloths. Don't expect to be wowed by the atmosphere, but the kitchen is clean and it smells good inside. For the price, you're going to be hard pressed to find much better. 

The 5 stars are for the value you're getting here... the bang for the buck. I'm not ready to put this on my list of top pizza joints in the Valley, but it's certainly a good little hidden neighborhood option.
