People have greatly under rated the 24 hour marinated chicken theighs in mexican seasoning and juices here! They are moist and fall right off of the bone to be shredded for tacos! 1lb tortillas, 1lb Barbacoa, 4 theighs, 1/2 lb queso fresco, 2 salsas for 2 plus leftovers! #Bang#sodilish#deservesahashtsg#instagrampostworthy
