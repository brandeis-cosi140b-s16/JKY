Coming from San Diego, you can't help but get a little burnt out on Mexican food.  I'm sorry, it's good, but it happens.  That said, it was decided to brave the Vegas Mexican Frontier.

The place was very clean with open spaces, and the atmosphere is nice.  They had a mariachi, but he had more style than I was used to, wearing a simple nice shirt, pants and tie instead of the sombrero/serape combo that all supposed stereotypical mariachis seem forced to wear.  Even better, you could enjoy his crooning without him getting in your face, so it wasn't awkward, and kept on the pleasant side.

The food is tasty and served very quickly.  I tried the chicken with cream/wine/garlic, and it was spicy.  Not overbearingly so, but just enough to give it a full flavor.  The servers were good about attending to your needs.  Prices are fair enough for what you get.  They seem to have a healthy tequila list of which I'll have to sample for the next time.

Admittedly, I was in a bit of a grumpy mood when I went there, but the overall restaurant experience lightened me up.  I had a good time with the place, and I'm sure the experience will improve as my mood does for the next time.
