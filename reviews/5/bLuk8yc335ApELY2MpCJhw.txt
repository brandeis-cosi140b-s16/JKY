Maria's is located next to the place where I work, and time and time again, it has served as an awesome option for a quick lunch or dinner. For under 5.00, you can get a great carne asada, california, or breakfast  burrito, which is a steal in my opinion. Normally, they'll set you up with some extra sauces or guacamole as well. Muy Bien!
