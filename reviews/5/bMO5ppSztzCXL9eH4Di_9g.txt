best tacos ever ! seriously ! 
I wish they were closer to the east valley , but I'm always more than willing to make 45 minute drive out there . 

must try the vampiros. the salsa they put in them is amazing. I wish they opened earlier & I would be there all the time. 
 
if you love tacos as much as I do , you must go here!
