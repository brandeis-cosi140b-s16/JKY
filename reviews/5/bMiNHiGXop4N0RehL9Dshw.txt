At first glance, the place is reminiscent of Chipotle, however the food actually has flavor. This has easily become one of my favorite Mexican joints in Phoenix. This is definitely for guys like myself who are always trying to grab something filling and fairly cheap like chipotle, but are starting to become sick of the same bland flavors of Chipotle. I usually get the rib meat and chicken all in their freshly made half flower and half corn enchilada. Also, I highly recommend their corn bread as a side even though it costs a little extra, you will thank me later. There are many sauces and condiments available, so do not be scared to have the staff run through each ingredient with you as they usually do anyway. Also add an egg to your enchilada if you're feeling wild!
