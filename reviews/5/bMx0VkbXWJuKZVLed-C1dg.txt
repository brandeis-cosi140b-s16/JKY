Heard about Pollo Correteado through some friends on the 4th of July. Of course, I had to go about the next day to try it. I'm always searching for the next great foodie venture. We call to place an order, but there were about to close. They were kind enough to way an additional 15 minutes for us to drive over for our Take out order. We paid (there's a sign that says Cash only) and when we got back into the car, the smell of the food was AMAZING. Note, I'm not sure if this a Mexican or Peruvian food, but it is AMAZING! We got home and opened up that delicious meal! The chicken was rotiserie, the tortillas might have been home made, the onions were amazing, the salsa was fresh with the perfect amount of heat, they used white beans, and their Mash potatoes were not what you would expect... THEY WERE BOMB.com

You're welcome in advance if you used my review to lead you to this tiny little jewel!
