Multiple positive experiences here, so I decided to leave a review. Excellent customer service! There was a little mix up with my wife's order, and they fixed it immediately, within one minute, no joke. Each person serving us was kind. The manager Cici was pleasant and friendly, she complimented my pregnant wife and made her feel good. Oh, and the pork burrito was superb!
