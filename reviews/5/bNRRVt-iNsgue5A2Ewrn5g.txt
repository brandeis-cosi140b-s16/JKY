I went through the drive-thru, gave the guy a complicated order. I got like 20 types of burritos and tacos. He got it right the first time, he was very friendly and professional. His name is Nick. I will definitely go back to this location because of him. I wish all Taco Bell workers value their jobs like this guy. Thanks, Nick.
