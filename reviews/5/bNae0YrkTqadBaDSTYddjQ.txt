The restaurant was very easy to find. The host sat us down quickly and was very friendly. The waiter brought us water (kids cups for my daughters which was a nice touch) and took our orders right after we sat down. My girls split the chicken strips meal. I ordered the Hatch green chile burrito and my hubby got the Mexican pizza. We waited 15 minutes for our food and everything came out hot and delicious. My burrito came with a yummy ancho chile sauce that was slightly spicy but very tasty and a nice addition to the burrito. The Mexican pizza was excellent! The strips of Hatch green chiles were wonderfully flavorful without too much spice. The crust was a flatbread so it was crispy and not too heavy for 1 person, though the portions were shareable. The kids loved the chicken and I liked that it came with beans and rice instead of fries. 5 star service and food! We will be back to La Ristra!
