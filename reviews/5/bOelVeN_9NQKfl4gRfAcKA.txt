Wow this place is amazing! Tucked backed in the corner of a shopping center, this place is a must for trying out. Fresh hot chips and salsa when you sit down and strong cocktails that exceed expectations. I normally don't order chicken because beef and pork is just so good, but I went with the chicken fajitas and the flavor/ tenderness of the chicken was muy delicioso. The lady ordered the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and they have a bit of a kick but are well worth it with the flavor punch you get.  With the staff being very attentive and the food so good, we're definitely  coming back to try happy hour and breakfast.
