Great concept! You have to love  korean food in order to enjoy the fusion of both. My Latin friends didn't  enjoy  it as much as I did. I'm filipino and enjoy all Asian foods. Living  in San Diego I got a lot of Mexican food being so close to the border. I love this place! The other reviews are all on point. I'm gonna make this my new fav. When I'm in town. Fast, friendly service. What more can you ask for right!
