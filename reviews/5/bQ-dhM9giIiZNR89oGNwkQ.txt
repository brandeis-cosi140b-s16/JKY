Queso Chicheron (fried cheese the size of an "american Mexican salad" bowl, Lobster Thermidor Taco (OMG I want BOTTLES of the sauce on this), Mixed Cocktail (Shrimp and Octopus) Shrimp Tortilla Soup, Pork Gordita, um... Other stuff... Every bite has been tender, delicious, perfect!!!! Will be back again and again and again!!!!  And Again!  Love love love!
