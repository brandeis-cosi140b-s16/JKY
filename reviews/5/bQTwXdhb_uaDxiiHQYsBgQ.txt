If I could give these guys more than 5 stars, I definitely would! 
Their service is amazing, the place is very clean, and I finally found a place where they make California burritos the right way.  I came from San Diego and since I moved here, I've been missing the way Mexican food is in SD and now I have a favorite place to go whenever I'm missing Cali. I had a very good first visit, and I will definitely come back again very soon! Keep it up!!
