If you are looking for upscale, modern Mexican, this is the place to go. Beautifully situated across the park from the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts, it is a great place to eat before a concert. The patio is great and the decor inside is warm. Be prepared to spend some money, but you will get really well prepared food. The drinks are also better than average. The funny thing is that while this is very upscale, they welcome community groups on the patio. Last time we went, there was a reception for people who had adopted dogs; and the dogs were there, too. It was really pleasant.
