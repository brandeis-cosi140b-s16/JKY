Amazing AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Employees are happy to help if you have any questions. Price is relatively inexpensive and you get a huge quantity. The tongue and tripe tacos are delicious! And the Chicharron en salsa rojo was delicious! The churros and white milky drink (can't remember what it was called) are also great! Would come back everyday if I could! Great salsa bar selection too!
