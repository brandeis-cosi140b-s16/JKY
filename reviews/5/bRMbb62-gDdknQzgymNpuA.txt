I have been visiting my mom for 6 years and she finally took me here.  The food was so good I made everyone go back the next day.  

Spicy, crunchy, melty was what I was craving in my pregnancy and this was the cure.  I had a combo plate with spicy red sauce.  It was amazing, I almost cried it was so good.  The enchilada and burrito were perfect.  The chili con carne was delicious.  I am counting the days until I am back in AZ and can go back.  

I have eaten at many mexican restaurants when I visit and this is my favorite.
