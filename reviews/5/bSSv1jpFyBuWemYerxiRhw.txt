I love their tacos, esp. the fish and potato. 
Their chips and salsa was HUGE for one person (bring a friend).
I tried fried oreos for the first time here. They were drizzled in chocolate sauce and fresh from the fryer!
The owner and employees are really nice guys and make the dining experience that much better :)
