This review is for the Sunday brunch.  Each dish was better than the next.  We ordered a dish or two and then we had the waitress surprise us with her favorites.  Since the mimosas are bottomless and the juice selection was endless, we also had to beg her to stop.  The more people the merrier at your table because you will want a fork full of every dish that comes by.  Thankfully the hotel was a long walk from our room because we had to walk off all the damage!
