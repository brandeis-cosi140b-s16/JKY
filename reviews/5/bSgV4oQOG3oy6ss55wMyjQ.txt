We used the catering service which we ordered food for 75 people. We were highly impressed from our initial meeting to the actual food. We felt the quality and quantity of the food was  exceptionally great, but mostly we are overly impressed with the customer service provided by the manager, George, and all the staff we had contact with. We will recommend Macayo's to all our friends.
