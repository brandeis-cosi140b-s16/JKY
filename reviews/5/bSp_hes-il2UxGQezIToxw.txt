THE BEST!
When it comes to cheap, greasy and fast Mexican food this is the place. 
It is located in Guadalupe and the sister restaurant of San Diego Bay (one of my favorites).
I ordered the bean and cheese burrito encalada style. The beans are out of this world! I'm sure the amount of lard is staggering but they are oh so flavorful and creamy.
They use real white cheese, not the greasy, plastic yellow kind. I could tell the tortillas were fresh.
We also ordered the Chile Rellenos. The stem was still on the chile and it was oozing with cheese. 
The Arizona burrito is enormous. It looked like a skyscraper was beaing eaten. This thing is massive.
The salsa was good and spicy and the chips were tasty too.

This is now my go-to place when I need some super fatty Mexican food!
