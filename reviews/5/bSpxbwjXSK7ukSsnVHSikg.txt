Arrived here for lunch off peak (2:00) and the place showed signs of being super busy, and was a wee bit dirty.  There was only us and another party and they did start catching up on the bussing while we were eating. First off, BEST Mexican I've had in a long time. Anywhere. The guac is something special and different.  See the photo. The pork shoulder and steak w/chimichurri sauce were amazing, even the simple rice side was great. I did like the steak taco better than the pork but the favors were very different.  The salsabar was a real treat!  So many things to try. Will be back next time in town.
