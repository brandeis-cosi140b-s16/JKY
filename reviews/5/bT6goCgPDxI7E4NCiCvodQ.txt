Great food! The food here is so much better than their Gilbert location. Not sure what happened over there, but as soon as this location opened the food in Gilbert when DOWNHILL. I prefer the service at the Gilbert location but I will only come here now as the food does not even compare.
Barrio Tacos, and El Jefe Chimis are amazing.  I also ordered the Ensalada Asada and it is HUGE!! For dessert the Fried Ice Cream is the winner! Their Margaritas are HUGE and very strong. 

The server told me they use a gold tequila in there normal margaritas. Just one margarita at $5.25 ad I was good to go. If you love Mexican food go to this location. OH YEAH And the Spinach dip is to die for!!
