Best Menudo! We moved here from El Paso, Tx and was looking for a place that sold Menudo. We tried a couple of restaurants around town but it wasn't like we were used to back home..we found it here at this place! Owners are wonderful and the menu is awesome!  Its our regular spot to get mexican food just like back home is El Paso!
