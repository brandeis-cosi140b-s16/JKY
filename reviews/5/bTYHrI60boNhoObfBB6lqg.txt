We just love this place! Great atmosphere, awesome happy hour, and the best tacos anywhere. We live in Ahwatukee which is about 45 miles away from this place. However every time we are in the north Phoenix area, I'm like let's go to Popos.

Highly recommend for Happy Hour in the bar which runs 3pm to 7pm and then reverse from 9pm to close.

Hungry? Take advantage of the Monday  "all you can eat tacos/tostadas" special.
