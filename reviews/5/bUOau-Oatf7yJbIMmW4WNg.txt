I've read a few reviews that show Don Pedro as subpar, did they eat at the same place as I did? Myself and the better half have eaten here several times, and each time we leave with our palates thanking us for the visit. Miguel will make tableside, incredible guacamole to your taste. As you will see in numerous reviews, ask for the "Picture Menu" you won't be disappointed. From the Taco Salads, to the Chimichangas, to the fresh made Guacamole.....visit Don Pedro with an empty stomach!
