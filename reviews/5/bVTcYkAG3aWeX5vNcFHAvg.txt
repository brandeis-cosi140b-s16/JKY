I have lived both in Scottsdale and in Southern California, but I maintain that this is one of the most delicious, homemade Mexican food places that I have ever been to and may ever go to in the rest of my adult life.  The burritos are unbelievably authentic, as is the rest of the food, and while you won't find incredibly high-quality ingredients every single time, it will always be delicious and satisfying.  The tortillas are incredibly fresh and it's clear that they're homemade, and their refried beans taste like I'm back across the border.  If you're looking for some awesome, relatively cheap Mexican food, then look no further than Se√±or Taco.  Always a favorite, and great to come back to when you want some southwest comfort food.
