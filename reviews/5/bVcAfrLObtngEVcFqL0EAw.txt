I was born in New Mexico and grew up in az and socal. I know mexican food!!! La Parilla Suiza has a unique flavor that no one else has. I love the Hatch Chile flavor of New Mexican-Mexican food the best. But Mexico City flavor that La Parilla Suiza has is every bit as good. I can't recommend it more!
