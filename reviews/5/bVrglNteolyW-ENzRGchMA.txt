Rubio's is an establishment I have been coming to for over 10 years now.  They are like family comfort food.  I have taken many family members and friends to this place, and they have become regulars themselves.  The food is always good, the salsa bar is fantastic, and the staff are helpful and friendly.  I tried the ancho grilled shrimp burrito - which was incredible.  The citrus mixture over the shrimp really enhanced the other ingredients in the flour tortilla.  My son got their  bean and cheese burrito with applesauce, churro, and organic drink.  They do allow you to swab out the flour tortilla for whole wheat.  Food was great, just as expected, and the price was just right.  Will always return.
