I wish this place was around when I lived in the university district. It's cheaper than Taco Bell. The soft corn tortillas literally overflow with the fillings.

I had the chicken, served with a tomatillo serrano salsa verde and mole sauce, and the carne asada, topped simply with onion and cilantro.

Both were delicious. Some of the best tacos I've eaten in Vegas so far.

I'll be sure to update this review once I have the chance to explore its menu further, but I don't often find myself in that part of town and wanted to be sure to make my approval of Yayo Taco known.
