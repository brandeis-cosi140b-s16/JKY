La Mexicana is an upgraded version of the street vendors.  Good healthy food, prepared home style, this is the real deal.  

There is nothing pretentious about La Mexicana, including owner Roberto who sports a soul patch and perfect English.  The walls are decorated with memorabilia and the tables are large, solid and sturdy.  

What makes La Mexicana worth the trip is the food.  It's made fresh daily in the small kitchen.  There are 3 kinds of chili (what we gringos call salsa) 2 red and 1 verde each with a distinct flavor.  

The carne asada is is grilled, thinly cut and goes well in the ample burritos filled with rice, beans and fresh cilantro.  

The chili verde, chucks of pork in a nice tasty brown sauce are equally at home as a stand alone dish over rice with beans and salad on the side or stuffed into a burrito, enchilada or taco.  

La Mex is about as authentic as it gets.  A working persons cafe, it is always filled with locals on a break from work, holding meetings or watching the huge TV that dominates the corner playing "futbol' or Telenovelas or the latest musical offerings live from Mexico City. 

La Mexican is a Vegas local's hidden treasure.
