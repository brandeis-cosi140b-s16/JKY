Chiles en Nogada. Life changing. Waiter asked how it was, my response, "Best thing I have eaten in my life." Really! I have lived in Phoenix now for almost two years and the only time I wear any authentic Mexican food is when I travel home to SD. Now I have found a little slice of heaven here in downtown Phoenix. Love the graffiti artwork around the building, fun photo opps! My husband had the tres tacos, pescado, and they were also amazing. I wanted to try the Agua de Horchata but they were out sadly. Next time!!!  FIVE STARS
