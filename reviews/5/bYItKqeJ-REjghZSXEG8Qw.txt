I have been here a couple of times and, contrary to the Henderson location, the service is really good. Fresh, fast, delicious. One difference between Qdoba and Chipotle that I personally have become more attuned to is that Chipotle has pretty responsibly sourced meats while Qdoba does not. (At least, Qdoba does not advertise as such. Chipotle throws it in your face which makes people like me want to support it more.) 

I like this shopping center a lot. Getting to it is kind of a hassle? But parking is plentiful. Qdoba is a yummy little stop here.
