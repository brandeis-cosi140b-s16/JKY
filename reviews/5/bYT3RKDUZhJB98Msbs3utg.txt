During a recent trip to Madison, my wife and I found Taqueria through our "friends" on Yelp.  This place is literally located in a random strip center off the frontage road, behind a McDonald's.  It is a bit sketchy feeling - in fact, my wife and I debated going here or doing the safe thing and hitting the Chipotle down the block.  SO GLAD we went here.

It is a medium sized Mexican joint with authentic food and great service.  The waiters were great, kind, and quick to help with any needs.  When we sat down, they brought chips and two kinds of salsas - I LOVE spicy foods and rarely do they affect me, but the hotter salsa had a nice kick and great flavor.  

The food we ordered definitely shined. I ordered Tripe tacos (get over the fear - tripe is awesome).  These were outstanding!!!  I also ordered the Al Pastor Sope - these were bigger than expected and also excellent.  While I didn't order a burrito, I saw one being delivered - it looked like it weighted 5 pounds...

If and when we go back, I will certainly stop by here again!
