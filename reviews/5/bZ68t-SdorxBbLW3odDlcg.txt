I've been a regular customer at Nando's since we moved to the neighborhood 5 years ago, and have never had a bad meal.  Service is always great--to be fair, one waitress there comes off a little gruff at times.  But they have great Happy Hour specials, delicious house margaritas, generous portions, and tasty food.  What's not to love?
