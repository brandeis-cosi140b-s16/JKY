The Best Sushi in Scottsdale.  For all of you Sushi Brokers lovers, I had my doubts going in, but this place leaves no doubt of the best sushi in Scottsdale.  The Mexican/Asian Fusion approach really works with the different sweet fruit flavors, cilantro/sriracha and marinated meats (El Pastor) they blend together...  The service, atmosphere and drinks ($15 bottomless Mamosas/Bloodies) are top notch here.  Might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale now.

If you have a baby, be prepared to deal with no changing rooms in the bathrooms though.

Make sure to call in your reservation.
