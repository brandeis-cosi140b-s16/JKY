My best friend and I recently went here a couple of weeks ago. It was the absolute most amazing tacos I've ever had. I might be over selling a tad bit, BUT this definitely a place you want to try out, their tacos are seriously great tasting. I'd love to come back soon and try out the burrito next, my friend said their burrito was amazing. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. Please check out this place, it's amazing!
