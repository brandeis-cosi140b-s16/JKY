As others have said, it's a chain however not all chains are alike. This particular Rubios is really clean, has great service and the clientele is classy. It's not loud and full of teenagers or gang bangers. The tables are clean. There are a lot of families that come here. The person taking your order will often bring the food to you. You can tell this particular location is a favorite among the locals, particularly those with kids. I've been here on multiple occasions and I've been pleased every time. Sure, it's not as Yelp trendy to write about a chain but for those who have matured past trying to appear cool on Yelp and just want nice food with nice service, come here.
