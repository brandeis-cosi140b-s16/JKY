Such taco.
VERY delish.
Much quick.
So cheap.
I am wow.

The food was great tasting, and as a party of 5 we ordered and sampled everything from the chili relleno burrito to a 12 taquito and guac plate. The salsa is bar is clean and features excellent salsa and fresh cucumbers. This cheesey goodness cradled our hangovers perfectly and my only regret is not being there on sat/sun to try their menudo.
