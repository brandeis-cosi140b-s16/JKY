Tonight was our 2nd time at Castillon's.  It is really a great Mexican restaurant.  It was a little busy but the owner, Johnny, does a great job getting the food out quickly and hot. The food is so flavorful. Not buried in cheese or heavy sauces. The white rice is fantastic with herbs in it. I usually order refried beans but here I've had the frijoles barrachos and love them. My husband says it tastes like the food his mother used to make. Give this restaurant a try.  It's clean and bright. You won't be sorry. The also have breakfast burritos in the morning. Try the Pork plate $7.99. Six adults and 2 kids ate tonight for $52.
