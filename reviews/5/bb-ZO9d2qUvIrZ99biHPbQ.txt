I work in a neighboring tenant of Chipotle so I'm a frequent customer. I really do love this location. The turnover can be high but it seems like they always attract friendly faces. 

Here's a quick but great customer service story (long story short): My card was compromised by Target and bank didn't tell me I had a new card coming. My card randomly stopped working as the cashier rung my order up. She didn't make a big deal of it... but I only  had $6 out of the $7 that  needed to pay for my meal in cash. Without blinking she reached into the tip jar and pulled out a $1 bill to cover the rest of my meal. I went back a few days later and overly compensated with a big tip to thank them for not totally embarrassing me and handling it in a way to allow me to show my face in there again. 

I eat a mainly vegan diet so I usually get a burrito bowl with rice, beans, veggies, salsa (two kinds) and guac... which is to die for. I will also pop in just for chips and guac and they always are okay with me skipping the entree line to get my chips which I really appreciate. 

Honestly this sounds silly but this is the only Chipotle I've been to where they don't huff and puff about me getting a kids meal. Maybe I've just had employees on an off day at other locations but at this location I've never had anyone deny me the pleasure that is a Taco Kit with the little bag of chips.
