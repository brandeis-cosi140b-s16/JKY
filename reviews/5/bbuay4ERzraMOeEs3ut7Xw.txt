You have to look a little hard to find this gem.  The New Mexican Grill is a small hole in the wall restaurant (in a new building) at the end of a Medical park type area.  
I lived in Albuquerque for nearly 10 years.  There is one thing you figure out real quick and that is the difference between good and bad New Mexican food.  This place is fantastic.  So far I am working my way down the menu and haven't found a bad item yet.  They will even throw an egg or two on your enchiladas and you can have it "Christmas" style (red&green chile)  There is only one drawback.  Dont be in a hurry, this isn't Taco Bell.
