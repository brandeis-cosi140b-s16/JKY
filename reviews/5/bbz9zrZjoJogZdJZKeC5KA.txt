My coworker and I started a Taco Tuesday at our work several months ago, in which we started going to a different place for tacos every Tuesday. After find La Canasta, we have stopped going to any other restaurant and have been regulars here since. We've even gotten our group to expand recently and now at least five or six of us go every Tuesday. I highly suggest the taco combo for any taco lover.
