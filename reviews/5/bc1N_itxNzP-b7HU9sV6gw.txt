I'm a little surprised at the collective score thus far. I think Panchero's is great and I'm elated with their choice of location as they won't be inundated with drunk college kids on random nights (think Chipotle and Qdoba - yikes).

I don't believe that the complaints of slow wait times are fair assessments. It's a new restaurant that a lot of people want to try it so it's naturally going to be busier. Also, if patrons aren't familiar with the menu it's going to take them longer to make their decisions. Besides, it's all worth it for the freshly made tortillas - so much better then the aforementioned burrito joints. Plus, they have punch cards!
