My favorate mexican food restaurant opens its 3 location in Glendale and this one is a hit and with in walking distance from our home. Now we don't have to stop at just two of their award winning Margaritas, simply the best and don't be fooled these margaritas have a kick . I have been eating at the 67th Ave & Bell rd location at least once a week since they opened. I spoke to the owner yesterday and this location is breaking sales records and they have only been open a week. I recently became a vegetarian and I though I was going to have to stop eating Caramba's, but as I looked at the menu I notice that they a vegetarian burro and several other options on the menu. Thank god, I don't know if I could make it with out my weekly fix. If you like menudo that have the best. One of the best things about eating at Caramba's is the friendly people that work there preparing the best and healthiest mexican food in the valley (NO LARD or M.S.G.). When I say fresh, they mean fresh NEVER FROZEN. The salsa bar is stocked with a variety of made fresh daily salsas. I have lived in the valley all my life and I can honestly tell you that you to will love Caramba Fresh Mexican Food.
