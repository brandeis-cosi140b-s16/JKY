This little food truck is an amazing place. So glad my Aunt told me about this place on a recent visit home. So reasonable and the food was fantastic. I highly recommend the Shrimp quesadilla. It was the best I've ever had. We tried a little of everything and for 40.00 dollar we had more food than four people could eat. FYI make sure when they ask if you want everything on it you ask what that is. They were going to put lettuce on it but that wasn't like what I was used to so I kept it off.
