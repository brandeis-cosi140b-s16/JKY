Came in HUNGRY!  It's our first visit here and they killed it! This place is great! I had the pork quesadilla, my hubby had the pulled chicken enchiladas!  Both were fantastic! We have had friends tell us it was good food and man were they right!  Flavorful without all the grease, made to order right in front of you with obviously fresh ingredients.  Go try it ASAP!
