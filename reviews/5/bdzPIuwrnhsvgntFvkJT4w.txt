I love Chipotle's because of this location. I happen to love having a great big, huge burrito filled with fresh ingredients and wonderfully spiced meat right after my workouts at the gym down the road. I had never been to a Chipotle's before I came to this one, and I'm impressed; by the service, the food, the price and the cleanliness. I'm almost a regular here.
