There is a couple Mexican food places in this area, however, this place is by far the best place out of all of them.  The taste and the portion defiantly gives you your money's worth.  The salsa bar is great, I wish they gave you some additional chips to go with the salsa.  The place is very reasonably priced, very clean, the ambiance is very neat for the size of the restaurant,  and the owner is a very nice gentleman.
