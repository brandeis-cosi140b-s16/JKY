I've always had a good experience here. Sometimes it can get busy so waiting gets kinda long but it's not so bad. 

I usually get the fire grilled salmon tostado with cilantro vinaigrette and love it every time. They aren't stingy with their portions which is a plus. They have a great variety of different drinks and even serve horchata. Staff is friendly and there's plenty of tables so it doesn't get crowded.
