Yes I did vote this with a five star! It is the best fast food Mexican joint on the West side of Phoenix. When I want fast food Mexican carne asada burritos I come here! It's not the closest Mexican shop to my house, but dang it, when I moved out to phoenix, you know I tried to hit every Mexican shop I could to try and find the best flavored carne asada meat. And this was the best I could find. 

I come here at least once or twice a month. I always get one of two people that are working the same drive through window. The price's are down right awesome for the quality of food you get. The red hot sauce reminds me of home, it's not firey hot but gives the food a wonderful taste. If your a So-Cal native and miss your Mexican food try here, it's not exactly the same but it will fill that void we all have. "Cheers Polibertos!!"
