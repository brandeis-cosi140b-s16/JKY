Come on no one has ranked Filberto's yet. THAT'S A DAM SHAME! I used to rock Filberto's BACK in the day on trips to see friends in Arizona. This PLACE WAS BOMB DUDE! You got some BOMB ASS BREAKFAST BURRITOS. Anytime in the day. You got a lot of burrito for your money too. Even living in LA and having been to Mexico a number of times Filbetos is TOP NOTCH Mexican food!
