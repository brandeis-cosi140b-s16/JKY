We had a large (28) group on 1/1 and the staff could not have been more accommodating. The food was delicious and everyone was happy. The community table in the bar is gorgeous, especially at night when it is lit.  All margaritas, entrees, and appetizers were enjoyed. And given the number in our party, I was most impressed by how promptly we were served. The waiter/waitress were unbelievable; they were patient, friendly and extremely helpful. I can't wait to go back and enjoy it with a smaller group!
