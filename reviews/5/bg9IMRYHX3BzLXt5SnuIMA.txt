Chronic tacos is my favorite place to have lunch at work. It helps that it's Mexican food which is my all time favorite food. My favorite thing to get it the handheld burrito. It's not as big as there normal burrito but it's perfect for lunch. When you order after 2pm you het free chip and salsa which are amazing as well. I really like their steak, seasoned pretty well. Not a huge fan of the chicken, but I like to change it up once in a while. 

Another thing I like is they have the limes on the line for tacos and burritos. Also the staff is really nice. They put on extra cheese or salsa for me if I ask. Plus they always chat me up when they can. Cool place to go.
