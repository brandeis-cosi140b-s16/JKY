Great experience!
I took my 3 boys here for dinner last night. We started with some fresh just made chips and guacamole. The guacamole was perfect!
My 2 younger boys opted for the carne asada burritos, my older son and I tried a mix of the different seafood & fish tacos. The fresh homemade corn tortillas rocked! Octopus and fish tacos were beautifully presented and the taste matched.

Service: Junior was outstanding! He was friendly and attentive. 

We will definitely be back!
