I went to this restaurant for the first time a couple of days ago. I must say the atmosphere is nice, the manager is great and the other staff is also wonderful. Oh yes, the food is very delicious!!! For dinner I had chicken & steak fajitas, along with fried ice cream for dessert. The portions were plentiful and the food was fresh & satisfying.  I will definitely be returning very soon!
