If your love seafood and are craving mexican food, this place is it! Don't let the outside or surrounding buildings intimidate you. The food is well worth the trip!

With free chips and salsa and also a delicious free bit of their ceviche while you order and wait, ya really can't go wrong! Its a bit small inside but perfectly sized for a nice peaceful meal without the room full of loud customes that normally comes with a great restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the mood is colorfully relaxing. I live in E. Mesa and its even worth the drive! :-)
