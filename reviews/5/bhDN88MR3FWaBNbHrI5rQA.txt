My husband and I had lunch here after tiring of the high-priced "haute cuisine" of the Strip -- it was excellent. We have very high standards for Mexican -- after spending time there and living in the Southwest. The Chile Verde was just right and the verde sauce fresh and excellent. Corn tortillas fresh off the press. Chicken/cheese enchiladas maybe a bit too cheesy, but delicious. Even the rice and beans were outstanding. Hubby started with ceviche pulpo and it was fresh and tasty. The atmosphere is indicative of the location and authenticity -- simple, but clean and the service very friendly. Next time we visit LV, we'll be stopping by.
