We hosted a happy hour event in the back room, and was fabulous. About 50 people came and they opened a small cash bar up just for our group. Dave the manager was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed from the time I booked the event until the time we left. Great service and everything about CL exceeded our expectations. We will be back for sure!
