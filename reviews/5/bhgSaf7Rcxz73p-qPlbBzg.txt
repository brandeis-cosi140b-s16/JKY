This is a full five star restaurant. The service is as good as it can be and the food is always on the level. This place really goes out of its way to put that little extra something on the plate. Whoever doesn't like Juan's just simply doesn't know good Mexican food. I have been eating here from the day it opened and I'm not going to stop anytime soon. Thanks to all the staff at Juan's ill be back soon as usual. Highly recommend the breakfast burritos and the chimichangas !!!!
