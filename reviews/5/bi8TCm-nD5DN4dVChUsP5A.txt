Was here last night & as always it was awesome. For my last meal on the states for awhile it certainly was the perfect choice. My wife loves it here & we dine here so often they know her order. Lol while the parking leaves a bit to be desired & lord knows it on the edge of the world it well worth venturing out of your comfort zone for easily the best Mexican Food Vegas has to offer.
