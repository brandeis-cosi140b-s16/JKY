Imagine this: two girls visiting Vegas, low on both money and luck...what could make this trip better? Is it 

A. A smile from Carmen after recommending the mango 'rita and give you extra hot sauce
B. A quickly made quesadilla with amazing pork fillings
C. A compliment on your clearly out of town accent
D. All of the above

If you answered anything but D, you clearly haven't fulfilled your Vegas experience. Be human for a moment in a city full of crazy, and visit Tacos & 'Ritas!
