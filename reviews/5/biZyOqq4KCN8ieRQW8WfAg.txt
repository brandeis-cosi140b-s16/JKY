That's a spicy meatball! Or in Gadzooks' case an enchilada. They do enchiladas and they do them very well. There are tons of different combinations of mixings and ingredients you can choose from to build your own enchilada. Tons of different meats, sauces, and veggies to choose from. You could really try a new flavor combination every time you go in. The atmosphere here and the patio make for a great time. They also have several bottled beers available for purchase that would compliment your meal very well. The staff members here were also very nice and helpful to my friends and I when we told them this was our first visit. The cashier even brought us over samples of the various meets so we could try each type. 

I really enjoyed this place and I am looking forward to trying more of their food in the future.
