LOVE this place. Consistently great food!! It is fresh and tasty food that actually makes your body feel like you've done it a favor. 

Barbacoa is my favorite. Chicken is my second fave. Veggie has a little kick to it. I don't eat pork but I've been told those are great too. I tend to get the 3 taco meal mixing it up or just a torta. So so delish!

The people are friendly and move fast to get your order in your hand. Such a treasure for Downtown Phoenix as it continues growing up into a real city!
