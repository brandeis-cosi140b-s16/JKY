We stopped in for a burger and we were blown away by the food, friendly staff, and atmosphere! Their menu is full of amazing choices, so I had a hard time choosing what to order. Both my boyfriend and I got a burger and some sweet potato tots which were amazing! We will definately be going back and I am so glad this is in our neighborhood.
