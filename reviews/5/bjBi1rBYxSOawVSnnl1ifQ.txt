We came here on a Saturday evening and order a dozen oyster ($17) and seafood jumbalaya  ($20) for $46

- In Sunset station. In proximity to the Feast buffet. Oyster Bar!
- We came for the oysters. People brag how good it is, especially at Palace Station, so we had to try it ourselves.
- We got seated asap. Didn't have to deal with the long wait at Palace Station. 
- Free bread and butter. Also these flavored salt chips! Terrific! 
- Oysters were excellent! Soft, chewy, smooth. Far from that fishy, oceanic taste. Apparently, the oysters that I have eaten in the past have not been good. I would taste sand or something crunchy with each bite, but not here. No need to slurp the oyster. Savor the flavor, chew and it marinate! Nom! Plus, the shells were surprisingly pretty. haha, a weird observation...
- The seafood jumbalaya was great! Nice blend of spices! Wish there were more clams rather than 4-5 that I have to savor till the end. Good recommendation 
- Service was fast! Ready for refills. Always asking if we were accommodated. 
- We sat next to a speaker, so music can be a bit loud for those that have sensitive ears. WHAT!? But, it's Saturday! Weekend party! XD
- Too fulfilling for a dinner of 2. But nonetheless, we finished it all! Coma...
- Can't wait to come back and try more of what they have to offer! Perfect local destination.
