This place is amazing. I was kind of concerned because my husband is Mexican and typically very critical of Mexican food but this place rocked our socks off! My husband got the tacos and I got the enchiladas - both we're amazing! Thankfully we did our research and checked yelp and google before we went so we knew what we were in for. 

I'd say this place is busy- know what you want as you walk in. Check out the gadzooks website and write out your order before you go. It will take 2 minutes but it will prevent the deer in headlights look as you struggle to create your meal

I had enchiladas -with half and half tortillas- 1 chicken 1 pork - Christmas style (half green half red) - with jack cheese- green sauce- crema and cotija. (Yep! 2 types of cheese! Boom) 

My husband had 2 tacos - half and half tortillas - 1 chicken 1 pork with chihuahua cheese (cheddar) the habanero salsa and slaw

This place is 30 minutes from our place but definitely worth it. We will be back for sure.
