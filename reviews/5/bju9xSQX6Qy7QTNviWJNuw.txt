Now this is a worthy destination and should be a must do next time you are in Vegas. So many tasty options... 
I had a Chorizo, Baja Fish, Chicken Tiki or something-or-other and a beef tongue.... All awesome!!!  The Margaritas were great too!  And it was taco Tuesday so 50Â¢ off each taco. So good

Do it!
