I don't know if this is the location I went to when I went to this restaurant but they have this amazing cold Mexican seafood soup. I haven't been here in years or had the soup in years but I look forward to my next visit. I have been craving this for a long time now. And I definitely recommend people to try this soup. I can't think of the name but when you go, you should ask for the cold soup with seafood in it. :)
