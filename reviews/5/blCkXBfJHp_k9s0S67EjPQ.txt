Los Dos rocks.  Even if you have to wait for two hours, it is still worth it.  Prepare to wait.  Hang out on the patio and drink some beers and soak up the great company you hopefully came with.  If you are getting attitude from the people that work there, it is probably because you are being rude, acting idiotic, or are just plain clueless.  

The food at Los Dos is like nothing else.  I generally prefer the specials (posted on the plastic surfboard), because I think they are super fresh, unique, and almost always amazing.  My favorite dishes from the menu are the garlic shrimp, the adovada ribs, and the Victoria's chili chicken plate-green.  However, the all-time greatest dish at Los Dos is the Angela's Special.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The Angela's Special is a chicken breast that is slowly cooked in a chili, topped with jalapeno-tomatillo sauce and cheese, and served over plain rice, with beans and tortillas on the side.  It is the most delicious thing ever...spicy yet flavorful, moist and flaky at the same time, and just wonderful.  If you are lucky enough to experience the Angela's Special, your life will improve...it is that good.

Do I even have to talk about how fantastic the salsas are, or how great the Herradura margarita can be?  No, try it for yourself.

I will say, however, that the snacks and margaritas are not as fresh on the patio as they are inside (which is why I suggest beer on the patio), so if you can wait until you get inside, you will be rewarded.

Now, I have heard that there have been some changes going on with who is running each Los Dos, and all I can say is that if Cheryl is around, everything will be that much better...
