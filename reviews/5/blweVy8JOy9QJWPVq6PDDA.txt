Three words, folks. Carne asada fries. Yep, Francisco's has the greatest food to ever come from the marriage of American and SoCal Mexican food. Imagine french fries, covered with marinated grilled steak, oozy cheese, diced tomatoes, sour cream, and guacamole. Like nachos, only with french fries! My guy convinced Francisco to make them and last time we were there he had added them to the menu. 

Next time you're wanting a little Mexican comfort food, or you need something to eat following a night of drinking, go here. Get the carne asada fries. You won't regret it!
