Wow, can't believe how many negative reviews are on here, especially after the awesome experience we had!  We have always loved Z's and this latest location is no exception!

They were packed for a Sat. early evening, and the servers were jumpin'. We were approached in the bar table immediately and our server was friendly, gracious, and prompt. Ordered a couple drinks, appetizers, all of which came out quickly and served hot.  I asked what certain apps. consisted of, and she explained in great detail how they were served.  She was spot on and the dishes were delicious.

Maybe they read the past reviews and stepped up the service and food, because we had the experience we always have at Z's; excellent and delicious...or maybe we just aren't as particular or have extreme expectations as some readers have...
