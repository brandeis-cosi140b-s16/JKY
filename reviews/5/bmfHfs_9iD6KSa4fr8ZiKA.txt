Stopped in yesterday to try out something new. Wow it was amazing. We made it in after lunch and was pleasantly greeted. The decor reminded me of the kinds of Mexican restaurants I ate at 15 years ago very traditional. We had four dishes cheese crisp, machaca chimmy, sour cream taco, and rellendo(my Spanish spelling is horrible). 
Everything was amazing and the tab was only $30 dollars. The server was super friendly and professional, I will be back many more times!!!
