Don't be deterred by the garish neon and the brightly painted walls. This is a great place to eat. Free serve your self chips and a full salsa bar. Plus free drink refills which is awesome if your looking for an inexpensive meal. My son ordered a massive beef burrito for $6 which we had to split because it was so big. I ended up taking my food home because it was just that much food. They make the tortillas fresh right in front of you with every order. The carne asada  was, dare I say, better then mine. This gets my vote for the best Mexican food in Phoenix.
