AMAZING FOOD! If you like it spicy hot this is the place for you. If you can drink liquid fire that is their salsa you will be very happy. Everything is homemade and great. Pour on their sauces and salsas and you have a party in your mouth and belly. Wash it down with an ice cold adult beverage and it is the perfect desert combination. I have been a fan of Los Dos for years and been to their locations. This looks to be a promising place for it to hold steady closer to the city masses.
