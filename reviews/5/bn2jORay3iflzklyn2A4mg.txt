So I read a lot of the recent reviews and I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews.

Look, this is not meant to be a completely "authentic" Mexican food restaurant. If you want that, go to Ranch Market. I am Mexican-American and for the most part, this is traditional Mexican food. 

The rice they serve there is white rice not the traditional red rice you find at most places. But, that is Mexican rice, but from a different part of Mexico. The beans also tasted great! Nice and salty, just how I like them.

The atmosphere is nice and it's at the Biltmore so it's got that going for it. The wait staff was very friendly. I brought my 2 month old little girl and they were very accommodating.

Also, I tried the Jalapeno Margarita everyone was raving about and it was yummy! And the chips and salsa was surprisingly good. Chips weren't too hard or salty and the salsa had a great seasoned flavored. 

All in all this was a great place. I would definitely go back!
