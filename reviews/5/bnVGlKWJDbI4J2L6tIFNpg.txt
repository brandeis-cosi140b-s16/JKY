Lunch chimichanga, try the chicken or shredded beef. The carnitas is the best I have ever had.  
Chips and salsa is the bomb.  Best Mexican in Arizona. Places needs a remodel but good people and great food.  Well worth it. Deserts are also very good. Best flan and fried ice cream ever.
At the end of the day, it's a must try.
