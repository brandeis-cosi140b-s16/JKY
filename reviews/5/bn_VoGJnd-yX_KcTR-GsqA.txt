For me, customer service is usually what sets restaurants apart. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the food is very important too. Rubio's receives 5 stars for both!

Not only is the food fresh and tasty, their customer service is exceptional. Everyone is friendly and polite. I can't recommend this place enough!
