This place is absolutely AMAZING.  Everything is homemade, super fresh, and incredibly delicious!! The sauces are made from scratch, and you just. Can't. Stop. Eating!! Portion sizes are super generous, service is great.  Been here 4 times and it's now our favorite restaurant in Casa Grande, and the best Mexican either of us have had anywhere (including Mexico).

You can tell the chef is passionate about quality, flavor, and cooking.
