I fricken love Chipotle.

The perfect PMS If-I-see-this-person-ever-again-I'm-going-to-explode-so-you-better-calm-me-down food.

One of the few fast food joints that serves MARGHERITAS. Woohoo!! (wow, would I be classified as a lush? I better change my title)

Their chips and salsa is very tasty.  Not too hot and not just tomatos.

I like the bowls... makes a good two meals for me.  Doesn't go bad in the few hours 'til dinner.  The black beans are awesome, although sometimes you get a spicy part that hits ya right in the throat... then you just drink your margherita and you're good. lol

Outdoor seating with misters in the summer, heaters in the winter.

The modern look inside is awesome. Makes me think of Ikea, but I know it's not from there.

At least I hope not.  That would ruin it for me.

The best thing... it's a chain fast food restaurant, without tasting like a chain.
