Excellent. The store looks like a small hole in the wall when you come in. The inside is very nice and clean. The bathrooms are clean. 

The menu is on the wall which is neat. It is also on a pamphlet.

After ordering I asked for chips and water. The owner brought out a BIG pitcher of ice cold water with ice in it. The salsa he brought out was delicious...and SPICY. The chips were fresh, home made and very crispy. I have not had chips this good in my life. 

The burrito came out shortly after the chips. The burrito was stuffed with meat. The burrito had beans in it also. There is also cheese in the burrito. It was very satisfying. It was even more delicious!! And it was super filling!

I am very happy I chose this establishment and want to come back soon!

Thanks for reading
