Great chips and salsa.  Their guacamole is awesome too.  Very reasonable prices, large portions, and friendly waitstaff.  It has the feel of a small Mexican joint in a little city, that is run by family.  The margaritas are perfect, nice and strong.  My favorite dish is the shrimp/chicken/steak fajitas. We try and come here on a regular basis.
