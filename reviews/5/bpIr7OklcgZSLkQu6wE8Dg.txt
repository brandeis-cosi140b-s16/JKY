I came here as a lone diner. I asked to sit at the bar, and the waiter obliged. The bartender was friendly and I got a Mango Margarita. At first, I wasn't a huge fan of the sugar around the glass rim, but with the Mango, it really worked instead of salt. Well made, tasty. The bartender was attentive and I got a Corona and shot of Malibu coconut rum to pour in once drinking the neck (highly recommend). He had no issue with my customer bartender shenanigan.

Warm tortilla chips and three different salsas kept me company while I made up my mind on what to order (plenty of selections here!) and waited for my food to arrive.

I got the Mexican Plate #3 for dinner. I opted for Sour Cream instead of Guacamole, as it was a ton of food and I wasn't going to need (read: probably couldn't handle) the increased depth that guac adds to a meal. This meal was huge. A relleno, a steak burrito, a chicken fajita, a beef taco, all with a side of refried beans and Mexican rice. 

The relleno was done well, with the cheese inside being a great consistency. Adding some of the beans and rice to a forkful, and this thing was fantastic. The steak burrito was sizeable, and filled with a decent amount of steak, rice, and other fixings. Sour cream worked really well with it. The chicken fajita was great, with the chicken being seasoned well and the onions and peppers adding a perfect mix of flavor. The beef taco was the only lackluster-y part of the meal, but how do you really compare a hard-shell taco to the rest of the above? The beef was seasoned well and the cheese on top was good. Beware if you go this route; This is a TON of food. and it's all delicious and you're not going to want to stop.

I'll definitely come back here whenever I want a good Mexican experience. I am very happy and full, hours later.
