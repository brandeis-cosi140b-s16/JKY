For that Mexican craving that no other  food type can satisfy, La Fonda reigns supreme. There is nothing upscale or arty about the plate they set in front of you, but it's solid, reliable and essential on occasion. My two favorites are the green corn tamale dinner and their cheese chile relleno. Cheese crisp or hot buttered flour tortilla also key players on sidelines. They've been around the Valley in a couple different locations since the '70's, geez just go.
