Where do I start? My love for Chipotle has been stronger than titanium is. Ever since I first took my bite into that juicy delicious burrito my life has been filled with happiness. I recently went to chipotle and ordered a burrito bowl with the heavenly chicken, black as night beans, brown rice that comes from the fields of dreams, along with amazing mild salsa, a touch of white cloud sour cream and the sweetest corn salsa, topped with the finely chopped green lettuce. I was in aw when I had this burrito bowl. Chipotle is not only cheap, but extremely filling. The portions could fill a hill giant. Thank you for always being there for me Chipotle. :)
