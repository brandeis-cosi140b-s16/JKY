Coming from a "food critic".....this is the best burger joint that we have found and we would recommend this place to ANYONE! We loved their Brulee Burger...starting with a slightly burnt sugar coated bread that melts in your mouth as you bite into it ... this mouth watering burger bursts with flavor as the fried egg breaks open and the bacon and cheese combine in flavor giving you the most perfect moment! You could never go wrong with this order. On top of the savory fries...they have a jalapeno ranch that is a perfect combination with the sweetness of seasoning. We also tried their fresco tacos that were out of this world and bursting with freshness of flavor!!! A++++ This family owned business is a must do if you enjoy good food.
