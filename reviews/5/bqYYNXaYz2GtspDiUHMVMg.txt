Whenever I go here all I can think is margarita, margarita, margarita lol I love  their special Sanchez sauce!  Their green chili is different then most, but I still enjoy it (which from my other reviews you can see I'm a hard critic).  Recently they started serving a hot and mild version of their salsa with chips when you arrive.  I love to mix the two!!! Service was great ... I can't tell you much about their rice, but I can say I will keep on going back!
