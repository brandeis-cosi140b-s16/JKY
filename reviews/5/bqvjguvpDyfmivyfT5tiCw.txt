Okay, so I know it's owned by McDonald's, and after watching Super Size Me, I will never eat at that place again. But wow, I don't care if it's going to clog the crap out of my arteries, I LOVE CHIPOTLE. Then after being in Florida for school for so long, my obsession with Chipotle became clear. Their chicken fajita burritos and their salsa are just soo good! It's also nice that you're able to get a Corona on the side if you want. MMmmm.

UPDATE!
Melissa M right below me just informed me that McDonalds no longer owns Chipotle. EAT UP!
