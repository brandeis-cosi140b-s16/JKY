My husband and I have visited several times and are never disappointed. I always love eating on their patio. The food is super tasty and fresh and the service is on point. They have the efficiency of of fast food joint and the attentiveness of a sit-down restaurant. Someone will usually come out on the patio to check if everything is good, and take away trays and trash. Most recently when we visited the tall guy I always see working there (owner?) stepped outside as we were leaving from the patio to say goodbye and wish us a goodnight with a smile and a wave.  It was such a simple, yet friendly gesture that made us feel like we are always welcome back.  I will make it a point to support this local business when I am craving burgers and shakes because they have quality food and I love their dedication to making their customers feel valued. If you have had a disappointing experience with their food I highly recommend giving them another chance.
