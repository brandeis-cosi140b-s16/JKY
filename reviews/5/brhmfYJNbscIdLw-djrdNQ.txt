Rio Ricos is a family owned restaurant  that has been owned and operated for some time. I myself do not like Mexican food but from all the different Mexican food restaurants my family has dragged me to, this is the one I can admit is delicious. The service is great. The food is both authentic and healthy. If you want to just sit at their quaint cozy sports bar,l and just grab a beer and chips, they are more than welcoming.
