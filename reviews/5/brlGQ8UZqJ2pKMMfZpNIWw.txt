Stupid name, blindingly bright menu, DELICIOUS. FOOD.  My parents have been raving about this place, so they took me for dinner one day when I was visiting for the holidays.

I got the veggie burrito, and the behemoth that came out of the kitchen barely fit on the flimsy paper plate.  It was delicious (the guacamole was excellent), filling, cheap, and it came with a side of chips!  My mom got the chicken quesadilla, and I swear to god, it was the largest single serving size of anything that I've ever seen.  She got 2 more meals out of it.  My dad got the shrimp tacos, and they disappeared quickly.

I was really impressed with the salsa bar.  Everything tasted homemade, with options that covered the spectrum of mild to spicy.  The guy at the counter was friendly, but he didn't even need to be because the food was just that good.

It made me sad that I live so far away.  Chipotle just doesn't cut it.
