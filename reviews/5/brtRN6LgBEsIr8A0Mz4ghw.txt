Being from LA  first impression of this place was not so good looks bad from the outside  but let me say the food the service and the cleanliness deserved a 5 star ordered some ceviche , mojara diabla, and some oysters food  was great  service was excellent being in Vegas I don't even know how I found this place bottom line money well spent
