I really like that a restaurant like this is finally in the Ahwatukee area.  I ordered the carne asada torta and the #15 chimichanga meal.  Both were a great choice.  The side of rice and beans were mediocre for Mexican food.  But overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for good flavor and is easy on your budget.  The kitchen and dining areas also looked very clean.
