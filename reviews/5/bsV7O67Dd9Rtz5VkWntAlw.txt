Decided to give this place a try after hearing good things about it.  First of all I was not disappointed. The food was amazing but what really made this place stand out was the cashier. He was a young male in his 20s that was rather toned. It was excruciating obvious that he engaged in some sort of crossfit. His upper body was so toned it was hard to believe that he was natty. In addition, his pants appeared to be ripped most likely from his massive hamstrings. Nonetheless, the guy clearly hit core and cardio everyday. As a matter of fact he was doing crunches as he took my order. Back to the main reason I am writing this review. The food was delicious. You won't find any tacos this delicious or a cashier as toned as tony west of the Mississippi.
