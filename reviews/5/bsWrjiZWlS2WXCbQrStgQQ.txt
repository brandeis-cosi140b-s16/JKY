Well well well Nelson, so you've done it again. You have found one of the most amazing hole in the wall joints in Las Vegas!! Big kudos to you. This is now my favorite place to get tacos anywhere in town, especially my favorite, the al pastor taco.

Unfortunately, I was not able to attend the UYE treks that Nelson put together due to work obligations. But after having these tacos, I probably should have used up all my sick days hehe. The only thing I regretted was taking such a long period of time to try these delectable morsels of flava'.

For parking, try to find a spot at the gas station or on the nearby streets. It can get kinda sketchy late at night so keep a lookout!

So I ordered three al pastor tacos with pineapple. First off, you know they are going to do things right when they use fresh pineapple. When the tacos came out, they were a great sized portion. Heading over to the sides station, I decided to try a different sauce on each taco. Added on cilantro and limes, and I was good to go.

That first bite... Forget about it. Forget about every al pastor taco you've had in your life. Because these guys? Yea, they know what's up. The smoky richness of the pork layered by the perfect blend of seasonings and spices. Trust me, you need to go here. The sauces? Amazing! Try some and find out which one you like!

In Nelson we trust! Great find!!
