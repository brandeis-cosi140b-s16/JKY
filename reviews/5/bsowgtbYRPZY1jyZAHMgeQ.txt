My favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison when I come up to visit. I love their tostadas carne asadas, so yum! The price is perfect, my tostadas are $3 each. Not to mention, this is the only food that actually soaks up [insert] liquids and is so good that it doesn't come back the way in came in! :P 

I can't really tell any differences between their horchata or anywhere else's, but I always buy from them because I love horchata all-around. Service usually is decent with one or two of them seeming impatient or they just stare, but other than that it's fine. I love their green salsa, spicy and a good complement to the tostadas~!

I can't wait to come back here :D.
