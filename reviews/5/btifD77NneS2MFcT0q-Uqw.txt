Authentic mexican food in Wisco doesn't often go this deep. Cooking with organic ingredients when available, sourced from this family's own hard work, this is a unique opportunity to try some of the great foods loved by many. I appreciate the rare glimpse into southern Mexico (think Puebla and Oaxaca). Their Mole, tamales, salsas, etc are a must try. If you haven't enjoyed this food at the northside and hilldale farmers markets (though they still run a tamales and burritos/tacos stand at these markets), dive into this great food seven days a week on Willy Street.
