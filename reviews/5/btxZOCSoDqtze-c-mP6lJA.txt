The food here is delicious! I am mostly impressed with the competent, helpful and friendly staff.  I go there often and see the manager always working hard and nice to her employees and customers.  All of the food I have gotten here has been good.  The helpful friendly staff will guide you in making food choices which is nice with so many options.  The Togo menu has the nutrition which is up front and helpful.
Love the salsa bar! Love the iced tea! 
Love this place! 
Thank you for being a reliable, consistent place to get a bite to eat, or enjoy a beer on the patio.
