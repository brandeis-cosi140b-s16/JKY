My favorite local Mexican place! I can't stay away! I absolutely love their cheese enchiladas. Their 99 cent Monday through Thursday deals are nice add-ons. I also like their bean and cheese burritos, although it wouldn't kill them to add a bit more cheese. Sometimes the service is less than stellar (slow speed, credit card machine issues, unfriendly male employee), but nothing awful enough to keep me away for long.
