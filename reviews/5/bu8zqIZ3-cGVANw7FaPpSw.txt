I love getting the mango chicken salad with a side of chips and guacamole when I'm short on cash. When you buy something keep your receipt. There is usually a coupon on the receipt that expires in 30 days. When I use it my meal only comes out to like $7.00. I also think their guacamole is the best out of all the fast food restaurant's also give you a good amount of chips and guacamole.  It's good for about 2 people with big appetites. The salad is also very filling!
