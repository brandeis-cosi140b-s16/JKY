Easily the best, most authentic Mexican street food in the city. Since moving home from the West Coast in 2009, I've been praying for a place like this to sprout up somewhere in the city. Finally!!! Authentic street tacos and only a few blocks from my house. 

If you're used to "enjoying" Americanized Mexican food like Chipotle or El Patron then you'll be in for a surprise here. El Burro is every bit a taco stand!!!

You can't miss: the Chorizo Street Style Tacos, the TJ Dog, the Carnitas Gringo Style Tacos and the housemade chips, mild salsa and guacamole.

They don't currently offer horchata but I was assured its coming in the future. Delighted!!! I can't say enough for this spot. Delicious!
