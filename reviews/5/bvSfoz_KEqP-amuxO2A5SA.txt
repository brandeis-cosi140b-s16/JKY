I have been a customer of this location for over 10 years. I can honestly say I've never had a complaint that's yelp worthy of writing about.  

The food has always come out piping hot and fresh. My order is always correct. The place is always busy and imo they handle it well. The staff hustles. My service is always just fine or better, sometimes fantastic! Another thing I love is there is always a friendly hostess to greet you.

My  favorite menu items are:
Green corn tamales with baja sauce! (worth every calorie, but don't eat this daily!)
Fajita quesadilla
Baja chicken quesadilla
Mixed mini chimis, no sour cream and guac, with baja sauce
Red corn chicken taquitos
Chicken poblano (stuffed poblano pepper of chicken goodness! like chile rellenos but with meat!)
Baja pizza (but Ajo Al's is even better)
Steak Cortez
Grilled chicken caesar salad (the chicken is so good!)
Tortilla soup
Cheeseburger (at least if you have picky kids!)
Baja burro (if you haven't noticed by now, you can not go wrong with baja sauce. this is not a place for diets!)
Grilled chicken tacos (which I think used to be called the beach tacos)
Baja Chimi
Sopapillas

I like the rice and beans but never have room for them! 

Also, the margaritas are awesome! I don't know if they always have it, but especially prickly pear!! Or original on the rocks,  strawberry blended.

I haven't experienced any of the negative things people wrote in other reviews.
