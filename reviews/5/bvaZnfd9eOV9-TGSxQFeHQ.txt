Only eaten here once or twice and it was so-so.

I really come here for the dancing and drinking!  I've never had a bad time here.  There's definitely something for everyone here.  You can sit in a booth or at the bar inside OR you can go outside.  They have it like a beachy bar.  There's a bar, cabanas and tables/chairs in the sand!  They also have a little water pool area thing that you can walk in and get your feet wet.  There are always interesting and fun people here and it's a great place to meet someone new.  I like to take my out of town friends here.  It's so different!
