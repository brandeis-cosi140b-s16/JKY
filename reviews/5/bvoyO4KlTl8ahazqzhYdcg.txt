One word: YUM!  The burgers are juicy and delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and was packed when we came in.  The black board behind the register has all the items on the menu written on it, but unless you had been there before, it really doesn't tell you anything.  There are a ton of burgers, sandwiches and even tacos to choose from.  My hubby got a burger with roasted chili and pico de gallo on it, and I got the classic cheeseburger with Havarti.  We both loved the flavor and I thought the portion was perfect, but my hungry hubby could have eaten a little bit more.  I loved the use of cucumbers on the burger; it was something I'd never had before.  We also loved the jalapeno ranch dressing that we used to dip our fries into.  Soooo good!
