Growing up in a Hispanic family I have consumed very many tamales in my lifetime. I have had big ones, small ones, dry ones.. You get the idea. I've never had the perfect tamale until.. Now. The search is over, folks. Let me just tell you that these tamales are like manna from Heaven. So many options to choose from-whether you are vegetarian, vegan or gluten free there is something for everyone. My personal favorite is the black bean cilantro.

I salute you Tamale Store.
