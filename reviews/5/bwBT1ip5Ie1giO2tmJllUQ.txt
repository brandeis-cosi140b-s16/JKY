The best mexican food I have tried in Arizona, finally authentic Mexican food from Mexico not tex mex. Even though they do serve the most common foods found in other Mexican restaurants they also have real traditional dishes like milanesas, tortas like in Mexico, tortas ahogadas, birria, pozole Jalisco style, tacos al pastor in little torillas, authentic tostadas, enchiladas tapatias and the best empanadas/quesadillas around.
I will go back to try their breakfast and perhaps find authentic huevos rancheros........to be continued
