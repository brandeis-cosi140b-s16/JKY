The last time I was here I do not remember much lol. I think I fell asleep but I remember the last time it was a lot smaller. I came this time and business must be booming because its completely remodeled now! Its pretty nice now. and will accommodate more people. Went here on a Sunday night with my girlfriend so it wasn't very packed at all. Their ordering system is a little confusing but the food made up for it. I usually hate Tacos with guacamole but these absolutely changed my mind about that. I had the carne asada tacos and they are delicious!
