Overall, it's a pretty nice place. The food is nice. The atmosphere is nice and makes me smile. The staff are very nice... BUT, what really puts them over the top and makes me give them 5 stars is their lunch special. You get food for like two big meals for the price of half a meal during that time. Also, they're very generous with hot and mild salsa and bean dip with your chips while you wait for your food. You can even time it up to where you are there for the lunch special AND happy hour (coinciding between 3 and 4 I believe). I've gotten lunch, a margharita, and left generous tips for almost less than $10 all total and was more than satisfied. Always a good experience when I go there for the lunch special.
