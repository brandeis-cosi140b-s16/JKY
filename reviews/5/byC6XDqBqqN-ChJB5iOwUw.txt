Tried this place for the first time today and it was an all around great experience!  My fiance and I went during the weekday lunch rush and were seated without any waiting.

First of all, I LOVE the whole feel of the environment.  They did an incredible job of converting the old Korean church into a trendy hangout spot.  The presentation of the bar is really great, and the balance between keeping some of the original features of the building with new accents is spot-on.

Between the 2 of us, we ordered 5 tacos: an al pastor pork, a duck, a snapper, a lamb, and a veggie.  The al pastor was incredibly good!  Probably the best I've had in town.  All of the other ones were also really delicious.  I also love that they have their own sauces that are made in house!

All of their draft beer is local.  My fiance had the Cartel IPA and it was really good!  Food service was quick and all of the staff was super friendly.

We will definitely be coming back here over and over!  There wasn't a single aspect of this place that I didn't enjoy.  5 stars for a job well done!
