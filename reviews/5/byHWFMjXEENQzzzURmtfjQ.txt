Love. Love. LOVE the happy hour! Happy hour is only at the bar area. I'll be frank, happy hour is great because of this bartender whose name I'm still not quite sure of. The several times I've been, I've asked and he jokes around a lot so I'm not even sure. Alex, Al, Carlos, whatever, you're awesome.
Margaritas are strong, guacamole is delicious, wings are awesome and most of all...THOSE CHIPS! The fluffier non-corn tortilla ones and sweet potato ones are my favorite. Salsa is a smoky and dark, unique. Coconut mojito is amazing. 
Unfortunately, I'm moving soon and will miss this place like crazy. Canyon Cafe happy hour, you will always hold a special place in my heart.
