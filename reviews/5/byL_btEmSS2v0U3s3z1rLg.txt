Me & two colleagues were starving as we were driving from Phoenix to Tucson. One of them was not going to make it so we stopped off in the town of Casa Grande. 
We drove around about 15 minutes before we found a restaurant. One of my colleagues was in the mood for authentic Mexican so this place caught his eye. 

Its a takeout joint that has a window that separates you and the kitchen that has the old school benches in the front to heat on a hot ass Arizona day. they have sprinklers up above that cool you off which is nice as it was 100 degrees out. They gave us a sample plate of all their meats and they all were delicious. I decided to go with the shredded chicken burrito as I figured it would be the safe route to go. The burrito was juicy and delicious and hit the spot. They had a really nice fruit punch to go with it as well. 

The man and woman (I presume to be owners) were very nice and accommodating to us. They seemed very happy to be serving a couple of out of towners. Good people, good service and good food
