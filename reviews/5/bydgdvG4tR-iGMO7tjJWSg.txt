Delicious food. Above and beyond service. We can't say enough about this place.  Both regular and allergy menus are bomb. 
The vegan gluten free menu is delicious.  They are very conscientious about cross contamination of wheat and dairy which is great for freaks like me.
I had the veggie bowl.  What ever is in the mock sour cream, it's very realistic. Lots of veggies and delicious sauces.  
My little one had a tummy ache when she arrived and they made her some white rice.  Not on the menu.  They made it special for her.  When she was feeling better she pounded a quesadilla.  Loved it.  My husband had the chicken tacos.  Again, lots of fresh veggies and fresh chicken.  
The food was yummy and filling.  Large portions of healthy food kept us going strong all day.  
It will take a little longer than your average fast food Mex to get your food but you won't be disappointed.  
Carnivores and herbivores alike will love this place.  Enjoy!
