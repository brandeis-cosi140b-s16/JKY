I normally don't like Tacos, and have never tried a popusa, but let me tell you this place is AMAZING! Wow, there food is so good. They modernized a plain taco & popusa with flavor that just works! They also have a school bus called, The Chrome Toaster, which is available for parties. Love this place..
