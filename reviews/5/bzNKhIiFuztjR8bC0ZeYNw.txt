I'm roadtripping through AZ and found this place on Yelp....I'm probably going to swing through there on my way outta town to get a few more tacos for the road.
I got chorizo tacos and a chili verde tamale.  The BF got beef tongue tacos and a tamale as well.  It was all tasty.  Even the tongue was tender and mmm mmm juicy.
Like other reviews say...they have a lil salsa bar.  The habanero is friggen hot but oh so good.
The service is very friendly, the place is clean and FYI it's cash only.
P.S. there is a nice park right down the road so you can take a walk after you reach food-coma status (....one too many beef tounge tacos).
