These guys have the best tacos in town, if you are visiting,  you have to visit these guys, I'll not go to any other taqueria in town. The first time I eat these tacos I fell in love with them, I'm not going to lie, they aren't what I'm used to in MÃ©xico of course but you want authentic traditional street tacos? This is the place. Tacos el gordo don't even come close to these guys and that is my honest recommendation.
