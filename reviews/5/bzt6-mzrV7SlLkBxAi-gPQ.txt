I first heard of this place and someone raved about their burritos. I, of course, living in Arizona and having a burrito shop on every corner didn't think much of it. Then I tried it. Nothing I've ever had here has failed me. I especially enjoy anything with shrimp like their shrimp tacos, shrimp enchiladas, or the diablo shrimp burrito. Their burritos are large, everything is of stellar quality, fresh tasting, and delicious. Their salsa bar is amazing. I'm a huge fan of this place and even though I've moved across town, I still come back. Their service leaves a lot to be desired (as with many places is the case), but it's not enough to keep me away. I highly recommend! And it's right next door to a great Thai place, too!
