This place was SO fricken good! But I went during peak lunch hours on a weekday and it was crowded!  Three long lines that move somewhat quickly. I'm not Mexican and being my first time here, I had no clue what half of the menu items were. After talking with a few people who frequent thus place they suggested the Carne Asada fries and adobada taco (spicy pork). It was so good! Plus, there's a help yourself bar with limes and radishes. You can also request for grilled onions and peppers at no charge!
