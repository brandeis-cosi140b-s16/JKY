I love this place, it's been here for years and is a cozy, intimate, authentic family owned Mexican restaurant. I used to come here years ago and was disappointed when I thought they had closed down. I was so excited to be back in the old neighborhood and see I was wrong and they were still open. Something that really surprised me was that the prices are still really good. I think they have went up a dollar or so in the years since I visited last. And believe me those are a few years back, my kids were babies and my oldest is 14. So, one of the dishes I always loved was the Mojo de Ajo. And I have to say it was just as good as I remember. One of the things I love about this place is their signature Mexican seafood dishes which I think are some of the best in the valley. Another great dish is  the A La Plancha.  It was nice to see the matriarch of this family owned business doing so well, she's still just as nice as I remember her.
