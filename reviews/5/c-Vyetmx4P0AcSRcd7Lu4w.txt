I thought this place was a bus stop until a coworker told me it was a restaurant.  There's always people standing there and it's REALLY small.

The dining area is only outside and well shaded.

They are cash only.

I'd go into detail about the food, but I've only been in the southwest for 6 years so almost all of the good mexican places blow my mind with how good they are.

Their chorizo is the better kind.  The kind with substance, not just oil with red food coloring like at filibertos.
