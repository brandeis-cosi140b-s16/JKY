My buddy and I had a taste for good Mexican food tonight near our hotel. I used the Yelp app to find such a place and El Dorado Cantina had the best reviews. We decided to try it and we were not disappointed. We were promptly seated by the host and then greeted by Amber who proceeded to take our drink and appetizer order and excellent food service. Both arrived in a timely manner and we asked Amber for a few extra minutes to decide on an entree. One ordered our entrees arrived quickly and the food was delicious.  My buddy ordered the beef empanadas and a $2.00 Carne Asada street taco and I ordered the Steak Bowl. We really enjoyed our entrees. For desert I ordered the  Flan and it was delicious. Our compliments to the Chef Paco. 

We will be back in the morning for breakfast. 

I hope this review was helpful.
