Homemade tortilla chips and perfect fish tacos. Excellent sauces.  Menu is not extensive but that's just fine. All are well executed items that will definitely keep us coming back. Casual, laid back ambiance with friendly staff. 

Don't forget to check out the bakery at the front of the place - amazing pastries and cookies.
