Rubio's, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways...

1. I have never been to a Rubio's that did not serve me delicious, hot, fresh food.

2. The Famous Fish Tacos are absolutely amazing. I have had them all kinds of ways, grilled, blackened, different types of fish, even the fried ones are great.

3. Prices are decent for what you're getting and since it is a step-up from typical "fast food" it is to be expected.

4. Salsa bar!

5. Even the rice and beans always come out hot and tasty, some places can get their side dishes all wrong, but not Rubio's!
