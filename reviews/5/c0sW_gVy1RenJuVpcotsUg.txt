Wonderful Mole that is very authentic.  This is hard to achieve but it is done extememly well at El Patron.  Carne tacos were also top notch.  I really liked the rice.  The flavor was fresh with many layers of seasoning.   Margaritas were killer!  Prices and services the best we've encountered in years.  It was so nice to be greeted warmly and then served outstanding food.  Thank you Antonio and the staff at El Patron!
