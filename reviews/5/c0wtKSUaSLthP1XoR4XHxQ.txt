Great food! I ordered the Carlos carnitas, and there was so much food! It looked like I didn't eat anything when I was done because the portions are so large. Share a meal! My boyfriend ordered the polling fundido and he loved it too. Our waiter served us quickly, food came out super fast! The entire restaurant was quiet and not very busy.
