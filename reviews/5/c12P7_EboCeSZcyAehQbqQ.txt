Me and my boyfriend  come here all the time just to get   chilaquiles. So far this place makes the best chilaquiles!  Its very cheap only cost $5.50. This place has one of the best employees by the name of Alejandra also known as Alex. Everytime we come here she is always quick with our meals, she is very kind and communicates great with customers, when I go through the drive thru at restaurants  workers  are not as kind but Alejandra  is kind. Alejandra always has a professional positive attitude and leaves a good impression. I hope she eventually  gets acknowledged  for her great work effort  as a great  employee. We will continue  to come back she helps brings  business  with her professionalism and deserves  to have a raise in her pay for doing  such a excellent  job.
