I love Chipotle! I have always been a fan, and even more so since becoming a vegetarian. I love that their rice, tortillas, black beans, fajita veggies, salsa's and guacamole are all vegan! I love the corn salsa the best and usually ask for two scoops on my burrito. And large globs of guacamole. That stuff is super addicting. 

So everyone knows that Chipotle is great, but this review is based more so on this particular location. This is the location I like the best. The workers are super friendly. One of them I swear is even in love with my husband because she always gives him more guacamole than she gives me. But the staff is great. If they are ever almost out of guacamole or fajita veggies they ask us to wait for fresh stuff to come out instead of giving us the old brown stuff at the bottom of the bowl. I love them! There is a Chipotle closer to our house than this location, but we come out to this one every time just because of the staff. That, and the quality of the food seems to be better at this one. Ive been to Chipotles where the beans have been mushy and bland, but the food is always fresh and great at this location. 

Chipotle is great, but this location is the best by far in terms of staff friendliness and freshness of food.
