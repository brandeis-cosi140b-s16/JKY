This place is great! I've been looking for a restaurant with authentic Mexican food and this hit the spot!
Their menu includes items like sopes, tortas, tostadas, and horchata that you don't normally find in "Mexican" sit down restaurants in the area.
I will be returning here often for the excellent food and great prices!
