Great little hole in the wall place. Traditional California style Mexican food, with a good fresh salsa bar, horchata, flower tea, everything you'd expect. They got the refried beans right, and their lunch combo plates are a great deal! I will be returning, and I'm pretty picky about my Mexican food!
