Yayyyyyyy! I just moved from Tempe to Gilbert and was so sad I wasn't near Betito's anymore and then we randomly drove by and they were opening right down the street from us in Gilbert. Thank you thank you thank you! I reviewed this place in more detail for the Tempe location if you want to see what I wrote before. Staff is the same at this location, they are so nice and treat me like family. They have great food in quality, taste, and value. This location will wow you inside- it was surprising how fun the decor was inside and they do offer a drive thru. 

I like everything on the menu- breakfast burritos: bacon, chorizo, and steak are what I usually order.

Carne asada is always good, tacos, burritos, I haven't had anything I don't like. 

I'll be honest, the thing that makes me drool for this place is their dark red hot sauce. OMG it is seriously sooooo good! My husband loves the green which is delish too, a bit more spicy, but the red is just mmm mmm mmm so good!

Try it and enjoy! :-)
