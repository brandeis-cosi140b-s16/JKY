I'm not really a fan of Mexican restaurants being that I'm Mexican and I don't see the point in paying for stuff I grew up eating. This place was definitely an exception. The best thing about this place is the customer service. Everyone is so nice and so attentive. It was my sister's 21st birthday so they sang her a song with guitar and all and even gave her a shot and a churro desert! The food is delicious. As soon as you sit down you are offered chips with beans and salsa. Not only that but they also give you a nice little warm bowl of fideo soup. The food is very fresh and delicous. And the tortillas...OMGSH. They're homemade and soooooo good. I've never been to another restaurant that made hand made tortillas!! They really do treat you like family as soon as you walk in the door. The decor is also very authentic and you can tell the decorations were brought over from Mexico. You really don't find too many restaurants like these anymore.Can't wait to go back.
