Alright, finally got to see what the carpet looked like after the grand opening which was so packed we could not even see the floor.  Very nice place for a date night and a cool bar to watch the big game and even the patio looked sharp.  Very upscale is a little of what we need over here in the west side and I refuse to knock it for the crazy grand opening.  We left after 10 minutes and ran up to Arrowhead Grill for dinner that night, but you cant fault a place for being to popular.  They can't help that they are so good!  

Anyway, we double dated with friends in the area and we started with the shrimp appetizer on top of rice, I am not a big fan of shrimp but it was pretty good, we also all ordered 1 tortilla with butter (which had a sweet flavor to it so it made it special).  I ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas......can I say heavenly?  Hell yes I can, this stuff was great!  The perfect amount of cilantro, sour cream, a tiny bit of spice, and just a great dish.  It was in a 10" low rim bowl with a side of white rice.  My wife and her girlfriend both ordered the 7 layer salad which I guess was good because they both cleaned their bowls as well.  My friend ordered the Argentinian steak....which I presume came from Argentina.  My buddy let me steal a bite and I will be coming back for that since it was darn good,  it had a fajita flavoring to it served with mashed potatoes.  The menu overall isn't to large....it had a few salads, sandwiches, appetizers, only a few entries like the steak and enchiladas and a couple of fish as well.  Then the bottom had a few options for their street tacos and then some desserts.  I am so pleased with this place and cant wait to return.  Once again a home run for Chef Charles!  Oh I forgot to mention our server was great, he had a sense of humor and did a great job and never left us dry.
