been to this place 2 times and like it.  always friendly staff and fast service.  i had the taquitos the first time and really liked them.  the combo comes with rice and beans.  the second time i ordered the beef steak and liked it too.  think and juicy with rice, beans and tortillas.  reasonable prices.  will be back.
