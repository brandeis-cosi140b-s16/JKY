This Taco Bell was the best I have ever been to. Clean, fast, fresh and the staff was great.

We always order what can only be described as a cashier's worst nightmare, or at least that is how it seems at other Taco Bell's. But our simple request of no tomatoes on a few of our tacos was no problem and the woman working the counter was friendly and repeated our order to make sure it was right. 

The shells on the Doritos Locos were fresh and not stale and chewy like we have had at other TBs.

It was close, convenient and as long as no one has bubble guts tomorrow it was well worth the stop. 

Also kudos to the counter guy who gave out the orders, he was funny and polite.
