Yes..this is as good as it gets for Rolled tacos. Finally found a place that knows how to do it right. The tacos are crispy and only a touch greasy and they load the guac and cheese on top heavy. All of that for $4.50 and a side of normal rice for 99 cents. Great late night meal for $6 and they don't skimp on the red and green sauce either, despite the sign saying they will charge more for extra. The red is better at this place and 24 hours to boot.
