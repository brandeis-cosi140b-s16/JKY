Cafe Rio has been a favorite spot of mine for a long while now. It's a step above Chipotle in my book and they have daily specials (not sure about the weekends) that are all pretty good and not as expensive as other items on the menu. The only downfall with this place is that if you're not careful when you're ordering you can end up dropping around 13 dollars for lunch. So yeah, don't go overboard ordering sides and whatnot, the portions are all pretty damn big.
