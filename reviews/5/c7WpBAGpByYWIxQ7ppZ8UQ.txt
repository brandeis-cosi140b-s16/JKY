Carne Asada Super Nachos for $7.99 -- so good! Ingredients were fresh and lots of flavor. Huge portions of everything, especially meat. 

Cash only (no cards or checks). 

One person working (taking orders and making food). Went at 3:30pm and there was no wait. 

Seating -- some bar stools (6 maybe). I didn't see any tables though. 

Located inside the gas station.
