When we want to eat at a sit down Mexican restaurant Frank & Fina's is our new go to place! The prices are reasonable for what you get and it's cozy. 

We always like to start off our Mexican dining experiences with chips and guacamole. The serving of guacamole is much larger than what most places serve. It is chunky and you can tell it is home made. There is nothing worse for me than ordering guacamole and find out there is no chunks of veggies in it. It was also very yummy! There is always more then enough to take home too!

I have eaten at Frank & Finas  a couple of times so here are some of the items I have tried. 

I have had their whole chicken legs with Spanish rice. I usually don't like chicken because sometimes it smells weird too me but it was really good! The Spanish rice here is delicious! It isn't bland it tastes like it has a bit of a garlic flavor for to it which was a pleasant surprise! 

I have also tried their beef, potatoes with the Spanish rice. I was also happy with this dish. The beef was tender and I loved mixing the meat and potatoes with the rice. 

Now for the drinks and desserts:

I ordered the pomegranate margarita because I don't see this offered a lot. It was a perfect mix of sweet alcoholic bliss! It was also a nice pink color which I loved!

I had their churros with ice cream which was good. The churros were nice and warm and had caramel inside. I liked eating it with the ice cream. 

My favorite dessert was their tricolor sorbets. I believe the flavors were lime, strawberry and Pineapple . It was very refreshing especially on a hot day!
