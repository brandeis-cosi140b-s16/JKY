As soon as I saw a sugar skull on the sign, I knew I was destined for the place.  Just as you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you cannot judge a restaurant on it's signage.  Luckily for me, cool sign aside, I was loving everything I tried.  Even the presentation was impressive.  They serve the tacos on a large branded butcher block.  

Do not miss the Yelp check in bonus!  Our table got free guac and elote dip.  Both were double dippablly good.  I would order both again in a heart beat.  I'm not even a guac person and was all over this dip.

The braised beef cheek taco was super tender and juicy.  The chicken tinga taco with its passion fruit salsa, jicama relish, lime crema and hint of chorizo was addictive.  For their al pastor, they braise a pork shoulder, and it's full of flavor from the pineapple salsa.  I could eat these tacos- every day.  All day.

El Hefe (The Boss) Supermacho Taqueria also has some pretty good margs.  I stuck with the happy hour house marg but the salty chihuahua with jalapeno and hermanos pistola with cucumber pique my interest.

The place was pretty rowdy and this was just during a week night dinner.  I gather at night this becomes a club.  Who would have ever thought that a club would serve some of the best tacos I ever had.   They passed around crazy mustaches and we got some hilarious selfies.   While, it was not the best place to dine with a baby, we were with a group and made it work.  However, the food was so good, I would tempt fate again and bring her in the future, if it meat I got my hands on these boss tacos!
