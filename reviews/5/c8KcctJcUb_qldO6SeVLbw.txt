Wow !  Best Bloody Mary !  Started things off in a great way ..   After asking my server for his advice on a breakfast dish .. I was very happy with his choice ! Eggs cooked perfect & my bacon was excellent!!  I'm very picky about my morning meal & this place was jus up my alley !!  All be seeing Jacob & his killer Bloody Mary Soon !
