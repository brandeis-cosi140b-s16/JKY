My family is from New Mexico.  I grew up on posole, green chilies, carne adovada, sopapillas...  This is the best New Mexico style mexican food I have had in the Valley.  Totally chill environment.  A true hidden gem. I always have to drive by like 3 times because the sign is black and it is tucked behind some vegetation.  Cheap.  Big portions.  My favorite is the carne adovada with red sauce.  It's definitely campy with fake rock walls with stuffed animal bats hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, newspaper menus and a lagoon outside, but that is part of the charm for me.  You don't have to be a fancy person to feel at home here and go ahead, bring the kids.  It's family friendly.
