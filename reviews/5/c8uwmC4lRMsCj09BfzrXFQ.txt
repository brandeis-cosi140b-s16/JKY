This is my new favorite place to succumb to my cravings for delicious Mexican food. 

I highly recommend asking to sample some of the various meats they make from scratch before deciding; there are almost too many choices. 

I am always going to be a fan of a place that follows the build-your-own meal model, has extremely reasonable prices and portions, and keeps a clean establishment. 

PS - cliantro lovers, rejoice; they offer it on the cold line and will fill your dish like it's lettuce if that's what you're into!
