Greeted by a friendly wait staff, and whisked away to a patio seat.  The patio is great for people watching or just enjoying the sunshine.  Table side guacamole, can't get any better than that.  One can taste the freshness in all dishes from carne asada to the cochinita pibil pork.  The meat and vegetables complement each other very well.
