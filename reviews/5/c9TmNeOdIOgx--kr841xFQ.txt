My boyfriend and I ate at Distrito about a month and loved it. The hostess miley was such a sweetheart and gave us a great table! Our server was named Michael and he was fantastic he had lots of great recommendations. The Ceviche here is fantastic. We tried both options and they both were so good. I think the Carnitas tacos and the Fish tacos may be the best I've ever had.  Our favorite dish was the shrimp entree. I still think about it. I would definitely recommend this place to all my friends!
