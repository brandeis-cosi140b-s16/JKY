One of the best pastor tacos you will find in the Las Vegas area. Ask for saut√©ed onions and peppers if you like them and they have a great choice of salsas, pickled jalapenos, pickled red onions, mango, and cabbage in their salsa bar.

Some people have complained about the lack of seating, but food trucks are not permitted to have them for customers so bring your own if you want them.
