I checked out the Revival today for a work lunch meeting. It was really good!

I had been here when it was Mucho Gusto.  What I has heard was the menu has the menu has changed and it was renovated. Well we were pleasantly surprised to hear they have brought back most of the original MG menu with a few twists. 

The lunch specials were just enough portions. I has the half burro with chicken. I started with he tomato soup. Both were delicious and just enough kick. My coworker had the fish tacos and said they were very good as well. 

We had great service and I would come back.
