When we entered we got samples of all the different kinds of meat they have, all of them were really good! I got a chicken bowl and drink for under $10 and my bestfriend got a burrito and drink for about $10. We tried the free chocolate bark and it was really good! He also gave us a sample of the peppermint too, how nice. (: will definitely be coming back, good customer service too!
