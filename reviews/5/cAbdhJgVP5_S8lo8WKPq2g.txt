My only complaint is that the food was so good that I  couldn't stop eating...

Great food, super friendly server (Brittany), and awesome ambiance. I got a BBQ Chicken taco (spicy!), Braised Green Chili Chicken taco and a braised pineapple pork taco. All were amazing and the home made salsa was over the top! The GM stopped by who also could not be any more friendly. 

After stuffing my face full I couldn't say no to dessert... "camp fire sundae" changed my life... Ice cream, chocolate sauce, graham cracker and toasted marshmallow cream over top... they literally toast it with a torch!! Highly recommend. 

Hands down my new taco Tuesday (and everyday) Mexican food spot.
