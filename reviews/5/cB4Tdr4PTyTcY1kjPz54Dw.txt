Heard about this place from a friend. I got a mini chimi platter for a party ant they were amazing. Everyone loved them. The waitstaff was really nice and even got the platter done early since I was early. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items they make. :) recommend trying this hidden gem out!!!
