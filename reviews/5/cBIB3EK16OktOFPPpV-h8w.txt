Grill it and They Will Come

As long as chickens and mesquite trees continue sacrificing their lives for humankind, you might as well visit a place honoring both, plus your tastebuds. Pollo Correteado does one thing, mesquite grilling chicken, adding standard sides. They offer macaroni salad, mashed potatoes, and frijoles de olla - Mexican pork and beans. 

Pollo Correteado honors all three, giving your palate a Cinco de Mayo or Fourth of July (take your choice) explosion of delicious excellence. 

Chicken can easily be grilled into jerky. The day I ate here, the bird was tender and juicy.

The salsa is mild, onions marinated down to tasty side elements, jalapenos warm and good, sliced lemons full of puckery, sweet condiment de Mexico. The frijols de olla that smoky traditional Mexican excellence that's not easy to find. 

Tear the meat from the bones and build your tacos as you wish. Supplement with a Mexican Coca-Cola over ice and it is feast time.

I'm coming back. And I'll make sure some Saturday night our family tries Pollo Correteado.
