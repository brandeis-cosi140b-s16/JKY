This is my absolute favorite place to eat. If you go here you must get the table side guacamole it is the best you will ever have and is also fun to watch them make it right at your table. I love the chicken tacos, as well as the pork, but the butternut squash tacos also are amazing if you want something vegetarian. They have the best margaritas in town, great atmosphere, always awesome service. Make sure you make a reservation as they are always busy!
