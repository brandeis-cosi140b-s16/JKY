Very good portions!! The food spilleth over my plate and I was glad. The service was good. Hostess, Server and staff were attentive and friendly. The food was over-salted for my taste but was still tasty. 

For all ethnic food restaurants, I like to see how many ethnic people of that origin actually go there. For Indian restaurants, I look for Indian patrons, Italian, Japanese, etc. For a Mexican food restaurant, Serrano's had zero Mexicans dining when I went. It's only an observation I made.
