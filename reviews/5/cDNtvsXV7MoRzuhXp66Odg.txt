Based on Faith A's review I made the drive over to 67th Ave and Indian School and found this busy little taqueria in the corner of a strip mall.

The people working there were extremely nice and wanted to help.
I read through the menu and decided on a red-chile burrito and a taco.

But I asked about a yummy looking folded taco-thing and he said it was their "Quesadilla" and I should try one.  It was amazing, with carne asada..
Their quesadilla is different, the whole thing reminds me more if an Indian Fry Bread contraption with a thick crusty tortilla, lots of meat and the cheese was fresh crumbled Mexican Cheese with a light white cool sauce.  It was delicious.

I also had 2 mini tacos, one Pastor and one Carnitas.
I can't remember which is which but one was more shredded pork and i really liked that.

Bummer:  they don't have real ice-tea.  Oh well.
They do have a good salsa bar with a red and green salsa and a bunch of veggies (not quite as big at Taco Tote).

If you are on the hunt for Taquerias in Phoenix this is for you.
