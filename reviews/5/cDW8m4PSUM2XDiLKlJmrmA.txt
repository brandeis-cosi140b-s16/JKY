This place was great. It is inside the Venetian. We sat at a table in the bar area, which over looked the gondolas going by.  The drinks were strong and tasty. The chips were yummy and the guacamole was some of the best I have ever had in my life!  Our server Danielle was fun and terrific and made the whole experience memorable. We will definitely be back.
