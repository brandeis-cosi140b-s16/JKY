The service, and quality of food and drinks at this establishment is off the wall!!!!!!!
I love it. There's one particular cashier that's very personable and makes a point of making you feel welcome. 

You should stop by JUST for a spinach or cucumber drink. They're REALLY, REALLY good, and healthy too!!
