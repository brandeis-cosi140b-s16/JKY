I don't live in town and we really struggle to find good restaurants. We were on our way back to suburbia and the wife and I decided to head into Noda to see if we could get a decent meal. 

It was so nice to go to a relaxed place with good food. I live in a town where Beef Obrady's and McAlester's deli is cherished. I hate these places so if you are a fan of those restaurants, ignore my review. Every kids menu is filled with crap I wouldn't feed my dog much less my kids. 

Our kids ordered their grilled shrimp and fruit. They ate every bit of it. I had the signature bbq fish taco and thought it was wonderful. The chocolate cake is a yes.
