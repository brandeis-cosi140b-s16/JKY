I have been going to Ponchos for at least twenty years and I am always satisfied.  The food is heavy - the way Mexican food should be.  You cannot go wrong with the chimichangas, Mexican pizza, green chili or flautas.  

A few years ago during a trip to Phoenix, President Clinton came into Ponchos.  They commemorated the event with a mural on the wall where Clinton sat.  Also the chips and salsa are bottomless and fantastic!
