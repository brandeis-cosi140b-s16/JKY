OK, I admit it. I'm a big ol' bacon cheeseburger whore. I'll eat a bacon cheeseburger anytime, morning noon or night but my favorite time is breakfast.

I hereby dub the Del Taco Bacon Double Del the "Prince of Bacon Cheeseburgers". Why, you ask? 

Well when I was but a slip of a lad my parents took me to Bob's Big Boy for my first restaurant hamburger. Not a McDonalds 15 cent hockey puck from a paper bag, mind you, but a for real, sit in the booth and behave yourself until your food comes, my God look at the size of that thing bacon cheeseburger. I'm not sure, but I have always believed Bob's Big Boy invented the double-decker.

Del Taco has recreated this culinary giant, from the two patties dripping with melted cheese to the shredded lettluce and ripe tomato kissed with raw diced white onion and blessed with thousand island dressing. 

So when's my favorite time to bite into a Del Taco Bacon Double Del? Right after I have swallowed the final bite of my first one. Yum!
