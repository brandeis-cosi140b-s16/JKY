The best Real Mexican Food in Vegas! This is not your organic California style Mexican food but real down to earth home cooked Mexican food that is amazing. the chicken chimichanga is to die for and the chili verde burrito will melt in your mouth. This place will have you coming back for more every week but be warned long lines form from 12-2 and sometimes you wait 30 minutes for your order but it is well worth the wait. Very clean, very fresh, and the best husband and wife team working to make this little grill the best in Vegas!
