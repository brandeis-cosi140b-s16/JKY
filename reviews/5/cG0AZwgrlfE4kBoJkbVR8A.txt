I admit, I came to Los Reyes de la Torta because I saw it on Man vs. Food and the sandwiches looked awesome. Unfortunately, I did not have the stomach space to partake in the del rey, but I was able to enjoy the milanesa and a giant agua fresca.

My milanesa was great - loved the fresh bread and the thinly battered beef. I forgot what the bf had, but his was even better because it was more saucey. Beware of the free salsa because they are both SPICY!!

I think even better than the torta was the agua fresca. I had the fresa cremosa - strawberry milk and it was amazing! Oh yeah and they have Mexican cokes in bottles too. 

The parking lot is a bit small, but there was a guy guiding people on where to park. He was really nice and told us not to park in the neighboring lot or we would get towed.
