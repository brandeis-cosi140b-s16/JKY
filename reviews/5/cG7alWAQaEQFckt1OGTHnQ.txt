Outstanding service, ambiance and vegetarian food options. I had lunch and dinner here. They have a separate vegetarian menu and can accommodate vegans and those who don't want eggs. They have fresh fruit based drinks (aqua frescas) that change daily - be sure to try this. They guacamole is made fresh & was very good. The spring rolls are very good - not very oily & with a good variety of vegetables. The tacos are unique, soft  wrapped, light & full of flavor. I enjoyed both the hongos taco & the refried bean taco. The chips are cooked in the morning in vegetable oil before any meat items are cooked. Finally, the terra cotta chocolate desert was very good. Bottom line - great vegetarian food with taste & creativity. The service was very very good. The atmosphere is nice. For a party of 2, I would get 2 tacos, the spring rolls, & the guacamole, adding on another taco or two if hungry, along with the aqua fresca.
