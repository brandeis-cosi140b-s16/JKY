This place is incredible.  All of the ingredients are fresh.  They don't have a lot of really heavy dishes loaded with sour cream and cheese but you don't miss any of that unhealthy stuff at all because the dishes are perfectly prepared.  I highly recommend the shrimp tacos with the salsa verde, avocado cream sauce, and cilantro from the fresh bar.  In summary, healthy, authentic, fresh and delicious.  If you think chipotle or other chains have fresh ingredients, trust me, this place puts them to shame.  We will be back again soon!
