It's not the prettiest looking taqueria, but it gets the job done. Came here with a group of 10 guys after a long morning of community service after an even longer night of drinking at the bars. I made a beeline for the free chips and salsa next to the typical cucumbers and other vegetables that let you know you're in a legit taco shop.

After inhaling my first bowl of complimentary chips, we ran up to the counter starving and ordered the huge burrito with rice and beans wrapped up inside of it. I can't remember what it was called, but I do remember thinking that it was a great deal. The food came out a little slow, but the chips and cucumbers were more than enough to keep us occupied as we settled in and watched the Cardinals game on the TV. 

The burritos came out and life couldn't have been any better; they blew Filiberto's burritos out of the water and just made my day. Definitely a solid taqueria option here in Tempe, and they get an extra star for the free chips and salsa.
