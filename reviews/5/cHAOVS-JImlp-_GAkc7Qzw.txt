This was one of the best breakfasts I've had. I was here a couple years ago when seeing the Grand Canyon. Had a Pink Cadillac with a SouthWestern breakfast of home fried potatoes mixed with peppers and onions, bacon, scrambled eggs. Yeah, I know...What's the big deal right? It's all in the flavor! Amazing flavor and our waitress was the nicest and funniest person. I like when wait staff and servers have a sense of humor. She was what we needed. So was the Pink Cadillac! BTW, Tons of Tequilla in that baby!
