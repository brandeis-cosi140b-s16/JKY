Had brunch here two weekends ago. Cannot express how wonderful it was.  We struggled to rank the items in order of deliciousness because each was as good as the next. I recommend the short rib hash, the shrimp and the tacos as a few of the best things I have ever eaten - with no exaggeration. And (here comes an incredibly egotistical sounding statement) I have eaten at many very famous restaurants.  Our server Christopher really made the experience special. Ask for him and tip him well!
