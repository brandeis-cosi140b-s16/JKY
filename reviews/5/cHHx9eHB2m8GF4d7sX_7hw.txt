After reading all reviews, I have to say that it is a good place for a good food! Agree with Yelpers for decor - need to upgrade! But not agree with some Yelpers for salsa- it is unique taste & looks watery - I had the same taste in different mex places.... Just unique taste. YES! Carne Acada plate was delusionsssssssssss!
