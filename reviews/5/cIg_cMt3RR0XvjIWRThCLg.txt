This is one of those places where I have been dying to try but the random 1 & 2 star reviews people have deterred me from making it a point to make a trip to the North Side to do so. Now, after actually being a block away and starving after a long day at AGH, I want to kick myself for putting it off.

This place is small, not air conditioned and with not a whole lot of seating.  You order at the counter and then they call you up when food is ready - maybe not the best place for a sit down date, but the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to get amazing taco takeout and stuff our faces in the comfort of our own home.  The menu is on a chalkboard behind the register.  I opted for the mahi mahi street tacos, chips and salsa and a side of guac.  My food was ready in about 5 minutes and I always say Las Palmas has my favorite tacos in Pgh (ok I said this about round corner cantinas tacos too) and I want to kick myself again for making that claim now that I've tried El Burro's fish taco.  It was served on a white corn tortilla with cabbage, cilantro and a creamy white sauce with lime on the side.  I added their salsa which I thought was a little bit smokey and their guac that was clearly fresh.  It was perfect mix of flavors and texture.

The man working the counter was very friendly.  The prices aren't as cheap as Las Palmas, but from my first time here, I have no problem paying.  I can't wait to go back this weekend.

I'm Tori and I have a taco problem.
