Great drink and food specials make this place worthy. The service was spotty at times, but the food, drinks, and overall value far outweighed this.

If you're a hotel guest, you get a 2-for-1 coupon. If not, look in one of the local Vegas guides for that same coupon. Also, for the month of May, they offered $1 Tecate bottles and $3 Cazadores shots. $4.95 margaritas as well, but didn't try those.

As for food, got the chicken fajitas, served with rice, beans, sour cream, and guacamole for $11.95 (which is only $6 with the coupon). I also enjoyed the chips and salsa (plus the bean dip was a nice change). The service was a bit slow at times, but otherwise pretty good.

$32 (after discount, tax, and tip) for two entrees, two rounds of chips and salsa, five Tecates, and two Cazadores shots. Great deal, I'll be back.
