This is a Mexican restaurant located in the same building as the Pan and Pan Mexican Bakery (http://www.panypanwi.com/) and in the same shopping center as the Woodman's East grocery store.  We love to go here before going grocery shopping.  The week-end is the best time to go because they have some fabulous specials.  Be certain to ask for them.  The Posole is absolutely amazing.  Definitely ask for the salsa verde.  The fish and shrimp tacos are delicious.  Seriously, the shrimp is cooked perfectly nearly every time I order them. The avocado slice and pickled onion strips add a lot of flavor.  The Quesadillas are not your typical version.  Each order comes with a type of filling along with diced red pepper and jalapeno.  Vegetarians have an option of fried zucchini and yellow squash as a taco, burrito, quesadilla, and torta filling.  For the omnivore crowd, all of their pork dishes are delightful.  Oh, and it is extremely affordable.  
By the way, this restaurant is also reviewed under the name of La Joya Mexican Restaurant but when we asked the owners, we were told it is called El Poblano.
