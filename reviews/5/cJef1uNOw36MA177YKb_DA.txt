This place can be found in the Riviera Hotel food court.  I used to work across the way on Convention Center drive, and this is absolutely the best Mexican chain restaurant in town, and I'm generally not a fan of fast food, but this one is exceptional. Your meal is made to order, from scratch, and always quick. Don't skip the salsa bar! They have 6 or more fresh made salsas to choose from, as well as escabeche and fresh onions and cilantro so that you can garnish as you like.

My favorites are the Fajita Platter, Mahi Mahi burrito, and Overstuffed Burrito with Chicken.

Try this place, you won't regret it. :)
