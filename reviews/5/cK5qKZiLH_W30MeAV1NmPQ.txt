We came for dinner 01/31/15 around 5 pm. 
The restaurant was busy but we were seated within 5 minutes of arrival . I had the best bowl of tortilla soup EVER !! It had grilled chicken , shredded cheese, fresh avocado, tortilla strips and an amazing , thick chicken broth . I'm posting a pic of it , but I'm warning you it won't do it justice .. My children ordered off the kiddo menu which was cheap( $5.55 each ) and the plates were each amazing . My son had the 2 mini tacos with rice and beans and he loved it . If you are in the mood for the best bowl of tortilla soup in the whole world .. Then you need to stop by here
