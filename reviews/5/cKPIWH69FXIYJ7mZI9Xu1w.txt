The raison d'etre of Yelp is to spread the gospel of local businesses like International House of Food. This little spot is a gem, tucked away on Van Buren in the shadow of the downtown skyline. The menu is large and aims to please a variety of palates. The prices are a steal considering how delicious and home cooked the food is, serivce congenial and amicable, and the interior itself is spotless and comfortable.
 This morning I dropped by with my special lady friend for breakfast, around 7:00, and we were the first customers, we ordered a battery of items to get a good idea of the spread: a waffle combo- one waffle two eggs a slice of bacon and a sausage link; a taco plate- one pastor, one asada, and a chorizo taco with rice, beans dusted in cotija, a side of grilled onions and some homemade tomatillo salsa; as well as a bowl of peanutty pad thai teeming with tofu, chicken, scallions, and eggs. It was a glorious repast, and insanely affordable.
  I can't recommend International House of Food enough, and I'm happy to say that this won't be my last visit. A solid option and a boon companion to the downtown restaurant scene, may they live long and prosper!
