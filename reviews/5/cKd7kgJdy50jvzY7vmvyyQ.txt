Elote! Tacos! El Julio! 

Three things that make up a perfect Sunday.

Popped into Gallo Blanco to meet up for a little gathering of friends. Good stuff! This is a very cool place.

Lots of local art up on the walls. Adjacent to the killer pool at the Clarendon. In fact, Arana W. told me about how this is a great spot for a birthday party/staycation for locals.

My birthday is next month. MAYBE I will set this up....

In any case....while we waited for our table, we grabbed drinks at the bar. Since it was Happy Hour, all drinks with a star on the menu were $5, and beers were $3. I got the El Julio which is lime vodka, liquor 43, lime, soda. Freaking amazing. 

Once we got our table, I ordered the Elote (corn for you amateurs) which is dusted with smoked paprika and cotija cheese. Your palate will have a hard-on. Yeah. Seriously.

Then for my entree, I ordered Pork and Beef Tacos. All were very well-prepared. My only concern was that the tacos only had one tortilla. Typically a street-style taco will have two tortillas, because the first one will break because of the juice from the meat. Mmm. 

It was still delicious, and I enjoyed it.

Make sure you try the two sauces they put on the tables. Green and red. PLEASE try the red. It's spicy, but so effing flavorful, that your whole outlook on life will change afterwards.

Perhaps I exaggerate a little. Who cares. Just come down here.

I drove all the way from Scottsdale. It was worth it. I'll be back.
