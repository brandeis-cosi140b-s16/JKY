Awesome food, service and drink specials. By far the best Mexican type place ive found. The Pollo Con Crema, Chori Pollo and Pollo Fundito are out of this world good. The Parrillida Mexicana fajitas are delicious and impressive(I swear, its gotta be pushing 5lb of food).
On weekends the jumbo margaritas are $6 and Dos Equis pitchers are $7. The margaritas are strong and the pitchers are large(64 oz methinks). They bring the glasses with the pitcher out half full of beer to make up for any foam. How cool is that!?  Im definitely a fan. Seriously, for some yummo cheesy food and great drink specials this place rules.
