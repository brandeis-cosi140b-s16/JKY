Transporting fast-casual dining to Maricopa! This awesome Mom & Pap joint has earned a place in my favorites.  I order the Nicol√°s, a gigantic steak burrito enchilada style, with green and red sauce, topped with cheese.  You can customize your burrito any way you like, and the staff is very friendly.  You've got to swing by and try Cilantro's!
