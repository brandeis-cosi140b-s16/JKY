First time ever trying Chipotle and OH MY GOD. It's great! When I told the guy I had never been there he told me that all their food is fresh and comes from fair treated animals. I would have eaten it anyway but I appreciated how friendly and knowledgable he was! Thank you! :) I will definitely be choosing Chipotle over other food from now on.
