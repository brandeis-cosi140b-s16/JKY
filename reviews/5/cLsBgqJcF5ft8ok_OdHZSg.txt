I really hope this place stays around for a long time.

I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!

The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat. 

I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!

The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones. 

They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out, 

Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more
