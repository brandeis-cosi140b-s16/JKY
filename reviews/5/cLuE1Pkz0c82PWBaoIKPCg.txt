Place is family owned and operated which is a big plus for me. They serve the authentic Mexican food I grew up with...there are no others around!  I believe the bad reviews are because the people are accustomed to another style of Mexican food, or the chain restaurants.  If bad service is the issue, everyone has a bad day. However, it is not an excuse!  Good service is hard to find Anywhere!!
