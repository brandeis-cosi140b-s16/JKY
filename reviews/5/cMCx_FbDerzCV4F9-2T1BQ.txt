This restaurant is outstanding.

My wife and I stop by for happy hour often. Their food is outstanding, I have pretty much loved everything I've eaten off their menu. You have to try their fresh guacamole that they make table side and try their habernero salsa if you like it HOT. Drinks are delicious and reasonably priced and they have a great tequila selection. Also, the staff and bartenders are friendly and great at what they do. Highly recommend.
