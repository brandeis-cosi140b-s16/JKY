In 2009, Sofia's was where we had our first date.  I can't remember which of us picked it but it was just right for authentic fare and lingering while getting to know a little about each other.

My partner and I felt the sparks of a kindling romance over the traditional and tasty chile relleno--we've been together, since and we're married last year.  

Thank you, Sofia's.
