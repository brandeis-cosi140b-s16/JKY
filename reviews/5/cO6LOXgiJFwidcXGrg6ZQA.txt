Chimayo Chicken, Cakebread and the corner circular booth by the seductive fireplace.  Five stars.  

I finally made it here the other night.  An attempt to go here last summer was quashed by a kitchen fire.  Needless to say, the blue crab tostadas also impressed.  

The ambiance at Rokerij is such that you just want to stay and relax for the rest of the night -- (I was late to my next Friday night stop!!). The dark cavernous feel of the place lends itself well to a special night out.  Wine service was adept and the server was refilling our chardonnay very regularly. 

The chimayo chicken was stellar - decked out and rolled with spinach, sundried tomatoes, poblano chile, asiago cheese and drizzled with an onion sauce and accompanied by mashed potatoes served in a green chile. A stunning combination of flavors -- spicy, smoky, rich and healthy at once.
