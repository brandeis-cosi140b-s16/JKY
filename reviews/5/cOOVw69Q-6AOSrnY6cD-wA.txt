sushi burritos ... say whaaat ??? 

JABURRITOS hit the spot for me and the fianc√© tonight.  Craved sushi but didn't want to go to a busy sushi restaurant.  I've seen places like this in Cali so I'm happy to see they've finally brought it to Vegas.   

All the guys working there are super friendly and they will help you out if you have any questions about the menu.   

The ordering is similar to chipotle/subway where they make it in front of you.  
The fish is fresh and they are generous with the condiments.  You can choose to customize it if you'd like or opt for a salad instead of a burrito.  If you want to "make it a combo" it includes a drink and you add a side salad, chips or, mochi.  The side salad was seaweed and I was craving cucumber salad, which they didn't have but the chef gave me some sauces to make it ... awesome ! 

This place isn't quite on my side of town, but I definitely would recommend others to come here to get your SUSHI BURRITO FIX !
