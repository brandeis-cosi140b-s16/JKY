La Escondida is in my opinion one of the best overall Mexican restaurants in the Scottsdale area. It is a great mix of ambiance, fantastic food, and great service. 

I have never had to pay for the food myself when going here so I really don't know what the cost is, but I would certainly be willing to pay more than the average Mexican food rate for the flavors here. 

This is one of the places I miss most in AZ.
