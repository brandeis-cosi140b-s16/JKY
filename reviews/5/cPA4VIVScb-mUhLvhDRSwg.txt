The only place where I can get my taco fix while I'm in Pittsburgh?  Legit.  I always get two lengua tacos.  Lengua is Spanish for delicious, so that's why I always get two lenguas because that's double the awesome (lengua is actually Spanish for tongue, but I find lengua makes for some of the best tacos; super savory and always tender).

Take a fresh tortilla, warm it up on the grill, and top it with a pile on the lengua.  Yes, onions, cilantro and a squeeze of a lime wedge would be preferred, but I guess the Pittsburgh market prefers the lettuce tomato with sour cream deal.  The customer is always right.

At 2/$5, it's a bit pricier than what I'd expect a taco to cost elsewhere, but in Pittsburgh competing with other food vendors in the Strip, it's priced just right.

They also do chicken, pork and beef tacos as well as burritos ($5 as well), but if you're in the mood for awesome, do yourself a favor and get some LENGUAAAA.
