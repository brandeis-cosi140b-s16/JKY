This place is awesome.  The only downside is that the secret's out and sometimes it's crowded.  

The food is amazing and it's cheap.  The chips are fresh made - light and flaky and usually hot.  They can be enjoyed  with the amazing green and red sauces.  Others have mentioned the sauces, but the green is just fantastic.  It's some blend of avocado, lime, cilantro, tomatillo, and just a little pepper, I think - and it is delicious on everything.

I've had the beef and beef tongue tacos.  The pork tacos are great too - they are pretty simple, with some fresh cilantro and onion over the tender meat.  The lunch combos are good too and the seasonings are flavorful and delicious.

I think the amount of food is just right if you're feeling hungry - not as much as some of the other Mexican places in town, but it's cheap and I think the quality is better.  

The service also deserves special mention - they manage to be both fast and very friendly.  They're fast enough to make this a good lunch break stop even if you have limited time.  

This has become our go-to Mexican place and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
