Out of all the Roberto's in the Las Vegas area, this by far is the best. 
- Cleanest 
- Freshest 
- Nicest
- Most spacious 
- Even during peak times, 6-8pm, still not that bad of a wait 
- Usually order on the phone. Food ready in 10min. Great service. 
- Salsa bar packed. If not, friendly enough to restock
- Even on Chicken taco Wednesdays, not sloppy. 
- I wouldn't go out of my way to just to visit this particular location when you have one right next to where you live, but I feel this place deserves merits.
