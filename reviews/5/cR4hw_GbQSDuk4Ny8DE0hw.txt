Great spot inside a gas station. They care about your customer experience and strive to get your 5 star Yelp review. Honestly it's a mentality that more restaurants should adopt. Generous and kind guys work the place who want you to have a good dining experience. 

I had the California burrito. It was tasty and fresh, beats Robertos by a mile. They use real avocado in their guacamole and their salsa Roja and salsa Verde aren't watered down versions of what they should be. They're flavorful. The fries in the California burrito were crisp, not soggy. The burritos are huge. Theyre a bit more expensive than robertos but it's worth it knowing that your food was cooked for you fresh and they're not cutting corners every place they can. 

Tell them it's your first time and they will hook you up and your panties will drop.
