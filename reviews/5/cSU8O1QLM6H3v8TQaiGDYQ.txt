We love this place! The tacos al pastor are the best we've ever had! We also love the carne Asada tacos and burritos! We order ours with no cabbage. We drive from Surprise to eat here that's how much we love it! Homemade tortillas! Be prepared to eat outside as its a food truck, but there's tables and a shade covering!
