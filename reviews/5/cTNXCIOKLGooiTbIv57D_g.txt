Really excellent Mexican food, far superior to the other fare on Green St. The name makes it sound like an Americanized fast food place but it's actually more of a restaurant than Taco Bell type place, you can sit down and have a decent dinner. The service is extremely fast and prices pretty reasonable, considering most items are large and come with sides. Even the chips they give you while you're waiting and pretty good. I had the fajita burrito and it came drenched in cheese, with sour cream and guacamole on the side, you can't go wrong with that.
