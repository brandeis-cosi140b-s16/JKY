One of our normal take out joints. We will occasionally eat in. Love all the different salsas you get when you eat in. The authentic carne asada tacos are the best here. I also love their tortas. Food is always tasty and fast. Venture out from your regular "American" Mexican foods you would normally order. Their authentic foods are great!
