This tiny little if-you-blink-you-miss-it restaurant has some of the most amazing Mexican food!! I've been coming with friends and co-workers off and on for years but am only now writing a review. From the friendly, quick and attentive service, to the best salsa I've ever had, this place would get more than 5 stars from me if possible. You won't be disappointed!!!
