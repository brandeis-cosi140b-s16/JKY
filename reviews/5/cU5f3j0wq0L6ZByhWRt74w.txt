So this is a family restaurant that has been in Las Vegas since 1969 and has some food options that can't be found anywhere else in Las Vegas. The nameless, homemade noodle soup with cheese is out of this world. The salsa is homemade and they have two options, one that is hot and one that is more of a chunky salsa, the chips are also homemade and delicious. They also offer lots of different options, with mix and match dinner entrees as well.

Bottom line, you will never satisfy everyone on any aspect but I support family run and small businesses not to mention Las Vegas locals.

The margaritas also are hand poured and are divine. So try it, trust me, you will like it!
