Oh man. This place is amazing. I went here with some pals because we were craving something organic and with a south-of-the-boarder flair. The guacamole is made right in front of your table, and the fajitas come out piping hot and full of delicious flavor. 
The restaurant itself neighbors a strip club, yes, but don't let that freak you out. Between the great service( shout out to Christian and Neil!) and the amazing food, this place works wonders. Chef Pacos' flan was amazing, and when he (yes, the executive Chef)came and introduced himself to our table he informed us that it was his Grandmas' recipe- how unique and great is that!? Order that flan, then thank me later) 
Do yourself a huge favor and request to sit in Rorke's section. That guy is dedicated, positive and his knowledge on the food was truly impressive. If you're lucky enough to have him as your server, you'll get a lot of great suggestions that will satisfy your Mexican cuisine craving.
Go here! It's muy delicioso.
