As a lover of street tacos in LA, it was a treat to discover this addition to the culinary landscape in Vegas!  Our taco assortment had generous portions of fresh ingredients that were delicious.  Service was prompt and the wait staff were courteous and attentive.  Although our trips to Vegas are infrequent, I will definitely visit again.  And I would encourage "locals" to take advantage of a neighborhood restaurant that offers great food at affordable prices in a clean and festive environment.  Good luck to the business and thanks for helping make the trip extra special!
