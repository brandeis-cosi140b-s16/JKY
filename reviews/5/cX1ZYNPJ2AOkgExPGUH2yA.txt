Watch out you Gringos! It's The Real Deal! I've been going to Restaurant Mexico for over 20 years. Raised in Arizona, I've had my share of Mexican food all over the southwest and Mexico. This is authentic food that is fresh and home made! The queso is delicious especially in the cheese enchiladas with green sauce (I crave them!). The cold guacamole salad is perfect on a hot summer day. Since I've had nearly everything on the menu, I won't go on and on, but try any of the dishes and see for yourself. Don't expect your average Mexican food though. This is *not* the bland, grease-ridden American-Mexican food you find as a default all over the US. Nice choices, great service so, go try the real deal already! :) (PS: If you are expecting the average Mexican food you always eat around town, then you may not be happy with the real deal. Expand your mind and stomach!)
