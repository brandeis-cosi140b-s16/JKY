I stopped in just before closing on a Monday night. Everything was really clean and the staff is super friendly.

They let us sample several of their agua fresca flavors. All of them were delicious, and I would go back just for the pineapple one!! They only have 1 size for $2.50. The watermelon and mango were great too!

Along with our 2 drinks, we ordered a carne asada quesadilla, a carnitas burrito, and Mexican street corn. Everything is made to order, and despite being the end of the night, tasted super fresh and homemade. I'm a Chipotle junkie, and I might like Frijoles better. The only thing I missed was the cilantro lime rice & the portions here are smaller. For everything we spent under $20.

The only thing I didn't care for was the street corn. I, unfairly, compare all street corn to Mundo's street corn which is off the charts amazing. And, while Frijoles is probably a more traditional version, it didn't blow mind like Mundo's did.

I would give this place an A overall, and I'm sure I will be a regular customer! They're worth checking out. The menu isn't huge, but what they have they do well and their prices are really affordable.
