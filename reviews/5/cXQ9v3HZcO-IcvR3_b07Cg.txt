I decided to try a new location for the BOGO deal Chipotle had this month. I like talking to the staff, and these guys were great. The manager Jacob was awesome about explaining things and takes care of his customers! Funny guy, too. Hope to see him again.

Also I love this location! It's tucked in a nice little circle with fountains a few steps away, which is nice since it's so hot in Phoenix... I'll be back next time I'm near downtown Phoenix!
