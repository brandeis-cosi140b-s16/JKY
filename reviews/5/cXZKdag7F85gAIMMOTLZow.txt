We came here on 7/19 & then again 7/20.. I'm not sure what "Tacos el Gordo" taste like, but these tacos are to die for! The Al Pastor/Adobada are THE BEST! I'm seriously going to have to make a trip to Vegas just for these tacos! SOOO GOOD!! The meat is nice and tender and sliced. i've never met Al Pastor/Adobada tacos like these. Out here in the Modesto/Stockton area there aren't very good places. I hope i see a taqueria out here with this quality of tacos soon. But yes, you must try these tacos. 5 STARS!
