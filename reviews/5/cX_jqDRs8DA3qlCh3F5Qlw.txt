Excellent. Great food, and the lower section - the bar- opens to the outside and, except when 100+ degrees, is almost always open. Faces the Village entertainment (Friday nights). Even in cool weather can sit outside by the fireplaces and enjoy the view of the lake. Worth the drive from the strip. Am a local; have visited often for more than 2 years and have never had anything other than a great meal with great, personal service, and returning guests always ask to go back. Will take pics next time.
