When my wife and I first moved to Maricopa, we were disappointed that there were very few "authentic" restaurants. We saw Tacos N' More advertising they would be "opening soon" and we couldn't wait. The wait was WELL worth it. First, the food is very authentic. I lived in Mexico for a year and this what I was missing, right down to the refrescos in glass bottles and Mexican style ice cream bars. Second, their service is amazing. They are the definition of family owned and operated, and they always greet you with a smile and ask "Where have you been?" Finally, Tacos N' More is about as close as you get to home cooking because you are not limited to the menu. The fact that they have a menu is absurd because you can order any item any way you would like it. I always feel dumb asking "Can I get..." because they always answer "OF COURSE!" A must dine-in for any Maricopa resident, and a great stop if you venturing through or going to the casino.
