Had the best experience! The husband and I just finished a fun weekend in Vegas and were looking forward to a relaxing lunch and Javiers seemed like the right choice. We started off with their house margaritas, which are made with el Jimador tequila. Pretty good, but they also have a great selection of others to choose from. We ordered a side of the guacamole to go with our chips and salsa which was so fresh and made perfectly. We both ordered the carne fajitas and they were delicious! We've been to the Newport and Irvine location, but our visit at the Vegas location has been, by far, our favorite of the 3. The food at Javiers at all locations have consistently been amazing, but what exceeded our expectations at the Vegas location was the service and the interaction with management. Our server, Ovidio, provided exceptional service. The manager, Charles, also spoke to our table and found out we were in town celebrating my birthday and made sure to send a dessert to our table. Little gestures like that go a long way and leave a lasting impression. We go to Vegas about 1-2 times a year, and are coming back in April. We definitely want to re- visit Javiers and hope that Ovidio and Charles will be there!
