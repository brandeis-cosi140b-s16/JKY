Every time I visit I want to visit again. My recent visit I was celebrating my birthday and had the happy hour enchiladas and drinks. I made a mistake on my own order. The server and manager took care of it without hesitation.

I come here frequently because of the food (you HAVE to try the red sauce) and the service. The waiter was new, but did an excellent job of attending to me. And, despite it being happy hour, the food portions, chips, and salsa were excellent.
