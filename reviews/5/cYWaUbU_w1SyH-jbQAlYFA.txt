I moved from Tucson 4 years ago, and was extremely homesick for authentic Mexican food when my best friend suggested we go to Nino's--that was 2 years ago.  Ever since then, we have been going about once a week.  They are the most affordable family restaurant around. The staff treats us like family, and the know our order the moment we walk in. I am grateful to have a place I can go to where I feel like family!  We love Ninos!
