Great food.  Very authentic family owned and run restaurant.  The food reminded me of food I've had in Mexico city.  In fact I was told by the server that they are her Mom's recipes and the family is from Mexico city. 
I would recommend trying the enchiladas, they were unlike anything I've had here in the valley.
