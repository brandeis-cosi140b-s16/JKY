This place is good. And Im saying that as a San Diegan who loves Mexican food (and has been to pretty much ALL the good mexican shops in Diego).

My brother took me here once and I just kinda disregarded it bc I figured LV wouldnt compare to SD... how wrong I was... Had it one time, and literally, FEINED for it while I was back in SD (got some as soon as got back to LV!) 

I always get the adobada burrito and have them add french fries to it (the lengua burrito is really good too... thats beef tongue for all you people who dont know wassup) ... They have a great salsa bar with green and red salsa, lots of lime, green onions, and the pickled carrots/jalapenos... I like to mix 1:1 of the green and red salsa... so delish....

Not sure this place is worth the trip if youre staying on the strip, but if youre nearby and want a good burrito at a reasonable price, this place is worth it!
