I'm not necessarily giving the 5 stars for the food (which I'd give 4.5 stars) or the atmosphere (which I'd give 4.5 stars), but mostly for the service.

We walked in and found seats at the bar almost immediately, sat down and our server cleaned off our place. We started out with the house margarita and a beer, and decided to start off with Chips and Guac. I'm new to guacamole, probably within the past year or so, but if I had had this when I disliked it, it probably would've turned me. A little bit of kick to it? Yes please.

The lady and I both ordered 2 tacos, she got the fish tacos and the poblano one, and I got the pollo rojo and the short rib. Although small, these were great! Well crafted, very flavorful! You can tell that they get all their ingredients fresh (which they confirmed for us). Everything down to the sour mix for the margaritas is homemade. Really impressive. 

We asked for our check and told our server that it was our first time here and we'd definitely be coming back. He returned with the check and told us "The chips and guac are on me, thanks for coming out and seeing us!" Shoutout to our server, Buck, for making a memorable Tuesday night. We WILL be back because of him, but for the food and atmosphere too.
