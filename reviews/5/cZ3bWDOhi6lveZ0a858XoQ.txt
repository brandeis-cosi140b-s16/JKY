Was surprised to see we had a new restaurant at that location. So gave it a try last night for dinner.  Wow,    A+ on the food, A+ on the service.  Outstanding restaurant and my new favorite.  Fresh ingredients and it shows. Was glad to see they had a nice sized crowd there cause I really really hope this place makes it. One thing, maybe turn down the volume on the music a bit.  But still a great place
