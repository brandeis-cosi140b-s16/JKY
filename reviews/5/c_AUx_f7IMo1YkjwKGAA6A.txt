If you are looking for a sub par chain Mexican food restaurant with chips and salsa this is not the place to go. If you want some authentic awesome Mexican food then this is your place. I had the rolled tacos plate and a gordita. Everything was amazing. Service was great and the salsa bar was super clean and had lots of salsa options. Good sized portions and friendly staff. This is for sure on my list of go to places.
