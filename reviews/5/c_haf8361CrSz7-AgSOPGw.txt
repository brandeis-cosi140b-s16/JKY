Great restaurant!  Just opened. Let me say its great to see a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix bringing back home style Mexican food. Phoenix has been influenced by filibertos style food. But this does it as it should be. They use Angus beef for asada tacos, they shred their own cheese, have handmade tortillas, fry their own chips, make the salsa fresh evetyday with a salsa bar, homemade lemonade,  cocktail shrimp is delicious have a sweet flavor that reminds me of a homemade only flavor. 

Tacos were also great! I had the tacos de pastor and cabeza. The pastor was sweet and spicy great grill taste paired with their tomatillo salsa.
The cabeza was extremely tender, just like mom can only make.  

I wish the best for this place. Try it you won't be disappointed.
