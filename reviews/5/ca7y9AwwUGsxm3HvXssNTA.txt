AH! The Roberto's of my College Years.... 

Rolling out of our highrise dorm at 1AM, getting the housemates together and leaving the misty La Jolla seashore for Miramar Road in the ol' VW Golf for some late night snacking on Nacho w/ Guacamole, hold the jalapeno... I was a vegetarian back then after all, so no taquitos for me (back then.) 

I have the menu here in front of me and they have locations in 
California, Nevada, and Florida. 

.....but NONE in the Bay Area. This makes baby Jesus cry. 
THIRTY locations in Henderson/ Las Vegas. 
2 in Florida (Del Ray beach and Hialeah) 

The car's Navigon GPS system navigated me to this place after telling me there was a location on S Maryland that I never DID find.... 

My favorites:
Taquitos (rolled tacos) with guacamole 
Tortilla chips with cheese and guacamole
Chimichanga with chicken (available with beef or carne asada, tambien.) 

In one sitting (at the other location a few nights previous), i ordered the Chimichanga Plate AND a side of 3 Rolled tacos. I could SEE the Hostest with the Mostest in LV's eyes.. his EYES widened as I placed my order. 

The menu does not refer to Rolled Tacos as "Taquitos", however. Was there a copyright infringement suit filed or something?????

Warning: Going here twice during my vacation is one good reason why my jeans are Too Tight today. I'm just saying.
