So good we've been back twice in 5 days. The shrimp tostada is fantastic, and the pork adobada torta was also really good, as was my chili verde taco. Similarly to Chipotle, you can go down the line and tell them exactly what you'd like on your torta/taco/burrito. Unlike Chipotle, the upcharge for guacamole is only $.25 for tacos/tortas, and $.50 for burritos, and most of the time, they don't even comp it anyway. Oh, and the guacamole's more flavorful anyway.

For a fraction of the price of Chipotle, I got more food, dessert, and 2-for-1 beer. Eat local.
