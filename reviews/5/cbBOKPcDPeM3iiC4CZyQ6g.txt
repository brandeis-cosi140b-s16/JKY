Wanted breakfast in Tempe before a day football game. (Long lines!) we walked in just after they opened and got seated right away. When we asked about the breakfast menu we were told they were only serving lunch that day. We were clearly disappointed, but within minutes of hearing the news, a manager showed up, apologized deeply, offered us special gift certificates for our inconvenience then had the kitchen crack a couple eggs for a bacon and egg dish for my wife! I had the nachos which were a great meal size portion. And who doesn't like fresh cornbread?!? Service was on point despite the large crowd. 
I'm not normally a big fan of any 'chain' type restaurants, but when the customer service levels exceed anything I can think of, I'll be back as well as refer friends and family. Thank you Z-Tejas!
