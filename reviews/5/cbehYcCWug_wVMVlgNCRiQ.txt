Cannot believe I haven't reviewed this great mexican restaurant yet ... as my mind thinks of 3 things when I think of Frank & Fina's, and all three of them have "mole" in their name:  guacamole, mole (as in chicken enchiladas mole) and holy-mole sweet potato enchiladas!   (ok, not LOL funny..but you get my point!

Try these 3 items and you'll be back ... for more mole!   

Ole'

(Misti your review inspired me ... as I've always tell people how great the sweet potato enchiladas are!  You must try next time!!)
