EXCELLENT! We were actually impressed by the cleanliness and unique decor upon arrival.  We had the Carne Asada tacos and the Fish burrito.  The tacos were really good.  Fresh and seasoned really well...  The fish burrito was PHENOMENAL.  The fish alone would rival even the best fish and chips I've ever had.  Will 100% definitely be back soon!
