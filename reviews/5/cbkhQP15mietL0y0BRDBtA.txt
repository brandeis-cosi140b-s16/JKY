This is certainly NOT Cheap food by any means. I have tried several dishes and enjoyed them all. My favorite is the Macha breakfast burrito. For 2.99 before 10:00am you cant beat this for the price. The people there are friendly. I LOVE the hotter "red" sauce on my burrito. Stop and and try this place. You should be all smiles!
