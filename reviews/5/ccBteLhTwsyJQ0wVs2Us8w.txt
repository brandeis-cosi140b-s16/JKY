I'm gonna say this place is 5 star. Been here 3 times since they opened and it's definitely on my list to keep coming back. 

Love the baja style fish and shrimp tacos! Beer battered is delicious, takes a little longer, just a few minutes, but worth the wait. Steak and chicken tacos also on point. Everything is fresh and you have SO many options! 

Owner is on site and super nice hard working guy. You can see his staff respects and likes him. 

Reading some of the other reviews I think people are being too harsh, when a restaurant opens it takes a little time for the crew to be performing as a team. Instead of writing a bad review talk to the manager and let them correct their problem. Revisit the establishment and then write your review! 

I hate to see such a great place getting negative reviews when they just needed some time to learn and start functioning smoothly! 

Good job Chronic staff and owner!
