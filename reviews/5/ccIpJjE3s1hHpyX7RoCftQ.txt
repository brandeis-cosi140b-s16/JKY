Okay, if you're in Vegas eating on a budget.... I would HIGHLY suggest stopping in for at least breakfast! I think we paid 3.95 for eggs, your choice of either ham, bacon, or sausage, potatoes and fresh tortillas. How do you go wrong with that? Everything tasted delicious too... Maybe that's because we started drinking at 6am... Hahaha 
They do have 99 cent bloody marys during breakfast too... So it's definitely a smart spot for a breakfast adult beverage. 
It can get packed in here, but even so, we were greeted quickly. Our food took a little longer to get to us, but for a complete meal under 10 dollars including tip out you can't be too picky. Making this a pit stop every time in Vegas!
