You know what chipotle taste like, you're not here for a review on the food, but the customer service at this location was exceptional. After a couple of very long days I was exhausted & looking for delicious, slow carb compliant food that I didn't have to cook. I just wanted to get home. They had me in and out of there so quickly, and everyone was smiling & kind. It just made my night. So much so that I'm bothering to write this review. Thanks, guys.
