Best Mexican Food I have had so far since living in the valley.  It's quick, hearty, authentic, and VERY well priced.  The tacos, enchiladas, quacomole, tortillas and chips are amazing.  Will definintely be going back here frequently.  Only recommendation would be for them to sell queso.  The chips are soooo good its a crime to not have queso for them ( I sadly do realize how un-authentic queso dip is, but still love it).  Writing this has made me hungry, think I'll head there now...
