Great 1st experience here. My friend treated me to lunch & has been talking to me for weeks about trying this chain. Slow when we came in, we were treated wonderfully. I explained I was a first timer. The gal behind the counter gave me a sample of each of the queso sauces & a chip for each. Went with the smothered burrito with shredded beef. Original queso sauce on top & inside the burrito. Love that the guacamole is free! Most places charge extra from my experience. Got an extra side of chips & more queso. I love queso & this meal was a home run for me. The manager came over & was very friendly. Will definitely be back for more.
