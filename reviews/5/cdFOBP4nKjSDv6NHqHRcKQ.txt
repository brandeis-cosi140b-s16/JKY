Decided to give this place a try for dinner last night since they were the only place that had sopes! Ordered to go, 5 rolled supreme tacos and two chicken sopes! My rolled tacos were one of the best ones I've ever had. They were hot, crunchy, and they were topped off with lettuce, guacamole, and cheese! It had the perfect flavor and they felt home cooked! My husband also enjoyed his sopes and said they tasted really good. I will definitely be back since they have such a huge menu of items to pick from!
