All I can say is Wow! My boyfriend and I came across this place and I am so happy. Lets talk green sauce, this place has the absolute best green sauce I have ever tasted! I essentially wiped our table clean of the bottle! It paired so well with our met plate, which I would totally recommend! Now I don't like refried beans..... But I could not stop eating them! Will definitely be back again! And again! And again! Great food for such an outstanding bargain!
