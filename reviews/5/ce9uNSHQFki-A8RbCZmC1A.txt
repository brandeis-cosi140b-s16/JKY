Chimichangas to change your life! Everything is really fresh & delicious(never old or soggy). The servings are huge. I would rather get take out from here than going to a nice sit down Mexican restaurant rip off. Despite the idea, it's nothing like Filiberto's. This place is the best kept secret I've ever found out about. I don't eat seafood, but am told their's is great. They only ever once accidently gave me guacamole when I asked them not to(I don't like gauc) & there food is so amazing, I ate it anyway & it was pretty tasty. Seriously awesome Mexican take out. I've never been let down!!!!! 24 hours too!
