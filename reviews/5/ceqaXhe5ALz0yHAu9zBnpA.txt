Mattas - RIP
I can't believe it's closed! I didn't have a chance to say goodbye. This was my favorite restaurant in AZ. I've been going here with my family since I was a child. Food is Tex-Mex style, so if you want authentic Mexican Food, this isn't the place. The waitresses knew me and always kept my chips, salsa & iced tea flowing. They used to have a Trio playing on the weekends. The soft beef taco combo was my favorite, my parents order the beef enchilada. The last time I was here, was the day my grandma passed away and the family went out to eat, it was her favorite place. I'll be going to the other Mattas on Higley when I visit family now.
