We pulled into Los Reyes just before noon after an all nighter, flight and roaming around the less than desirable neighborhoods of Phoenix; all because we were riding the Man v. Food bandwagon. 

Not sure about the other location, but this had quite the dive-y feel to it that I love. Menu was exclusively in Spanish which wasn't too hard to decipher, but made me happy we had our amiga with us. 

I had a feeling this place was going to be good, but became ever more excited when our Mexican friend started getting excited at the authenticity of the menu compared to the food she enjoys when in Mexico. 

Everything was fresh and everybody was VERY happy with their meal. I somehow finished off a giant torta despite being full half way through because the flavor was so amazing. 

No alcohol and while a beer would have been great, it definitely shouldn't keep you from going for a nice binge.
