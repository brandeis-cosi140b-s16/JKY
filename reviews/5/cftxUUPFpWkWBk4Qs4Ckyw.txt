Chipotles tastes pretty much the same everywhere but this location is has fast service and friendly staff.  Although the line can get long, they whip through it.  I come here often and I haven't had any problems. *knocks on wood*  Guac is the best I tasted so far.  Also biggest thing is they give more generously than a lot of other chipotles.
