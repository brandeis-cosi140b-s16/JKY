Tried this place yesterday after seeing the online reviews. Had the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito with everything in it. It was DELICIOUS!!! Chorizo was spicy and had tons of flavor. Burrito was huge and actually made two meals for me. Hubby had the carne asada burrito enchilada style with everything and he loved it. Said the carne asada was actually better quality then most places and the burrito was delicious. Salsas were yummy. Restaurant was very clean and staff was friendly. Definitely will go back to try more stuff!
