I just ordered a chimichanga from felipitos.  AMAZING!  I would gladly pay $10.00 for it, but the price was $5.63.  It was humongous!  Chicken in every bite.  If you want authentic Mexican that's inexpensive, Felipitos is the answer.

Update: I've been coming to this glorious 24 hour establishment since the summer of 2005, and Felipito's never fails me, unless it's the sorry location on decatur.  I seem to be addicted to their Carne asada burritos. 95% of the burrito is Carne Asada meat!! The other 5% is the guac, pico de gallo, and of course the tortilla.

It's all outdoors, so you better bring a jacket if you wanna eat there during the winter. 

Another highlight to me, is their Chicken Burrito, not the grilled one, just straight 'chicken burrito'. 96% chicken, 4% cheese and tortilla.  The chicken is always piping hot with the cheese melting. Mmm it's actually a chicken quesadilla in a burrito but with less cheese, and way more chicken.  

Anytime I'm on the eastside of LV, I gotta make a trip to Felipitos.  I'll go out of my way for it too.
