This is my go-to Mexican food place when in LV. The service is outstanding first of all, they serve Pepsi but have Coke in the original glass bottles of you ask. When they bring you your chips they come with salsa AND beans. The Sopa de Fideo is a little bit of home when I'm on my business travels. My favorite thing to get here is the Al Pastor taco plate with nice cold Michelada.

I'm not a huge fan of any of their seafood here, but their original take on the classic steak more than makes up for that. Pretty sure this place has been on TV a few times.

Parking kind of sucks during dinner time, thankfully they have a large lot in the back.
