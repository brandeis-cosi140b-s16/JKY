We were fortunate enough to get the chance to eat brunch their on sunday... and it was fantastic. Immediately you could tell that the patrons were regulars and were appreciated by the staff. everything was welcoming and warm.

playoff football was on the tv's and the bar was full but we found a spot there. The menu was eclectic but traditional at the same time - 4 different kinds of eggs benedict, including crab and sirloin. huevos rancheros, chicken fried steak, beast burrito, etc. 

we ordered the chicken fried steak and omelet - regular favorites of ours. The first thing i noticed was the gravy for the biscuit/steak was homemade with true pieces of real sausage, and was thick. The biscuit was clearly homemade and the portion of country eggs was very generous. 
The omelet was smothered with a sweet/spicy jalape√±o sauce that was incomparable. ingredients all seemed very fresh and vibrant and the pepperjack cheese had a nice spicy kick of freshness. 
we also indulged in the never ending champagne brunch with a few mimosas and the best bloody mary i've had in town (was told it is a family recipe). tried the red sangria (which i traditionally do not enjoy because of the sweetness), and it was very good for my tastes. The pinnacle of the drinks was the award winning apple pie margarita (pictured). It was actually a slice of homemade americana in an iced glass. The mixologist that discovered that combination deserved the award. The bar was outstanding. Their lowest brand name liquors were my personal top shelf brands.

We will be back for dinner soon. After peering at the dinner menu, it will be the perfect special occasion location. DId we mention the scenery/setting were picturesque?
