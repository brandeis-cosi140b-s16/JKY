YUMMY!

I've heard great things about the Tavern and I'm glad I randomly came one night.

At first, while walking in I thought that place was trying to do too much.  Though on second thought, the waterfall and moat was pretty cool.  In case a medieval army decides to attack I guess.  There's a nice little patio to the side, but I chose to sit at the bar to people watch - "Hungry Eyes"!

I ordered the Green Chile Burrito and boy was is massive.  However, I couldn't believe I ate the whole thing!  YOU, get in my belly!  Felt like mini-me was in my belly!  ooof!  It was definitely well worth it.  The chile was tasty and the black beans were well spiced.  The shredded beef inside the burrito with the chiles were to die for - mmmmm!  I pounded it down with a few drinks.  Gluttony!  Now I just gotta look our for Kevin Spacey! (SE7EN reference!) 

Service was good, I think the waiter kept pushing drinks on us haha!  Do I look like I need another one!  Well yes, yes I do.  You know what else is pretty cool about this place -- they have pay phone!  What the heck is that!? - Enjoy!
