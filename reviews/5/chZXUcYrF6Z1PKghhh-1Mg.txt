We have been fans of the original location on Scottsdale Rd for years. We were very pleased when they opened a North Scottsdale location and are open for lunch. The owner rotates the kitchen staff between locations so the food quality is consistent. The ingredients are top notch and fresh. The food is not the typical Tex-Mex that we're all used to in Arizona. This food is from    central Mexico and delicious. Some of my favorites are the hibiscus tacos and enchiladas. All of the pork dishes are great. The adobo sauce is superb. It is a special treat to find huitlacochi on a menu. The chocolate tamale is a wonderful desert. Other reviews mentioned that you had to choose between rice or beans and that chips/salsa were charged. I don't think that is true. We had the choice of black beans with veggies or refried beans with rice. Chips and salsa were complimentary. The owner was present on a Sunday evening, so that shows she really cares. Prices are reasonable. It's great, give the North location of Los Sombreros a try!
