My boyfriend and I were very impressed with Taqueria Guadalajara!! I got the chicken enchiladas - and they were divine. The staff was friendly and FAST! Seriously delicious authentic Mexican food. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Only cons are seating space and no margaritas. However, I wouldn't want TG to change their location, because it's the home town feel that makes them the diamond in the ruff that they are.
