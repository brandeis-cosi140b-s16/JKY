Cantina Laredo is a huge, nicely decorated restaurant. This was my first time dining on a Sunday. My guest enjoyed the fact that the brunch options were served with a complementary mimosa or "Bloody Maria." He ordered the crab cakes which were served with eggs, potatoes, and a cinnamon fried tortilla bowl filled with fresh fruit. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal. I had the cheese enchiladas, which were amazing. The types of cheeses they used (not sure the names?) made these the best cheese enchiladas I've ever tasted. My entree was served with rice and pinto beans. My other guest enjoyed the carnitas, which was pork shanks served with rice and zucchini. We all enjoyed the chips and salsa. The salsas were unique. One was served warm and the other was served cold. They were both yummy. The desserts looked delicious but we were too full to partake in them.  We will definitely return to Cantina Laredo.
