It's a pool bar! You can't go wrong when you mix a pool, margaritas, friends and food in Scottsdale- you just can't!
 Loved the look of this place, it's very large and they do have a restaurant side as well as the awesome cantina side. The cantina side has a resort-like pool area, large bar, cabanas, several tables and outdoor seating. Granted, our unpleasant waitress seemed to hate the world, but other than that, very cool spot.  Decent tacos, pretty good Cadillac Margaritas, and really good Micheladas (bloody-beer as the gringos refer to them). I very much look forward to spending many hot Arizona summer days and nights here! El Santo, you got yourself a new regular.

Tip- OMG try the ceviche! You cant beat this deal, good quality & it's only 5 bucks. HH is M-F till 7pm.

Tip- shoutout to our awesome bartender Maddy! (sorry if I spelled that wrong)
