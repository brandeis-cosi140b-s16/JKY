Awesome awesome awesome.  The food here was seriously legit.  Loved all the flavors, the salsas and the smells.  I was seriously impressed with the food and cannot wait to go back again and try some different things!

The place was very clean, the staff very helpful and the salsa bar was on point.  Great atmosphere and great food!
