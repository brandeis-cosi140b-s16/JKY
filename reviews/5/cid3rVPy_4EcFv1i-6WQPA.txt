Loved it!  We  visited Serranos for dinner yesterday and I have nothing but compliments to give.  I had the machaca  tacos and a chicken enchilada.  They were both extremely good!  As for the negative comments about the bean dip that's served with the chips, it's bean dip!! What do you expect?!?!  There's nothing special about it but it's not bad:).  To drink I had the 1800 margarita.  It was a good strong drink and only $8!
I will definitely be back!
