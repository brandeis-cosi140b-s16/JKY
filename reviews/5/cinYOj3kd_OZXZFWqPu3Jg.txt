The Flautas at Maria's may be the best in the city.  I'm definitely coming back for more!

Restaurant is small.  Relatively clean.  
Prices seemed about $.50 - $1.00 more than most other places for most items. 
For the Flautas it was worth it, I don't mind paying a smidgen more if the food is great.  

Ill let you guys know how the other menu items are when I try them!
