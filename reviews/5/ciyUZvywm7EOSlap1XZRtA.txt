FYI ... So, we stopped at this super-conveniently-located Chipotle (delicious Mexican fast-food in case you're unable to read the reviews below) for lunch. What? Don't give me that look. It's Vegas. You're supposed to be drunk by lunch.

This is the only Chipotle I've seen in a food court setting and trust me (and see my reviews), I've been to a lot of Chipotle restaurants.

Maybe there's a mini-Chipotle at an airport. I haven't been to enough airports.
