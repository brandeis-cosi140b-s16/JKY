First time here and I came during happy hour after shopping at world market. The food is upscale Mexican with a very hip and pretty atmosphere.  The happy hour menu is great plus a free margarita from a yelp check in is nice. By the way their classic margarita is reeeeeally good.  I'm picky about my margaritas but their house made mix is balanced very well and makes you want another. 

Food.  
My boyfriend and I ordered the steak skewers with chimichurri sauce and it came with an avocado salsa and a salad that was deliciously peppery with the steak and had green apples in it. The steak was very tender. I recommend this dish it's all around packed with flavor. 
We also had the chicken taquitos. Very good.
The sashimi grade ahi tostada with fresh herbs. Amazing! Cut up in wedges, great for sharing. 
Great happy hour! I can't wait to try the dinner menu! I will be back :)
