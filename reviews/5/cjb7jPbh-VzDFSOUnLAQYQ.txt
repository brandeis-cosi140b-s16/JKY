I have a favorite mexican food spot in San Jose called Aqui.
Not typical Mexican food.   Like Maria Maria they have a creative, progressive menu, which could be described as foo foo.   I love the twist on tradition in both art and cuisine.   Maria Maria also reminded me of Croce's in San Diego.  For me Maria Maria has captured the best of both places.   Beautiful decor, lovely food,  live music, and the 
Margarita/Sangria cocktail was awesome!!  I 'm all in!    Will let you know if future visits do not live up.
