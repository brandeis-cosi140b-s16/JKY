Extremely satisfied with the quality and price! I had used them for my sons birthday party and they gave me the best quality and best price! I was so satisfied the lady (Lily) that helped me out was so understanding and she worked with my budget! My guest loved the food! Extremely convenient if you don't want to cook. When I picked it up they even helped me take it to my vehicle. I definitely recommend Se√±or Taco to anyone that wants real Mexican food for there party! I give them 10 STARS!
