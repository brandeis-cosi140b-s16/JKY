Dual review for Mesa and Central Phoenix Locations:

I have never noticed a difference in food for either location. Some like it hot is true!!!!

I have been on about a six year love affair with the adovada ribs. This is the dish to get here, if you are excited about the the heat, and want something amazing.

My wife who is not as into the heat, or meat and has been quite happy with Bean and Cheese Burro, and cheese crisp. Margarita's are good but expensive. We have had many a great evening there drinking and waiting for a table. 

Central location:
Great atmosphere, wonderful area to wait for your table, and you will wait as there is not very much seating inside. Evenings they will open the bar so you can get chips, salsa, and drinks. I think my favorite part is sitting out side and waiting,until I eat the food then the wait does not matter any more.

Mesa location: 
Much bigger, and more seating it is in an auto strip mall, no waits there, however not as nice and welcoming as the central location, in fact they have painted a mural of the central location (I heard it was Tom Mix's house) on the wall inside the Mesa location. The food has always been just as good. However given the option I would drive out to south mountain every time.

Great place that we will be going to for many years to come.
