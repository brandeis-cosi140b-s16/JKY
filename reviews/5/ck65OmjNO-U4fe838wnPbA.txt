This was a recommendation from one of the managers at the Sheraton Desert Oasis. My husband and I shared the Cruz Kitchen - tenderloin Colin relleno, carne adobada, smoked pork tamale, rice, beans and Flour tortilla--each one better than the other!! Even the rice and beans, which normally are shoved to the side, were wonderful!

Splitting this huge entree was perfect - but we were wishing we'd ordered two so we'd have leftovers to take back with us!   This may be our new favorite restaurant!! Fabulous service - oh, and did I mention the roasted salsa?? I bought a large jar to go and they threw in 2 bags of their yummy chips!
