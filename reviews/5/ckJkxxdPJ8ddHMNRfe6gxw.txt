I have eaten here twice so far. Both times the service was great. We sat outside on both occasions and our waiter was very attentive even with the patio being absolutely packed! The guacamole and salsa trios are amazing. We've ordered many things off the menu so here are my recommendations: Lobster Tacos are delicious but really spicy. They come with a jalepeno sauce that I might not ask for next time. I'm a wimp when it comes to spice but my husband loves it. Shrimp Enchiladas with green sauce. So creamy, so soft so... heavenly. Comes with sliced avocado on top. My husband got their Mercadito Cheeseburger and it came with these rosemary fries and a side of that spicy jalepeno sauce. He loved it. The margaritas are outstanding. I believe someone makes fresh juice for each one. You can add heat to it if you want. Again, I'm a spice wimp so I haven't tried it. 

Note: this restaurant brings your food as it is ready. Don't be surprised if someone gets their food before you. I recommend your party orders apps and small plates to share so that the food just keeps on coming.
