I lived on the U.S.-Mexico border for a good portion of my life. Everybody claims to sell "street tacos" in the Southwest, especially AZ. After TWO years of looking for decent Norten~o Mexican food in the Phoenix area, I found La Santisima (formerly La Condesa). They have a wide range of salsas and condiments to add to your food. So check it out and try it. The salsa has heat and flavor that is lacking in 99% of "Mexican food" places around here. Be advised that it's a small place that specializes in tacos and burros and, at times, there's not enough room to sit. However, it's really worth the wait. I drive all the way from northeast Mesa/AJ to just have some of their fare. As far as the latter not so favorable review (9/6/2015) on here questioning authenticity, I don't understand how something isn't "authentic," when northern Mexicans regularly use mayo and mustard, due to U.S. influence. Ever had a Sonoran hot dog? The menu does state that the owners are from the northern state of Sonora. Regardless of these types of reviews, La Santisima is a great place to go have some beer and tacos in a dark place reminiscent of a taqueria on the Mexican side of the border. Besides, where else can you see posters of "El Santo" movies in the men's restroom? If you've been watching "The Strain" on FX, this is the movie hero upon which the "Silver Angel" character is based. Without a doubt, wholeheartedly recommend this place for tacos and beer... btw, if you're looking for margaritas, the ones we had were far from "watery."
