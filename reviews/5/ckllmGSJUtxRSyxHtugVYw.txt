The Mission is one of the best restaurants in Old Scottsdale. The Street Corn and Clam stew are the perfect lite meal as are the tacos. The Mission Bitter Bee is one of best cocktails in the Valley with fresh grapefruit & lime juices. The service was efficient but not rushed and the table location was exactly as requested. It's our favorite for out of town visitors but allow a few extra minutes to find a parking spot at peak times.
