Ordered the super nachos & large drink. Free refills which I like, and they have a chip and salsa bar. They have about 5 different kinds, also has the spicy carrots, limes & cut up cucumber. Lady was nice, order came out quick & the chef wash his hands before he made the food. That's 5 stars in my book.
