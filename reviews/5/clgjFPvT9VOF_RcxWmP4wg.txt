I have been to this place several times and I really like this restaurant a lot. Really like the ambiance and the great service always with a smile as it should be. Really like their Crispy Fish Tacos, shrimp, Carne Asada and the Braised beef tacos, did try their Serrano Cucumber Margarita and it is a treat. Definitely want to check out their Taco Tuesday deals!
