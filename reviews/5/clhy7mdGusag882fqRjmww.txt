Went here on a tip with my coworker and was pleasantly surprised. Really great tacos, and it was Taco Tuesday!!!!  We were given samples of the meat, I  ended up getting 3 street tacos, and my friend purchased 8! Afterwards, we were given samples of homemade Horchata, which was bomb!!! So cinnamony!!! I highly recommend giving Julia's a try. Plus the Grandmother works there cooking, you can't go wrong if Grandma is cooking in the back too. Don't pass Julia's by, get in there and try some delicious food.
