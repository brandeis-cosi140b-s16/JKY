Always good here. Always fresh. No extra charge for cheese on the Shrimp burrito cuz it comes with it. The breakfast burritos are awesome. The lengua is great. I have had no complaints at this location. Their red hot sauce is on point with flavor all the time. We've been to MANY Roberto's in Las Vegas and they all fail compared to this place. Very friendly people who are rude if you don't speak Spanish.
