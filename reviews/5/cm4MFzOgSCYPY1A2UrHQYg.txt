Ahh what can I say about Vaquero's?  Hard to locate, but magnificent. Just to the East of the awesome King Tut's Cafe, it is the number one late night drunken Mexican food place in Tempe. Get the three rolled tacos with cheese.

I recouped many times in the parking lot. Nice people and awesome food. It will make you shit though. Possibly in your pants.
