Can we get a 6th star over here?! I have never been to a location that didn't have a line at noon... Well except here! 

The parking lot is being redone.. People are running late and driving like ass holes.. To get in and no line was amazing to say the very least! And it was not luck! There were close to high 30's of people already eating! The staff is sooooo efficient! They still have a bit of small talk but not much. They move at lightning speeds to get you your lunch and back to work! I am so glad this place is right down the street from work! To put it in perspective of how quickly they got me in and out.. It took me longer to park than to order and pay for my lunch! These employees had all the bins fully stocked before lunch rush and kept things moving! 

Now if one of those efficient people could direct traffic out front that would be great!
