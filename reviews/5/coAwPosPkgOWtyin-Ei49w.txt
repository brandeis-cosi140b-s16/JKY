I had to give this location a few more try"s before updating my review- but it looks like the management really pulled it around. This location has really good drive thru times, excellent customer service and they always give me exxxxtra fire sauce when I ask for it! Yumm! 

I appreciate all of the hard work you guys do- It's like this location is always jam packed-  maybe it's my timing... definitely up to taco bell standards! My go to location :D
