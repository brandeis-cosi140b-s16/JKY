A friend recommended this place and I had to try it. There's taco trucks that are somewhat similar which I love so knew that I'd love this place. It's great that the tacos come with the option of a lettuce wrap. Had the bulgogi taco with lettuce wrap, pork belly taco with corn tortilla and the calamari taco with flour tortilla. All came with slaw. Kimchee was tasty too along with the chips, guacamole and salsa that was included. Hubby had the chimichanga which was huge!! He had to take half of it home. 
Would definitely go back. Have to try the taters, fries and won ton.  Would be interested in franchising this place for California. The website's link to franchise wasn't working. But, this place is a definite hit!
