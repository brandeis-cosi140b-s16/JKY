VEGAN FOOD AVAILABLE upon request.  they didn't even blink.  even ordering at the bar through the bartender got me the perfect vegan meal upon his suggestion! the beans and rice alone were so good that the next day during the basketball tourney i just dropped in for beans and rice to go, and they packed it up to go to take into the arena.  the main dish of a portobello and asparagus fajita was terrific, and they even make fresh guac right at your table.  service was really quick considering they are located right outside the arena and with the tourney they were almost always packed.
