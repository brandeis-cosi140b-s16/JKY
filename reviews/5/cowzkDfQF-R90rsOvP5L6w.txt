Love this place! This is a go-to spot for my friends and I. Every time we are looking for a good happy hour, a fun night out, or just some good Mexican food - this is the perfect place!!! They also  play the best music and have the best environment for dancing. The servers & bartenders are all nice and make sure you have a good time. Definitely check it out, I would recommend the bullgaritas & the tacos.
