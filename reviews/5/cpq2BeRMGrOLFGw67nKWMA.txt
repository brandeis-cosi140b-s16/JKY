Awesome! We had the breakfast burritos, one chorizo and one bacon. Simple ingredients, but packed with flavor. The tortillas were cooked on the flat grill, which I think really changed the flavor of the whole burrito. I love the fact that they cook to order. I don't mind waiting when I know that my food is that fresh. The addition of the salsa bar, which included sliced limes, was a perfect touch. Can't wait to go back!
