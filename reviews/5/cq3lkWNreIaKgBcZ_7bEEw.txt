The Carme Asada burrito is amazing! About twice the price of everything else on the menu, but definitely worth it. High quality meat, and great toppings. You order from the burrito bar where they cook the meat to order and They add beans rice and/or cheese if you want. You then take it to the salsa bar to add your salsa and a few other things, and they wrap it for you.

Food was excellent. Service was great. People were extremely friendly. Great menu (see attached photo of menu).

Downsides: neighborhood is a bit sketchy. Only beans they have are refried.
