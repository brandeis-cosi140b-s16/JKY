The food was great and the service was very friendly.  I have only been once, I had the smothered carnitas burrito, the portion sizes are huge!  The red enchilada sauce was good, not as good as si senior's, but still very tasty. The carnitas was really good.  I will definitely be back to try out something else.  Another great find thanks to yelp!
