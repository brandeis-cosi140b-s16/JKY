Carolina's is my all-time favorite!  My family has eaten here for years.  I go here WAY too much!  I absolutely love all their food.  It is such a great value.  They have the best tortillas in the state.  The #3 Combo is my favorite.   I love their shredded beef tacos, beans, tortillas and salsa.  I never grow tired of it!
