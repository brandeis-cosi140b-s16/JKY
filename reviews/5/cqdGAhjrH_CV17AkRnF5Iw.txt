Very good tacos 
Will be the spot the next time we come to Vegas. Good size for the price (2.25) a lot of meat. You walk in and there is three different spots where you can order your tacos Depending which one you want. We got there and it wasn't so packed but once we started to order it got super busy. Recommend this place oh and they are making the tortillas by hand :)
