I have only had the fish tacos and the ceviche tostadas and they are delish.  I eat here at least once a week and bring the whole family.  Service is always great and their salsa is quite tasty.  I love this place.  I would like to venture out and try the molcajete.  It looks like a lava of cheese.  My food is always great.  My picky kids even love this place.  The fish tacos are my kids favorite.  I think this place is great.  Don't let the fact that it is in Guadalupe scare you!
