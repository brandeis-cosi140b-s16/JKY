I have been going to Jordan's since the mid 1960's and it has been a family institution ever since.  I grew up going for tacos every single Friday.  Birthday's and all family visitors were whisked to Jordan's and thus the traditions began.  I had a server named Lottie for my entire life until she passed away.  Servers stay there and there has to be a reason for that.  The food is "comfort food" and just reminds you of something that you've known your whole life.  My children grew up on Jordan's every time they went to Grandma and PaPa's house.  By the time they left for college, Jordan's was the first stop when I picked them up at Sky HArbor.  Even today, I buy it and take it to all my kids when I leave to go out of town.  I've had to get very creative packing it on the plane.  People who don't "get" Jordan's should go to a tourist trap and be happy.  This is old school and a family restaurant that has made generations of people very happy.  Jordan's holds a very special memory in our family traditions.
