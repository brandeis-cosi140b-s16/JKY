Ever since my go to place broke my heart time after time.  I have been looking searching and eating, I think I got it!  I have been frequenting this place for awhile but just now getting around for a review!  

With that being said this has become 1st choice while looking for a burrito.  

Allways a good sign when you walk in and the music (sung in spanish) is on WAY  to loud the second is the sauces.  My boyfriend continues to punish himself for days after and calls his favorite "I don't think it can be labeled food, how can that be labeled food?!"  But insists I get him 2 sides of it every time I go! I prefer the mild green sauce.  The Burritos and the size of your forearm, HUGE!  But I love lunch the next day.  The meat has the best flavor I have had in awhile mixed with some of the sauce poured on top, YUM! 

There are many other choices but I stick to my usual.   Minimal knowledge of spanish ok and a hungry stomach required!
