Me and my boyfriend had come to AZ for a week and we're staying on downtown phoenix.  We were hungry and love good food so we found el chino on yelp with rave reviews. 
Hopped in the challenger and headed down. At first we each ordered a taco. We didn't think it was a big deal. But wow! That flavor! It was so fresh and so delicious! We moved onto burritos and then more stuff on the menu. The owner, El Chino was an awesome guy. So laid back and helped us venture through the menu. He was a great host. We promised to come back with friends and in that 6 day period of staying in Phoenix we visited el chino 3 times with different groups of friends.  No other place stands the competition. Trust a foodie!
