Big stars for Frank and Lupe not banning me for life. 
After knocking not one but three drinks on the ground, all three producing shards of broken Negro Modelo glass, one would think they'd send a goon squad over to whisk my Winter Beer Festival attending ass out the door, throwing me into the street like the town drunk in some old western movie. 
Nope.
What did they do?
Instead, they bring me replacement drinks free of charge. Go figure. Like I needed any more beer, right?

I suggest ordering the #4 combination dinner. I managed to get a couple bites, (which was pretty damned tasty) but most of it wound up on my white polo shirt.
Weird how white attracts large amounts of Mexican food. I looked like an art-deco work in progress. 

Frank and Lupe, you have a really nice establishment. 
Your food (what I can remember of it) is tasty, and your servers are super polite, but you really should have banned me for life, or at the very least, called the police on me or something. 
Anyways, I'm going to do you guys a big favor and self-impose a "Banned-for-life" on me. 
It's the least I can do to return the favor. 

BTW, we were both lucky I found your receipt in my cargo shorts this morning, otherwise I'd never know the name of the place to ban myself from.
