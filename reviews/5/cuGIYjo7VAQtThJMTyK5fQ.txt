Someburros has been a family favorite of ours since I was born. We have been going to the location in Tempe my whole life. Their shredded beef tacos are divine, their bean cheese burrito is the absolute best! I know what you're thinking, "a bean and cheese burrito is kid stuff, and Taco Bell has ruined them for me." This burrito is perfection. There is nothing else I want to eat than two tacos and a bean and cheese!
