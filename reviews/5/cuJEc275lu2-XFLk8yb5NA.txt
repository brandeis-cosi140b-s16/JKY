Muy delicioso! I will certainly be back to this little joint :-) I only tasted two of their tacos, the carne' asada and the carnitas tacos. I have a feeling lots of items on this menu kick ass! My friend ordered a chicken burrito with no sour cream or guacamole inside and though that is how I personally like it... it 
tasted amazing :-)also, he does not eat beans, so... Guess who scored... Me! Two tacos and beans, I was full and happy :-) go here  & you will not be disappointed.  Bottom line:  good food, service and many options.  Go.
