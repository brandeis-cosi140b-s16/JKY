This place was awesome! My family and I came in after leaving the airport, and I got the three tacos pastor, and they are the BEST pastor tacos I've ever had! And I must say, I'm a little spoiled when it comes to Mexican food after having lived in San Diego for the last 3 years.

This place was a pleasant surprise, and I will definitely be returning and telling my friends about it.
