First time and an awesome experience. Saw them on several billboards and have been wanting to try for a while, finally got the chance today. 

House Margarita, not my speed but my fianc√© loved it 

Queso Fundido, so good, could be a meal in itself 

Shrimp and steak fajitas, best carne I've had in a long time and grass fed which is a huge plus, shrimp are huge and well flavored 

Cheese enchiladas are very cheesy 

Pro tip mix the habanero and green salsa for the perfect blend 

Great service, chef out and about talking with customers ensuring people are happy. All organic, non gmo, farm to table dining next to a strip club, only in Las Vegas. With 50% off on Mondays there's no reason not to go
