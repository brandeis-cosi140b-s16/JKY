Love the Tamale Store even though their hours drive me crazy!

I've tried pretty much all the tamales- my favorite are the Jack and poblano peppers, the green chili chicken and red beef. So tasty and delicious and so stuff full of ingredients. The BF likes the Vegan tamales the most but enjoys all the other ones we buy. 

The tamales are so delicious and so easy to reheat, I've never had an issue with reheating them in the microwave or steamed in a pot. We've even taken them camping and steamed them; which was amazing. I haven't tried their dessert tamales or their salsas, but I look forward to it!

They are not open at the actually store during the weekends as they are off at multiple farmer's market, which I often forget and have to wait to refill our tamale stock until the following Tuesday. Or I get down in time to the farmers market downtown and clean them out of the ones I like best!
