Ok let me preface this by stating that I've only eaten the inexpensive tacos there and they are yummy and awesome especially for the price! Around $2 for each Taco so a couple of them make for a good light meal along with the complimentary chips n salsa. Very warm and competent staff that takes great care of you.
   Perhaps I will try other menu items and report back but for now I'll stick to my favs. I always get excited when I know I'm going there and leave the place all warm and fuzzy. Not too many places like that anymore!
