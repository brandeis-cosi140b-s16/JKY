LOVE this place.  Went for the first time last night and look forward to going back.

We sat on the beautiful rooftop bar and had the Supreme Margarita and the Apple Margarita.  The Apple one was very sweet...which we were told...but was very delicious.  The Supreme one was great.  A little small though...but delicious so I just ordered another!

For food we tried the sushi tacos with Ahi.  YUM. Absolutely delicious.  Totally recommend.  We also had the carne asada which was fantastic.  It came with 3 different sauces - the green chile one (don't remember the exact name) and the jalepeno cream were the best.

I cannot wait to go back here and eat in the garden.  

WOW.  Great atmosphere.  Can't wait to bring friends.
