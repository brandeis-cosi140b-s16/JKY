Went here for the first time yesterday, after having multiple great experiences at this hotels other restaurant, the Normal diner.

I sat at the bar and received great service from the two bartenders working. The leaded margarita was delicious but, it was the food that insures me to write this review. The Papi taco is a must have! If your in the mood for something more filling, both the pollo torts and the cubano are outstanding. One of the best cubano sandwiches I've ever had. 

I will be back!
