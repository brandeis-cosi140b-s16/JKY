It's tucked into the Mad Max-like Mercado, but once you get past that, this is the best Mexican food in this part of town. I've never had a bad meal here - I can't say the same for the far more crowded Los Taquitos down the way. Delicious Carne Asada on thick, tasty tortillas, and salsa with a real kick. It's all I've ever asked for in this world.
