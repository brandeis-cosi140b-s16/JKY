Good Lord, this place is so good.

Found this little gem a year ago while visiting my In-laws who live in Fountain Hills.  They had not yet discovered this place but have since been converted to addicts like me...

Whenever I'm in town I eat here for as many meals as I can... Breakfast, lunch, dinner, late night (they are open til like 4 AM!).

Don't be fooled by the modest location and exterior.  This place has top notch, authentic & very fresh mexican food.  From the carnitas (yum) to the carne asada (awesome) to their fish & shrimp offerings, everything I've had there is delicious.  

Very generous portions from their entrees (their burritos are almost as big as my forearm) to their kids meals (the rolled chicken tacos are fantastic and very filling).

The surf & turf burrito is my current favorite but it's hard to stay away from the shrimp or fish tacos...

You can go ahead and skip Taco Bell because this place is the real deal for about the same price.  By the way, they also serve ice cold bottled beer if you are craving a Corona with your meal...

I love this place so much, I had a picture of me holding one of their burritos as my Facebook profile for a long time...

Can't wait til I can go back on my next visit there!
