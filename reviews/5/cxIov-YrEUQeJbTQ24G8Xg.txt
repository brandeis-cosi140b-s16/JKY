Manuel's is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the Valley. We found it when they started in their 32nd street location. They continue to grow and they are very consistent.  Not sure why some folks have a hard time giving this place a good review. I've been to multiple locations and they are all excellent.  The margaritas are great and all of the food is great.  The Pollo Especial is excellent, but my favorite is the Fiesta Platter. I always suggest this restaurant to folks going to Arizona.
