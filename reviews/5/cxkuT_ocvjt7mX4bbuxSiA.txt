This was a lot smaller inside than I expected but they have a patio I will definitely check out when it's cooler. Came on a Tuesday at 5:30 and told we had a 20 minute wait but it ended up more like 45 minutes. Not a big deal since we brought our drinks outside. The margaritas tasted fresh and are on special for $5 on Tuesdays along with tacos. I'll be coming back!
