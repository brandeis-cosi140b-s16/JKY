Chuy's is AWESOME!!! Guess what's even more awesome besides the food...THOMAS, one of the servers!

First of all, the decor is fantastic. The hostess was perky and friendly. As mentioned before, Thomas was an incredible server. He made sure our chips were frequently refilled, gave great suggestions, and kept a genuine smile on his face. 

Ok, enough about the cute server. 

The food! It was super delicious! I got the Chuy's special which was composed of blue corn tortillas filled with roasted chicken, covered in tomatillo sauce and topped with sour cream. Delish! The side sauce of creamy jalapeno was also a great addition. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita...it was extra yummy. 

I'm glad Chuy's has arrived. The place is massive, and while I LOVE Cowfish, having Chuy's right beside it as a marvelous alternative is pretty sweet. Not that Chuy's is just an alternative to Cowfish... 

Ok, what are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go!
