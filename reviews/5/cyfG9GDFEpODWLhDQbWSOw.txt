I live in the SoMo area and I remember waiting (patiently) for Gorda's Baja Taco to open.  Well, it's been a few year since it opened and it's been worth the wait.  I absolutely love Gorda's.  First of all, the staff is incredible.  I feel like Gorda's is my Cheers...they always greet me by name and sometimes start making my order before I even get all the way to the register.  

Now, on to the food.  Everything I've had is great.  I can be a picky eater; however, I know that whatever I get taste fresh and homemade.  these recipes are not downloaded from the internet!
  
Must haves: Carne Asada Burrito is my favorite.  the meat is fresh, tender and peppery.  something to note: the burrito's here are HUGE! you could split one between two people.  Pork adobada tacos are amazing.  they are in the vein of street tacos and they are delicious.  The carne asada fries are also amazing, but you might want to share them!

Gorda's has a great salsa bar that has three different types of salsa, onions, cilantro and carrots/cucumbers.  The salsa is top-notch and you get to use as much as you want.  

I have taken friends, co-workers and family to Gorda and everyone loves it!
