As soon as I land in Phoenix, I go straight to Los Betos.  Having lived there for about a year, it was a staple.  Now that I am gone to the East Coast, I can only DREAM about their delicious breakfast burritos.  

I have read the other reviews, and all I can say that anyone who complains just doesn't appreciate the gem they have there.  Is it a pantheon of hygiene, no...but it is a drive through Mexican restaurant that is open 24 hours a day - if you want high class and floors that you can eat off - there are plenty five star restaurants in Scottsdale.  Also, as one with food allergies and a penchant for getting food poisoning - I have never, in ten years, gotten sick once from Los Betos.

Be warned - one burrito is like a pillow, and the red hot sauce is divine and will knock your socks off with spice.   It is a lot of food - but it is worth the calories and the salsa stains.  The staff are also always pleasant.

In all - my only complaint is that it is so far away from where I live now!

The address of the one I love is on the way to the airport or near Fashion Square - at
