I'll recap the last minute of my life for you: I polished off my burrito and immediately texted Boyfriend to tell him that we never have to go to Roberto's ever again. This place is that good.

The restaurant is big and open, with plenty of little tables. It's very clean. 

I was greeted when I walked in and was given a minute to look at the menu, without pressure. The menu is small, which I like in a place like this. Granted, I only looked at the burrito options, but this is how it works: they have all the different Mexican food formats (burritos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, etc). So you pick your format, then you pick your meat (there are like 8 meats to choose from, which is awesome). The prices are based on the format, not the meat, which is a breath of fresh air. My decision came down to toppings. The Super Burrito has pinto beans, your meat, pico de gallo, sour cream and guac. The regular burrito has just beans, meat and pico. I chose a regular carnitas burrito.

To. Die. For. This is definitely a quality vs. quantity thing. The burrito isn't huge, but enough to fill you up. The tortilla was warm and pliable and didn't even think about falling apart mid-meal. The beans were..beans. Not much you can do with those. The pico was delicious (heavy on the onion, just like I like it!). The carnitas was killer. Moist meat with crispy bits from the grill. At the bottom of the burrito was my favorite part: that delicious meat/bean/pico soup that collects down there. YUM! As if that was not enough, I sampled both of their hot sauces: the red "hot" and the green "mild". The hot wasn't "grab a glass of milk" hot, more of a smokey, pleasant heat. The green salsa was my favorite! It seems to be a puree of cilantro, onion and maybe some garlic. Like pureed chimichurri...heaven!

Super friendly, super fast service with really, really tasty food. I couldn't ask for anything more!
