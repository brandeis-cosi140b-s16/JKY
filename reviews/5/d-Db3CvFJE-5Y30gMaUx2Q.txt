Love this place!!! It's right across the street from my house. The XL Asada burrito is awesome, The Carne Asada is juicy and sooo flavorful, hand cut while you wait. I also got  America's corn and some street tacos! I absolutely love the corn, at first the idea of mayo on the corn put me off but it's amazing, especially with the cotina cheese and sauce they put on it. i love that they give you a lil baggie of cucumbers and radishes with your order, it comes in handy to clean your palate after some of the salsa. My friend had a Margarita but I had to try the Horchata.....so good, just the right amount of sweet, cinnamon and it was ice cold!!! Can't wait to go again
