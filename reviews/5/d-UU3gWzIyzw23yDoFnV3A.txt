I've been eating here going on 10 years now. Their food is consistently good. The salsa ranchera is fantastic, roasted jalapeños and pickled jalapeños with carrots and cauliflower are the best. The standouts are the 7 seas soup, goat tacos, and carne asada tacos. I wish they would ad pasole to the menu.
