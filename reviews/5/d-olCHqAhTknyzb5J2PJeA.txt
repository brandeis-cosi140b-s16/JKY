I lived in San Diego for 8 years and LA for 9 more.  This place is indeed Socall mex food.  The prices are on par with the non-chain mexican food restaurants places in San Diego, and the quality is just as good too.  I am really glad this restaurant is here in Pittsburgh.   Keep up the great food, kind service, and salsa.  If you want to take this place for a spin, then just try the bean and cheese burrito... simple perfection.  My kids love it here too.  The staff lets the kids order a bunch of fried fish and french fries a la carte... excellent.
