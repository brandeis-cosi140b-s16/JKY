I am vegan and love this spot! We usually order a vegan burrito or vegan fajitas etc. I just have to be clear about not having any cheese/cream/lard/chicken stock etc. I am always disappointed with my drinks at other establishments because they rig the liquor, but I have never had an issue with my drinks at Cabo Wabo. Nice outdoor patio overlooking the strip, great chips 'n salsa, and tasty drinks! Yum!

Tip: We purchase 20% off coupons at the nearby kiosks for like $2 and usually get our photo taken while eating that comes with another 20% off coupon!
