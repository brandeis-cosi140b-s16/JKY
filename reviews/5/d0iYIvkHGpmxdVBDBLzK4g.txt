I have eaten here many times in the past year or so and it has quickly become my favorite Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is always very clean and service is always fast.  I've had everything from tacos to enchiladas to fajitas and everything is delicious with good quality ingredients.  My only complaint is that the salsa a little too spicy for my taste, but it still has a good flavor.  I love the fact the the dishes with ground beef are not dripping with grease, which is my biggest complaint at other Mexican restaurants.  I even brought my mom, who isn't the biggest Mexican fan, and she loved it.  The restaurant is always packed at lunch, and usually deserted in the evening.  But don't let a lack of customers stop you.  The food is still always cooked fresh.  I highly recommend and hope this place is able to stay open for a long time.
