Authentic Mexican food doesn't get better than this. The beans are delicious, service is prompt and the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle is what I fantasize about when I wake up on a weekend morning. I usually get the Nana's Special nearly every time we're there for breakfast. Green or red chile, it's all great. It's consistently yummy and warm chips will keep you content until your order is up. Lately I've been ordering the #3 Red Burrito lunch special with rice and beans for $6 and change. The Red chile reminds me of being a little kid at a school fiesta. Mmmm.

The only downside is that we miss Manuel, our favorite waiter, who moved away! He memorized our orders exactly and had the best personality. But the rest of the staff are pretty damn good too though.

When we were married a couple of weeks ago, last minute we decided to change the menu and so we called La Canasta to get a quote for dinner for 80 people. When I say last minute I mean 3 days notice. We got a great price, excellent customer service from Richard, and a ton of compliments from all of our guests. Seriously, when was the last time you heard about people liking wedding food?
