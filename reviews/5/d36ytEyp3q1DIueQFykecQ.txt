Found out about this restaurant on yelp on our drive back to California. This place is small and deceivingly good! The owner is very nice & friendly. The food was delicious and authentic. Homemade enchilada sauce and guacamole. The special for today, camarones rancheros, was amazing! The price was very reasonable too! Definitely worth giving a try!
