What a wonderful addition to Madison!  I wasn't super hungry when I stopped in today, but by the time I left, I had eaten 5 extremely delicious tacos. My favorites were the shrimp tacos, fish tempura, and pulled pork. Wonderful combination of flavors!  I will definitely be back to explore more if the menu!!
