This is a legit taco shop with the best tacos! The meat and toppings are always fresh! The red salsa is to die for! If you haven't tried mulitas yet, YOU MUST. they're two taco tortillas and in between them is your choice of meat, melted cheese, pieces of avocado & onion! One order of mulitas comes with 3! =) This is the only GOOD taco shop that I've been to where tacos are still under $2. If you want to have real taco shop tacos,  come here. All of their other food is good as well. Tip: if you ever need a taquiza for parties, they do it as well! I had them for my party and everybody was asking me where these tacos were from! They are generous with their meat, and don't just try to fill you up with tortillas like some other taquizas.
