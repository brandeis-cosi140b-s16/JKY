I went to Moes last night and had a great experience. I ordered my usual homewrecker with steak and a side of queso but this time was different.
The food the was great but the customer service was over the top! The employees were constantly checking on the guest and even refilled my drink for me. I go to a lot of Moes in Charlotte but the Moes in Southpark here at Sharon corners is absolutely the best the restaurant is consistently clean and the food is always fresh and the employees act like they want to be there. I will be back and I recommend everyone to go to the Moes in Southpark it's actually clean and the food taste great!
