THERE'S NOTHING NOT TO LIKE

Grab yourself a table or seat at the counter and watch your meal be prepared in front of your eyeballs. One small Caesar Salad with sweet tart dressing, bowl of chicken gumbo and lobster-shrimp etouffee and I'm transporting myself back to N'awlins. Chicken was ordered mild and Yu-go chauffeur's etouffee at medium spicy hot.

Ideal for the healthy appetite wanting for spicy enticing Cajun style home cooking. We saved more than half of our two meals for repeat performance at home..
