After watching Man vs Food, there was no way we were about to let another weekend go by without checking out this place! About a 5 minute drive from our place, we arrived around 7pm on a Friday night... it took us 10 minutes to find parking! That was our first indication it was going to be good! We were promptly seated in a cozy, nothing fancy table. Families to our left, couples to our right, Marc Anthony special blaring from the TVs, get the picture?
This is one of the only places in Phoenix I've been to that doesn't serve alcohol, it didn't take away from the experience at all, but a good thing to know before going. 
Our tortas were awesome awesome awesome! So reasonable, tasty, authentic. 
Will be back again soon =)
