When I first looked at the menu, my mouth watered, my eyes began to widen...they had Hoegaarden on tap! My fav beer from my days living in Belgium, I just had to have one. Of course, the person I was with promptly ordered three shots of patron, one for each of us and our waitress. You can always spot a kickass place if the wait staff will take a shot with you. Well, we got em and shot em. She did too. Already, this place was up there on my list.

I had the mushroom tamale dinner and it was so good. The rice and beans are perfect, not over cooked like some are. The food was screaming hot when it was dropped which was a good sign it was right off the grill. The open kitchen area made you feel like a part of the restaurant, like you were there cooking right along beside the chefs. The bar has a ton to select from and the cooks are happy to chat with you and hang with you while they're making whatever delicious delight you ordered. Great experience, great company, great food.
