What more can I say that has not already been said in other reviews...This place is by far the best as far as fast mexican food goes and in fact, I will take it over most sit down chains as well, like mi amigo's. 

Senor Taco is much better than Filberto's (and I do like them as well) because the prices are pretty much the same and Senor Taco seems to just use better ingredients. The burrito's are huge and I have never had a less than superb one. I like the shrimp burrito and my wife salivates over the mere though of their bean and cheese burrito.

I have also had the fish tacos and it is in fact, something to write home about. I also really like their chips. For under $2 you can get a decent sized bag of really good chips and their salsa bar is a million times better than filly b's.

All in all, you can't go wrong here, 5 stars for sure.
