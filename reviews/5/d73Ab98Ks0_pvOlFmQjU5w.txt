This place is awesome! They even have a breakfast menu served in the morning til noon. I haven't tried their breakfast but definitely will be coming back. I got the chicken burrito with the green sauce. Their portions are big and delicious. Mario was my server and he gave me 5 star customer service! He was helpful in recommending what items to order. They were attentive and refilled my water. Restaurant atmosphere was fun and friendly. It was also clean. Definitely recommend if you live in Vegas or visiting to check this place out!!
