Arriba!  Good food excellent atmosphere.  I love that this place has all of the good Mexican menu standards done well; but what makes this restaurant really good is that they go the extra mile to set the scene for your meal.  The restaurant's atmosphere gives you a sense that you may have left Charlotte for just a moment.  That said, after a few of their Margahretas you might actually swear you are south of the border - and I am not talking about South Carolina!
