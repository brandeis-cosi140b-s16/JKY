This is my family's favorite Mexican restaurant. I always order the bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with red sauce. Both their red and green enchilada sauces are awesome. Their chips and salsa are my favorite as well. The chips are typically very fresh and come out warm and the salsa is unbeatable.

The restaurant is well lit as well as acceptably clean. The staff is generally attentive to your needs as well. Other members of my family order the chili relleno combo and their "Robert's tacos" combo. The food always comes out in a timely manner as well. 

For those like me that care, they do have a drive through and carry Pepsi products. Overall it's a great restaurant with a rich Arizona history! 5/5
