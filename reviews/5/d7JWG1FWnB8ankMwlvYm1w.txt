We had lunch at this restaurant the day after Christmas this year and everything we ordered was very good. We had ceviche with tostadas, coctel de camaron, camarones aguachiles, caldo 7 mares, caldo de camaron, and a variety of kids menu items.  As you can imagine, our party was pretty big, and the waitresses did an awesome job at accommodating us and providing us with everything we needed.
