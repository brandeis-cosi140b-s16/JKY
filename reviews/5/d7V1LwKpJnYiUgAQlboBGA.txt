We went here tonight for the first time on a whim and we will definitively will be going back. So what sets this apart from other burger places besides the GREAT service? The pickled onions totally made the burger spectacular. And lets not forget about the sweet potato tater totes. Since the kids ate their burger and tacos in minutes, we agreed to allow them to have a milkshake which were awesome too. When we left, the kids asked when we can go back there again and we agreed we would come back soon even though it is a little of a drive for us!!
