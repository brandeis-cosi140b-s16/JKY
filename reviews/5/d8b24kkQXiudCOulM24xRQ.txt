well well well, now these tacos are not just good, they are gnikcuf delicious. i came here my first time about a year ago and boy oh boy was i nervous taking street food from a chicago fan. But i was in heaven, these tacos are so good i drive all the way from sahara and hollywood to enjoy them. the owner is a nice guy, he loves talking about mma which is cool because he keeps with the now. with that said, go give these tacos and the other items he has a try. and when you grab the fries, have him dust a little extra of his secret seasoning salt on em..bbboooommmbbbbbbb
