I was a little hesitant when trying this place out. I'm a vegetarian and going to restaurants that are favored by meat eaters aren't always my "go to". 

I ordered the veggie empanada and the quinoa avocado bowl. Both were extremely delicious and satisfying.

I will definitely be back, and you should all give it a try!!!
