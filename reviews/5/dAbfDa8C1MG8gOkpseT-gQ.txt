Not sure what Bonnie expected after she wrote, "not much content."  We eat here about twice a month and they don't skimp.  As you can see from my previous review, there are enough for me to eat at least 2 meals. I am over 6' tall and I don't eat light a bird either.  We had the Mexican pizza for the second time now.  Whoa, it has two tortillas with toppings piled about 2" high. I love that it has a whole olive on each slice, and a bunch of guacamole. My husband and I shared for a meal dinning in and took half home to share for another meal at home.  THAT IS 4 portions.  It comes with 8 slices, so it could easily be an appetizer for 8 people.
