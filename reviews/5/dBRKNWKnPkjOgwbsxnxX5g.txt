Simply put - if you don't think this is 5-star food I don't know what to tell you.  Salsa bar is amazing and had things I've never seen before - and it was amazing.  If I could only drink and eat chips and salsa , I'd still give it 5-stars.  Tons of taco options. Their quesadillas are more like empanadas and fried (super delicious.)  Go here...and prepare to come back often...
