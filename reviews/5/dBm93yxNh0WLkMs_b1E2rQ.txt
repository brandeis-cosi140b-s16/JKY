Is there a rule about New Mexican Restaurants needing a water feature to pass on the way in?!?! I was just wondering because I am noticing a theme....hmmm.
My BFF and I went here for dinner the other night. He was in the mood for some beef stew and I was along for the ride. We started with their take on chicken empanada's and I thought they were ok, not amazing. They had an interesting white sauce that kind of reminded me of cauliflower, which might have been what it was...lol
I decided to go with the platter that came with a chicken enchilada covered in green Chile sauce, I will be honest, I was not impressed with this and left most  of it on the plate...but the good news was this was not the selling feature of the plate. It also came with a Carne Adovada burrito with red sauce, it was very well flavored and extremely tasty, I loved every bite. And don't forget the Chile relleno with cheese and pork that was extremely tender and very flavorful! I'm a big chile relleno fan, and would definitely order it again!
The beans and rice were pretty good, and everything had that New Mexican spice...Not too hot, but enough spice to satisfy!
We also splurged this night and got the Sopa Basket, we are not huge honey fans, so we asked what else we could have and they offered warm butterscotch sauce, which was so good we contemplated drinking it...although we didn't give in to our desire!
I am looking forward to returning and having the Carne Adovada plate next time!
