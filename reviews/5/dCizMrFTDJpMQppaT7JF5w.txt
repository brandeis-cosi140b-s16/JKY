This is one of my most favorite places in Vegas.  The Chicken tacos are incredible.  It looks a little rough, but I'm staring to realize that places that don't look necessarily "sterile" are usually busy cooking up delicious food in the back, so cleaning is 2nd.  It's pretty off the strip and you don't go through the best side of town to get there, but do it anyway.  When's the next time you'll be in Vegas?  might as well venture off the strip a little.
