I ordered three tacos of the owner's choice: beef/pork combo, steak and chorizo. The tacos were simple, not overly garnished and the flavors distinct. They were all delicious and under six bucks.

I ended up eating a fourth fish taco that was my personal favorite. It came with a very light lime mayo sauce that set off the well cooked fish perfectly.

Chips were average, but the salsa was well spiced and flavorful.

We started off the only patrons and were immediately seated by the owner. He was very friendly and helpful, explained the menu and a little about the way they do things. He was more than happy to pick my food for me and made great choices. We also recieved our food almost immediately. Couldn't recommend any more highly.
