Not that Zaba's needs help, their food speaks for itself, but this location is awesome. One of the managers and one of the girls that transferred from the Silverado location are so personable. They always ask how we've been and when we havent been in, in while, they notice! Its nice to have a spot that they actually remember who you are and seemingly actually care and you arent just another customer. And of course we love the food!
