This is my new favorite place for Mexican food.  You can tell immediately that the ingredients are fresh and of the highest quality.  The recipes definitely have a more personal and traditional taste, than the cookie cutter offerings that you get from the chain stores like Chipotle and Qdoba.  There's also a really casual and friendly vibe that make you feel welcomed.  I'm a big proponent of supporting local businesses and when you have a place like this, that obviously cares about their product and especially about their clients, it's really easy to do.  This is my Friday night spot.
