This place is a hidden gem.  I found this on Yelp and the reviews were pretty good so we decided to give it a try.

On Thursday they had from 12 to 3pm Happy Hour for food no alcohol is served here....

For $11.99 per person they had all you can eat Pork Mole or Beef with Potatoes with all the fixings of course to include chips and salsa.  Even though it was close to 4 when we arrived, they still offered this to us.  We did not take the all you can eat as we wanted to try other stuff from the menu.

Chips and salsa was brought to the table and it was good.  We ordered our food and while waiting for our food, the server brought us a sample of the Pork Mole and the Beef with Potatoes.  Both were pretty good, it was homemade and made with love and very traditional.  

We had tacos and Enchilada's.  The sauce is a sauce like you would find more in Northern Mexico.  Southern Mexico tends to make their sauces a little sweeter.  

The tacos were good as well as the enchilada's, however the chicken is a combination of moist and over cooked meaning it was really dry, but you did not get that in every bite.

Our server told us on Wednesday they will have Taco Happy Hour, which is all you can eat tacos.  She was not real sure on the price so it will be between $9 and $12, thats the window.

I recommend giving this place a try, everything we had was good, it was only the chicken I found to be a little dry, but otherwise I would go here again.  I like family owned mom and pop places and they do not sacrifice traditional cooking for the American Way.  This is what you will find in their native land whether is be Mexican or Salvadorian style food.  THIS I LIKE and is why I will go back.
