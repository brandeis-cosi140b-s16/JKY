I love this place. Everything about it makes it fun, entertaining, and satisfying! The ambiance of the restaurant isnt dimmly lit and boring, it is open and filled with people. Ask for a window seat, you will be viewing the entire Vegas valley, and if you time it right you can see the sunset. The salsa and chips they serve you are prompt and authentico, mmm,

Margaritas, delicious and they dont skimp out on the alcohol!
I recommend the table side made guacamole. There is nothing better than frech guac, and I am in looove. 

My friends and I usually share plates because their portions are so huge. I have had the burrito bionico and a few other stuff that I dont recall, probably because I didnt order it.. 


All in all, great & authentic Mexican food that is full of flavor and size. Great staff. Great environment.
