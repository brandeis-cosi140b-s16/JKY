Best New Mexican spot in town. Recently discovered this place and the food is amazing. Get the street tacos or Chipotle Chicken.

If Juan is working, have him stir you up a Cadillac margarita or "The Alejandro" from the specialty drink menu.

Also ask him how he has the cook make carnitas special. 

Finally. GET THE CORN IF ITS THE ONLY THING YOU EVER DO.

-Vito and Stef out.
