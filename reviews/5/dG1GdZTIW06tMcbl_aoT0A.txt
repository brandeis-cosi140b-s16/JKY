We went for happy hour and to check out the place. WOW! Cool that we felt that we were at a small resort. They had live music playing during happy hour and its not even season yet!

Selected food and all drinks are half off during HH. Thats one of the best deals in the valley, BAR NONE. 

Their wine list is decent enough althoug its really built on CA wines that everybody can buy in the grocery stores. But at least they are drinkable (compared to other bars). My husband liked the beer selection though.

Will be back, and for sure when the weather is nicer so we can see what the pool is really used for!
