Muy fantastico!!!  Mr. Triny is a very friendly guy and sells some of the best Mexi hotdogs. $3 a dog is a great price. Stop by, say hi and wave to the passing cars! They don't know what they're missing!!

Update.......  After 1.5 years, the dogs are now $3.50 and STILL kick @ss!! Crispy bacon on the dog, messy and delicious!
