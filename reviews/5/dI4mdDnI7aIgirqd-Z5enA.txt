This place is amazing, and, despite it obviously being a Yelp darling, it never felt like it when I was there.  That's a good thing.  

My buddy and I ate there three nights in a row during a recent trip.  Two late, late night trips and one early night trip.  

The food was consistently great all three nights.  The tacos are freshly prepared using obviously fresh ingredients and taste delicious.  I can't say I've had better and certainly not in Vegas.  

The place draws a crowd, but it's equipped to handle it, and the lines move quick.  Pay for your food, find a seat, and enjoy.  

Douches and hipsters, and especially hipster douches, you wouldn't like it.
