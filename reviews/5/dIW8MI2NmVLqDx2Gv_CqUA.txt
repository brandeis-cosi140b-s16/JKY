I've been eating Rito's since I was a little girl. My mom and I would go pick up my older sister from work and on the way home grab some burritos for dinner. We would get all different kinds including the red chile, green chile, bean burritos and occasionally tostadas and tacos. We'd head home to my dad coming from work and my 2 sisters, brother, my mom, dad and I would half up the burritos between us sharing and delighting in the food.

My sister we would pick up has now passed. Towards the end of her battle with cancer all she wished for was a burrito from Rito's. I live in California currently and no other place has held a candle to Rito's in my heart. Because of the wonderful childhood memories I have of this place and for always being so friendly and being consistently good I give Rito's 5 stars and a heart. My sister I'm sure would agree
