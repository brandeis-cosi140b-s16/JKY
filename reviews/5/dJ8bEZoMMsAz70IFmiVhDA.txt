This is the best Mexican food in the valley. 

The food is true Mexican food too therefore it's NOT covered with tons of cheese (which ruins good Mexican food in my opinion). Staff was good - it's mainly self serve and they call your number when the food is ready.

We ordered chips and salsa, horchada, carne asada plate, and the red tamales - all for about $20.

This place is going to be our "go to" when we are craving Mexican food.
