I've been going to Burrito Express since I was in high school. The food is always prepared quickly, and they even offer delivery. The red sauce is amazing, and I haven't tried a single burrito I haven't liked! The prices are more than affordable, the atmosphere is great, and the place is super clean. 

Definitely recommend!
