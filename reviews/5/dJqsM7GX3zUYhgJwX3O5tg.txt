This place is awesome! It's closer to me than Macayos, the service was better and it's brand new so much cleaner. The chips and salsa come with bean dip. Yum! I got chicken tacos, and everything comes with rice and beans which is a huge plus. The tacos have bell peppers which aren't spicy, with feta cheese. The chicken was amazing, and I loved the spin on ingredients! I'll be back soon.
