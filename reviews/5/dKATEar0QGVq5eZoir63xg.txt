I have no regrets ! . I had been to manuels mexican food the day before for lunch and had the same thing I ordered today . For an actual cheaper price and better quality Macayos delivered!

I ordered a basic cheese crisper with grilled chicken and it came out hot and really cheesy. And it was 9.95. 
 Manuels yesterday it was 8.95 WITHOUT chicken and seemed to barely have cheese ..

Our server was great ! He refilled our drinks every 3 min or every time we took a drink , braught multiple bowls of chips and salsa . And checked to see if we needed anything.
