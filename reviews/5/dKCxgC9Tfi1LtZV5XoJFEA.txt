I was sick!  I came home with leftovers!  I would do this again and again!  This was the best!  I was told to come here from a friend and man was it the right choice!  The food was outstanding.  The only complaint is I only had one sitting.  The Suckling pork was great, but funny enough not the best.  The four of us had ordered apps, salads and soups and main courses, and had to stop on each serving to take it home, and we still had more to take home when all was said and done.  The spinach salad was to die for and I will be trying to make that at home.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the steak was cooked perfectly and the service was fantastic!  In fact, I read reviews before I left expecting less and got way more!  This morning we are making Suckling Pork omelets and for lunch, making steak sandwiches.  If you read anything about this place that is negative, then try it again - again, you can B*&^h, about places all day long, but really - good food is subjective, but well crafted food is unusual.  This placed - more so for a hotel restaurant, deserves a 5 star rating.  

As for being a personal Zagat or Berlitz reviewer, people take Yelp way to serious on all the details.  Sure - you can find this or that to complain about and knock a star or three off, but in the end, honestly try to read reviews with a grain of salt and get out and try new places.  We do and wow - we loved it!  Again - enjoy your time here and make this one of the stops you go to.
