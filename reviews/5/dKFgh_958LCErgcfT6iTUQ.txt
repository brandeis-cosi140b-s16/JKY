Yummy food. Large portions. Friendly service. Clean. I had the tostada ceviche mixta. It was "muy grande!" I initially ordered two, thankfully she only brought one. It was huge.

My wife had the molcajete res. it was very big, and yummy.




I don't get why people on here complain that a Mexican restaurant is like a Mexican restaurant. It's not Taco Bell. The sign says authentico , so expect loud music, especially if there are mariachis that night. There were none on my visit.

To the complaints about not taking credit cards, there are old looking visa/MasterCard stickers on the doors. I used my card. I am not sure what the deal with that is.
