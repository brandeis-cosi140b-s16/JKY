I have been to this little taco shop a couple. Both times I have been highly satisfied with the food. It can take a minute to make since the place can get busy, especially at lunch time. However the food is worth the wait! It's cheap, filling, and tasty! It's also nice that the place is open early so that you can get your breakfast burritos, but also open late so that if you are craving a burrito you can still get one!
