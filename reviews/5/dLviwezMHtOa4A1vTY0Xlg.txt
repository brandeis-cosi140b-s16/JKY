This restaurant is awesome! I was very impressed with the restaurant all together! The decor immediately caught my eye! The atmosphere was fun & energetic & the staff was very friendly. The menu offers Mexican food options, Chinese food options, or the fusion of both. They have great presentation with their plates, top-notch service, & the portions are reasonable whether you want to share or be a little stingy. The food was delicious & interesting. I enjoyed having dinner here, mostly because of the great overall experience I had. If you're looking for a good time in an energetic environment with great service & delicious food, this is the place to go!
