Better than Roberto's, also the only tamales in town I actually like. Wife loves the tacos al carbon. Prices are on point as well. The only reason this place isn't more popular is because of the akward drive thru, but less line to wait through for those who've discovered it :) It's funny to me that this is right next to Taco Bell. That's actually the reason we ended up trying it haha. Be back soon!
