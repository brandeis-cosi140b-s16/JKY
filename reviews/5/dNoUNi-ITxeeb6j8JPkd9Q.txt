I only have one warning about this restaurant.  The food is so amazing that you cannot eat Mexican food anywhere else.  My wife had the shrimp fajitas which huge shrimp and were cooked perfectly.   I had chicken and beef enchiladas which had homemade corn tortillas and the most tender meat I had ever tasted.  Pair it up with the margarita special and I was a happy camper.  I will be a customer for life here!
