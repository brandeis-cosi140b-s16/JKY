What can I say I love this bar! wait a minute thats a different place. well just the same  I have spent many hours here people are friendly bartenders are sweet and very quick to serv you at the bar. at the tables it takes a bit longer but not to terrible. The food is better then average and the portions are big. happy hour is decent at best.
