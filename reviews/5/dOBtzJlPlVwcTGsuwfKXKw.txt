We have been looking for a good sit down Mexican place in the area and saw El Burrito from the road. We decided to try it out after reading some Yelp reviews, and I am glad we did. We have been twice so far, and the food has been great. The chips and salsa are delicious, the salsa in particular has a nice little kick and a deep tomatoey flavor - though it should be noted that they are not complimentary.

I also really enjoyed how they offer small tasting dishes, the first time we received mini tacos and the second time a soup. Great idea to open up people to the other options on the menu.

My wife ordered the Mexican tacos with ground beef (with cilantro and onions) and loved them, and I got the quesadilla norteno, which was very well made. Others in our party ordered tacos with chorizo, which they said was the best they've had, so I'll have to try it next time we're there.
