Okay: I ate there right before Christmas, and I ate a root vegetable taco topped with a sunny-side up quail egg and a juicy flank steak chimichurri taco loaded with sprigs of fresh cilantro.  Usually, I HAVE to have a black-eyed pea taco (an underdog deelish on the menu), but I couldn't resist some of the tempting new menu choices.  Outstanding!  Took my parents with me on this occasion and they were equally as pleased with their meals.

The menu changes seasonally so I return to try new yums every so often.

Another reviewer made a snide remark about the bartenders' appearance, and I'm not sure why.  They are completely professional, knowledgeable and dare I say.. attractive- people.  Perhaps because over half the waitstaff is significantly tattooed?  Whatever. The service here matches the food in quality.
