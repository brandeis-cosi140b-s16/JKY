I was here on 6/19 and ate 3 tacos at the counter. Somehow I found the willpower to not consume any more delicious tacos and the strength to actually leave the tacqueria and not make it my permanent residence. If you're lucky enough to live or work nearby you may find yourself here often - I saw a few people picking up tacos to go. I look forward to seeing how their partnership with the bar next door works, too, since they don't serve alcohol.
