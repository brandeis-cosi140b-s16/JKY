What a great surprise!  Stopped in for a quick bite while traffic calmed down and found a gem of a restaurant.  My husband had the chicken chipotle chimichanga (which he loved) and I had tacos. The corn tortillas for the tacos are homemade and delicious!  The waiter was very friendly and brought us various salsas to try.  They were all so fresh and fantastic!  We had the strawberry cake for dessert and it melted in our mouth.  We will definitely be back.... soon!
