This is by far my favorite restaurant in Anthem!  I definitely recommend if you're in the mood for some great Mexican food, since everything I've had the chance to try has been delicious! The staff was very friendly and approachable, especially when I asked for substitutions due to dietary restrictions.  Overall, a great restaurant with great food!
