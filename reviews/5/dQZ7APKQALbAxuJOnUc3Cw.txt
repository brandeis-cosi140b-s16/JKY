AHHHHHHHHH!!! I AM SO HAPPY!! 

I literally used to have to drive for 20 min. to get to the location on Charleston but now they opened one more south which is super convenient for me since I could just go straight down Tropicana road on the way to work if I am craving some mexican food!!

The outer appearance for this location seems to be a LOT more inviting though ahhaha. The interior is also clean just like the other location. They have a counter top where you could sit & enjoy your food while they make the food. Once thing I liked about the other location was being able to see EVERYTHING without having to TRY to look over a counter. 

Service is great for this location as well greeting you with a smile & the guy that was making my food even bothered to have a conversation with me while I was sitting watching my food being made.

Food was delicious as I got my usual selections. I was a LITTLE disappointed with my CARNE ASADA BURRITO - it literally seemed like there was only meat in it... usually there would be a good amount of guacamole. pico de gayo. & cheese but it lacked these things which made it seem a little Bland. 

CARNE ASADA FRIES - delicious & served with FAT fries. Each bite had a little bit of everything when mixed which in my opinion is to be considered a good Carne Asada fries.

MEXICAN STREET CORN - packed with cheese & sprinkled chili powder

Overall I crave it & if you can make me crave something it is well worth 5 stars from me! Plus their AGUA FRESCA selections are PERFECT for the HOT HOT summer days coming our way here in Vegas! =]
