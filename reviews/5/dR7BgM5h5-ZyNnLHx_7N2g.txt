This is where we met up to start our taco trek UYE and the best of our stops in my opinion. I was so impressed watching them making fresh flour tortillas right on the truck! Nice! The line was long at Sinaloa so I found that to be a good sign. Sinaloa offers a variety of tacos, burritos, mulitas, tortas and quesadillas. Here are some of the current prices:

*Tacos*
- Asada (beef), Al Pastor (marinated pork), Cabeza (head), Chorizo (pork beef) are $1.50 each 
- Lengua (tongue), Tripa ( intestines) are $2 each.  

*Burritos, Tortas and Quesadillas* 
- Regular $5
- Lengua $6.50
- Tripa $6.50

I decided to try a "Al Pastor Taco" and after ordering it took about 10 minutes for my taco. They make everything you order from scratch so it might take an extra minute, but it is worth it. The fresh tortilla is worth it alone! The pastor had great flavor. My hubby noticed the condiment bar (salsas, sliced cucumber, etc.) right next to where you order, but I didn't see it! I think there were too many people standing in front of it for me to notice. While I watched my hubby make a Mexican flag with sauce across his 2 tacos, I was glad to just have the cilantro/onion mix on my taco. The pastor had such good flavor that it really didn't need anything more then a good fresh tortilla wrapped around it. 

They have Coca-Cola in glass bottles (score!) and there is even a hot dog cart right next to the truck. I don't get the hot dog cart, but there were a decent amount of kids eating hot dogs so whatever works!
