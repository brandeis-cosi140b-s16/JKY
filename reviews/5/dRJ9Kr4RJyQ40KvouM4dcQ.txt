We came here today after a long day at the park.  There was a long line but the staff was very fast.

I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans, rice, sour cream and I had them add grilled veggies and extra hot sauce. The burrito was hot, huge and delicious.  The only negative was that the last several bites were all rice.  
Great healthy meal to soak up the beer though.
