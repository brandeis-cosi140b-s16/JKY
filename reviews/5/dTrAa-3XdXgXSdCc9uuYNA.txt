I just got done wolfing down a chili relleno burrito...that  was so AMAZING I looked here to see what everyone else thought but was shocked to see I am the 1st to review here!
According to the bag my food was in there are 10 locations.  I guess that makes it a franchise, nonetheless it's killer.
You know how you order something and it's a bigger portion than you expected and you think there's no way I can eat this much- but then take a bite and it's so good you just end up eating way more than your body is prepared for?
That's how delicious it was. 
Since I am new to this area, I listen when someone recommends a place to go do -well just about anything.  I am also big on trying to take the source of the referral into consideration.
But in this case, pretty much everyone I've met has told me how great this place is..I decided to check it out and grabbed some dinner on my way home.  Instead of hitting one of the many corporate franchise drive thrus on the way home I went to theirs..
I didn't see what I wanted on the menu so I asked if they had it. The guy said yes they do and then handed me a white bag about 1.5 min later. 
I don't know if it was cream cheese or some kind of Cojita Cheese but whatever they stuffed the pepper with it was super tasty! They also put Lettuce, Onions, Some enchilada sauce, and cilantro in the burritos!! My stomach is so full right now I have to lay down after I write this!!
Parking is no problem.
They have a drive thru! YES-it's a little on the worn out side- but they do have one!
Open 24hrs.
They have fresh juice, horchata and tamarind drinks
