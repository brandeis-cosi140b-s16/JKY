Dang, Cabron!
What a surprise. Thought we'd eaten most of what was to be eaten on the West side, then THIS! Feels like you are in the Yucatan.

Clean aftertastes. That is HUGE when it comes to Mexican food. Chicken Itza has it dialed. The Habanero salsa is perfect - not too spicy, not too 'buttery'-tasting. I poured it all over my food just like a typical salsa - a first. (And I did not regret it later in the day :)

My sizzling hot plate ($6) of chicken enchiladas w/rice & beans was fantastic and generous. The special Yucatan-style pork mini-tostadas ($6) were amazing as well. Plenty of food. 

It only took one time to know I was going to be a regular. 

Friendly Yelp Tip: IF you're a freaky fan of Komex or of Taqueria La Mexicana, you will definitely want to try Chicken Itza. I won't give away the ending (but I think you may have found your new value spot.)
