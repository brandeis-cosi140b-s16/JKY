Been here twice.  Great service.  Negra Modelo on tap.  Chorizo tacos and quesadilla were perfect.  My wife had tasty fish tacos.  Beers, tacos and dilla' for $22.  

I'll be a regular here as its walkable.  I'll still occasionally pickup a green chile burrito at nearby Los Taquitos, but Escobar's is my #1.
