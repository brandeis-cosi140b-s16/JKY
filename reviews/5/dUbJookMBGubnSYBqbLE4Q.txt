So I live close to this place and have heard the raves about it, but I'm not the biggest taco person. I was working with a television show whose taco truck fell through last minute. Since everyone was really looking forward to tacos I suggested this place. I called them up and they said no problem and were nice and accommodating to me and said we should do the make your own taco platters. When we got there to pick them up they were ready right on time and gave us so much. They were super nice (even though I know we were being at least a little bit of a pain) and the food was amazing. Everyone loved it and the fact they could put together the perfect taco. I'm definitely coming back here on my own with my bf regularly now. I was also really impressed with the inside because from outside it looks like a tiny hole in the wall, but it's really nice and very clean looking. You guys really got my vote as one of the best places I've been to in Vegas keep up the good work!
