I love Chipotle.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends, but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.

We love going to Chandler Mall and get the kids a meal inside and we get Chipotle for us.  Best bargain there!
