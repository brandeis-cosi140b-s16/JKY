Two words: BEAN DIP. That's the main reason to visit Serranos, but the rest of their food is great, too. You can't even compare Serranos to the rest of the big chain Mexican restaurants in town that serve generic food straight from cans. Blech. 

I applaud the recent re-addition of the "Pollo Rojo" chicken dish, but unfortunately it is on the limited time only special menu. I really hope someone at Serranos reads this and brings it back permanently.
