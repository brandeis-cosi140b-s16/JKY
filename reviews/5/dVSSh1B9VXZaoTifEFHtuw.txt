what can I say? this place has delicious food. I ordered a carne asada burrito and a fish taco. I sat outside next to the grill which made my experience even better. before I started my review I had already wolfed down my fish taco so I didn't get a picture of it lol. the burrito was just as good tho! 
they do charge extra for debit or credit cards tho but that's the only negative I could find about this place
