I'm usually skeptical about little dives close to the flea markets , but this place has outstanding carne asada and chicken street tacos!   The meat is marinated just right, the tortillas are piping hot and the service for a drive thru is lightning fast!
If you are in the area , be sure to stop by....delish!
