Love the tacos!  This is a really small restaurant though with only about 12 - 14 tables.  You need to get there about 11:50am for lunch to ensure you get a table, otherwise you're waiting, and they don't have a waiting area so your either getting hit in the back by the door or waiting outside in the heat/cold.
