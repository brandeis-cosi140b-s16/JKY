I find myself making excuses to go down to Grand Canyon University (my son goes there) so that we can dine at El Taco Tote. It is a rare find: clean, efficient place serving authentic Mexican dishes. We took our houseguest from Ensenada and he agreed.  The Borcheta is my favorite, consisting of diced grilled steak, bacon, onions and peppers, served on a sizzling skillet. I smother it with some of the excellent salsas from the salsa bar and eat with the flour tortillas made right in front of my eyes.  We've tried many of the dishes on the menu and haven't had anything we wouldn't order again.
