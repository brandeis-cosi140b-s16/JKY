My first time in Vegas and I saw this place checking things out online prior to my trip. I knew I wanted to go here because it's walking distance from the Stratosphere hotel-casino-tower where I was staying.....

I came here six or seven times. I lost count. Day, night whenever. it's open 24-hours and , needless to say, but I'll say it: I'm a fan! A huge fan !!! Food was tasty and good. Burritos, Sopas, Tacos, Cortidas even with lengua, which I never had until that time, it was all delicious. So good it had me speaking Spanish! The place looks like a converted KFC and has the look of a neighborhood hang out spot for locals. Don't let this deter you, as the surrounding area can be *sketchy*....but everything I had, even the tamarind drink was fantastic. 

Big Fan !
