Mexico City is located on smithfield by the bridge and is without a doubt the best authentic mexican I have had in Pittsburgh. The staff is great, very friendly. The tacos are awesome...I think the homemade corn tortilias are the reason they are so good. I felt like I was back in sayulita, nayurit!! All the food is very fresh and flavorful. Enjoy because this is as close as you can get to the real deal!!
