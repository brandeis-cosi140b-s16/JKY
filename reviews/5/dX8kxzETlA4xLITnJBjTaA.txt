My favorite!!I am an Arizona Native and know good Mexican food. I have been eating at Tia Rosa's for years! This is my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant. I crave the SHRIMP TACOS all of the time. My husband loves the Chimichangas because the meat is so tender and wonderful. I definitely recommend.
