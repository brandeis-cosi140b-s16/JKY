We have lived by this place for over 4 years and had yet to try it out. Today we decided we will go for it and boy was it good! I'm so disappointed I waited this long to try it out. I got the veggie burrito since I'm vegetarian along with a side of their Spanish rice. The burrito and the rice were both amazing! Definitely will be going back to Espo's!
