If you like fish tacos try Rubios!  The food is fresh and always delicious.  I love the classic fish taco, grilled salmon and grilled mahi mahi taco, and the mesquite shrimp burrito.  The salsa is also fresh and compliments all the food well.  The staff makes the food fast and they're always friendly.  I also like the fact that you can call ahead and place an order.
