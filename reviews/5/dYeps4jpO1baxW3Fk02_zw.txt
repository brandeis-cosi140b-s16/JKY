Love this place. I typically do the Pork Enchiladas with Green Tomatillo sauce, but everything on the menu is delicious. This is one of the only authentic Mexican restaurants in town, others being Barrio, La Hacienda, and Los Reyes. If you like the american style, with the rice and beans, chimichangas, etc. stay away, because you will not find that garbage here. The food is light and central american kinda style. The bar is a fun place on the weekends when they have a live salsa-merengue band that comes on at 8 or 830 and turns into more of a festive bar atmosphere. I've never been sick after eating here, and have always recieved good service. They are also excellent for groups. I like to book the back room, which holds at least 20 people and is almost like a semi-private room.
