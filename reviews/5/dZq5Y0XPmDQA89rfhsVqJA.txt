It's a new place and my first time here. The street tacos were awesome! Between my boyfriend and I we tried 6 of them and all were delicious! My personal favorite was the shrimp tinga taco. The chorizo in it was just awesome and added a great compliment. The cocktails are tastey too! I had the North of the Border that was a perfect patio drink.  For dessert, I had the orange cheesecake flan... A-Mazing! The prices of food aren't bad and cocktails are average. I really like the ambience off is place and the cool design. I'm definitely going back with friends. Did I mention they had a patio? 

PS. Our server was Celsie and she was great!!
