Decided to try a new place ,so we came here. We're seated and waited on quickly. Ordered two patron margaritas and cheesy crisp with green chile. Salsa and chile very mild but not bad. I ordered burro favorito carnitas red enchilada style. My wife had combo platter. Besides the mild chili it was awesome great flavor and good size plate. My wife loved the combo platter and these bite size what I can only explain as a ball were great tasting had oozing cheese and pieces of green chili fried in a crust. And our server Patrick was the best server we have had at any restaurant we have been to. Friendly, attentive, and alway
Made sure we liked everything and that we were doing good. So if you come here you might want to look for this guy. Great customer service.
