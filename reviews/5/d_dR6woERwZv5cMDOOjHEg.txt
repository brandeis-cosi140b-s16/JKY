So if I was given one last meal it would be from the place. The food was unexplainable. Fresh full of tons of flavor and super cheap. I would have paid twice the money for the same food.
Had the wings that are crazy full of flavor.
Orders the shrimp on a tamale all I have to say is stop what you doing and get here now. 
The bartender was super cool and threw this frozen pineapple my way again can't wait for tomorrow I will be back.  Thinking about putting my house up for sale to be closer to this place
