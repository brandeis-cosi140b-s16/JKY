This place truly is 5 star! Their staff, their food and the atmosphere are the best. Good customer service goes a long way and they seem to have mastered it!  Their staff members are very friendly and appear to truly enjoy working with one another. The food is unique, delicious and very reasonably priced. I never would have ordered ceviche, but we did and it was so good! A must have every time now, along with the Mexican corn. Grateful to have this gem in our neighborhood.
