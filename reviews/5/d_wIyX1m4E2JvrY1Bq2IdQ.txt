Excellent Atmosphere: If great food and cheap (free) entertainment, tickles your fancy, Catch this place on a night with a live performance.. It gets a little congested but its well worth it.. And Guys, while your here, make your way to the little boy's room and Check out the pisser.. I found it mildly amusing to relieve myself into a big-porcelain mouth. 

The Food: Start off with the best damn Bloody-Mary on this side of the Mississippi. Only Bloody Mary I don't have to add my own personal touch to. They garnish it with celery olives and JICAMA, which is THE perfect touch to this nectarous potion. One word people: GUACAMOLE! This stuff will enrich your lives.. Tomatoes, cilantro, salt, pepper, MANDARINS and other little pleasures make this Guac absolutely divine. (Super generous serving as well.)  
Tacos are cheap, but small, so you can try every-one on the menu for a song. And the CARNE ASADA ones?...... Can you say DELISH?! Stick with the carne asada and you won't be disappointed.. The red and green salsas at the table are both unique in taste and rich in flavor, and combined, ambrosial. Great place for a date or to nurse your hangover, either way, Bravo Gallo Blanco.. Bravo.  Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.       -Cheers
