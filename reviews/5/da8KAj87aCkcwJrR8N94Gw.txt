This is my favorite mexican food restaurant in Tempe (maybe Phoenix). 

Our favorite things to get are a cheese crisp and either a charro completo or gollo burrito. And of course enchilada style. The salsa is really great too. Has a unique spice that we like a lot.

Growing up in Phoenix, I have fond memories of eating great mexican food at mellow, low key, non pretentious places. Many of those places are gone and I miss them. This place reminds of them. This is Arizona mexican food. Killer cheese crisps, great chips and salsa, combo plates with great re-fried beans and cheese melted, good margs... 

Great mexican food, good prices, Arizona old school mexican food.
