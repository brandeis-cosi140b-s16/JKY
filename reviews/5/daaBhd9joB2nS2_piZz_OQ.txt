I've been wanting to eat at a Hussong's forever and was never able to make it down to their locations in Mexico.   Growing up in LA, I know good Mexican food and was really looking forward to trying them out; I was NOT disappointed!  

You enter the door and go straight to the counter to place your order.  Their prices are economical and comparable to Chipotle or Qdoba, but oh-so-much better!  My fianc√© had the carnitas tacos with rice and beans ($9.95) plus the bottomless chips and salsa for $1.95 (freshly made chips and a salsa bar for the grazing...good stuff!).  I had the chicken bowl, which included chicken, cilantro-lime rice, cheese, pineapple (it also comes with guac and onions, but I got it without).  it was delicious and a heaping portion!  I couldn't have been happier!  Speaking of happy, we were there during Happy Hour and though there are no food specials, the drinks are half off and with that, I had one of the best Margaritas I've ever had!  The beer selection is good and the well tequila was really, really good.  

We were there on their grand opening night (and totally by accident) and the service was ON POINT!  Every staff member we had contact with was friendly and happy; the manager and several other servers in the bar area kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed and if everything was perfect.  Very attentive and genuinely concerned about our experience.  

A great experience and we will come back again and again!!!
