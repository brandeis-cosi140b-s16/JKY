So good! So good! So good! Thank goodness Don Ruebens isn't too far of a drive because my fuel bill would be astronomical!!! Their service is impeccable, always friendly and I always get the feeling that they are just as happy to have us eat there as we are! Food is consistently delicious and I always leave there fat and happy. The wait staff is super attentive, drinks, chips and salsa are bottomless! I've tried multiple different menu items and I've always been impressed. Great for families, a couple of margaritas after work with a co-worker or significant other or to just come in for the food and ambience by yourself! I got wind of this gem from a friend who lived in SURPRISE. If someone willing to make a 40+ minute drive doesn't convince you, I don't know what will!
