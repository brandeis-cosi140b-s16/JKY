Everything here is AMAZING.  The food, the service, and especially the scenery if you sit by the duck pond!  I've been all over Mexico, and El Encanto is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  It is unbelievably authentic.  This is a great date place, or a place to take out-of-towners, or  place to go to "just because"!  Well worth the drive from Phoenix!
