This is my new favorite spot to get "street tacos"  the flavor is awesome, super fresh and my meat was perfectly cooked, not dry at all. 

I like how you can see the food being cooked over the hot coals of the mesquite grill right in front of you as you order. 

They have some of the best salsa's I've ever had, I honestly would buy jars of it if they sold it separately. 

It's $1.70 for the typical double corn tortilla "street taco", honestly with quality salsa that comes with it, I think that's a very good deal. 

The crazy potato is very interesting, it's a baked potato mixed loaded with what would usually be in the taco, kinda reminds me of the Stuffed Baker from Joe's Real BBQ.  

Honestly though the tacos are where it's at.
