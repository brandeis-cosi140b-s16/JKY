This is our very favorite place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The food is amazing! Carne Asada, carnitas, chorizo, no matter what type of meat, it is all made to perfection. The burritos are huge, the super nachos are mind blowing, and the kids meals go above and beyond. The crew is super friendly. Prices are more than fair and they even have a daily .99 special. They have an A rating with the health dept, too. I checked!
