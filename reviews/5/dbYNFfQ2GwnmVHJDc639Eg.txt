Everyone that worked here was friendly and provides good service. The building also has a lot of history to it as well as the area! This place is worth a visit.

I recommend the healthy shrimp lettuce wraps, so tasty! We came in a Sunday around lunch and they had a chocolate fountain with lots of fruit laying out.
