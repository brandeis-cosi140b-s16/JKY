This place was absolutely amazing! I had been craving good Mexican food and decided to try it out since it had really good reviews on yelp. We pulled up and was a.little taken aback because it's connected to a gentleman's club but we were so hungry decided to give it a try still. The interior was very sophisticated very nice. We started with a a pitcher of margaritas witch were $32 I thought it was a bit pricey but hey it's vacation. The margaritas were so good. You could taste the alcohol so it wasn't watered down and it wasn't over sweet because they use fresh lime and agave nectar. Made about 5-6 glasses. I ordered the carnitas burrito, my mom got the shrimp tacos, and my sister got the carnitas tacos. Everything was excellent! It all tasted so fresh and was such quality I was really impressed with everything. Loved it so much might have to make a trip back before the trip is over! Oh and they are open 24/7 so you can't beat that!
