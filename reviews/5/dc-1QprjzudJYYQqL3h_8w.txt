Ate here based on a friends recommendation and I'm so glad I did.I enjoyed everything I was served,from their fresh chips and salsa to the complimentary fideo soup (I'm usually not very big on soups,but it was so good I devoured it in a matter of seconds).I ordered the carnitas and it was delicious and their service was fantastic! I think I found my new favorite Mexican restaurant.I just wish it wasn't 2 1/2 hours away.
