When they sit you, they give you ceviche for appetizer with very nice and spicy salsa. The location is a little hidden but not too difficult to spot if you are looking fkr it. The staff is very nice, the chef comes and checks to see how you like. will definitely come here again when im in the area. i recommend this place.
