Surprise is lucky to have such a place as this for something other than Mexican chain-food. The owner "gets" customer service too. 

I enjoyed the Green Chile Burro, enchilada style and Spanish rice. Good flavor and good quantity. 

I don't drink sodas but I'm sure this place would do better with fountain.
