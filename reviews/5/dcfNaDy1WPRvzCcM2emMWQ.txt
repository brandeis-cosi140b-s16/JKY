In the desolate almost barren landscape that is Las Vegas Mexican restaurants, finally an oasis appears called HACIENDA DEL REY. Yes, I am given to hyperbole but in a town that considers Lindo Michoacan a good restaurant, it is appropriate.

This was our second visit and it was just as good as the very first time. Did I just use a Foreigner lyric in this review? The food here is SO much better than any other local full-service Mexican restaurant, especially any place with Michoacan in their name.

This is what we have had for dinner and why you should probably have the same.

Chips and Salsa: chips were warm and I believe spent their formative years as tortillas rather than being reared in a bag, salsa was fresh and bright tasting.

Quesadilla: complimentary, tasty, and a very nice touch.

Seafood Campechana: full of shrimp, crab, pulpo, and avocado, delicious and pretty authentic as well.

Albondigas Soup: great broth, plenty of veggies, and housemade meatballs.

Carnitas: the real thing, old school well browned and succulent, big chunks and not greasy.

Steak Tampiquena: tastes of beef and the grill, cooked medium rare as ordered with a really good cheese enchilada. Puts that other place to shame.

Tortillas: made fresh in house and I prefer the corn slightly over the flour.

Rice and Beans: way above average and we finished them.

Guacamole: excellent.

We really enjoyed both meals here. The beer (Bohemia, YES!) was ice cold as were the mugs. Our server was outstanding and very attentive.

I do wish they would upgrade their Margarita program; more top-shelf and craft options available straight up or on the rocks would be nice. We want this place to stay around for many years so more advertising and promotions would be a plus.

If you think Lindo Michoacan is good, try Hacienda del Rey and see what you have been missing. GO NOW! Hope they can overcome that somewhat jinxed location.
