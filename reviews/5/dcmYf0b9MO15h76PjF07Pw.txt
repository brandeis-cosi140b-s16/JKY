I've been coming to El Burrito since I was in Middle School and it's still one of my favorite homegrown Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas.

I've never really had a bad experience or bad food at this place because I pretty much stick to three things on the menu because each of those items are so good that I just never decided to branch out and try anything else.

The complimentary chips and salsa are always an awesome start to the meal. I usually follow that up with the Noodle Soup. It's pretty salty, but it'll warm you up on a cool night and it tastes great.

I usually get one of three entree plates every time I go, which comes with the aforementioned soup.

1) Two Chicken Burritos w/ Red Sauce
2) Two Tamales
3) Carne Asada

Each of the items comes with the typical fixings, rice and beans and whatnot. Each of the items are equally tasty, and if you get the two burrito plate you will DEFINITELY have leftovers!

I usually cap the meal off with the sopapillas, which are cinnamon-sugar covered pieces of dough that are absolutely delicious. 

:) I highly recommend this place, as a loyal customer for most of my life.
