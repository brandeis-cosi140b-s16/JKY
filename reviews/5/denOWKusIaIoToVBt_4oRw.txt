Just discovered this neighborhood treasure.  This family owned and operated business prides itself on knowing its clientle and every time my husband and I visit, they remember our usual drink order -- and have remembered almost from the first visit -- and have it ready for us the moment we sit down.  My favorite dish is the tamales, which are something I learned to love in my home state of Texas, and I love, love, love La Fonda Del Sol's version of home style tamales.  

The food is reasonably priced, generous portioned; the wait staff is friendly, and service is prompt.   I judge a Mexican place by the quality of its salsa, and this place wins big on the salsa.  One is mild, but really flavorful, and the other has a great level of heat.  The chips are great.  In all the ways a Mexican restaurant should be good, this one is great.
