I'm not a fan of sea food, but this place is a must. I call it "the best spot to recover from a hang over", no kidding. This was my 3rd time and I was as pleased as the last 2. 

Try the toritos (peppers filled with shrimp and wrapped in bacon, on a soy-like sauce). Three of those plus a "michelada" (beer with lime juice, clamato and salt) and you'll be better than with an IV. You can also try the shrimp broth, it takes you back from the grave (the booze grave).

The shrimp cocktail is great, with fresh cucumber. Pour some lime juice and ask for ketchup and you'll be thrilled. 

My brother had the shrimp wrapped in bacon, there were pretty good.

The service was pretty good and friendly. Actually I went there with a friend who has several restaurants and restaurant experience and he pointed out that the service was better than average. 

One note. If you're white supremasist, a mexican hater, kkk, confederated, Arpaio lover and so on, this might not be your place. Most of the patrons are hispanic and also all the waitresses. 

I almost forgot it, they play "banda" music which I find hideous but the food worth the music pain, specially if you're hung over.

This is as close as you can get to the real mexican seafood restaurant that could be found in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Ixtapa, etc.
