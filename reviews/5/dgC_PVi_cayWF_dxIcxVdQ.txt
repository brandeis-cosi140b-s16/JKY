Too lazy to go anywhere nice. We decided to give this a try. It's like Chipotle only way better. I had grilled steak salad and it was fantastic. It came in a tortilla bowl, which normally I would never eat. But it was baked and not fried. Delicious and fresh! Picky husband had a chicken burrito and I was scared he was going to eat the pan. Amazingly, everyone working there was a good actor or actually enjoys their job. The only negative was I hate seeing all those tinfoil pans going in the trash. They should get real pie pans and wash them. On my wish list I wish they had margaritas.
