It is so hard to find excellent Mexican food in this town! A friend recommended Yo Rita, and we loved it.  The al la carte Taco menu is unique, 2 tacos and a soup is more than enough dinner for an adult. The ambience is simple and clean, the bar is central to the small restaurant so it isn't a place for kids, which is one of the reasons we like it here. The margaritas were the best I have ever had. This will become a regular stop for us.
