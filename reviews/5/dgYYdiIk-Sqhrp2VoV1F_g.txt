Amazing food and great happy hour prices. The bartenders are extremely friendly and the wait staff is very accommodating. The managers are also very approachable and check in on their customers occasionally to make sure their dining experience is great, which it always is. The bean dip is always delicious and the wait staff is always willing to bring more than enough chips, salsa, and dip to the table. The outside dining area is also a great area to sit at as well. I highly recommend sitting outside or in the bar area to anyone who wants great service and delicious food.
