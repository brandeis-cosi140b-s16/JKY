The Chipotle chicken salad is the largest food group in my nutritional pyramid. And I treat this Chipotle like my personal home kitchen! Except I really don't do any of the cooking. And it tastes delicious every time..

The workers here are for the most part very friendly, generous, and efficient. Like all other locations it gets busy during peak dining hours but they do their best to keep the line moving. Until you get those n00bs in line that speak too quietly or don't know what they want which in that situation nothing can be helped. 

My personal recommendation is to order ALL THE SALSAS! Go for it. Don't be shy.
