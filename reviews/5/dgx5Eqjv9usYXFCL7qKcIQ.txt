My favorite taqueria in Charlotte so far. Shame on you yelpers here for not finding and posting this place yet!

My torta oaxaquena was great and full of that stringy cheese that makes it so special. My pastor taco had pineapple chunks mixed in and was pretty solid as well. My recommendation, get a taco and a torta, eat half the torta and the taco for lunch/dinner and save the other half of the torta for an excellent breakfast.
