I have been to this Z'Tejas a couple of times in the past and I wouldn't have said it was a five star experience but tonight was top notch.

We were quickly seated in a nice booth around 6pm. It was not super busy but busy enough. We were greeted by our waiter Matt who told us the specials of the night. I got the Chambord margarita special which included a Chambord margarita and two carne asada street tacos for Cinco De Mayo. My fiancé got the 21 day aged filet based upon our waiter's recommendation and it did not disappoint. Right away when it came out we could both tell that it was cooked perfectly and a great cut of meat. My street tacos were wonderful and the carne asada had a great kick to it. I joked with my fiancé for the rest of the night that I liked his meal as much as he did.

He gave me about a quarter of his steak and I enjoyed every bite of it. It was a little spicy, tender as can be and the mushroom sauce was to die for. The service was great and Matt definitely left a good impression.

Well done Z'Tejas, we will be back.
