Espo's is back with a vengence eversince they reopened. They have the best chimis I've ever had. You have to get one and it doesn't matter which one. My favotrite is the red chili but they're all amazing and you'll leave stuffed. They give a generous portion of toppings and the flavor is spot on. Go get that Chimi!
