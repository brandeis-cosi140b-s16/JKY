I've been coming here since I was 13 before they remodeled.  The service and food have always been exceptional. The traditional Mexican food flavors a are satisfying and worth every penny.  I suggest the number 17 carne Asada taco plate or the enchilada Suisas with chicken instead of beef.  The red and green salsa they provide freely with chips won't disappoint if you like the heat of good chilies!  The Micheladas aren't bad.   And the chiliquiles with and egg on top if a great pick for breakfast.  Enjoy!
