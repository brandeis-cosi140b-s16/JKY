My very first review could only be that of Zapatas Cantina, or "Zaps" as I like to refer to it as.

I frequent this dining establishment more than any other in my life. Very much at the pinnacle of decent restaurants located in the university vicinity of Charlotte, it has all the ingredients: the food is of upper-end quality, it's modestly priced, and has a fresh atmosphere. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a place with a staff that can understand and replicate English well- this place is not for you. I've heard various people toss that comment around every now and then. It may just be my opinion, but it seems as though the best authentic, non-American eateries are those with misplaced English skills, or a complete lack thereof. 

Now I myself usually don't deviate from an ace menu item once I've found it, and as such I've had the same "Southwest Quesadilla" from Zaps for the past 6 years. First thing I've ever ordered from 'em. Think I care? Nah. Sure don't. I have only recently been "around the block" with other various items on the menu and to no shock whatsoever, find them all exquisite as well.

Overall, here are a few things to consider about the business: 1) Adequate spacial constraints with an up and downstairs, each consisting of its own outdoor section, 2) lakeside view, 3) great food/ menu combinations & a plethora of menu items from a very basic "kids" to a "make-your-own" spin off anything they have to offer really, 4) generous portion sizes, 5) full bar selection and quality margaritas, 6) drink specials for every day of the week, 7) VERY quick service (9 out of 10). Can't beat it.

And for Cinco de Mayo? This is the place to be.
