I usually avoid malls at all cost hut in Charlotte, there's no way to not eat at a mall depending on what you're looking for.  The menu was everything delicious.  I ordered the soup alboguins, (sp)  with lime and chorico and huevos and refried beans.  Absolutely delicious, fresh and filling.  It took a few days to finish my leftovers in the hotel, but I was determined not to waste that.  Even cold, it was just as tastey, for me, that is the true test of how good a dish can be, if its gross cold, then you shouldn't have ordered it or cooked it in the first place.  This location is in a university type mall/plaza, hadn't been there in years and not too much has changed.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, I highly reccomend eating here for a bite when ever and where ever you may be in Charlotte.   The service was great, friendly and just smelling the food cooking, just made you want to eat everything.
