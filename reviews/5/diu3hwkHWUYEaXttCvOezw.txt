I almost didn't write this.

I almost don't want anyone else to know about my favorite place to grab some authentic tacos when I'm in Peoria.  I fear one of these days I'll stop in for a quick bite, and the line will be out the door.  Because that's how good the food here is.

One of the best things about life in Phoenix is that if you do have to resort to "fast food," you're not limited to the enormous over-advertised chains.  Taqueria Los Angeles is quick and inexpensive, so technically it probably is fast food, but the quality is so much better than anything you'll find at a traditional fast food burger place.

The salsas are fresh and flavorful.  The tacos come in different varieties of beef, pork, chicken, or fish.  (Looking for ground beef?  Go to Taco Bell.)  The burritos are enormous.  And it's all made to order.

There are a few clean tables inside and a TV tuned to a Spanish channel, but not much else in the way of d√©cor.  If you go, don't forget to scan the walls for mention of specials and additional items; the menu behind the counter is not all-inclusive!
