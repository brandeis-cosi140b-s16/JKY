Um, I wanted a burrito. What I got was the size of my calf. I got the chicken burrito for $9. I now have upwards of three meals. The chicken was great. By no means dry or lacked flavor. Added a huge heap of burrito swag (tomato, lettuce, cheese, rice, beans, sour cream and more, I'm sure). It took up the entire take out box!!!!

Now let me reverse to the experience up until this point. I crave burritos and I was picking school supplies when the craving hit. So I checked out what was recommended on yelp. Drove all of .5 miles from the mall. I pulled up and this guy is pacing back and forth, singing to his rap that is blasting in his ears. He had an odd aura about him but I proceeded. I walked in and is was for sure a hole in the wall. Clean. Decorating included the standings in the world's cup and post it notes on the drink cooler. This is exactly how I like my Mexican food though. Authentic in taste and no extra jazz.
