I was so happy to see Tijuanas come to Charlotte as I was a big fan in Florida and Virginia Beach. For this specific location I was especially impressed. The server was super friendly and attentive. I could tell they put a lot of attention to the food being prepared carefully too.  We always get the black bean flautas so I can't speak to their burritos, but GET THESE. Crispy tortillas that you can smother in queso, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato and sour cream. We split these with a side of rice and beans and add a side of chips and salsa which is a generous portion. All that and a drink was $12. This is by far my favorite fast food Mexican place as the food is consistently good and I'm over the cold burrito line other places offer. 


Finally I think when evaluating restaurants, it is important to assess it based on what type of place it is trying to be. Therefore comparing Tijuana Flats to Cantina 1511 isn't even fair as they are offering two different dining experiences.  TFs is fast food that is tasty but adds some extra perks to the regular grab a bite places, such as a more playful and entertaining ambiance (and nice patio outdoor seating), options for alcohol, and servers who bring your food, refills your drinks, and clears your table.
