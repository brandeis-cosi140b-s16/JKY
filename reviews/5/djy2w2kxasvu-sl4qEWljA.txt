Amazing food! Authentic real Mexican food! Definitely worth the drive to Summerlin. The staff was very friendly I love that it's family owned they definitely care more than the chain places. My margarita on the rocks was amazing I didn't order top shelf and you don't have to there very smooth and they're definitely not stingy w the alcohol . A must try for Mexican food I had a guacamole burrito enchilada style and their homemade noodle soup w cheese. So good!! I'll definitely keep going back.
