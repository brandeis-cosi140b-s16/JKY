WOW YOU MUST EAT HERE!! Great food and even better service!!  The warm chips and delicious, spicy salsa kept coming.  The food was really good Mexican style food that came on HOT plates and was beautifully presented.  The kids meal even comes with an ice cream sundae.  The best thing about our meal was that JESSICA'S service was the best service EVER!  She filled our drinks often, checked on us often, made sure we knew food, chips, or drink refills were on their way, and was very friendly to us and our 3 year old.  So respectful and courteous that we felt welcomed to be there because of the great atmosphere.  Thanks for the delicious food and the AWESOME service!! We will definitely be back!
