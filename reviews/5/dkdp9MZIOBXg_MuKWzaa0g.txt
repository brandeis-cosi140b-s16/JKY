I'm not normally big on Mexican food, but they have great Mexican food. So cute, in the heart of old town Glendale. It's been there for 68 years. Friendly and great service. The mild salsa is my absolute favorite. It's a must try. Mexican pizza is pretty good too!!! So far I have been there 3 times. Many more to come. :)
