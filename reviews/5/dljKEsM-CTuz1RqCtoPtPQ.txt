Such a fun and relaxed place. They have events every night,  bands,  cancers etc. Check out their website,  some of them are free. Great burritos,  really good drinks and staff is friendly. The building used to be a body shop I think,  regardless,  I really like the reuse while conserving the buildings original uniqueness.
