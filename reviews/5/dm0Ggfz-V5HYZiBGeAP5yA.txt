Terrific food quality and service. Ingredients used were fresh and delicious. Restaurant was very clean, dive-y, but clean. Parking lot is sketchy - but once inside, you're transported. I loved it.

I took yelpers' advice and tried the aguachile shrimp tostada, the shrimp empanadas along with a small guacamole. Chips were warm, shrimp was clearly made / marinated in lime upon my order because they still had that velvety-raw mouthfeel. The lime/salt/chili kick was great. I ordered an 8 heat level and my server side-eyed me...you really want it that hot? I did -- but I think she adjusted because it was definitely not super hot, but it was delicious nonetheless. 

Please note, food is not cheap - but you wouldn't want it to be since they specialize in seafood dishes. They're also closed Mondays which is worthy of another nod. (No fish deliveries on Sunday so fish is always less than stellar on Mondays...) Nice to note that they are busy and do a brisk business which is what you want to see. It's definitely worth the trip. Lots to taste and try. For those who aren't interested in seafood, you've got options, but seafood is definitely the star here. 

Even though they take credit cards, the machine may or may not be working so to be safe bring cash -- $20 per person minimum without beer.  

Several large tables were enjoying lunch so they can accommodate a few groups, but not much...but the small size made it even more enjoyable -- and probably made the dishes feel that much larger...
