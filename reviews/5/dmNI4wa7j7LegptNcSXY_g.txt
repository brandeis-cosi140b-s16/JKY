Chipotle is one of my favorite fast foods and this store is as good as it gets, mainly because the portion sizes are the largest I've ever seen! I stopped by on a Friday night with my parents and it was pretty busy. We shared two chicken bowls, but we really could have just shared one. Everyone else sitting down to eat had bowls piled up high enough that a cover would definitely not fit over it.
