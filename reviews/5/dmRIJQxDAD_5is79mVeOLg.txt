I became hooked on Moe's while in college, then I moved to Charlotte and found myself Moe-less way too often.  I would bounce around the numerous burrito places always asking for cucumber and chipotle ranch to be added to my burrito, but always getting the same confused look, and then a awkward "we no have that mkay sir."  I was always forced to choke down a bland, sauceless, yet drippy burrito with only moderate satisfaction.
Well, then came July 2011, and the opening of Moe's in the Epicentre.  (queue "Hallelujah!").  Needless to say, I was very excited, and I've been there 3 times since the opening, which is not nearly as often as I want.  However, as I've been distanced from Moe's over the past few years, I was not aware of their new approach to natural, organic ingredients.  This only solidifies my love for Moe's and creates even more distance between Moe's and everyone else.  
This Moe's is excellent - fast service, friendly people, and a sweet friggin coke machine that mixes up all kinds of concoctions.  

This is the best burrito in Charlotte.  Get whatever you want, and add chipotle ranch, that's all I'm saying.  I guess you could call it a redneck burrito.  We southerners like our ranch, but don't you worry about that.
