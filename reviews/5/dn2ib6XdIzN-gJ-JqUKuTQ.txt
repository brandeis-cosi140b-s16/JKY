Honestly the Place is called "Nacho Daddy"! With that being said a guy who's a Nacho-enthusiast (like me) feels right at home. I had the Hamburger nacho and my sister had the pulled pork. The hamburger was awesome, the pulled was good but word to wise the BBQ sauce is sweet and my sister was a fan. All in all I will be back. FYI Nacho Daddy please come to OC!!!!!!!
