I tried the car club chicken tacos with corn tortillas and it was amazing! They were bigger than I expected them to be for being corn tortillas. We went back for taco Tuesday and got the 2 dollar happy hour tacos. They are pretty small but good. It was a nice surprise to see four peaks peach ale on tap since usually places only have kilt lifter. I will be back for sure. Nice to have this place close by.
