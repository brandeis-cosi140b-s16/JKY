BEST TACOS EVER!! This place is truly amazing, The taco shell was crunchy but also soft. (Although it's a but oily but that's alright!) The tacos were full of flavors and the shrimp tasted so fresh! My only complaint is that it's way to crowded! Especially during lunch time. But the decor is a plus! Defiantly will be coming back for sure!
