This a hidden gem on Central Avenue. They serve authentic Mexican food with love. Did I forget to say the price vs quality is unbeatable. If you ever drive by the old Eastland Mall area give this place a shot you will thank me for it. Won't mind eating chorizo tacos with everything on it on a daily basis! Delicioso!
