We know Mexican Food so don't let the dark and dingy fool you, food is excellent. Been coming here for years. We crave the green beef enchiladas and the ground beef tacos. Meet is tender and not fatty. Food is soul satisfying.  My only regret in giving five stars is we don't want it to get busy. We love the staff some have been here as long as we have been coming.
