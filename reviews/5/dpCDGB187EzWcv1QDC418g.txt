Either this is a brainfart moment or someone at yelp is messin' with me.  I was sure i posted a review after posting several pics of my eating experience at Border Grill.

The gf and I were at a poker party where we met a new foodie friend that gave high praise to the Border Grill weekend Brunch.  We decided to give it a try.  It costs $29 / person but locals get 15% off.  The added champagne option costs a reasonable $5.  You order from a special "tapas" menu and the plates are brought to you - all you can eat.  We did our best to get through all the options on the menu but not even close.  

The highlights:

The mexican chocolate chip pancakes
the churro tots
the banana bread french toast
The sausage biscuit/gravy
The pbjc ( peanut butter jelly and bacon ) - AWESOME
Shrimp and grits - AWESOME
Chicken enchilada ( the sauce was amazing)
mexican eggs Benedict

Ok :

The sweet corn tamales
the short rib hash ( will be much better if served with an over easy egg instead of the provided scrambled eggs ) 
chilaquiles
empanadas

Service was excellent and we enjoyed speaking to Chef Mike when he made the rounds in the dining room

WE ARE COMING BACK !
