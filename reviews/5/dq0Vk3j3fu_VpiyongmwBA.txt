The best tacos in the valley, with out a doubt. This place is my favorite Mex taco supplier, for burritos I go to Rito's. El Nuevo Taquito knows how to use spices and the meat is very tender and seasoned or marinaded.
Tacos are small, about three bites worth for me, they run $1.05 each so order five or more, but they are the best tacos you will ever have north of the Mex boarder. I have never given 5 stars to a restaurant before, but for this place, I do not hesitate.
