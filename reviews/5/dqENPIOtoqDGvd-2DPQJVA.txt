Aww man was iy good. Well as the name says vaqueros Carne Asada we got te carne asada burro, fries, and torta. All were exceptional and a quesadillas that was massive. My kids loved the quesadillas and we thoroughly enjoyed our food the burro was the best. Filled with pico de gayo cilantro and guacamole. I love the way the place looks it is cool and fun.
