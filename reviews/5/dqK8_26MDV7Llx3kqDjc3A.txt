Authentic and tasty, no question. Enjoyed a burrito con al pastor, which had that lively, slightly sweet flavor. It was excellent and plenty large. The salsa is clearly made in house and is also delicious (and comes with the meal, I might add). As good as Mexican gets in CU. Here's to hoping the steady volume of traffic I've noted driving by (and visiting the once) continues.
