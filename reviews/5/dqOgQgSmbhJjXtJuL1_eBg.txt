Have gone to this place three times now and have yet to be disappointed! The service is what makes this place so exceptional. Every visit I have been greeted with smiles and the waiters are fast and polite. I highly recommend the tamale it is a personal favorite (that is if you don't get to full eating all the yummy chips,salsa,and beans brought to the table as soon as you sit!) Best Mexican food I have eaten so far in the Summerlin area
