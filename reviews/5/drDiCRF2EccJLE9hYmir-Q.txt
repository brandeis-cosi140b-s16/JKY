Happy that my first Yelp review is of this great new place. It's amazing what they have done with the space that used to be a bakery. Very, well...urban...comfy seating. I had the 2 taco plate, veggie and the shrimp, and my friend had the shrimp burrito. Portions were ample and the taste of everything, including the salsas and chips, was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I LOVED their chimichurri. This is a great addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to checking out their happy hour.
