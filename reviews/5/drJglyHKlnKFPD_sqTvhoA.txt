This place is amazing! I have so much fun every time I go to The Sandbar. They have some of the best events held here. This Halloween they had a costume contest and games where you can win prizes, and they even had turkey bowling around Thanksgiving last year. Also during the holidays they make some of the best drinks that go with that specific holiday theme,  they are so delicious! The food here is also very good, I really enjoy getting their tacos here, they taste absolutely fantastic! The service is really great, everyone seems really friendly and very quick to serve. Kelli, one of the managers that work there is super cool. She is so friendly and helpful, and is a mega hottie! If you are looking for a place with a fun atmosphere, and to get awesome drinks and food, The Sandbar is the place to be! Also they even have a short bus that takes people to and from Cardinal games! How awesome is that!
