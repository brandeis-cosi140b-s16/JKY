I am reading the reviews and surprised at some of them. I have been going here for about 2 years and really like it. A big plus is that it is in the mall. The food always tastes fresh and I was told they make mostly from scratch, which is a plus for me. I love the guacamole they make it at your table for you. The salsa and chips are so good, the best I have honestly tried in a restaurant. You can get them to go for around 8.00 for a huge bag and probably at least a pint of salsa. I always order the soup and guac. My hubby has had many things on the menu and always is satisfied. This is the only mexican restaurant my son goes to, he loves it.
