If you like island style grub, it doesn't get much better. My friend told me about this place several months ago and now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to try it out. So far I have tried the chicken, pork and steak... I must admit, I LOVE them ALL! My boyfriend favors the steak with the corn salsa! I also love the chips and guac, but let's not forget the COCONUT BARK... OMG! I also like how friendly everyone there is... I will definitley be a regualr!
