I went with my sister and my boyfriend for lunch today. It was our first time there. The staff was friendly and answered the question we had about the menu. My sister ordered a fish taco with rice and beans, while my boyfriend and I both ordered Cajun chicken nacho. They came with lots of cheese and beans, but not too much chicken. Overall they were delicious. I would definitely go back.
