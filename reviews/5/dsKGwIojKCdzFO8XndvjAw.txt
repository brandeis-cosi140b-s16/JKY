I first saw Guy Fieri's visit on TV. I have Family in Phoenix so I said I had to try it out on my next visit. I was just there with my Family this past weekend. I was blown away by the decor and delicious food. It was everything that Guy Fieri said on his show and more!! I can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can eat there again!!
