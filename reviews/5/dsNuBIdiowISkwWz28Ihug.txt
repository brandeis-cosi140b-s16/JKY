Excellent. We eat here almost every weekend. Simple reasons...

The food is WONDERFUL. Like most mexican food places, the plates are huge and the food is scaulding hot when it arrives, but the food seems to be a notch above most places we have eaten.

The drinks are abundant and you can order everything from small margaritas to SUPER HUGE get-you-drunk FAST margaritas. I am a White Russian enthusiast, and they have one of the best I have ever had.

The wait service is prompt and polite. The management is great. This guy made me a White Russian with half and half instead of milk and it was the best thing ever! Now every time we go back the manager makes me my drink:) Incredible customer care.

I disagree with previous comments about the Guacamole. Its alive and tasty. We order a side of it with our chips and salsa every time we visit.

I would HIGHLY recommend this place.
