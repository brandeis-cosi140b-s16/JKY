Joyride is the best new retaurant downtown, hands down.. My waiters were personable and knowlegeable.  If you like postino, federal pizza, and windsor, you'll love joyride, their most recent success.. the staff is attentive, and the management cares about your experience.. Enjoy a hand crafted, organic cocktail, and a glimpse into the street taco world!
