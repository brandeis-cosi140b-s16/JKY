Two adults and a one-year-old looking for somewhere new (to us), found Viva Zapata's. We were there for late breakfast/early lunch. Seated promptly! The hostess took the drink orders and the waitress brought the drinks and a busser brought chips, salsa, and bean dip. Awesome teamwork! Everyone's timing was on point.

Allow me to point out: if you're craving chips and salsa, you can go to pretty much any old Mexican restaurant and get your fix. Viva Zapata's offers chips, salsa, bean dip, AND a fabulous fideo soup (it's basically tomato soup with short noodles; VZ's take on it is among the best I've had). Speaking of the soup, the busser brought out a cup of it for the toddler before our orders were even taken, which kept her busy and gave us time to look over the menu.

He had huevos rancheros and I had camarones deseados(?). Huevos rancheros came with pork (a little dry, but great flavor). Shrimp was incredible. Something different about their rice--I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's definitely a good thing.
