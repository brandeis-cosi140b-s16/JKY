I feel like not so many people know about this place, and they need to! I loved everything about this place. The laid back Caribbean/Mexican feel, with sugar skulls and paintings done by local artists, and the food was great! The queso fundido with red AND green chorizo was AWESOME, I love queso fundido ;) also had pork and beef tacos, we all had different tacos and everything was great!
