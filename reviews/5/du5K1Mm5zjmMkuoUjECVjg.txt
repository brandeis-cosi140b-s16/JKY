Francisco's does Mexican via American staples well.
Everything tastes great, although Mercado Marimar & Taquer√≠a Guadalajara are more authentic in my opinion.

However, what Francisco's lacks in taste/authenticity (which is really very little), it makes up ten fold in hospitality, atmosphere & service.  It's the perfect place to go with friends for lunch, dinner, or post-bar-close emergency meal because it's warm, welcoming & laid back.

And did i mention it's OUTRAGEOUSLY cheap!??
