My buddy Mike took me here after we played golf recently. We wanted something with "chips and salsa" and a decent beer selection. Their chips and salsa are served community style, and the beer selection rocks. Winning! Oh, and the chips are corn AND flour. The place is really big, too, and has a classic vibe to it. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, and they were terrible. Told the server and she took them away and brought me something else. Just a really good experience. They have a Living Social right now, too, so we will be going back. Thanks, Mike!
