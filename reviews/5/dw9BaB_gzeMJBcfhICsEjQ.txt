Wow !

We had 'baked' at Nascar all afternoon and were on our way to the East Valley - in 'snail' traffic when the teenagers said they were hungry.

The restaurant was in a tiny mall with a Subway and a pizza place.  We chose Senior Taco

I ordered the special of 5 rolled tacos/drink and was really impressed with the moist chicken in the crunchy tacos and so much guacamole (no extra charge !) really fresh lettuce and grated cheese.

Another Nascar 'nut' had a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with meat, another had a combo plate that looked really good, and the boys had tacos.  They managed to find samples of cinnamon topped chips that had them trotting back and forth while our food was being prepared.

We had taken a chance on this little place and were very happy to be eating great fresh food while we watched the slow traffic pass by !

The bathroom was very clean and smelled great - very nice after a day at PIR !

We'll be back in November and encourage other race fans to join us in their 'fan apparel' :)
