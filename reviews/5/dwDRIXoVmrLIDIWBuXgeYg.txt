Ohhhhhhhh Emmmmmm Geeeeeee..... Irma's Kitchen you are my long lost lover.. my ray of sunshine during a dark storm.. my diamond in the rough.. you are my everything.. Ive passed this place a few times and yes, its a little sketchy looking.. buuuuut I am sick and tired of shelling out 10-20 bucks a meal for shitty overpriced hipster plates that justify their pricing with a garnish of cilantro.. I ate two HUGE pancakes, 2 eggs over easy, and literally the BEST bacon Ive ever had (bacon should be fuckin crispy godamnit!!!)... HOW DID YOU GUYS COOK THAT?!?!? And a generous cup of black coffee all for 5.50$$!!! The service could not be more friendly, and I am blown away with the quality of food for that price.. this is not your typical shit show guys!!!! I wish there was more of these 'kitchens' around that didnt try to rape your wallet along with feeding you.. as long as this place stays in business I will continue to not only eat here,  but be more than happy to give them my money.. Irmas Kitchen!!!! keep doing what you do because there are people who appreciate it.. much love and respect.. I will be back soon.. over and out
