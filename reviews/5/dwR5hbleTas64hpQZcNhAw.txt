12 seats, maybe 16, but great home style cooked food. Very authentic. I've lived in Mexico personally and have to insist this is a hidden gem. Family run. Nice laid back attitude that  makes you feel you just walked into a relative's home, they made you feel welcome then served you some great food. At one point the cook poked her head out of the kitchen and asked how we liked the food. We will definitely be back. It's a shame more businesses aren't as welcoming. Definitely recommend this place
