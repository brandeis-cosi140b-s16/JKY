I first tried the location in Laguna beach CA... And I fell in love. Javier's offers authentic & delicious food! The ambiance is incredible, the service is great & we absolutely love going to Javier's ! The steak was amazing & so was the queso fundido... Yum! Can't wait to go back. Wish we had one in Miami!
