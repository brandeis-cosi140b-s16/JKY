I have to update my review now that they batter the tacos at each location. Wow does it make a difference, the fish breading is extra crispy & way more flavorful. These tacos are better than most sit down restaurants and they still sell them for $1.50 each on taco Tuesday.  This location always has the best service and it's a clean locations with a clean bathroom.
