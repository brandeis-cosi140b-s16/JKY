First of all, I have to preface this review by saying this is NOT Mexican food. It's New Mexican food, therefore it's American. Now, that being said, I LOVE this place! The food of New Mexico is so unique and different. The Navajo fry bread stuffed with  pork Adobada is incredible, and I get it almost everytime I go. The fries smothered with the green chiles and cheese are sooo good, still crispy and just perfect. It's always a tough decision on what to get because everything is great. The diable burrito is stuffed to the gills with huge shrimp, and their rice and beans are totally different than any kind you  can get anywhere else. I found the green chile to be spicier, and the red chile to be more earthier and smoky. If you can't decide, get them both in a version known as Christmas style, both red and green. And to top it all off, they even have their own signature beers for $1 a pint! It's a cool little hole-in-the-wall place with neat art from New Mexico, and you can buiy the chilies to go, either dried of made into their sauce. If you've never had the food of New Mexico, then this is the place for you to try some of their tasty food and experience their culture. I highly recommend it, and have never had a bad experience there. When I move, I'm gonna miss this place because I'm fairly sure there is no food like this available near Tampa. I LOVE Carlito's!! Vaya con Dios Yelpers!
