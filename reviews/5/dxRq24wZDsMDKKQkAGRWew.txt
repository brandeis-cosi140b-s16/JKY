I always forget about this place, but it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in all of Charlotte and the prices are extremely reasonable.

Usually go to 3 Amigos, but this place has been consistently beating it in quality, price, and taste.  Their queso actually has some substance to it (3 amigos tends to be watery).

I usually get the grilled chicken salad and the chicken is very tender and fresh.  Great fresh avocado and the dressing is tasty too.

I wish they gave a little more salsa with their to-go order, but I'll bet they would do it if I asked.
