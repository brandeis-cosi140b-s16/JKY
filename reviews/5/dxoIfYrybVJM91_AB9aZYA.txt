OK, after several more trips the Stand has fully won me over. I think it may have been the salted dulce de leche shake. Or perhaps the french fries, or the chips and guacamole, or the fact that it is open till 11 PM -  and there isn't really a better place to get an inexpensive drive-thru meal of this quality.
