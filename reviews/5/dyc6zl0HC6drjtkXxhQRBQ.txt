This place reminds me of my favorite street tacos in Mexico. However it's brick and mortar, clean and got a lot of variety. For less than $2 you can get a small taco that is packed with flavor. 
I've seen my Facebook friends eating here a lot so I thought if give it a try. I ordered two steak and two chicken. You can see the meat on the mesquite grill right behind the counter. I loved that the steak was medium instead of well. The chicken was also very juicy. 
I washed it all down with a mexi-coke. Shame that sugar mexi-cokes are going away. 
Give this place a try. You won't regret it. I can't make it to Rocky Point every weekend. This place is a fine substitute. I'll be comin back with friends and family.
