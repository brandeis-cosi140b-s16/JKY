Well my brother has talked about this place often on for a while. We came here yesterday and what's really weird is we're back today. It's fantastic I'm normally not a hot dog person but this is over-the-top good you got to try it. The owner is gracious and kind hard-working cares about the food. I had to tell my fellow yelpers about this gem in old town Mesa. And it's a bargain too.
