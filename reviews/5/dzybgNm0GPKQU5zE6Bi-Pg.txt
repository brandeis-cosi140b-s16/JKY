Rudy's is awesome.  They make you feel at home and serve you excellent food.  The prices are very competitive until you get the plate.  The portion proves that prices are outstanding for what you get.  The service is always stellar whether you have an expensive or low cost meal.  I say low cost because cheap refers to quality, and quality proves this is not a cheap meal.  You want authentic with a home type feel - this is your place.  Ask for Erika, she is awesome and will take good care of you.  Family owned and operated and they take pride in every plate that leaves the kitchen.  Their chips and salsa are killer!
