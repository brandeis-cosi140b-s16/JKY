I really love the queso fundido sauce they carry.. that being said you must try out the Rio Grande Enchiladas..... I usually get the adobada inside but you can try both, get one of each adobada and one green chili.... super super tasty!!!! The complimentary chips and dip is also bomb!! The bean dip has a tiny bit of zip to it. I have tried a few other items but I always go back to this one... really the only reason I go is because I crave this dish so much. Anything that you can get the queso fundido on will probably be awesome!
