Hands down the most amazing carne asada burrito I've ever had! Their marinade or rub for the meat is.sooo good! When they ask you mild or hot ask for the green sauce. Both the red and green sauce are homemade both are delicious but the green sauce is absolutely amazing! Absolutely positively going back for more. I wish they were opened 24 hours!
