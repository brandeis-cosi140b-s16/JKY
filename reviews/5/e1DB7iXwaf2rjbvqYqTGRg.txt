I  LOVE Chipotle!  I first got addicted when I was Monterey, CA and in the Air Force.  The company was very good to military service members and would often have freebie days where you could get a free burrito if you showed your military ID.  I'm not sure if they do that here in Madison, but they will forever hold a special place for me for being so kind to service members in Cali!  What I do know is that the staff in the Madison location is very friendly, the restaurant is always clean, and the food is always amazing!  When I walk in, I'm usually greeted immediately with a warm hello, even if they are busy and there's a long line.  It's the fast meal cure for my family as it's way healthier, tastier, and fresher than anything else I could pick up for a similar price.    So many places downgrade their food as they expand and grow, and I've been loyal to Chipotle for 7 years now and the burritos are just as yummy as they were back when I first discovered them!
