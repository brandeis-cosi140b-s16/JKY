I'm new in town and I thought that I would give this place a try.  What a pleasant surprise!  The service was great and the food was delicious.  I've returned every week since I've been in town and have tried something different on the menu each time.  The beer is cold, the service great & friendly, the portions big and the price is right - what more could you want?  I'll be back.
