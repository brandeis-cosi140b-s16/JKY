Great inexpensive burritos.  Authentic tasting HUGE burritos.  The staff was very friendly, clean, and the food really good.  My son ordered the bean and cheese burrito with bacon.  He is quite a picky eater and he loved it.  The retried beans are made fresh and are really good.  Fresh chips and poco while you wait.  (And the wait is not long at all.  Worth driving a little out of your way to eat here!
