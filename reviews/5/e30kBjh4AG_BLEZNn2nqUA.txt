I live about a mile from this food truck, and eat here about twice a month, sometimes more.  We have visited for YEARS.  Have you heard the saying, "Don't judge a book by its cover?" Don't let the fact this food truck sits on the corner of Van Buren next to a used tire place fool you.  The food is terrific.  Never, ever, have we been sick from eating here!  And we eat here a LOT.  Real food, prepared well, absolutely delicious.  Our favorite is the Carne Asada street tacos.  I also love the Vegetarian Burrito!  The flour tortillas are heavenly.  My boyfriend enjoys the Ceviche.  And we happen to be white - so don't worry, they do speak English, ha ha.  It's safe, super fresh, and totally delicious.  There is a reason this food truck has been parked here for years, and hasn't ever moved.  It's good food.  In fact, they added a dine-in place on 83rd and McDowell, and it has air conditioning there, but we still get a kick out of sitting outside to eat on nice days, so this is still our first choice.  If I had any criticism, I'd say the red salsa at this place is "meh" but the green salsa at the dine-in location is amazing!  And it would be nice if they posted prices somewhere - it's a bit intimidating to look at such a general menu with no prices posted?  (Prices are posted at the dine-in location, though.)
