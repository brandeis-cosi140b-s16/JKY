Wow! What a little gem this place is! So good! A beautiful building nestled in an older part of town but so worth it to go there. We were having a "Girls Lunch". I'm new to the San Tan area and we were going to try Serrano's Mexican restaurant. They are closed on Sunday. So I googled the next Mexican restaurant in our area. This listing came up for Casa de Mena. The reviews were very good and the pictures looked delicious. We arrived around 1 o'clock on Sunday. We were seated quickly and we were given chips and two types of salsa. The red salsa is very tasty and not hot. The green salsa had a sweet note about it. I've never had green chili salsa sweet before. But it was really good. My sister wanted hotter salsa so we asked for it and we got it. I had a mango frozen margarita, and it was so refreshing. I ordered the green chile verde chimichanga with Rice and beans. My sister ordered two enchiladas and a side of mango salsa which I tried and it was so fresh and very yummy. My mom ordered her usual 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and beans and an iced tea. She was very pleased at the portion size not being too huge but not small either and it was piping hot just to her liking. My sons girlfriend ordered the steak sliders with chips and she loved it! Our waiter, Tony, was very patient with my sister who is very indecisive. He was fun very efficient and checked on us several times throughout our meal. The prices were very fair for the good quality food that we got. I would recommend this place to anyone it will quickly become one of our favorites I'm sure. Very nice ambience, everything was clean, just a really nice and relaxing restaurant. Again our waiter's name was Tony and he was awesome! Come try this place out you will not be disappointed.
