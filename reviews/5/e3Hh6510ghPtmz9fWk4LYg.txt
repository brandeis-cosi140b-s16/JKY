Yumtastic! My husband and I love this place. We were so sad when Chevy's closed. We have been trying to find another Mexican food place, we found it. It is better than Chevy's. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The prices are reasonable, staff is always friendly, food comes out pretty quickly, hot and fresh. I am pretty particular and have a lot of requests/alterations/substitutions with food dishes, but they always get it right. I love their chips and salsa. Can't wait to eat here again!
