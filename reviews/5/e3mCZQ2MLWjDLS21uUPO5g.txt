I haven't tried the food- but the people that work here are so friendly so if you're visiting the area, this is a great spot to stop by at! We brought in our Spring Training ticket after the game and received an offer for 1 dollar Old Style beer- a great deal. The security guard inside was working as like a host, asking if we wanted anything, and giving us huge smiles. A lot of people were walking in and getting tables immediately.
