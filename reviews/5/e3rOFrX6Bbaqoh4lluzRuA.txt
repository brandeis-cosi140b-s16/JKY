This is by far the best fast food Mexican restaurant I've ever enjoyed!

It is now a regular tradition for me every payday, dinner from Senor Taco!

They have some daily specials and other good deals, but most of the prices are medium on the price range for fast food, about $5-8 per entree.  The servings are VERY generous (muy generoso), so I usually have leftovers for later.

The food is always freshly made to order, so it does take longer than your typical fast food, nothing like Taco Bell.  If you just want a late night run to the border for some really cheap and fast crappy tex-mex, then this is not your place.

If you want some really good food for a reasonable price, then stop by.

Oh, AND they have the best Horchata I've ever had.  I order Horchata from every Mexican restaurant I go to, and somehow, they just do it better: not too sweet, not too cinnamon-y...

I have been to bigger sit-down Mexican restaurants with a more complete menu, but as far as fast food Mexican goes, this is as good as it gets en mi opini√≥n...
