I just left Joyride taco house and could not be more pleased with the food and exceptional service. I frequent Upward Project Restaurants and the service tonight was better than I could ever expect or have had! Justin was our server and he took great care of us! The chips and drinks were never short and the tacos we ordered were out of this world! I loved the carnitas, pork and shrimp tacos with the Asian slaw. The food was cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend Joyride to anyone interested in great tacos, awesome drinks and incredible service! To make your experience even more 5 star ask for Justin for your server!
