Best Fili B's in the valley! I am a regular of almost 20 years and love most every item on this menu. In general, filibertos is hit or miss depending on which location you go to. But this place takes pride in their store!! Know what your getting into, and go get yourself one of the under 5$ meals, or cheese enchiladas, or whatev!! Extra red AND green sauce, and don't forget the horchata!!! 
Thanks Fili B's for all the great meals!!!
