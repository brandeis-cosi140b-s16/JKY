Yum! What a good meal I had at Mexi-casa today. I ordered chicken fajitas & they came to my table sizzling hot. The presentation was appealing & it was more than enough food for one person. The chicken was tender and the peppers & onions were cooked perfectly. I topped it off with a banana & peach frozen margarita. If you haven't tried this restaurant since it has been under new ownership I would recommend it.
