Love, love, love this place! My favorite is the Rumba Nacho's and my Husband loves the Rumba Burrito. Always fresh and made right in front of you. Don't understand the negative reviews. They have a great menu and lots to choose from. Just wish they didn't take the fried ice cream off the menu! 5 stars from me!
