My wife and I had the owner (I believe) and he was very warm and made us feel welcome.  He recommeded the stuffed peppers with shrimp , wrapped in bacon and it was delicious!  He was genuinely excited about his food/service and it shows.   I doubt I will be back because of the very long distance from my house but I'd love for him to have a restaurant in California!  I would highly recommend!
