We love this restaurant.  If you are ready for authentic Mexican cuisine, great service; a great atmospere - you will love this place too.  The prices are very reasonable.  Prepare for your taste buds to be tickled.   We are impressed that the second generation of Serrano's are running this family business with excellence and with great dignity and respect.  Please keep up the great work.
