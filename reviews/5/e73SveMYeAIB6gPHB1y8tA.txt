I had a wonderful experience at El Dorado Cantina. All of the staff was extremely friendly and the food was Amazing. Bailey was my bartender and she was Fantastic. She was extremely knowledgeable of the food menu and the drinks behind the bar! She made it very easy to figure out what I wanted. And even gave me fresh squeezed strawberry juice to try and it was great! Chef Paco even stopped by to ask how everything was and to recommend dessert! I will definitely be back to see the friendly staff again. It was as authentic as it gets, reminded me of my grandmothers cooking who is straight from Mexico City. Cheese Enchiladas are one of my favorite dishes and I would definitely recommend theirs to everyone. Can't wait to go back again and try something else!! Oh and don't forget dessert! I had the churros and oh boy would I be in trouble if I could get them everyday; they are DELICIOUS!!
