Excellent!  I wanted so bad to eat there the next night but couldn't make it back from Sedona in time. The filet on cheese enchiladas?  Divine and melted in my mouth like butter. The chicken mole...best I've ever eaten!  I'll miss this dish when I return home. The group I was with had the tableside guacamole and can't stop raving about it. We all split dessert and had the churros and empanadas. They were excellent as well. 
I'll make this a regular stop. Thanks Richard Sandoval, great execution!
