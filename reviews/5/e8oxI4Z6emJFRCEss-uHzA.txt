PV Burger Company is the absolute best burger in AZ and is definitely at the top of my list for all-time best burgers.  The owner is great and helped me work through my tendency to stick to what I always order and try some of the specials and other burgers on their menu.  I love the jalapeno ranch and fried onions as well as the pickled onions and that brulee burger is definitely worthy of the praise it gets.  The shakes (good lord that maple bacon pecan) are amazing and the price is more than reasonable.  The only bad part is that it's within walking distance from home and I have a feeling I may go overboard, if that's possible.  I only wish they stayed open later; 8:00PM is just too early!  Seriously though, EAT HERE.
