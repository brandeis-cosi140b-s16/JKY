El Entronke Mexican Foood, is a new restaurant that opened about 4-5 months ago. It's owned by a local couple. The food is amazing. I go there once a week or even sometimes two. There food is airways fresh. It's not greasy like other places I have been. Believe me I know. Growing up in a Mexican family, we get to grow up very picky with our food. The staff and owners are always great. When football season comes around this will be the place to go and have some great food and great cervesas. I recommended. Food price is very moderate. Not expensive.
