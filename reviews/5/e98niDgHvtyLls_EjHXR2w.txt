BEST CHIPOTLE LOCATION. i love chipotle so obviously I have been to many many locations to get my chipotle fix, but out of all, this is my favorite :) Let me tell you, as a busy location (esp across the street from UNLV), they're customer service is never lost. Staff is very vibrant and kind to customers, plus they make sure we are satisfied with our food. This location is also very consistent on giving good portions to their customers. There has yet been a moment when I was disappointed with my experience at this location. Keep it up!!!
