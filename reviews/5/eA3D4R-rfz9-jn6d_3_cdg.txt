Chuck at Royal Links GC highly recommended Frank & Fina's when we asked for a good Mexican restaurant.  He was right.  Started with guacamole, chips and salsa.  Chicken enchilada suizas, chile rellenos, Chicken Nolan (a specialty) beans, rice and fried bananas with the Chicken Nolan.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The service was excellent and Frank is a character and you can see he really enjoys what he does.  Finished with sopaipillas with honey and cinnamon sugar and ice cream on the side.  Yummy.  We are only here a week, but definitely going back.  A must try.
