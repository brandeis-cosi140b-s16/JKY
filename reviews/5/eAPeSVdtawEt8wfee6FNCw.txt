We had dinner and the food was very authentic. I had Hatch Green Chile and chicken enchilada and my dining partner had the beef burrito combo plate. I was surprised to learn the beef was ground and not shredded. Flavor of salsa has right mix of spices and tasted fresh. Cute place tucked away in the strip mall. Very good choice for lunch or dinner in you are in the neighborhood. Prices are reasonable for what you get. No liquor license and not sure if you can byob (cold Pacifico would have been nice).
