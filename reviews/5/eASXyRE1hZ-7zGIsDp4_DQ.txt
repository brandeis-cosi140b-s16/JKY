Overeating, supersized, excess upon excess...I tell ya, with all the extravagance of this country, savvy Americans clean up pretty good. Case in point: My outrageously delicious & generously portioned KID-sized lunch at Qdoba.

Some weeks ago, a friend mentioned that the steak here is even better than at "the other" popular fast-casual Mexican grill chain. Wrote that off as woefully improbable, but then found myself both hungry for meat and steps away from a Qdoba yesterday. 

Blindfold me, place me in here, remove all signage and then take the blindfold off, I'd swear I was at "the other" place. Almost identical in layout....even how the food is displayed. I don't know which chain came first, so cannot point my copycat finger accurately.

Anyway...sorry, yes, back to the point I was trying to make! The meat is wonderfully seasoned but mostly comparable. What DID lift my lids were 3 things: the FREE guacamole, the size of the "kids" meal, and the free cheesy dipping sauces. It was even too much for someone who intentionally eats small meals to magnify the taste experience and leave a little hunger in her. (I dine a bite short of satisfaction. Keeps me alert, energized and on top of my game.) My meal, quesadilla with half chicken & half steak, was a clear 10. Best of all...the total came to a whopping $4.32. Unreal. Thank goodness for America. Greed is GOOD.
