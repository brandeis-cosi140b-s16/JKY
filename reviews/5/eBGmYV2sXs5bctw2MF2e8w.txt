One of my favorite seafood dishes is Ceviche. So, being Mexican and having fresh ceviche on the beach made me extremely picky getting it elsewhere. However, Mariscos Chihuahua has the best Ceviche I have ever tasted. It is so fresh and so tasty. I totally did not expect this while stumbling upon this location. Our entire dental office (Cute Smiles 4 Kids) that is down the street go here regularly for lunch.
