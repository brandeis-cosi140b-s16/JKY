Went here for lunch today with my friend Sandy. It was nice and quiet despite being busy and lunchtime. We were seated right away and not 5 minutes later, we were blessed with chips and very delicious salsa to begin our lunch, as we both perused our menus, deciding what to have.

Our waitress was an older lady named Jessie & she was very helpful with suggestions on what to try and the daily special. Sandy has been here a few times and decided to try their Street Tacos. I went with the Daily Special, which was 2 Cheese Enchiladas, rice, & beans. We each got a soda to complete our orders & as we waited for our meals, we caught up on things and enjoyed the complimentary chips & salsa.

Jessie was very efficient and great about checking on us, especially after we got our food. Our meals came out piping hot, looking & smelling very good, & we both enjoyed our lunch. My enchiladas were made just right & the cheese melted in my mouth upon each bite! Sandy said her Street Tacos were the best she'd tried in a while & I knew that I would definitely come to this restaurant again. 

Great food + fantastic service=return visits!
