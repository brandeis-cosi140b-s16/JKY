Talk about a patio at this great taco place!  So many good reasons to love this hot spot. First and foremost I find the food to be absolutely delicious and very reasonable for the quality!  I have to say I keep wanting to try something other than tacos but I like them too much!  I have had a side salad which was very well topped and prepared. 

Patio on fleek!  This place has a nice balance of shaded areas for lunch, and cool light strings across in the evening. The outdoor bar gazebo is also very large. The inside is nice as well, though the patio is where it's at if the weather is cooperative. 

The staff is always very friendly and service is pretty quick once you are seated. The drinks are also very good here I must say. And of course the names of both the drinks and the meals are very unique. 

Finally, make sure to take note of the parking lot off Fenton Place and tell your first time friends meeting you there. The address location being Providence Rd and having that small lot in the front makes it a bit tricky your first time at the Ru.
