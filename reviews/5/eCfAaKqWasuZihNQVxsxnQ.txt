Dos Gringos is a great place to go day drinking with some really good Mexican food. It's a dive bar with plenty of outdoor seating and THREE bars. Two are full outdoor and one is in and out door serving/seating. TV's are aren't large in size or number but they're there if you want to watch the game or whatever. Good number of people there most of the time but plenty of space as well so it's not overly crowded. Also, there's a Jenga game (probably 10 times the tabletop version, played with 2x4s) as well as cornhole (bags, beanbags, etc) that's free to whoever wants to play it in the outdoor section. 

Always a great time at Dos Gringos!!
