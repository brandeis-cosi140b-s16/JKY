Mariscos El Dorado was AMAZING! They're mixed ceviche was fresh and delicious. The portions are huge and the service is excellent. My fianc√© and I are huge mariscos fans and this place has definitely surpassed our expectations. We felt like we were in Mexico, especially with the great background music. We will be back!
