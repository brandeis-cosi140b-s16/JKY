Delicious!!!!  You can't ever go wrong with this place!!!  Whether it's a late night snack or a lunch, you always leave satisfied with a happy tummy.  The lines are a bit confusing as there are three separate ones depending on what you're ordering.  The spicy pork and the asada are the obvious staples although they offer tongue and other stranger meats I don't have the balls to try.  So staples it is!  The tacos are the perfect size and usually 2-3 at 2 bucks a pop will do the trick.  I recommend getting into the shorter line of the two since you can still place one order. To receive both.  They have a nice selection or horchata and plenty of seating inside and out.  The locals obviously love the place as well and I constantly see construction workers pick up huge orders for their crews.  If you're staying at the Wynn or the encore, there is NO excuse not to try this place!
