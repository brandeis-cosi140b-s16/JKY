Every bite was absolutely delicious!

The interior is gorgeous! At first when my husband and I walked in with our two young children we almost left because it looks so nice inside and we thought maybe it wasn't appropriate for our kiddos. However the entire staff was gracious to our whole family from the very start and made us feel very welcome.

My husband, who is Mexican, and grew up in New Mexico is a hard judge for Mexican food-- loved everything. Especially the queso  fundido  (hope I am spelling that right). He said, "tastes just like it does back home". A huge compliment! We both had a three taco platter and the tacos were so expertly crafted, they take you to a different place. The fish taco transported me back to my childhood in San Diego and had a very Baja feel. Then there were several marinated tacos that were so reminiscent of our time spent in the Yucatan peninsula, which is a whole different style of Mexican food that most people have never had.

Then the tequila selection! We are always so disappointed by other restaurant's selections because there are so many really good tequilas out there. We will definately be back sometime soon without the kiddos enjoy  a couple of tequila flights with some more excellent tacos!
