This place looks like a total hole-in-the-wall dive joint (near Goodwill at Alma School and Ray Road).  Having said that, the food is fantastic!  I really love the salsa and chips.  To me, the salsa tastes like a cross between the mild and hot sauce at El Palacio - another of my favorite restaurants near Chandler.  Food tastes fresh made.  I had two cheese enchiladas and a chile relleno burro.  The enchilada sauce is very authentic, and very tasty.  The chile relleno burro is huge - it is stuffed with all sorts of stuff - an entire meal in and of itself.  Be sure and check out the daily special.  I noticed it after I made my purchase, and it would have been an awesome deal.  Prices are very reasonable.  Also, I must say whoever brixes the soda fountain does a great job - the Mr. Pibb tasted perfect!
