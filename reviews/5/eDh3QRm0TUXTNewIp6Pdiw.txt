This place was pleaseant, clean and very organized. They were prompt with their service and acknowlefged us when we came in. We ordered and waited about 10-15 mins for it which isnt bad consideting the freshness of my food when i got it. The tortillas were thick, hot and ripped apart like nothing. And they have Margaritas too. The nice part was that the pozole i ordered was $8 but this is more like a $11 meal with the extras i got. My husbands burrito al pastor was hot and the meat had a smokey but sweet taste to it and eating it was like eating butter; melted so easily. Add yhe sour cream and it set it off lol wonderful. So id recommend for ppl that wish to eat n actually be full. :)
