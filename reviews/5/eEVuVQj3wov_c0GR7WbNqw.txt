Our favorite taqueria close by Boulder City. We won't eat at Roberto's in BC since seeing meat sitting out on a counter in a plastic bin in a dirty restaurant. 
Really good burritos, tacos and shrimp dishes.  The owner is hands on, super friendly and keeps the place immaculate. His cook is a familiar face who's been there a long time and she knows how to produce delicious fast food which is made to order. Top quality angus beef for meat eaters and tasty salsas! You should give it a try, ambience is laid back, spacious and you can call ahead if you're in a hurry.
