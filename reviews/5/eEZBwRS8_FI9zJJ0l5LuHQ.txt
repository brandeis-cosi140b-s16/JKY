Don't let the line wrapped around the building during the lunch hour scare you away.  If you see that anywhere, you make time to wait in line.  It's a small local dive, but the food is as good as I've had nationally.  

Even something as simple as the chips and salsa are out of this world.  Get a burro...any of them...and leave happy.

Awesome, awesome joint.
