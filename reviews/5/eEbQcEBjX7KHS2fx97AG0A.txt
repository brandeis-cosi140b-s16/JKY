Josh is completely correct! This is by far my favorite "fresh-Mexican" type of place, and it is by far superior to Chipotle.  I always order the Daily Special (which they have had every day I've gone?) of the salmon tacos with rice and black beans.  My understanding from over a year ago is that they weren't doing so well with sales, so I'm overjoyed to hear from Josh they are packing it in during lunch!  Hopefully they will still be there when I move back to Scottsdale.  They aren't open every day though, as I found out during Superbowl weekend, so you might want to call first...
