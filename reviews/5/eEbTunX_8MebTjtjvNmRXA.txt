LOVED this place!  Great margaritas, great food, great atmosphere.

Drinks:  We had regular margaritas and the blueberry margaritas, quite tasty.

Appetizers: We had chips and guacamole (excellent! they add cranberries to it and its amazing).  We also had the nachos which were to die for!  Very cheesy and flavorful.

Entree's:  We had several street taco's, the chop salad, the enchiladas suiza.  We had six different taco's, the best was the Conchita Pibil.  We also had the Carne Asada y huevo which was great, Cameron asado which was ok.  We also had the barrio pollo which was excellent, the pollo deshbrado which was good, and the Saudero Ateca which was also good.

Dessert: We had the churro and buenelos.  Churro was to die for with the carmel and pecans and ice cream!

We went on a Sunday night, it was busy, we were seated quickly, sat in the bar, service was decent, could have been a little more attentive.  I would eat here over and over.  Recommend a reservation!
