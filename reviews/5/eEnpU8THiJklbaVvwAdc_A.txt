Okay, this is my hometown Mexican food restaurant.  I have eaten this food all my life and I grew up less than a block from the original owners, The Amabisca Family.  That said, it's not gourmet Mexican food, but it's good enough for me.  

In fact it's good enough to make me crave it a few times a year when I drive back out to the homestead to check on my parents and the rest of the relatives.  Specifically I crave their shredded beef taco plate with sides of rice and beans.  Oh man, I dunno what it is about their oily, salty, shredded beef tacos with beans and rice, but I love them.  And they also have a very unusual hot sauce that they serve with their chips, that I *swear* has oregano in it (and I like it) but it's definitely an acquired taste.

And another thing they make here that is amazing is their Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  So damn good!

So, this is a decent little place for *Americanized* Mexican food, UNLESS of course you are a bone fide food snob, in which case don't bother because you'll probably just decide you hated it as you pull out of the parking lot, sneering at the little town of Buckeye as you screech away towards the I-10 cursing the Food Gods that somehow misdirected you here in the first place...
