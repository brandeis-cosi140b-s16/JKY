Woah. This place is fire! Starting with their salsa actually having flavor and spice, to their friendliness, to their enchilada sauce! First time eating in casa grande and I will definitely be back! I am usually not a fan of enchilada sauce, but they use the owner's mom's recipe, and it is honestly the best I have ever tasted in my life! And to top it off, their service was phenomenal and some of the nicest people. Can't wait to have another trip down here!
