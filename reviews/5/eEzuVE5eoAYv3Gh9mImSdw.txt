For what this place is I loved it!  It's a small privately owned mexican restaurant.  The owner was there.  The staff is SUPER nice and quick.  They even have a guy dedicated to pouring out delicious salsa!  The food was great and I couldn't finish it.  I like the loud ambiance, and the maragritas are cheap and yummy!  will go back!  Everyone seem to order the taco salads.  I loved my machaca chix burrito..  Small, friendly, quaint, quick, reasonably priced and yummy!
