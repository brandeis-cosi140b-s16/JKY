Great food! Great atmosphere! Great service! I met a friend for happy hour and was blown away by Baja Joe's. Danny Vouga was our bartender/ server and she was attentive and accurate. I couldn't have asked for more. The restaurant and bathrooms were clean and in great shape. (Not something you find all the time now, unfortunately.) Prices are a little higher, but I am willing to pay for good seafood, great atmosphere, and great service! Will recommend to all I know! And be back for HH again!
