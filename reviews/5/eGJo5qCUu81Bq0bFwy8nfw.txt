Found this place on Yelp and so glad I did! Food is so authentic, fresh and delicious.
The guacamole is better than homemade and all of our food was amazing! I can't remember the correct spelling of each dish but I had the seafood stew which was perfection!!! 
Big portions, good prices and wonderful service.
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!
