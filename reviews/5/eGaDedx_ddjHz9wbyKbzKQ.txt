This place is awesome.  We had a great time at the opening and have been back a few times since.  We would recommend it to our friends for sure and will be bringing clients here.  We met the owners who are really cool guys - it's a family-owned place and they definitely have the restaurant owner thing down.  Everything we have tried has been good so far.
