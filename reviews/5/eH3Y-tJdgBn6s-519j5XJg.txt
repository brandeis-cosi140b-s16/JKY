I had my retirement dinner here.  I was able to reserve Leticia's El Patio.  It was perfect.  I had a little over forty people in attendance.  Andy the manager, worked with me and I was able to get exactly what I wanted. I was able to have my own bar and the waiters and bartender for my event were just wonderful.  The food was great and drinks kept coming.  This by far is my favorite restaurant. I love the atmosphere and the great customer service I always receive.  Thank you for making it so special!
