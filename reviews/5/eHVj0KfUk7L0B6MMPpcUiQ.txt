This place is becoming a habit. I am hooked on the chicken fajitas and find myself trying to talk the hubs into going here at least once a week (he usually shows restraint and limits me to every other week). 

As much as I love the food, it's the service that really makes this place shine. Never any issues if you ask for extras, want more chips and salsa? Just ask and it will appear before you, no hassle like some other places. The place is always clean and I find the seating to be comfortable. 

The only food I have tried are the fajitas, and at some places I think that makes me narrow minded but when it comes to Mexican food, I like what I like! 

I am so happy to live so close to this place!! I'm already thinking about going for lunch since I'm guessing the hubs won't want to go for dinner.
