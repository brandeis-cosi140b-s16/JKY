I love Chipotle, and I love this location because they are serving sofritos here...what a nice option for vegetarians.. Chipotle's version of sofritos here is a tofu with a whole bunch of spices and beans.. so freaking good. I will be back for more for sure! I am also hopeful that other locations will start to serve this option because it really fills the need for an "Entree" meat for vegetarians!
