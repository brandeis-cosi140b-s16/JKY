Barbeque AND Mexican? You read it right. 

And Gecko Grill pulls it off. 

The BBQ ribs are outstanding. My husband's favorites are the shrimp and fish tacos. I prefer the fiesta chicken, spinach enchiladas, or the pork soft tacos. And anything with the mango salsa is good. 

Gecko Grill is worth the trip if simply for the chips and salsa. They serve both red and green, and both are good. I only wish they served them in larger bowls! 

The chips are very thin and usually come out warm. 

Oh, and did I mention they serve free bean dip along with the chips & salsa? It's very good, and so popular that many folks who come to Gecko order a pint to go.

The inside of the restaurant is painted light pink with teal accents. The carved wooden chairs and rough stone floor add an authentic flavor.
