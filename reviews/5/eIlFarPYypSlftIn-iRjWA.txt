Love the place! So friendly, and they definitely make the money worth it! I'm not a fan of beans, but because of this place, I love beans now. Their dishes are a good enough portion for two. I get the CC Sizzle Nachos, but the rest of the CC Sizzle dishes are just as delicious. It just depends on your preference on how you want to eat it, whether in a burrito, tacos, etc... Great place! Went there on its first opening, and I come back all the time!
