Came here with friends for a Saturday lunch. I ordered one chicken and one shrimp taco, and we ordered guacamole for the table to share. The guacamole was some of the best I ever had, and the chips were really good by themselves. They looked freshly made. Both my tacos were also good, clearly made with fresh ingredients. The shrimp itself was probably the freshest-tasting I have ever had. I really liked the hot sauces on the tables, especially the green, more spicy, one.

The atmosphere was very nice. There was some very interesting artwork inside. There were a decent amount of people there when we were, but it did not feel cramped. Our waitress was very nice and attentive.

A very good choice for Mexican in Phoenix!
