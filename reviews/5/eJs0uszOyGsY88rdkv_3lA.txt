Tried this new taco shop on the corner of Ft. Apache & Sahara. I was hesitant because I've had so many disappointments but it was the best crunchy taco & chile relleno I've had since my old favorite spot shut down 2 years ago. Made to order crunchy shell & the carnitas came w/guac. The relleno was kind of like a Mexican spin on eggplant parmesan, so a little different but AWESOME! The adobado taco was good too & the fluffy rice & light colored beans were good but I'd skip them & order another taco instead. Nice salsa bar & the owner is nice & speaks good English so he explained the salsas to me & he'll accommodate special orders. Tostadas aren't on the menu but someone got one & it looked yummy! Please visit if you're in the area so it stays in business. I can't lose another favorite spot!
