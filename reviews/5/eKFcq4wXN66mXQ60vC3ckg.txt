Baam, and just like that my friends at Americas Taco Shop in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport made my day again. 

We'd 7/29 around 8 am the staff was on it as I'm use too. Great greeting, great service, and as usual awesome product. I love this place. I don't always get to leave a review on every visit but I eat here every week and if my connection allows I easy here twice a week. 

If you did not like the food here then you must have no taste buds. Simply killer flavors. 

Thank you again America as this guy is muy filez.
