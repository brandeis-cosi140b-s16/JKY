Soooooo tasty!!  Only $2 a piece?!? Worth the wait line. After having these tacos I felt it wasn't fair to pay more than $2 for a taco knowing these are on point!! Asada tacos taste GREAT and have salsa and guac on top and the adobada with pineapple is AMAZiNg!!! You cannot miss put on this gem :) eat there now!!!
