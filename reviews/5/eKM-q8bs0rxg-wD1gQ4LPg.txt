Went here for the first time last week.  We only had drinks at the bar but had a great experience.  They brought us what tasted like homemade tortilla chips and bean dip with red and green salsa.  Really good.  I had a yummy gin and tonic.  My guy had a few really cold beers.  The best part was the service.  Had a great time with the male and female bartenders.  Didn't get the guy's name but Wendy was a delight.  Think we'll go back again this week for our 'date night'.  I'm in danger of becoming a regular if the food turns out to be as good as the chips and dips, decor and friendly service.  Will keep you posted.
