Everything was delicious.  I had the street tacos (one of each except the fish) and they were all great.  The pork taco had some onions on top that were very spicy but they do warn you ahead of time.  Best one was the chorizo. Guacamole was AMAZING! Ceviche was the only part that was just ok.  It wasn't your typical citrus ceviche with lemon...when we told the waitress we didn't like it, she took it.  Then the manager came over and apologized and offered to give us a discount.  Then the chef/owner came out and sat with us and explained to us why the ceviche was different than normal ceviche.  We weren't even upset...this was soooo nice of them! Service was GREAT! Cute little family owned spot.
