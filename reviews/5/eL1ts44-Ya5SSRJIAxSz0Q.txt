Since moving nearby two months ago, this has become my go-to grub spot. I've yet to order something I haven't loved and despite eating here several times a week- I don't get tired of it. The place is always clean and or being cleaned, the prices are great, the food is awesome and there is barely any wait to get your food. Its a great place to stop for a snack or a meal anytime. Plus they have amazing breakfast burritos and quesadilla's that are served 24 hours. 
Since becoming a patron, I have enjoyed the following items the most: bombero chicken burrito, chicken taco's, pastor burrito, pastor torta, chicken nachos, chilaquiles with red sauce, breakfast quesadilla and burrito with chorizo and green chile pork burrito. They have great red and green salsa in bottles so you are free to use as much or little as you need. They serve alcohol as well, if you prefer your tacos with  beer or wine. Overall, it's a great place with good food that you should definitely check out.
