So being from San Diego California I am biased about Mexican food in Vegas. Quite honestly when I hear people boast about Robertos is makes me cringe. I have been here for about 10 years and have yearned to find the perfect place for what to me is a simple meal, rolled tacos with guacamole. El Taco Feliz has done for me what my ex couldn't, make me happy again. I would consider it a hole in the wall next door to a very cool dive bar Money Plays. Cute, decorative and artsy is the place I have been praying for and was about to give up on Jesus until he pointed me in the right direction. I was going into the bar for a drink and came across this lovely place which is like a second home to me now. Very authentic and the people are cool. If you want good Mexican food in Las Vegas please give them a try. If you go you have to try the rolled tacos as I think this is their signature dish in my opinion.
