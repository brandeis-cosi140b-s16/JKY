My family and I adore Cafe Rio.  Everything I've tried there has been excellent (mmm, Tuesday mango shrimp tacos especially!) and the staff is wonderfully polite.  When we dine in with our 20-month-old, we are always given a free child-sized quesadilla with a sliced strawberry on the side.  Cafe Rio makes for a quick, delicious, and enjoyable meal.
