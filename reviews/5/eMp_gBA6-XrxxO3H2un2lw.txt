The food is the star here and the staff's attention to detail sets it off perfectly!  When we were here with a friend mid-summer, we left speculating how nice it would be to come back when we could comfortably eat on the lovely little patio. Even though they don't take reservations, we took our chances last night with a group of seven, and these people really delivered! We were all impressed by quick setup on the patio and pleasant and efficient service throughout. What a pleasure to interact with an experienced server proud to serve fresh made-to-order food that comes from the kitchen as it's ready. 

Come knowing it's not the neighborhood Sonoran multi-page menu, so it's going to cost a little more. What you'll get is perfect clean margaritas, awesome guacamole, an entree selection with something for everyone ... and willingness to accommodate special requests. If you pace yourself, you might even have room to sample one of the two desserts.

We all left resolved to tell our friends not to miss this ... and check out the patio!
