Great Sonoran dog, I've always driven by it but now stop all the time. I get 2 each visit but can only ever finish one haha. A take home one isn't so bad though. Menu prices compare with filibertos and other similar franchises but morenos to me has a more authentic and fresh approach to the food the prepare. Great seasoning and spice as well with good horchata and even shrimp street tacos that are filled!
