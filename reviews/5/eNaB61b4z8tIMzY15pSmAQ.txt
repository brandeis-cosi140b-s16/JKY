Fish Taco Tuesdays!!!  Never been to a Rubio's before and I heard that they do $1.50 tacos on Tuesdays so I decided to stop in with some friends to test it out.  The tacos are awesome, come out real quick, and Rubio's has a full salsa/condiment bar to add some extra sauce, onions, peppers, etc. to your taco mix.  The staff is always friendly when we stroll by on Tuesdays and they even offer to take your trash for you even before you leave.  Andddd service is almost always with a smile... very nice to look forward to on Tuesdays.
