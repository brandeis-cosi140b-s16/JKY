My girlfriends and I decided to come down to dos in summerlin to try it out because we loved the old one in palazzo. We had a reservation but brought a few joiners and the hostesses were so nice and got us a great booth near the kitchen. The waitress was so nice and fun and suggested excellent cocktails. I ordered the enchiladas and they were delicious. Everything was prompt and so good. Definitely going back!
