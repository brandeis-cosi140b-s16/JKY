My favorite Mexican restaurant in all of LV. Happens to be close to gown too! Have eaten multiple dinners and loved them all. Recently I was able to attend a business meeting and was exposed to a breakfast menu that was delish! Wait staff has always been superb and recommends new dishes and combos. Lots of times I let them choose my meal.
