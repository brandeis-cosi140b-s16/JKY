I have been coming here for about 30 years. It is still owned by the same people. Their Mexican food is delicious. I especially like the chili relleno  and their cheese enchiladas. I recently had a cheese crisp with the green chili strips melted into the cheese.  It was fantastic.  The inside needs a little remodeling. But it has the old-school look to it. I will be coming back here for many more years!
