I loves me a good Chipotle burrito! Steak, chicken, you name it! This location is relatively new and is comparable to any other Chipotle in their food quality (just as a chains are supposed to be, right?) and interior style. One especially nice thing about this location is that it's in a small strip mall (with a Starbucks, Coldstone, Ono Hawaiian Grill, Subway, Panda Express), so in case you're with someone who might not love the Chipotle as much as I do, they can find somewhere to grab food and you can eat outdoors on the patio. :)
