I cannot say enough great things about this place.  From the chips and salsa you get when you sit down, to the crazy cheap bill you get at the end, it's everything I want in a Mexican restaurant.  I typically get tacos served in the traditional style.  Perfect, simple, and delicious.  Their margaritas are terrific, as is the guacamole.

Service is always excellent, very friendly staff who do a great job.  Love this place!
