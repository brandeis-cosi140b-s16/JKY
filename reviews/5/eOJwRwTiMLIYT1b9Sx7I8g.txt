This place is killer. This is their second location, first being in The Container Park Downtown. Their Mexican corn & horchata are to die for. The owner talked to my boyfriend & I & explained everything. They're family owned & operated. Score! Support small businesses Food is authentic Mexican food & all homemade. We'll be regulars here for sure.
