I met up with my boyfriend and his family for lunch.  We ordered from the regular menu however.  I had two items: green corn tamale & beef taco with beans & rice.  The chips and salsa were ready as we sat down.  The service is excellent and our time at the table was not rushed.  The other guests had the fiesta, chk fajitas &  another machaca specialty plate.  Everything is delicious.  We topped it all off with fried ice cream.  We will be back!
