Best food ever. All I can say is wow. A must when you are in the Phoenix area. Atmosphere is a little dark but very classy and comfortable. This was one of my first dates with my wife and where she introduced me to 'New Mexican' food. They cook over mesquite wood; who awesome is that? Strictly fantastic.
