The Yelp rating is what made me drive out of my way to pickup a late lunch. If I were just driving by this shop I would have never stopped. 
I ordered a three taco plate with three different tacos. I do not remember the names, but they were ALL excellent! I ordered a Quesadilla. It is different from the Americanized version but I did not care for it. Love all the salsas!
