I was surprised to see so many 'eh' reviews of Picante as I personally really love it and it's one of my go-to quick lunch grabs in the FreeMoreWest neighborhood.  The owners are so nice, the food is fast, and the price is very reasonable, especially compared to Phat or Chipotle.  I really like the fish bowl (ask for the white sauce) and the buffalo chicken bowl.  The also have a philly bowl special one day of the week (Wednesday?) and the Tuesday $5 burrito or bowl is tough to beat!
