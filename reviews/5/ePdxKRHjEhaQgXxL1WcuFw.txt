So the other reviews here are not reflective of my experience whatsoever. I'm not sure if we just got dealt a really good hand or what, but I super enjoyed myself. The server was great at making recommendations for both food and drink, if the teeniest bit pushy (she could tell we liked her and after we had been served our food she pleaded, "Are you SUUUUURE you don't want any margaritas?" Yes we're sure. I have to drive in a minute and my friend has to go back to work). The hostess, however, was probably 17 and having the worst day of her life. No smiles, no acknowledgement when we asked for a table, just grabbing menus and leading us to a table. (I know, Girl, being 17 is hard. It's even harder when you hate your life. Smile a bit! It gets better, I promise. Molly out.)

Anyway, I had a special--some kind of elevated Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme. But I don't want to insult it by calling it Taco Bell food, because it was really great. It was the first quesadilla-type food I ever had to eat with a fork. It was stuffed to the brim with whole slices of tomato, avocado, and raw jalepeno. All of it tasted super fresh. The chips and salsa left a little to be desired, but the green salsa was flavorful and fresh. 

Despite the sad hostess and salsa situations, I would like to try it again. Judging by the other reviews, I don't know if I'll get so lucky again, but I enjoyed it and would be willing to give it a try.
