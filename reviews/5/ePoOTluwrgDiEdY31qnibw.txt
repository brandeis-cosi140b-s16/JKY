I love this Rubios.  I don't even know why I love it so much, but its so much better than all the other ones in Tucson.  I love the fish tacos, the salsa bar, and the coke zero on tap.
Caution: This review may be biased based on the fact that this is a tiny oasis in the awful, hellish drive to phoenix from tucson.
