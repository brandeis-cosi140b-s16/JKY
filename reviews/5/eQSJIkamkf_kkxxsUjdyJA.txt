wow okay so this restaurant is so boring looking inside and it doesn't look special or delicious or exotic or fancy or any of those interesting things but let me tell you that you have no idea what you are talking about because this place has taquitos that are very delicious and they put guacamole on top and also they have meat inside and they are crispy like wood chips but they are edible and also greasy and i mean they definitely are not good for you but if you can get past that mental roadblock then you will understand how important these things are and i am sure you can just go to the gym for a little longer or skip having a heavy meal later on or if you are a normal person then you will just go about your day because it is not that big of a deal and no one will think differently of you if you gained a few pounds and if they do then they do not understand the magic of a nice greasy wood chip with guacamole and they also have carne asada fries but those are dangerous because you try to get them and you tell yourself that you will eat half now and have the rest later and it's actually a great idea because you can get two meals at once but it is not two meals it is one meal and you are a fool to think otherwise and i was a fool once too so i am an expert of how a fool thinks do not be a fool just enjoy your life
