Amazing! Carne Asada tacos and the Carne Asada Chimichanga were a huge hit with me and my kids. One of which is a pretty picky eater! The fresh salsa was SO good as well. Would have taken pictures but we devoured it all in minutes! Here in Vegas from PA, and it was a TREAT to eat here. Very reasonably priced as well. Hoping to visit again before we leave on Monday. Highly recommend!
