We loved it here! Don't let the outside takeout atmosphere scare you, this place is great! We laughed when we read the menu, because so many items were just listed without explanation of what they were.  (And it's one of those funny menus with pictures!)  We ended up ordering the Carne Asada burrito combo, # 14.  Our food came out of the kitchen literally within seconds. The burritos were huge, loaded with fresh ingredients, and absolutely delicious. The waitress was super friendly, and the prices couldn't be beat. Several days later, we went back to a different Filiberto's location for takeout, because we liked it so much the first time. And bonus, the take-out places are open late! 5 stars!!
