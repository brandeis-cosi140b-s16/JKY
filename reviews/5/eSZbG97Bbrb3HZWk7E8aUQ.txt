I've been here twice, both times at breakfast. The coffee is delicious, the food is delicious, and it was an accommodating place to bring my 5 month old. I ordered the vegetable chilaquiles each time I've come here and I also had an order of pancakes. It was all amazing. The service was great, although be warned that this place isn't a regular restaurant it's a ~cool~ restaurant. 
All in all great place for breakfast. I'd love to come at dinner & try their cocktails.
