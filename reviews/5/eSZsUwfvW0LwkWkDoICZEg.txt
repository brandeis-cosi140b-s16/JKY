When Peg and I heard about The Yard about to be re-landscaped by Chef Silvana, we were all in. Her take on food, for those who love authentic Mexican cuisine (as opposed to the classic American take of use 3-4 ingredients and just shuffle them around) has always been a refreshing change. Peg and I have been twice...first week of opening and then last week. The energy is infectious and the service very very attentive. Her food is wonderfully flavorsome and fresh tasting. Chef is extremely involved in receiving feedback from customers which always bodes well. We look forward to spending more time....and breakfast there for us  is in the near future!  Dr. B
