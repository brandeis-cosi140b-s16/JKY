Great hopitality at this upcoming establishment In the Boca Park/Summerlin  area. Elizabeth and House the bartenders on duty, Wow they make excellent Margaritas. The feel of this bar is genuine and makes you feel at home. Shout out to Brian Mangino the director of Operations he really knows what Excellent Customer Service is. Brian and his team made our visit very enjoyable the minute we sat down at the bar. Give this establishment a try you won't regret it!!!!
