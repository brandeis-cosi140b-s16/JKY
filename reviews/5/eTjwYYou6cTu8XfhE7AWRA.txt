The vibe of this place is really cool; casual, beachy, clean, modern. And the burgers we got were delicious. I got the beach house burger, subbing the meat patty for grilled chicken and my friend got the burger brûlée. Both were delicious. I also had to get the pretzel fries they were offering that day because they just sounded to interesting to miss. They were really good, but I preferred the fries my friend ordered with his burger brûlée, classic fries with a good amount of seasoning. The pretzel fries did come with this amazing trifecta sauce, I think it was ranch, mustard and ketchup - not mixed but served in the same container... Delicious concoction.
