Glad to see Espo's back in business. I never understood their closing given the constant flow of patrons. I had my usual machaca beef enchilada combo with rice and beans. The main difference is that the combo used to include a ground beef taco but now that costs extra. There were fewer rice and beans as well. I don't remember the previous price but the new price is $8.15. The menu is now on the wall and there were no handheld menus. When the line gets long it will be difficult for people to read the menu on the wall.

Still...the food is great.

Welcome back.
