Hadn't heard of El Rico's, but got a Groupon, and went for lunch today.  It's a counter-style restaurant, where you place your order, then take your number to your table, where you are served. 

My wife and I both had a carne asada chimi - it was great!  Very fresh, and the meat was great - flavorful, lean.  They have good salsa, great (freshly made) chips.  Service was friendly.  I will definitely come back!
