Wow my first review!  Yeah!  I ate there for lunch last week and tried their new menu items.  It was the Cantina Burrito!  Very Very good, but what stood in my mind the most was the young man that waited on me.  I was ordering lunch for two other people to take back to work and he saw me struggling with handling 3 drinks, so he offered me a beverage carrier!  Then he ran and opened the door for me since he saw my hands full.  

Just saying great customer service!  Kudos to a great employee.
