For a chain place, they are pretty decently good I must say.  But the reason for the 5 stars (which I don't give out easily) is more for the service.  I am constantly blown away by how good the cashiers are here.  Excellent Customer Service.  That's a lot coming from me since I used to work for a company where we were known for our outstanding customer service.  My expectations are high.
