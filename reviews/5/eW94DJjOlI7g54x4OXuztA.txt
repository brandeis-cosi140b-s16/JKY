My husband and I have been eating at Senor Taco for over 5 years now and LOVE it!  My husband always gets the famous shrimp burrito and a fish taco.  The shrimp burrito is the BEST burrito ever!  Ask for extra sauce and it will be even more delicious.  The shrimp diablo burrito is also amazing if you like a little kick of spice to your food.  I have had other things on the menu and have never been disappointed but the shrimp burrito is our favorite.  Everyone we have brought to Senor Taco is also very pleased with their flavorful food.  Go and enjoy!
