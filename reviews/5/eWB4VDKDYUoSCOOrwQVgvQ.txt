DELICIOUS! finally got the chance to come and check this place out. they have since increased the price of the tacos from $1.05 to $1.11. who cares though? because thats still HELLA cheap! 4 tacos fro $4.80...amazing. i ordered 2 asada, 1 carnitas, and 1 pollo...i wasn't brave enough to try the lengua even though it got good reviews. =P super quick service.
