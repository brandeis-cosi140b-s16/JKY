My husband and I had a great time at Mercadito! The food was AMAZING. I loved the flautas and the guacamole. I have sat in the dining room and on the patio and both were great. Even in the heat of summer, the patio was a great place to hang out. I love that it is also easy to get to and don't have to go through the casino. I definitely recommend this place!
