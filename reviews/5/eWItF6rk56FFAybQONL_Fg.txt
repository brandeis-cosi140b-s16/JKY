OHHHHH LAAWD! I wish I could add a sound clip to emphasize my oh lawd. I am a huge taco snob, and love trying new spots. The chips and salsa were awesome, I loved the hot fresh chips. Then they brought my drinks out and included a big carafe of cold water. Seal the deal, I am already sold on this place. No having to wait for refills. Then I ordered three tacos from the recommendations of the waiter, steak, shrimp, and pulled pork, also a side order of black beans and creamy rice. The tacos are huge! They should be called mini burros! They were also super delicious, and that rice! Can I have the recipe?? I think I have been back every week since I went, I am obsessed! Highly recommend!!
