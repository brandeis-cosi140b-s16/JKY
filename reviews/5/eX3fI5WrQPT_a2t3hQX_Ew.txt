I come here for lunch quite often. Good food, decent pricing, and nice staff. During the weekday you order at the counter and they give you a number and bring the food to you. On weekends they have full table service so expect to pay a little more. Most of the entrees are your typical tex-mex, but still excellent tasting. They do have a selection of the more wild entrees, and even fresh oysters. There are several kinds of salsa available; I think the chipotle salsa is my favorite. After several visits I have never had a bad experience.
