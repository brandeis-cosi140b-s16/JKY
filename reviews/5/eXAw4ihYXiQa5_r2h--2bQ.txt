Ok, Ajo Al's is not really mexican food, but it's the best darn tex-mex you'll find in these parts.  To be fair, all Ajo Al's are not created equal.  I've eaten at the other two in Scottsdale, and this location is superior, by far.  Great food, great service, super strong margaritas, a girl couldn't ask for more.  I also appreciate their willingness to substitute on menu items.  Here I can get the pollo fundido with shredded beef, which is a big deal for me, considering I'm allergic to chicken.  If only more places were as awesome and as accommodating as Ajo Al's.
