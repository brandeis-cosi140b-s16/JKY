I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. I recently discovered their 'cantina only' specials which made this amazing place even better. Phenomenal service, high quality food, consistently a win.

There are several specials; two tacos for $5 (and change), three tacos + a 20oz Margarita for $11 (and change), etc. In the main dining room, the average entree is $10-$15 so $11 for an entree AND a margarita is really a steal. Hope this helps!
