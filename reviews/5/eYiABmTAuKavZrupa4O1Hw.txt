The best mexican restaurants are the ones where even after going through a whole basket of chips and salsa you still find room for your entree because it's that good.  

Let's just say that I'm glad that my office is about 6 blocks away because I needed to walk off not only the chips and salsa, but also the very tasty enchiladas verdes.
