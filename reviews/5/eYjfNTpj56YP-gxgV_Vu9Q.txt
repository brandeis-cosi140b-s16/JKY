I had been wanting to try Arriba for awhile. I am not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants. 
My cousin was in town to assist me while recovering from a surgery. He mentioned he wanted Mexican food. He graduated from the Scottsdale Culinary Institute and is a food snob, so I am VERY careful when I suggest a place. Arriba was in the list of Mexican places when I checked Yelp on my phone. I had been wanting to try Arriba  and so I warned him that I had not been there before. They did not let me down.

Chips - Hot when they came to the table (I like my chips served like that!).
The hot sauces and beans that come with it were good as well except the tomato based sauce - tastes like canned tomatoes. Luckily they have others to dip the chips in.

Ordered some Chili Verde on the side to see if I liked theirs. I did. Very much. Great with the chips too. 

I had the enchiladas with the three sauces.  Excellent!
He had the seafood enchiladas. He loved them. He gave me a portion to try. It was very good.
