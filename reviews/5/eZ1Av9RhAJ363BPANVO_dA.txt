Time for an update. We've been to Poncho's about five times now. The only disappointment was when we did the take-out window: got several tacos that were way over cooked. 

Tonight we arrived at 6:10 PM on a Wednesday. They had four parties in line, as usual. We waited 12 mins. 

My wife ordered #18 which was two Shredded Beef Tacos, beans and rice. I ordered #11, a Relleno, Green Chili Corn Tamale and a Cheese Enchilada. We added two margaritas for a $30 tab before tip. 

The #18 was very good. The beef had good flavor. The rice and beans: outstanding. I don't know if it's all scratch made but it sure tasted like it was. My #11 was very good. I love onions and the sauce was very heavy with onions. The Tamale was savory and huge. The enchilada was small but I still couldn't finish it. I haven't had a lot of rellenos so I'm not sure how it compared to others. 

Our server was attentive on a busy night, so ole there!

Still highly recommended.
