I wasn't particularly hungry but I'm a sucker for authentic Mexican and this place is pretty legit. I had a lengua taco and a pollo mole taco and washed it all down with some horchata. I also got to try the "not nachos" with chicken and some jamaica. Everything was delicious. I'll definitely be coming back.
