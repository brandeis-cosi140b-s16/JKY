This is a really good place to get some decent mexican food for the money. The menu is extremely easy navigate. There is self serve chips and salsa and they are relatively quick to serve your food since the menu is of composed of mainly the basics. The place is pretty small inside and doesnt seat that many people though if you plan on bring a big party for whatever reason.
