Found this place on yelp, I have never reviewed a place before and had to sign up for an account to review. I had the Honduran Carne Assada, it was prefect, the plantain was ripe, sweet and perfectly prepared. This is like getting real central American street food than fancy but perfect. We had guacamole that was obviously prepared after we ordered it, very fresh. My friend had a burrito that was delicious. 
Don't go if you want fancy but do go for the great food.
