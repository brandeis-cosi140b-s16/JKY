We have been coming here for over three years and while the service has been up and down, the food has stayed at a 4-star level. We have had just about everything on the menu between myself, my wife and our daughter, There have been some misses, but after reading some of the negative reviews before me, I wonder what standards these people are applying.. It is a chain burrito place, not Pampano in NY. Yes they still only take cash, but they have an ATM. Like any place you go to eat, you should give it two tries before condeming it. Oh and RIck S, thanks for the review, but I'm guessing you have turned more people off with teh update, so I hope you don't go any other places I like.
