Hello again. Today we had the green chicken enchiladas, tinga tostada and a machete de alambre de pollo. Bombness!!!! Salsas are on point. Every thing tasted fresh and delishes. Only one set back.... My chicken in my enchiladas was hard. Imagine chicken left overs from the fridge left open. The top layer that gets hard is what seemed to be served. 
But still 5 stars for their great service and delicious menu. It was my wifes first time and she loved it. Their aguas are freshly made, not like the other restaurants that sometimes have old foam dried on the plastic container that ironicly is suppose to cycle the bevarege. For authentic fresh mexican food and drinks i highlt recommend los reyes del la torta
