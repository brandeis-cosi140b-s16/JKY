This place is amazing! you have to try the standard burger with bacon and cheese with a side of fresh cut a homemade fries and their secret sauce for dipping.  If you're in the mood for tacos I highly recommend the braised short rib tacos. They are fantastic! Nothing is frozen or premade here. It does take a while to make the food since everything is from scratch. It is well worth the wait, so be patient and dig in when it comes out fresh hot and juicy!
