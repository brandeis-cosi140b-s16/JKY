When our Los Angeles, Boston, Bay Area, and Louisiana foodie relatives come to town, where do they want to go first? To our neighborhood Mexican soul food spot, Los Sombreros. Trust me: this is not Tex-Mex. We all have our favorites: one of my sons loves the crab enchiladas, the other loves the puerco en chipotle, while my husband and I tend to go back time and time again to the chicken enmolada with mole poblano sauce. We always start with the guacamole and ask upon arrival for the kitchen to make sure they reserve a piece of the Mexican chocolate cream pie for us-- luscious. Tonight, after stressful days, we empty nesters knew it was a Los Sombreros night and headed in for our comfort food. Thankful that this treasure is here!
