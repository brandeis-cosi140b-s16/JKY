I went to Pitt for three years (I transferred in as a sophomore). I think I ate at Veracruz at least twice a week during my sophomore and junior years. I can't say enough about it! I miss the black bean burrito to this day. Cheap prices, huuuge burritos, and you gotta love that 10% Pitt student discount!! Try the guac and chips, also - AMAZING guac. One complaint -- they never give you enough chips, but I went in so often that they'd usually give me a second bag for free without even asking. Love!!
