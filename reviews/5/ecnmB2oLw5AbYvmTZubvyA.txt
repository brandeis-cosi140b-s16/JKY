EGG-cellent inebriated location for those late night munchies. 

I had Tacos El Gordo in San Diego...and they were absolutely delicious...and I was sober. One can only imagine how much more I would have enjoyed them if I werent sober.

So remember this...

It has been a long and fun night of fist pumping to insane EDM music...your drunk because for some reason your liver thinks its a god in vegas...you dont want to travel far becuase your lazy...and you dont want to overpay because your cheap. So where do you go?

TACOS EL GORDO is your solution!

-TACOS EL GORDOs is probably the best tacos in Vegas
-TACOS EL GORDOs is as authentic as it gets
-large variety of proteins to choose from
-closes late!
-located at the end of the strip
-taste absolutely amazing...especially when drunk
-cheap!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^
