We started out at a different Mexican place but sadly they had closed at 4. So back to Yelp we went. Came across this place and decided we'd give it a try despite having to drive a ways from our hotel. All I can say is WOW!! When we first walked in, she asked if we'd been there before and since we hadn't have us a taste of each different type of meat they offered. Every single one was delicious and full of flavor! I ended up with the green chile pork super nachos and the hubby got 3 large tacos. The food here is AMAZING and I promise you won't be disappointed!!!
