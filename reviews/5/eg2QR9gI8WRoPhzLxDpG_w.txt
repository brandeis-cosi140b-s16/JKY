Even though Serranos has a few chain restaurants, it has to be the most authentic tasting chain Mexican restaurant in Arizona.  I got the chicken fajitas and they were literally sizzling.  What I enjoyed about my meal was the serrano chilis they put to add a little kick to the fajitas.  Another one of my criterias for a good Mexican restaurant is the salsa, since I literally pour salsa all over my food.  They had kind of a bean dip salsa and a regular salsa, and both taste really good together.
