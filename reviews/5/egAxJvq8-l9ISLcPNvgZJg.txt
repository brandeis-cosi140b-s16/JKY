Holy Crap, I love this place!!  I had the Shrimp and Octopus Molcajetes.  Not at all what I was expecting but probably one of the best Shrimp and Octopus dishes ever.  The dish comes in a boiling hot lava rock caldron that can barely contain all of the flavor literally bursting out of it.  One of these can easily be split between 2 people so you can try any one of a myriad of other delicacies this place has to offer.  One of which is the Fish Ceviche Tostada.  Which by the way they literally PILE the ceviche on top of a tostada.  If I was at home I would be able to make two tostadas for as much fish as they pile on one....  but who am I to complain!  If you are in the area by all means stop in this place and prepare for a feast!!
