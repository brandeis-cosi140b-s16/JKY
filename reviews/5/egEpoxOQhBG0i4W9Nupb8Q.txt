After Moes, Chipotle and even local joints like Phat Burrito, I have to say this place is the best burrito place in Charlotte HANDS DOWN. I've never gotten a burrito as full and thick as I have here for the price of all the other places.

Their salsas are even amazing. This place was crowded and the service was even fast.

Must try for those craving a burrito.
