My family and I were in Las Vegas and needed something to eat.

 KFC was not an option there but driving by, we did see El Pollo loco which kind of made me want to try thanks to Spanish Class.

 First walking in, it smelled sooo good but what made me stop my tracks were the burnt looking chicken on the grill. I had the moment where I was like "Lets get out." But my mom wanted the family meal so oh well.

We had recieved a huge meal which was apparently too big for the small hotel tables. The churros were amazing as was the salad. Too much tortillas and not enough rice and beans was my dad's opinion.

The chicken was AMAZING! The thought of the burnt chicken on the charcoal went poof out of my mind. It was crispy on the outside and so flavorfull on the inside. 

We ended up going there at least 2 times before leaving.
 (The second time we took it to Red Rock Caynon for lunch)

All i'm thinking is, WHY isn't there El Pollo Loco in Virginia?
