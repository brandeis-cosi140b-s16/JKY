I want to return to Phoenix just to eat here again! This place is a total hole in the wall filled with locals. Its cheap and delicious! I got the carnitas meal and it was a big serving of meat with rice, beans and fresh warm tortillas. It was probably some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. I will definitely be back the next time I am in the area. Maybe they could expand and open up in NYC?
