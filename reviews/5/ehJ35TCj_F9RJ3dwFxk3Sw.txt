I couldn't recommend Frijoles enough!! We LOVED it!! The food is fresh and sooo flavorful. The juices are yummy. Not sure which one to pick? They will let you sample them first. We had the chicken tacos which were stuffed to the brim, chicken salad, fresh guacamole and mexican corn. Everything was wonderful! The employees are all so hard working, providing great service and their attention to cleanliness was nice to see. They wear gloves when handling food and I observed them always cleaning, cleaning, cleaning.  I was sorry to leave my vacation in Las Vegas, mainly because I will miss this place. This kind of food is hard to find.
