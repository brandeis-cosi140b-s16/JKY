Found this place on yelp, and it was everything that everyone was raving about; absolutely awesome and delicious! We were a little skeptical at first because it's right next to Saphire (a strip club) and we were bringing our 3 year old niece, but there was nothing to worry about. They even have a children's menu, where the meals come with churros for dessert!  The chef even came to our table, chatted with us, and gave us his business card. Five stars all around: service, food, drinks, atmosphere, vibe! We will definitely be going back!!
