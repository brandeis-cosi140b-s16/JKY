went back again today, still awesome. They have special a few days a week and today just so happened to be "It's Tuesday, a dozen oysters are only 99 cents" day. Holy mother of pearl! So  I had the oysters, a small shrimp ceviche and the bomb.com crab tostada. All awesome. Oysters super fresh and shucked to perfection, not all torn up. I stopped by the QT on the way home and got a tall can of Chelada and BAM! I'm official! Get there!
