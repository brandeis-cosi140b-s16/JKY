We had enjoyed an amazing brunch at the original LV location in Mandalay Bay, so were excited to see the new location at the Forum Shops at Caesars, which is much more centrally located on the Strip.  We had lunch there today and were not disappointed.  The new space is clean and stylish, and though you will pay more than you would for taco truck or mission burrito fare, you really can't compare these beautiful and sublime plates to the mexican street food we are all used to.  We shared the carne asada nachos and the chicken poblano enchiladas.  Every bite popped with flavor and texture, the seasonings were spot on, and we kept eating long after we were full simply because the food was so delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try some other food next time we are in town, maybe next time we will cozy up at the ceviche bar?
