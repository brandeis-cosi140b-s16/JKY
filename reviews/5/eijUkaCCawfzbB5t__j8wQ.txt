Great horchata and the servings were big. A great deal for your money. The shredded beef in my burro was so good and also had onions, peppers, cheese and tomato. The tortilla was so soft and... just perfect. My enchilada w/ red sauce was delicious. Definitely will be back. Everything was hot and stayed hot the entire time. It's just an all-around solid authentic Mexican food place.
