You'd never guess how great this place is if you're one to judge a book by its cover. The location is less than desirable, but the food is AMAZING.  Probably the best chicken burrito bowl I've had.  You know it's good when the signs, the staff and the TV show in the background: all in Spanish.  Will I come back to this place: absolutely.  In the next week:  there is high probability.
