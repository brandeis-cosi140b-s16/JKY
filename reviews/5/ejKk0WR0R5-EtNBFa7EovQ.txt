If you are looking for some authentic Mexican charcoal fire grilled chicken, look no further! The chicken at Pollo Picante is great! The chicken was cooked perfectly over a charcoal flame and seasoned just right. Prices are great as well. Half a chicken, 2 sides, tortillas, grilled jalapeno, pickled onions, lime and salsa for less than $8! That's what I call a deal. Lucky for me the owner stopped into my place of business which is right down the street to let us know about his restaurant. Do yourself a favor and check them out. I am glad I did!
