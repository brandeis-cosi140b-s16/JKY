Visited this based on the Yelp recommendations.  It did not disappoint!  Looks a little grotty from the outside, and seems typically tacky on the inside.  Good thing the food is crazy delicious.  Almost makes me wish I still lived in Mesa, just so I could visit weekly.  Instead I will have to plot my next visit and merely dream of taquitos.
