One of my girlfriend had recommended this place to me a long time ago.  Ever since then, when my hubby and I make our trip to LV it is a MUST for us to go to this cute lil restaurant in PH!  Their prices for their food can be a bit pricey, but very tasty.  I especially love this place for their delicious raspberry margarita!!  OMG so yummy.  Their bartender makes it with fresh fruit on the spot, two thumbs up!  Service is great here too. A must try!
