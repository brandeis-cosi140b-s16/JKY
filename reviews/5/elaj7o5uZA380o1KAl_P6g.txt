I may have found my new favorite Chipotles! The other two locations I went to it was a pain in the ass to just get up to the door because they had so many inclines to get up and being in a wheelchair makes it hard to enjoy a nice burrito. 

Then this place on charleston saved my life! No inclines and a very spacious interior made my burrito munching a pleasure!

When I went up to the line to order my delicious burrito the display was low enough for me to see the ingredients. When asked if it was my first time here . I said yes and they comped my beverage!! How nice! Very friendly staff ! 

I will be a frequent customer to this location. 

Awesome!
