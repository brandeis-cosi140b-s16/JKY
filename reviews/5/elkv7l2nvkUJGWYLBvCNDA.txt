___________________________________

My new favorite spot for late night cheap eats on the Strip. If we had one in the Bay Area, I'd definitely be going on a regular basis. The tortillas are hand made and the meat is juicy, tender, and well-flavored. 

Tacos el Gordo is a favorite amongst locals and well-informed tourists alike, and for good reason.

Favorites: Adobada (Spicy Pork), Suadero (Beef Shoulder), Lengua (Beef Tongue), Tripa (Tripe).
