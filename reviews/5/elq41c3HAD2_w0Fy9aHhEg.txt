I eat Beef!  I love the stuff.
Especially Carne Asada and today I had America's Carne Adada.
It rocked.  Especially with the addition of a little lime juice that the Carne Asada comes with.

Cute little place with a no-nonsense menu.
They make what the like to make and are good at it.
Don't need anything else.

Support local business, America's is on my list.
