Bomb ass tacos!  I could eat here everyday. I'm feeding 3 adults (one pregnant) and a 3 year old for $25 PLUS these tacos are so good, it'll make you wanna slap yo mamma. No more "make me a sandwich", it's now " go get me some tacos". They need an el mirage chapter, because we've got jack shit out there, and I REALLY LOVE these tacos. Please?
