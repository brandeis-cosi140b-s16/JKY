Chipotle is my weakness! This one is near my house, almost too close. I have visited other Chipotle's around town but this is the one that of course I favor constantly. I have never come here and had to stand in a long line like the one near the outlet malls. I am usually in and out in less than 10 minutes and I like that. 

I think the food tastes nice and fresh with some good flavor. I usually get chicken tacos with just lettuce, cheese, and pico on it. Simple to the point and so yummy! If I have been a good girl I will get some chips and guac. I love their guac, I am drooling right now. 

This particular stop is always clean, fast and the service is always friendly. I don't think I can think of one time when I have had bad service here. That definitely helps me visit this location more often.
