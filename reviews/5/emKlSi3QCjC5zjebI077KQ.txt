Hands down, our new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas. The service was incredible - and what an unexpected place, from looking at it from the street.

I don't even like tamales, and these were incredible. The salsa is to die for.
The michelada was cold and refreshing.

The only negative was the Sangria - it had an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, that I personally was not a fan of. The waiter notices I wasn't enjoying it, and offered to add more wine. That helped. 

We will definitely be back.
