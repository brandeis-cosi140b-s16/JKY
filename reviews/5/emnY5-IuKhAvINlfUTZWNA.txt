I was heading out of town to drive to AZ, and hadn't had breakfast or lunch, yet. Didn't want a sit down heavy meal, so I was going to go to Einstein's. But I saw Taco Y Taco come up on my Yelp searched, so I popped in to check it out.

The place looks visually clean and awesome. The opposite of all the hole in the wall Mexican places I was brought up on in San Diego. But another Yelper said it was the best tacos in Vegas. So I had to give it a shot.

The guy that helped me was super friendly, letting me sample three of their meats even after I had already ordered the 2 he recommended. Great customer service.

The tacos weren't very big and were $2.25 each, so they're about double what I want them to be priced at. I almost gave them 4 stars due to the price, but they were so friendly I have to give them 5.

Oh, and there was a DJ spinning in the restaurant when I was there. Only in Vegas, amIright?
