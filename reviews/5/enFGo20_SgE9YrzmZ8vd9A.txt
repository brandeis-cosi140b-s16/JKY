Gran Agave is definitely in my top three Mexican restaurants in the burgh.

Atmosphere:  
The restaurant itself isn't huge, but it's festively decorated, with plenty of seating.  Weekends are very popular, and they don't take reservations.  So I suggest checking it out on weeknight or for lunch.

Staff:
Amazing!  They are very attentive, and know their customer.  They are always willing to please, and I've never had bad service here. 

Food:
Of course this is why we go.  Delicious, fresh, and authentic.  I always order the chicken fajitas, or the chicken mole.  First of all the portions are HUGE.  My fiance and I typically share a platter and an appetizer.  Their chips are fresh, and the salsa is extremely good.  I've never had a bad experience with the food here.  Like they say in their menu, Mexican food is not spicy.  However being the Indian I am...I always ask for hot sauce, and they are always willing to oblige.  They have a house-made habanero sauce, that you can ask for by special request.  It's deadly good.
