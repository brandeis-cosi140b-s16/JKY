On our way to airport from Sedona and wanted to grab a quick bite of authentic Mexican food.  Found Tacos Kissi thru Yelp and was very pleased with Francisco's help asking me if it was my first time there and what kind of food I liked.  He showed me the condiment bar and all the different items to dress my tacos. Also,had bean soup that complemented the tacos. Very good food, really wish I would have tried his wife's Mexican Sushi too. Nice family owned business and great to see them all operating together.
