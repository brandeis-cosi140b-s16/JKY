They are owned by McDonalds*. Anyone of the Yelp persuasion would have to want to hate them for this; but can they? I can not.

I would like my apartment to look exactly like a Chipotle with a big comfy couch. The decorating is just industrial, modern, hip. The jazz and blues piping in over the brished metal just makes me want to hang out all day; as does a stomach full of huge burrito.

The burritos are huge and delicious. I go barbacoa every time...Choice of beans? I like my beans like I like my women...Pinto. I actually get black and they rarely laugh at this joke.

Everything tastes freshly made. I even love the chips and guac. What do they do to those chips to make them so delightful? The savior of fast food joints at last!


*I was just informed that they are no longer owned by McDonalds.
