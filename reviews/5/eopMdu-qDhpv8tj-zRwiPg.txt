From 3/7/15
This Don Tortaco is located in the Sahara Pavilion and is open 24/7. We came here for some nonTex-Mex Mexican and got exactly what we expected. It's a cool little place, with a decent amount of seating. The cool factor about this location is it is a side door adjacent to PT'S pub, so when you're done drinking you can come in here to soak up all the booze you consumed.

I got the number 8 which is the tamale meal, and my boyfriend got the chimichangas. I enjoyed my food, the tamales were great, the beans and rice were tasty. I like the fact that they put cheese on the beans and what I think might be parm to top them off with too. 
The service here is quick, and the staff is friendly. I will come back here for sure to try their other dishes.
