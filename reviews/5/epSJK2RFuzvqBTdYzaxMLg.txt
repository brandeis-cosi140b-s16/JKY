Alright ,so I have been here a time or two. Maybe about 20 times to be exact.
Every time I have ever been here, I have never been dissapointed.
This place is great!
The food is great, the service is good and fast.
The place is spotlessly clean. They seem to always be busy.
They are busy I am sure because,everyone feels the way that I do.
This place is great!
I really like all the different salas they offer and you can have as much as you like!
Thank you Rubios for always being delish! As well as always being fresh and having really great tasting fish tacos.
