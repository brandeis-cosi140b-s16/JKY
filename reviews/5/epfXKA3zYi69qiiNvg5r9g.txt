I love this place.  In fact before I bought my house, still in the area, I intentionally moved into an apartment to be near a Chipotle. This location is the best.  The food is ALWAYS fresh... even before they close the food looks fresh and hot and full...they're never scraping the bottom of the container...and the moment you think they are they reach back and pull from the heavens a brand new hot container of Barbacoa... or you see the guys in the back tossing that delicious cilantro and lime rice in a giant bowl... I order the same thing...always... 
A burrito bowl... extra scoop of white rice... no beans, fajita mix , barbacoa, sour cream, and cheese.... i always get mild, medium, and guacamole on the side and i always get a small quesadilla cooked nice and well done... i top all of this off with my favorite apple juice ever... Nantucket Apple juice... the people here are always pleasant....when i come the line is normally long but i don't blame them... i blame people who don't have their order ready or wait til they get to the front and then start asking questions... i liken this to the Starbucks of Mexican food... people who know what they want KNOW WHAT THEY WANT... others seem confused by the cafeteria like line... but eh.. they'll get use to it... because it is amazing food.
