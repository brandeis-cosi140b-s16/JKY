Came here for the first time with girlfriends for a weekend lunch and loved it.  Brought a headhunter and his team here for a work-related (aka:  Please hire me!!) dinner and they raved and raved about the food.  Excellent vibe, service, and the bartender was extremely patient with our creative ideas regarding cocktails.
