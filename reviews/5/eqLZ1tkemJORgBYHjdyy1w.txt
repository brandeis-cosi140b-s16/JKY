Went there for dinner last night, Sunday, November 18, 2012. Ambiance was great, attentive from the moment you walked in, every person working there was smiling, now lets get to the food, what can I say it was fabulous. We started with the guacamole, made table side, they had little jars of condiments and asked you what you would like in it, it was delicious. My son had the Tacos al pastor, they had bits of pineapple in them and smelled and tasted wonderful (we all shared and had a bite of every ones order) I had the Enchiladas de Camerones....what are you kidding me, the shrimp was sweet and succulent, served with a sour cream poblano sauce that made my eye roll to the back of my head. My father had the Enchiladas Veracruz, which was a chicken enchilada with tomatillo sauce and queso fresco, old adage to "Die For". We topped off our meal with flan that was so smooth and light, my dad had the Mexican Apple Pie, with a Mexican Brandy butter and homemade cinnamon ice cream. I had the Mango Tres Leches cake, all I can say is that this cake deserves it's own holiday, it should be celebrated. If you have a chance to go there, what are you waiting for.....FANTASTIC!
