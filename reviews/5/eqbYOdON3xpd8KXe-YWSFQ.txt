Food was good.. fried fish kind of small but what do you expect when ur in the middle of the desert. .the menudo was very very good...waitresses are very helpfull and keep checking up to see if everything was good...it was to early to drink beer ...my only issue i had is that one of the waitress ... not the waitress that was helping us.......was chewing gum mexican style... i was waiting for her to pop it while she walked..
