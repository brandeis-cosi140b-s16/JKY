This location Just opened  3weeks ago-so its clean and pristine.Its not popular yet so there is absolutely no wait for your food.The food was good,fresh and tasty.Will definately go back and bring my husband.Am also recommending it to all my friends.
Hope the location becomes a success,it could be a one stop place when you come home from out of town.Way to go super Burrito!
