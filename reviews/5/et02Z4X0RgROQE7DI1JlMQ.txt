This place is a hidden gem!

Please don't let the surrounding area deter you from this fine establishment! 

Staff: unbelievably friendly from beginning to end! Hector, our waiter, was patient throughout the many questions we had and even have us a complimentary ceviche dish to start! 

Food: O.M.G! In order of our favorites:
1) molcajete. GET THIS!!! It is basically a volcano of saucy lava that is erupting with steak, chicken, shrimp, and fish. It is served with rice, beans, and tortillas and is made for two or three people to share. It is made in either a green tomatillo (mild) sauce or a red diablo (spicy) sauce. I liked the diablo more bc it had such amazing flavor. 
2) guacamole: best ive ever had!!
3) Shrimp in cream sauce: yummmm. Great flavor!
4) Shrimp and octopus in garlic sauce - also good
5) shrimp tacos - just okay. Would choose the above over these

Finally, don't forget to check in on yelp!! Show your waiter and you get a big free slice of cake!!
