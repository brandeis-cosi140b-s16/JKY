What a delicious unique restaurant.. Not unique because of the food but because of the environment and the service.  Food - It's Mexican food.  All you have to do is close to right and it is delicious.  They easily took care of that.  I have the Johnny Carnitas Tacos and they were amazing.  The service is what blew me away.  They really know how to take care of the customer.  We sat in the bar area and were immediately greeted and our drinks were taken care of.  They told us all about the margarita options and the servers knew all everything about the dinner choices.  It was truly a wonderful experience that I look forward to experiencing again.  Tip top service, beautiful surroundings, and excellent food.  You wont be disappointed.  Enjoy!
