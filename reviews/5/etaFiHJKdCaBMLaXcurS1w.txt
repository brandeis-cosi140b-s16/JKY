My two tacos were perfect!   The carnitas were delicious, crispy without the fat.  The fish tacos were super crunchy with a creamy sauce.  The salsas were so fresh.  The habanero had the heat but did not overpower the flavor.  My favorite was the green.  Can't wait to try other items from their menu.
