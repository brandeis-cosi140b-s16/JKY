I think I've made my face pretty well-known at this venue since it opened last month. Friendly staff and management, clean restaurant and that fresh Chipotle flavor everyone should know and love by now. 
This neighborhood needed a Chipotle! I only hope Trader Joe's is next to fill some of the empty retail space.
