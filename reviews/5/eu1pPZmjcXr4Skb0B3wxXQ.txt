We had a bad experience stopping at a random Mexican restaurant in Sonora,TX in our way to Huntington Beach from Houston so we looked up the DDD website and found Barrio Cafe, it has a lot of personality and the food is really good, I had the corn soup, my husband had the fish tacos and we shared the churros which had the best homemade vanilla ice cream ever, we finish everything and left happy.
