On my first visit here, I was very impressed to see they have vegetarian dishes on the menu.  They can make these dishes vegan if you ask.  The food is AWESOME, the service is AWESOME and the staff is very friendly and tends to your needs.

This place is worth the drive no matter where you are.  The food is some of the best mexican food I have had in this town.  This is a repeat place for me as there are so many things I want to try here and like I said, you will NOT be disappointed.
