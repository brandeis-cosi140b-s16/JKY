Their breakfast burritos are awesome, mostly because their tortillas are amazing. The chips and salsa are really good as well. We've enjoyed anything we've ever eaten here. 

The only downsides, which aren't even worth deducting a star, are that the tea never tastes fresh and their hours/days could be better.
