I was craving Mexican and saw this walking to the valet at the Forum Shops. 

The chicken enchiladas and rice and beans were so good. Bae and I shared the flautas and the enchiladas and we still didn't eat it all! We were so full but everything was so good. I also love the salsa here! At first they bring out everything mild but then we asked for something spicier and it was SO yummy!
