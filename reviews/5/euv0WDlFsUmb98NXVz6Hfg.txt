Extremely clean and well maintained with fantastic tacos!

This place is awesome. Went for the taco plate (five tacos for $6.25). They are stuffed full of flavor and might be the best I've had so far in my quest for the best taco in Vegas. The restaurant, despite it's age and fast food atmosphere, is well maintained and clean. Great staff and the orders are made quick.   

It's worth nothing that they have a location on Jones and Charleston that also does a fantastic job. However, the tacos are not the same. The Trop location serves up a slightly different taco with a little more kick. 

Don't forget, help both the staff and yourself by hitting the tip jar when you order!
