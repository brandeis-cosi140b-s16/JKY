While your in Vegas do yourself a favor and start going north on Las Vegas Blvd. Once you see a strip mall near crappy hotels like The Riviera and Circus Circus you're at Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana taco joint that is also now in the U.S. They have locations in San Diego, Vegas and Temecula. Having tried the real deal in TJ, I was skeptical that the Vegas one would not be as good. But it is just as good. When you first walk in its a little hectic and confusing. They have separate lines for different meats.  All the tacos are good but their best is the Al Pastor or Adobada. It's a  thinly sliced marinated pork on a rotating spit. Make sure to order plenty of tacos and ask for the green salsa and cebollitas (onions) and chiles.  I also highly recommend the Adobada quesadilla and Adobada fries which is French fries with a ton of Adobada meat. This place is heaven for any taco loving glutton. I've had tacos all over Mexico and can honestly say these are the best tacos you will find in the United States. I was trying to keep this place a secret but judging from the lines there and number of reviews the secret is out. The Vegas location is full of tourists so it's key to go there at the right time which is early for lunch or early evening for dinner. During the 2am drunken hour this place is a zoo.
