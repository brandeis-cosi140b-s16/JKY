On our way to Sedona and used yelp to determine where to stop. Easy location off highway. Staff is super friendly. Authentic food. We ordered chicken Mexican pizza and it was great. Large. Their salsa is good, tad different but wonderful. Warm chips served. We split the 3 combination plate with 2 tacos and enchilada. Looks like a amazing outdoor patio. Huge disappointment to be told 40 minutes on fresh tortillas. It's the item they brag on and not available. 
We arrived at 2:30pm but full parking lot and lots of full tables. Fresh tortillas are the reason we venture out to authentic Mexican. 
Tacos were ok. Enchilada was wonderful.
