Here is how you eat at Tradiciones: Select group of people, preferably more than two. If all are drinking, order pitcher of margaritas, ideally fruit flavored.  Mango is an excellent choice.  Order appropriately sized Parillada (family platter) accordingly.  Platter for 2 comfortably feeds three or four.  Platter for 4 comfortably feeds six to eight.  The platters prompt you to pick three meats. I highly recommend the shrimp, pork and chicken.  Mexican sausage is also good, but not as universally crowd pleasing.  You will automatically get chips and two kinds of salsa (one green, one red) which in my opinion are quite good. With the platter you receive tortillas (I prefer flour(I also prefer parentheses, apparently))rice, beans, guacamole, nopalitos, grilled tomato, and grilled onions.  This is all served on a cast iron skillet of sorts, placed on top of a candle-based warmer. Embrace the fact that the mariachi band will come to your table and want to play a song and ideally solicit a couple bucks.  Know a mariachi song, request it and enjoy it.  You are essentially in Mexican Disneyland.  Eat until you are ready to bust.  To avoid an unfortunate food coma driving disaster, wander around the attached Ranch Market grocery store marvelling at the brightly colored pastries, tortilla conveyor belt and whole cow head in the butcher case. Revel in the fact that the two person platter is only $24.95, the four person platter $48.95, and fruit-flavored margaritas for four were $24, blow the savings on Mexican candy or a Spiderman pinata. Drive home, pass out with a giant smile on your face.  
   Sunday Brunch is also really good.  Incredible variety of food, including an omelette bar and chocolate fountain, last I checked all for $14.95.  I kind of blew the climax of this review with the brunch thing didn't I?
