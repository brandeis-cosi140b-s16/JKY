This review needs few words.  Amazing food, great ambiance and CLEAN! Did I mention the place was clean?  Our server Kimberly was great and with the Hibachi style serving Francisco helped us seize our food.  Okay, started off with shrimp
Ceviche, very fresh, just right on the cilantro. I had the brisket enchiladas delicious and my wife had the chicken burrito which was excellent as well! Their habanero sauce is spicy and a good compliment to any dish.  Definitely will be coming back and telling our friends
