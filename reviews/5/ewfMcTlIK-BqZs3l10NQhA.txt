My first time here. I wish it was not so far from my house! One of the best taco joint I have stumbled across yet! Delicious chips and salsa and tacos were amazing! Extremely reasonable price! Very clean restaurant! The staff were very friendly and accommodating! The wait was not very long either and it makes it easier that they give you a basket of free chips and salsa from the salsa bar while you wait! I will be back if I find myself on this side of town again!
