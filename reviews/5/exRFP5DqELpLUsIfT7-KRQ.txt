This was my first time dining at Abuelo's and I found the service, food, and swirls to be fantastic. The restaurant was moderately busy at noon for lunch. Everyone in the area should be here for lunch!  They have great lunch specials and from what I have heard an amazing Thurs night prime rib dinner. If you haven't been to Abuelo's you should dine there.
