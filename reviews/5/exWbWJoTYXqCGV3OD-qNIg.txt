This little hole in the wall restaurant is my absolute favorite place to eat Mexican food in the entire valley! The breakfast burritos simply cannot be beat, the carne asada is delicious, and the tacos are to die for. It is definitely worth the 30 minute drive for me to get to. Probably a good thing it isn't any closer though... I'd be there every day :-)
