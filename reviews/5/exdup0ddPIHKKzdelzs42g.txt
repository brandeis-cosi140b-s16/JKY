So I stopped here again for the first time since 09.  It was August of 2014.  I'm glad it is still here since this whole area of Phoenix is dying out due to what I assume land buy out from Sky harbor airport.  Anyway, service was fast and prompt!  And the food just as I remember.  Pitic is a must stop for me before I head home to California.
