Great place for Mariscos in AZ!!! Seriously this place has the best ceviche in town it rivals with my favorite spot in Mexico. The tostadas de ceviche come with sliced avocado on top, which is delicious. I have had their fish & shrimp tacos and they are delicious as well. I've also had their margaritas and micheladas they are the perfect drinks to enjoy with Mariscos!! if you are not used to traditional Mexican seafood this place might not be for you.... they have a jukebox which is always playing Spanish music which is awesome if you were raised with this type of music. The prices are pretty reasonable as well for the amount of food you get. I truly enjoy the food and service here!!! Be adventurous and check it out!!!
