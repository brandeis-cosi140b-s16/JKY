Since I work close to this restaurant, I visit often. With the Habanero Mexican Grill only a few more miles away, it is always a tough choice in which to go. El Poblano's is not a fancy restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, but if you are looking for great tasting food and very reasonable prices, by all means check them out.
My standard order is the Steak (Asada) Burrito which I have never been disappointed with. 
I have had the el Pastor tacos and burrito which I always consider when making my choice, the tacos especially are good.
A few weeks ago I did go outside the box and ordered the enchilada, it only comes with chicken and I was a bit disappointed. The chicken was very dry and the sauce was less than desirable, but it all in all was edible just the same. Just not the quality I have come to expect from them.
I could make a meal out of the chips and salsa, yes the chips are not fresh, but tasty, and today I tried the hot salsa, YUMMY!!
In the spring and summer they also have buckets of tomatos and peppers along the outside of the building, and I would like to think they use these in their food. Great Idea-I stole it from them (the idea not the vegetables)

All in all I do enjoy going there and as any local business that is starting out, I hope they survive, and people discover this restaurant, service is great, food is excellent, and location location location!!

Oh as a side note-the bakery is awesome also!!! Got these huge cresent roll type things that are incredible for making a sandwich-light fluffy and extremely tastey!!!
