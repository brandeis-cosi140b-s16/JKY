Love this place! The Mussels are awesome! You will want a straw to slurp up the sauce they come in. Luckily they serve bread with them so you can sop up the sauce. I also like the braised rib tacos. I like them so much I have ordered them two times in a row! Get chips and sals while you wait and don't add salt to the chips, they are pre-salted and perfect the way they are! Great place for lunch or dinner!
