Service is slow but worth the wait. Tried everything from Quesadilla (An authentic version with beans and cheese) to fajitas (also authentic with spicy red sauce) to Huevos Rancheros (Oh so heavenly) and Open faced cheese enchiladas. This is where I stop. 
Open face cheese enchiladas came with eggs, and a variety of sides.

Have you ever heard a song that gave you the shivers? It was kind of like that. I took one bit of my concoction (I put the egg wrapped in the enchilada, beans, rice, salsa, sour cream?) 
And my mind exploded. It was the MOST heavenly thing I have EVER tasted. 
Ever.
However, I have not gone back and ordered it again becuase.. I dont want to ruin the memory. Of this perfect moment in culinary heaven. I dont want to over-eat it. It was... so.. delicious. And I had their sopapillas which come with meals with some beans and cheese in it after, which was a fine closure to the worlds perfect meal.

Service is always slow here, just like in Mexico ;D but all of the food is fresh and worth the wait.
Chips and salsa are 'alright'.
