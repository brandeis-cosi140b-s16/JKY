First time I had their food and it was phenomenal! I had family come down here from Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico and they were all tired of the same restaurant we always went to before and my uncle said you know what let's try somewhere different. So he found Rita's and let me tell you it was awesome and I don't ever regret coming here at all. I had their small white menudo bowl and I think today I'm gonna have their large white menudo bowl lol
