I had a lunch business meeting at this restaurant on 11/11/10. The location is amazing. There is plenty of parking. The d√©cor of the resultant is beautiful. My 1st impression is how attentive our wait staff was. I ordered the skirt steak with the Mexican corn, WOW!, it was sooo good. The food tasted very fresh. For dessert I had the flan and shared some churros with the table, the chocolate the churros came with was amazing, the waiter told me they make it in house with Mexican chocolate.. great move! Mundo did not disappoint, I look forward to many more meals here when I am in Vegas.
