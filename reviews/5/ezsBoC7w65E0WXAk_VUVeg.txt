Today was my first time coming here after hearing so many great things about this place and WOW I have to say that it lived up to the hype. The young lady at the front had great customer service wasn't bothered by me not knowing what I wanted she even gave me samples as to what she recommends. All around great the food was beyond tasty, I recommend this place to anybody I was also going to post a few pictures of the food but there goes to show you how good the food is I fell in love with the first bite and didn't get to take no pictures.
