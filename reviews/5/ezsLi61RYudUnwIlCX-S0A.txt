First of all...I love the Roadrunner Farmer's Market on Saturdays....It  has introduced to so many fun, yummy local foods, Molly's Tamales being one of those.
Tamales are one of my favorite bits of Mexican fare, the almighty enchilada being number one, and I'm always on the hunt for the perfect tamale.  I think I may have found it!  I have only enjoyed their goodies via the market and have yet to visit their actual establishment.
So far I have had the southwest chicken, chicken & spinach and my new all time favorite.....wait for it!   The wild Alaskan salmon tamale!  Yes, I know you purists are probably shouting blasphemy, but seriously, it is insanely good!  I had one for breakfast this morning:  holy crap!!!!!   
Here are your marching orders:
1.  Find Molly's Tamales...
2.  Buy some tamales...
3.  Eat them and scream in mouth-gasmy bewilderment!

PS - A successful reheating is necessary, so wrap it in a wet paper towel and nuke for 1 minute for the goodness...
