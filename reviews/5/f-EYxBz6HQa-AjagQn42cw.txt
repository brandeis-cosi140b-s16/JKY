I come here with my co-workers for lunch at least once every other week because we really enjoy the food.  On the outside, this place doesn't look like much, but this restaurant (which used to be called Mexico City) has excellent authentic Mexican food for a very good price.  I usually get the tacos Mexican style (one of the changes they made when they changed from Mexico City to Vicky's is you have to specify American or Mexican style).  Normally, I get one chicken taco and one steak taco.  Along with the free chips and salsa which they give you as soon as you sit down, it makes for a pretty filling lunch.  I've also gotten both enchiladas and quesadillas at the restaurant and have greatly enjoyed everything I've gotten. I also enjoy the "entertainment" as Vicky's always has on Mexican comedies. Although I have no idea what they are saying, it adds to the authenticity of the place. Vicky's is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh.
