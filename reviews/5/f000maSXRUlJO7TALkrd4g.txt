We went to Komex this trip...had to try the new location on Buffalo because the Decauter location was closed on Sunday....EVERY bit as wonderful and it was so hard to leave.  GREAT news is they sell their sweet/spicy Koren hotsauce by the pound, so will have to bring a leak proof container when we visit the kid again in April!!!  Woooo-Wooo....book a nonstop flight and do the same....SO worth it!!!  Had the Bulgogi nachos and our normal corn tortilla tacos...my sister, the pickiest eater EVER could NOT stop singing their praises!!!  She was even telling folks on the plane about them!!!  Thanks again Komex for the BEST dining experience our entire trip (and we enjoyed some world class cuisine!)  Will be back in April for sure!!!!
PS....PLEASE publish a cook book for those of us that live in other states and are in NEED of a KoMex experience!!!!  ;)
