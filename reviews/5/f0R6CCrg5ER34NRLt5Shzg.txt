I guess I get the 1 star for myself, for never coming back to give an update.  It has been several years since my first visit, but I have been back several times, and every time is a great experience.  Service is excellent, and you cant beat that trio salsa. Haven't been disappointed once. This is our go to mexican restaurant when we can't decide.
