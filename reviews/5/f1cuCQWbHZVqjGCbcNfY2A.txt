Yo Rita. I sincerely wake up in taco sweats, dreaming of the next time I can get my mouth around one of these decadent tacos. Unfortunately, I will not be able to soon--I moved to Austin, Texas. And while I'm on the subject of Austin, Texas, I have yet to taste a taco as creative and delicious as this little gem at the end of East Carson Street.

My boyfriend and I used to live closer to the Hot Metal Bridge side, so we would make it an event getting to walk down to that side of town, maybe even stopping into a pub for a happy hour cocktail and stopping at another on the way back for a night cap. We were always so excited to see what the new featured taco was.

Seating is incredibly limited here, so please don't wait until you're ravenous to eat, because its highly likely you'll wait. This made it incredibly taunting and I considered on more than one occasion reaching over and eating some chips off of someone's table.

Ah, their chips, though. Also incredible.

Everything about this place is perfect. Just go. And don't whine about the taco prices. They. are. worth. every. penny.
