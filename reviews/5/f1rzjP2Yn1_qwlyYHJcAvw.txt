This place is perfect if you want carne asada tacos that is about all they had besides quesadillas. The meat was full of flavor the taco was delicious .   I prefer my tacos with cilantro and onion which was no where to be found but it was just as delicious with cabbage and there salsas.  I would recommend this place for lunch. The place is tiny but it is super clean and they are friendly. Service was fast. I will definitely be back
