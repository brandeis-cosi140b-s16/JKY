Relaxed atmosphere. Chips and salsa at table are way above average. The carnitas street taco was delicious. The star of the meal was the street corn- OMG- I'd come back here and just order the street corn... Like 3! I had it off the cob to avoid the "corn in teeth" look. So amazingly delicious. Bonus- I didn't know they discount the tacos on Taco Tuesday!! Woo hoo! My amazing taco was $2.25!!!!!! I'm glad we tried this place! Thumbs up!
