Ahhhhhmeric's! I LOVE the bean & cheese burrito both America's & Terry's way!!! Also, the el pastor taco is a sure win! Not sure what else pastor is? Oh man, slow cooked marinated pork & they put slivered pineapple on top! Great chips & salsa! I usually get the mild salsa but I'm sure the spicy is delicious too! The food is always great! Fan for life! I find that it's a great place to pick up to go, but a nice enough casual dine in spot too! If you haven't tried it, you must! Plus, it's local! Yay!
