I love this place. Can't stop eatin' those carnitas tacos! Everything is good here. If you want to visit a neighborhood kinda establishment, not pretentious, just really good food. This might be your place. All kinds of interesting hot rod memorabilia, pictures of the owner with lots of celebrity types that also visit this very cool spot. Awesome!
