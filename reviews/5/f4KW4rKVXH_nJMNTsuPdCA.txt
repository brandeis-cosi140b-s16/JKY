Went here for the first time and it was Excellent!

Myself, Wife and kids all went here for the first time. We all were very impressed with all our meals. I went off the reviews off my phone, and tried it for myself. The great reviews are true, this place is really that good. Everything was top notch. I had the enchilada combo, the sour cream blend chicken was superb, as well as the others. Everything you can tell was made with care. We all were very impressed with the food and the quality and taste.
This will be my favorite Mexican food restaurant. 

It's just too bad it's soo far away from us...
