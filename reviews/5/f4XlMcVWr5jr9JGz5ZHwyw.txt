I don't understand how Filiberto's stays in business, and this excellent place is forced to bounce from location to location. One benefit of a new building: the cleanest eating area and kitchen I've ever seen in a taco shop. You could eat fondue off the ground here. The food is excellent, too, leaps and bounds over the chains. A great little place to quench that taco craving.
