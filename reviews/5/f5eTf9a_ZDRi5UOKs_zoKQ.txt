We were recently visiting Las Vegas for a conference. We drove up to Mount Charleston sight-seeing and decided to check Yelp for food in the area. We're so glad we found this restaurant!! It was so delicious, and the service was so very friendly and nice.
I chose beef fajitas. They were quite tasty, and I really enjoyed the zucchini and mushrooms that were included in the vegetable mix. 
At the end of the meal, one of the owners thanked us for coming in, and we mentioned we were from Nashville. He then had Leticia come over to meet us. They both seemed genuinely pleased to have visitors from so far away. Leticia then surprised us with a free serving of flan to share. It was so completely wonderful--the perfect consistency and taste! Delicious!! 
I've never felt so welcomed in a place. I look forward to visiting again. It's definitely worth the drive from the Las Vegas strip.
