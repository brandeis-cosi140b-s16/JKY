Tried the Bacon Egg and Potato breakfast burrito with cheese and also the Carne Asada burrito with guac and beans.  Exceptional burritos.  Ate both while watching people exercise in the gym.  Felt like my stomach would burst, but I think the burritos are worth a ruptured organ.  Oh and also a little thing that made me happy with the meal, they asked if I wanted salsa, and actually gave the right quantity of salsa cups.  I sometimes get frustrated with other burrito places that just give you one small cup of salsa, and I'm just like wtf bruh, is this salsa for brushing my teeth or what?  But again, excellent salsa and food at Phx burrito house, I was content with it.
