Ah, I miss the delicious crispy chicken tacos so much! Shredded white meat, perfectly season, fried in a corn tortilla until it is crisp but still tender and topped with cheese and lettuce. Can't find anything like it in California. Definitely stop here if you're in town. Great service and wonderful food!
