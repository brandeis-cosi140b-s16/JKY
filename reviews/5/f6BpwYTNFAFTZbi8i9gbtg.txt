Best tacos in Pittsburgh. I mean I'll gladly love to be one-upped but til that day comes, best tacos in Pittsburgh! Tacos lenguas is always my choice. They have a very plush selection of Mexican groceries too. Oh and I'm a sucker for flash, so of course I love that spinning barrel they have up front with the blow torch roasting peppers. It makes the whole block smell wonderful!
