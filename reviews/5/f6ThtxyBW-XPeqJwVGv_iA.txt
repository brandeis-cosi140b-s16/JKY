I went to Maverick Rock Taco the other night but they only had the bar open.  From what I could tell they were working on getting the kitchen ready for daily lunches and dinners.  I know they had some food service days prior for their "family and friends" so I liked the idea that they had shut the kitchen (even on a busy Saturday night) to make sure the kinks were worked out.

The menu looked great so we'll be back this week to try it out.  Also, loved the rock-n-roll theme, artwork, and tunes.
