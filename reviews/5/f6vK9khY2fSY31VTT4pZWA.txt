I've considered making a Yelp account for some time now so make note: Backyard Taco was the winning meal that sealed the deal.  
1. The best carne asada I've had in AZ
2. Tortillas are soft and fresh.  It tasted like they might have been lightly buttered which is as delicious as it sounds.
3. Fresh salsa bar with sides of cucumbers , radishes, and onions (try the onions).  
4. Friendly service 
5. Clean 

I ordered to-go and I wish I had ordered more.  Definitely returning soon!
