This place never disappoints. The staff is incredibly friendly, and generous with the portions of authentic Mexican food they serve. Also, the prices are incredibly cheap for how much work they put into their food. Definitely the first place I go to whenever I'm craving ethnic food. Love everything they do to spread the wonders of Mexican food throughout Vegas. Honestly, I do worry about food poisoning from small businesses such as this one, but I have never gotten sick from the dozens of visits I have paid to this place. Just a very happy stomach! To the people who complain about the location and how it isn't fancy or classy enough, just go to a casino and pay $50 for mediocre microwaved tacos. :) Or Taco Bell/Del Taco, and enjoy their poor excuse for "Mexican" cuisine.
