I've been in Arizona for 11 years and finally we have found a Mexican restaurant that we love.  In two days I've eaten here twice.  First day I had their street tacos and day two I had their carnitas and they were both excellent.  Anaya's is clean, comfortable, great prices and tasty.  I highly recommend it!
