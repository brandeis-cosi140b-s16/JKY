Delicious empanadas! The best I've ever had. So crispy and fresh, amazing flavors, not overly spiced, just perfect. The green cilantro sauce was also delicious! I had the passion fruit/milk drink and enjoyed that as well. Staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Charlotte! Atmosphere is just okay, but I wouldn't be coming here for that-the food and hospitable staff are the winners here :)
