Picked up dinner to go and was blown away by the shredded marinated chicken burrito. This shop just opened up so it is still in its beginning stages, but they are doing the most important thing right which is the quality of the food. The couple that owns the restaurant recently moved here from Canada. They are very friendly, helpful and know what they're dong. This place won't stay secret for long! If you are looking for delicious, top notch mexican food with a hint of spice and Canadian charm that won't break the bank, this is the place to be!
