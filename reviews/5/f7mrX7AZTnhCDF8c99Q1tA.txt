It's been years since I've had El Pollo loco! We used to always eat here growing up in Cali. A few years or so ago, El pollo loco restaurants opened up in Georgia where I live now. I was super excited and my family and I ate there at least once a month (we lived 40 mins away). Everything was good until they just closed. My family was pretty bummed about it. 
We were in Vegas for a few days last week for vacation and of course, we had to eat at our favorite grilled  chicken place. This location was close to our hotel. The food was delicious as we remembered. We got the family meal and also the new shrimp tacos. Everything was great and delicious. One of our boys who only had El pollo loco a few times when they were briefly opened in Georgia kept saying, " I forgot how the food tasted but now that we're eating it again, I know why you love it so much". If you like chicken, you have to go to El Pollo Loco.
Btw, if you need to go to the bathroom, you have to ask the cashier for a token. You then take the token and insert it in the lock on the bathroom door. It was pretty neat. Haven't seen anything like that before.
