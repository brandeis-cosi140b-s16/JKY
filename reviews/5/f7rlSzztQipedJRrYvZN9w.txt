Went to Padres last night with my best gal pal for the umpteenth time, and as usual, I was incredibly pleased.

We sat in the far back room off the patio and it was so lovely. There was a light breeze flowing in that was just as refreshing as my mojito. Ahhhhhh Mojitos. That thing kicked me on my ass!

As usual, we started with the guacamole, and as usual, it was incredibly tasty. The chips were fresh and the two accompanying salsas were delish.

I usually get the enchiladas, but since I am now vegan, that is out of the question. I opted for the three tostadas, and it was a great choice. Crunchy corn shell, fresh veggies, and really tasty black beans made a great base for the vat of the tomatillo sauce I poured on. Man I love that sauce.

Our service was incredibly friendly, like always, and even when the kitchen made a mistake it was correctly quickly and correctly.

Padres is one of those places I always forget how much I love until I go back, and upon my arrival, our romance ensues for another magical evening, and as I leave, I whisper gently,  "I'll call you Padres, I'll call you."
