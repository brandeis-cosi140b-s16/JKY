Best Fish Tacos I have ever had. I came here based on a recommendation and I expected fast food quality food but was happily surprised with how good their fish tacos were.

I got the Fish Taco Especial plate which is the Original Fish Taco topped with handmade guacamole, jack and cheddar cheese and a cilantro/onion mix.

If you're looking to mix up the normal burger or sandwich I would recommend Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill for their fish tacos!
