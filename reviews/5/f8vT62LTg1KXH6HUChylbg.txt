We love Tortilla Fish! We went tonight for the first time at this location for the free taco opening night! As expected, the fish tacos were awesome, the French fries were perfect and everything from the salsa bar was excellent! There are so many toppings, salsas and sauces to try at the salsa bar! Fast, cheap, amazing food! Looking forward to coming back to try the new carne asada!
