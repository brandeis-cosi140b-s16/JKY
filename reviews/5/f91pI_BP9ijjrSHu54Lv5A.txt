My husband heard about this restaurant and had been dying to try it, and I was anxious to try some local flavor. It is a smaller restaurant, which adds to the ambiance. There was a ton of beautiful local artwork on the walls, along with a boatload of writeups and rave reviews. I knew we were in a great place. The menu had all kinds of great items, which made it hard to choose an entree. I picked the shrimp tacos with spicy fries and he had the Pescado Veracruz. We also had the guacamole made fresh table-side. Everything was delicious, expertly seasoned and full of flavor. We didn't get to try any margarita's this go round, but plan to try those on the next visit.
