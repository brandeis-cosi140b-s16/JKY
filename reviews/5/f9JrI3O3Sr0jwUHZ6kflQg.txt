I found myself at Fat Boy at the request of a great friend and co-worker who possesses a rather refined pallet.  This small, unassuming venue nestled in behind a busy illanteria, was the surprise of the year for me so far. 

Don't be fooled by the lack of decor or the tight dining area that only fits 27 consenting adults. The extremely friendly and outgoing staff greet you and help you make your decision to wage war against the American Heart association. Reviewing the menu alone caused my overall cholesterol to jump up 27 points. I ordered the double cheese boyger with all the fixings. That means a fried egg and a generous serving of bacon perched on what is already a bohemith burger. Made to order and served with brevity. The instance the boyger hit my mouth I immediately forgot where I was. eating the double cheese boyger was like reading an amazing book you didn't want to end. Every bite was full of flavor you can only find in places where the cooks truly cook with love and lard.

The price was extremely inexpensive and came in under ten bucks. Hands down one of the best burgers I've ever had. If I may offer some advice, don't wear a white dress shirt with a fine tie. It is worth the trip to this establishment for their rather diverse menu. ( they do burritos and pizzas as well). I will definately be back to this place they call fat boy. My mouth waters even as I write this. Enjoy
