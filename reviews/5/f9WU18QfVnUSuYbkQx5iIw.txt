BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN MADISON!

Habanero's is hands down the best Mexican food I have had EVER. I have been to several Mexican restaurants before and I have never had better service or better food. The tacos are amazing and I would also recommend the tortas. 

This place is small and has a very cozy and intimate atmosphere. It is kind of hard to find, but look for it across from Farm and Fleet on Stoughton Road.
