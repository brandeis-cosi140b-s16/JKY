I love this place!!! My family and I always stop at zaipis for a refreshing raspado whenever we're in town. They have everything from sweet raspados to thrifty ice cream. My favorite thing on the menu is the clamatos, they're freshly made and spicy too. My kids of course love the tostilocos, churros locos, and banana splits. 

Customer service is great. I love the fact that they're very family oriented.  If you're not sure what you're craving they'll help you chose something that you'll be very satisfied with.

Also the hot dogs on the weekend are awesome.  They're delicious and inexpensive if you have 3 kids. :)
