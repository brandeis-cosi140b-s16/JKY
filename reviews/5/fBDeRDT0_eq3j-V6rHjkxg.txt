Wow what a great little Mexican joint! Went here for the world cup match. I wasn't planning on eating but the smell got to me! 

The chips and salsa were standard fair. The drinks were huge here! Definitely get your money worth. I ended up going with the Supreme quesadilla which had steak chicken and shrimp for only $13. Not a bad way to go out. It was delicious. Full of flavor. Came with a side of rice, refried beans, and guess what sour cream and guac came free no up charge! 

I will definitely be frequenting this place more often. I highly recommend this place and dare I say it's better than mad mex? Oh blasphemy!
