Other Taco Shops in AZ should come here and take notes.
 
Lived in AZ my entire life and I can say without a doubt that Los Favs is the best Burrito/Taco shop in the state. 

Caifornia Burrito? Amazing.
Starts with the Tortilla which is always warm and soft, then you get the arne and I am not sure is it is actual carne because it taste like Unicorn Meat. And like the artists they are Los Favs puts French Fries in the Cali Burro not just a slump of Mashed potatoes like some other places in town topped of with melted cheese and Pico to complete to masterpiece.

Green Souce is awesome.
