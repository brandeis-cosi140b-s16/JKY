The smothered bold red chili burrito with slow cooked beef was awesome. Friendly staff helped me with the queso choices and sauce on and in burrito. Free guacamole and any extras you like. Free wifi. Never going to the other build your burrito place again. I got to excited and forgot to get a picture. Also easy to eat gluten free.

I came back tonight and got the green smothered burrito.
