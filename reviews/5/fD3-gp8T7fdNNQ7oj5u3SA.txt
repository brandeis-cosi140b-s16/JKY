O M G! My friend took me here and I just fell in love with the food. Large portions, super tasty and the tortillas are awesome! I tried their salad with steak and house dressing, the tamales (pork and chicken), and the nachos.

The salad was huge, extremely tasty, and filling. The nachos must be eaten right away. If you let it sit too long, the cheese gets hard and hard to eat. The tamales were delicious. I liked the chicken over the pork.

The sugar free strawberry lemonade was so refreshing and so was the limeade.

If I lived in Vegas, I'd eat here often. As much as I love Chipotle, this was much better than that!
