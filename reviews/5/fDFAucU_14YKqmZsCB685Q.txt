This is our favorite place to go! It's near home and the service is outstanding. Never had a bad experience here. My husband orders the chicken quesadilla, I get the chicken fajitas, and we start with the fresh made guacamole..... the food here is addicting! They know our order every time we go and I look forward to going here as often as possible.
