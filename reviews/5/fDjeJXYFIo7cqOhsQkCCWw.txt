Not for the mexican food, but for the margaritas and the good service...plus the birthday dessert they treated me!!

We were like 14 persons and everybody was happy! The guy that took our orders was very nice and efficient. I had their ajo shrimp...mmm very similar to "camarones al mojo de ajo" and it was good. The happy hour offers really tasty margaritas and the place is nicely decorated. Good choice to celebrate my birthday!
