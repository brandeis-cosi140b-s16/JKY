My usual Taco Bell is on Boulder Hwy at Russell, but it's either a 20 minute wait and/or screwed up order there, or lifeless service. What a surprise when I came this location!! I was greeted on the intercom with a smile (yes, you can actually tell when a person is smiling), my order was read back to me, I was given the total and pulled forward. Two cars ahead and it was only five minutes to get to the window!! Paid, receipt, and my food came out 30 seconds later! They are on the ball here! My new go to Taco Bell has been found.
