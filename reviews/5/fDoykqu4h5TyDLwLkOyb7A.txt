MUST GO!!  My husband I found this place while on our way home from the San Tan Mountains.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting and we enjoyed the music.  The best part though is the FOOD!!  My husband had the beef tacos and I had chicken Flautas.  The chicken is soooooooooooo good and the flauta is crispy deliciousness!  My husband really liked his tacos too.  I could get hooked on the chicken.  It's simple, juicy, fresh, and the best flavor.  Salsa is crazy good too!  The beans were fantastic and I don't usually order the beans.  I will every time I go here in the future that's for sure.  

One last comment, the service was excellent.  Friendly, kept our drinks filled up and we were very happy.  We'll be back.  Keep up the excellence El Rico and you'll keep us coming back for more!! ;-)
