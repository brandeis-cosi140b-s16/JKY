Amazing tacos! Their specialty is the al pastor, and that's one of the first things you'll notice when you walk in. Behind the counter you'll see a huge slab of pork on a vertical rotisserie. They've got 2 different sizes of tacos, a regular size for a dollar or so and a super size for $2.45. The regular comes with your choice of meat with chopped onions and cilantro on top. The super size comes with the same plus sour cream. They double up on the tortillas for both sizes, but for the super size they'll add a little bit of cheese to the tortillas and fry it up to get it a little crispy around the edges.

The al pastor is your best bet here. It's tender, juicy, and has some intense flavors, especially if you get there early and get the outer sections of the pork that are heavily marinated and full of spices. The outer portion of the pork is red from the chile powders, I'm assuming. Their carne asada is excellent as well and the chicken isn't bad either. They offer combo meals -- for example 3 regular tacos, rice and beans and a soda for $6.99. Although I thought the beans were a little too runny and the rice wasn't anything special. My suggestion is skip the rice and beans -- that's just filler -- and get yourself another taco.

The interior is very clean and doesn't have a ton of personality. Just a few pictures of their food hanging on the walls. They have a TV hanging from one corner that has played Spanish soap operas both times I've been there. The most bizarre thing about the decor is probably the sword that is hanging on the wall next to the cash register. I'm not sure what the story is behind that. But if they're going to fight back if someone robs them, wouldn't it be better to have a gun back there instead? Anyway, they've got great food. Go there and check it out, just don't piss them off or else you might see that sword up close as it's chopping off your arms.
