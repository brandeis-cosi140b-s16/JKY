fantastic food, oustanding prices, and one of the best salsa bars in town - realize that your eyes WILL be too big for your stomach, so be sure to tip when you get your to-go boxes!  The carne asada fries were legit, the chimichanga was out of this world and the shrimp quesadilla made me miss the beach it was so fresh.  This is by far my favorite 'berto in the valley!
