I have been here several times & have always enjoyed it. They have a good happy hour & great mojitos!

On my last visit the waitress told me they have veggie fajitas but they are just not listed on the menu. They were fantastic! & the staff was great about altering the order to make it vegan- leaving out butter & giving me different rice.

I will definitely be back!
