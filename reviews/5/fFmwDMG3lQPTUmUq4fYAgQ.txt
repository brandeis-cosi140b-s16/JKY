Who doesn't love Chipotle?

It is only the best Americanized Mexican quick bite restaurant! I usually tend to stay away from these types of establishments because they don't seem authentic but Chipotle is my exception.

No matter what I order, it's always good, from burritos to bowls. Tastes even better with a dollop of avocado! 

Service was pretty fast and we got here right in the nick of time. 5 minutes later there was a line of over 10 people, it seemed to move pretty quickly though. Didn't have a problem with parking and the gal helping us was very patient and friendly. I like this location so far.
