I've lived in Vegas for 7 years, and when I first moved to town, I went to pretty much every hole in the wall Mexican restaurant looking for a place that could duplicate the taste of my favorite Mexican restaurant in San Diego (Sombrero, if you want to visit them and bring me back a burrito).  After 100 shitty burritos, I gave up on my quest.

Last month, I was on a dinner break at the World Series of Poker, and I was in the mood for Mexican.  I was driving down the street to one of the Lindo's, and I checked Yelp to see if there were any other decent Mexican places in the area.  El Taco Feliz came up with really high reviews, and only one dollar sign, so I decided to try it instead.

I am sooooooooo happy I did.  I ordered my usual (chicken burrito with rice and cheese), and sat down at the connected bar Money Plays.  They had green sauce, which was a huge plus.  Another huge plus?  IT WAS FUCKING DELICIOUS!

El Taco Feliz uses quality chicken, and the burrito was a pretty damn close replica of Sombrero's burrito.  I went back 3 times that week for the same order, and I now find myself heading down there when I need my fix.  It's also open 24 hours, though I brought some out of towners here at 3am one time and they were closed.  That was weird.
