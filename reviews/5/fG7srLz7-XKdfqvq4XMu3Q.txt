Ok...so I know I have said this before, but this is legit.  

These are the best tacos in the valley...perhaps anywhere! It wouldn't have even happened had Fajardo's Cafe been open! We had driven out to Glendale and it was closed, so I jumped on Yelp and this place came up!  

It's a very small place and if I hadn't read Floyd C's review, I probably wouldn't have found it! (Thanks, Floyd!!!)  It is on the north east corner of 59th Ave and Camelback.  However, it is facing 59th avenue...yeah.  we drove around a few times...then read the review! Oh....gotta love random adventures leading to a diamond in the rough!

You go up to the counter, order...and they hand you a little plate to fill with all of the fixings they have at the salsa bar...which to be honest...they're all AMAZING!!!!  Plus, they have cucumbers, lettuce, onion/cilantro mix, carrots and limes! LIMES!! Remember...I have a lime fetish.  

***the ONLY complaint I have...and it is not even that big of a deal and I won't be taking any stars away is that they don't have cilantro alone...I hate raw onions. Like to the point of having a close to "ick" reaction! *** Anywhoooo...

I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a lengua taco with a side of beans.

The lengua (tongue...yes tongue) is absolutely flavorful and SOOOOOOOOO tender!  The carne asada is probably the most flavorful I have ever had here in the valley!  The beans are amazing and super yummy...it seems to me that they have chorizo and cheese in them.  

The service is quick and not so personable, but not rude at all! They are busy and are pretty much just making sure to get everyone their orders!  We will be back! Every Tuesday! ;-)

Wanna know how much we enjoyed our meal?  We each ordered a carne asada burrito to go...for lunch tomorrow!  We never do that!  

So who is up for Taco Wednesday? Thursday? Any day that ends in "Y"??
