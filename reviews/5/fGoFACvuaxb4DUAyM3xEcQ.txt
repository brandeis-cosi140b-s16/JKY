I've driven by a few times and finally decided to stop in. Glad I did. Tacos are great, I got them G style which I love the lettuce and cheese versus the PICO and cilantro. Philly cheesesteak was amazing. Not a big meat eater myself and there was plenty of it. Nice flavor not chewy and great without or with Whiz. But the tacos I'll be back for probably tomorrow. The staff was great and the owner appreciates every customer.
