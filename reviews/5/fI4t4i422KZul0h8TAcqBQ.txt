Watch out, Chipotle!!!!   WHY don't we have any Zaba's in San Diego?????

It's basically a Chipotle - looks, architecture, food choices and preparation and all, except for these very important points, which bring Zaba's above par:
They have great whole wheat tortillas as an option;
They have brown rice as well as white rice;
Their red salsa kicks butt;
They make their burritos HUGE;
They have a breakfast menu;
They have fish tacos
They have Coke Zero
Need I say more?

My only gripe is that our "server/burrito maker" obviously hated her job, and was downright depressing, but the food was tasty and filling and affordable.

Yum!
