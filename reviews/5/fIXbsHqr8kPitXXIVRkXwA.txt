My wife and I have recently become vegan and vegetarian. We weren't sure what we would be able to find at Leticia's, but we saw quickly that the veggies only fajitas would work perfectly. The fajitas were amazing! We ordered one plate with extra veggies and it was super filling! We barely finished it! Highly recommend Leticia's even if you are "off the meat"!
