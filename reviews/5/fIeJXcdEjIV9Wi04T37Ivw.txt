HOLY CRAP! 

This place is insane! The Sweet Corn appetizer was just like some that I had tasted at a Fell's Point festival. (I confess to going home and making some because I was so inspired) The scallop tacos were also served in heavy and delicious portions. 

To top it all off, the red sangria was singing to me by the end of the night. 

Awesome rustic chic decor. A must go in Scottsdale for a fun night out with the girls.
