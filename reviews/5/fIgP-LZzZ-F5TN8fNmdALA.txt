We were on our way home from Vegas & we were craving Mexican food. Came across this place on yelp so we decided to stop by. I got the mama Maria's enchiladas because the fried egg on top sold me. They were really filling & the enchilada sauce was tasty also. The owner came to talk to us & was a very friendly man. Place is small but the options on the menu are just right.
