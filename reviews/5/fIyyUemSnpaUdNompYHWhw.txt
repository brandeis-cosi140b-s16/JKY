This is one of my favorite places right now. Everything has been really good. I don't have a favorite thing yet. I love the pictures they have on the menu which always make me hungry but I wish they had take out menus so I could decide before I get there. I always get indecisive at the ordering counter. Too many yummy things to pick from.
