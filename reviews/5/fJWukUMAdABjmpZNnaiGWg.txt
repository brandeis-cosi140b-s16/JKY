One of our favorite lunch haunts back when I often traveled to work in Phoenix (Mesa)   from the early 90's to the late 00's, we always ate there at least once during the week.  A favorite of Queen Creek locals, the decor was updated back in late 90's or early 00's before the real estate boom and then subsequent bust although you probably wouldn't think that it was as it still has that "hole in the wall" atmosphere.  Yep - the place was a *real* hole in the wall back in the days it had a sign on the door asking you to close it for 'em 'cause it was broken!

The food is great but not absolutely the most authentic - think good Tex-Mex (or maybe Az-Mex).  No lengua, cabasa or menudo on the menu here!  The salsa and thin chips are unique - haven't had any like 'em anywhere else and others have noted the ice cream cone at the end of your meal.  Make sure you look at the 2 specials on the board - I think they just randomly choose 2 items on the menu everyday to sell at $0.50 or thereabouts less!
