8 piece chicken dinner with 2 sides, 4 tacos, and your choice of deserts for $20!!!!!!!!! I can't cook unless it is on a grill so when it is dinner time and the kids need to eat, this was the spot.

I was just giving it a shot and I was super impressed. The chicken was very good, the beans were fantastic with a smoky taste, and their tacos are so simple but hands down my favorite part. 

Thanks for making my life easy El Pollo.
