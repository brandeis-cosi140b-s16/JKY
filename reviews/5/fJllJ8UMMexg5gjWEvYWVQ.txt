Awesome place, great Margaritas, most places don't know how to make them.  They have an awesome happy hour from 3-6.  The food was great.  My wife got the shrimp rilleno and it was awesome.  I got the carne asada steak.  I liked the beans and rice as well. The flavor is more true to authentic Mexican food.  Definitely will be coming back.
