First, the service was above average.  Our waiter, a manager, and even another table's waiter checked on us, which was awesome and we really appreciated it.  Granted, it was a slow evening, so I can't speak for the service during busy nights.

When ordering, I wanted some fish tacos and was going to order the beer battered "seasonal fish", but the waiter urged me to get the seared ahi tacos (which was the most expensive taco item on the menu).  I agreed and wasn't happy with my decision.  The ahi is a great portion-- but for my taste, they were way too heavily salted.  The waiter saw I wasn't happy with his recommendation and brought me the beer battered fish instead, which were probably the biggest and most delicious fish tacos i have ever had.  One of the managers came over and made sure we were ok, and they even deducted the price difference from the original fish tacos.  I hate complaining about food, but these guys handled it like pros.  

My only complaint is the margaritas were weak, but I was expecting that from an $8 Patron margarita.

There was a group of about 20 seated near me that seemed to be enjoying themselves, so I would definitely bring a large group here.
