The food here is amazing.  I have NEVER gotten a bad meal.  From the breakfast burritos to the dinner platters.  The food is all cooked made to order and the staff is really friendly and accomodating.  And the prices are cheaper than McDonalds in the same lot and you get more food than you can eat.  There is nothing fastfood-ish about this place.  Always a favorite
