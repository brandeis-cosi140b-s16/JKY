Really enjoyed this place on my first visit. Great chips and salsa, chicken enchiladas and tacos. Mother in law loved her taco salad and husband his chimichanga. Interior needs an uplift/clean, but a great find for the price. We'll definitely be returning! Love these authentic little holes in the wall.
