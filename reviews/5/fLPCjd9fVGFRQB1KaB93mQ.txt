I have been regularly coming here since I was a senior at Sierra Vista in 2004, and seeing how it's still around, you can tell it has to be good or at least have a good reputation.   My love for breakfast burritos?  It all started here.

Amigos Tacos is a mexican restaurant akin to Robertos, but in my opinion better.  Their prices are reasonable to your wallet and their portion sizes are quite large.  The dining area and restrooms are very clean as well.  There is a small salsa bar in the side, but if you love punishing your colon as much as I do, ask for the special habanero salsa behind the counter!  They also have a TV, which varies in showing either the news in english, spanish telenovelas or soccer.  

Their beef tacos are great, but HOLY CRAP THE BREAKFAST BURRITOS ARE AHH-MAZING!!!!!!  Seriously, my addiction for Breakfast Burritos started with their ham and eggs breakfast burrito.  The burrito is huge, and stuffed with who knows how many eggs, ham and potatoes.  Nothing like having one of those and drowning it in Habanero salsa.  I have yet to try most of what else is on the menu simply because I am horribly addicted to those delicious breakfast burritos.  

Best of all, they are open 24 hours, so it's a perfect option sober or drunk!  Hooray for all-hours eating, which will probably be the eventual death of my workout regime even though I deny it every time!  Yes, truly a Vegas staple.

PROS:
Tacos and burritos are oh so good.
Specifically their breakfast burritos, I can't get enough of them!
Clean tables and bathrooms
24 hours to satisfy your altered state of mind!

CONS:
Nada

THE VERDICT:  Breakfast burritos breakfast burritos breakfast burritos yay!
