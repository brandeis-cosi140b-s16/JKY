Line went super fast. Did not mess up my order at all. Food was good and din't make me feel sick afterwards which is always a plus. Easy to find and right by a light so it is easy to get out of. The drive through window is a little small though but it is right next to my window in my car so I didn't have to reach at all to get my order. Will be coming back here a lot.
