Greatest Mexican food ever!!! I might not be educated in Mexican food, as this was the first I ever went to, but I have to say that no other Mexican restaurant can beat it. The Carne Asada, which I found out to be tasty beef, was great. They had a flat screen that was turned on to Univision. This restaurant sticks to the Mexican theme in a great way!!!!! And there was a salad bar with carrots!!!!!!! This place has quality food, copious choices, and for a low price. Definitely recommend.
