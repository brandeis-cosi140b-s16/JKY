I attended Popo's Mexican restaurant for the first time this past Sunday. I have lived in Arizona my whole life. Let me tell you, the fajitas were the best that I have found in Arizona. Also, everyone else who joined me only had good things to say about the food. The service and atmosphere was also very good. Would recommend it to almost anyone who enjoys mexican food. I cant wait to take advantage of the .99 cent margaritas!
