I challenge you to find better Mexican food in Madison. 

Just dined there since it's re-opening and it's only gotten better. Clearly they invested in the infrastructure. The salsa got even better and they will sell it if you want to put it on everything you have at home. (guilty)

It's authentic and flavorful. Squeeze limes on everything like its your job. Ask for more salsa because it's that delicious. The torta can easily feed two & is crisped to perfection. My partner in crime had the tacos and left none standing. Everyone was silent as they dined. 

So glad you're back taqueria!

There isn't a lot of seating, so I'd be careful during peak hours. TOTALLY worth the wait. (And easy on your pocketbook!)
