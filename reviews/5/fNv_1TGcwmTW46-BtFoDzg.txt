I Went to this location for the first time yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. It's definitely loud and a little cramp but not uncomfortable at all. Anyone looking for a quiet restaurant to dine in probably wouldnt like it here but seeing how busy they are makes it okay. Plus it kinda sets the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. However  We sat in the cantina, it was a little small but we were able to grab a high top and had both perfect views of the t.v. 

Their happy hour is awesome and the best part is its all day sunday in the cantina! They have good choices  and prices on cocktails and food. The taco baskets are to die for! They are amazing! And a good size! I could eat them all day! Except i only ate two because i was stuffed haha. 

Our server was awesome he was super attentive. Being a server I think he did a great job being busy an all. He always got us refills on our drinks, checked up on us, made sure we were happy, and we were! I definitely think I'll be back, especially on sundays and I'll bring a few friends while I'm at it!
