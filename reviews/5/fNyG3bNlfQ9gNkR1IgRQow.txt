I have been going to Macayo's since I was doing flip flops in my mom's womb... I only go to this location because my staple location, W Charleston, closed down.  I only eat in the bar... It is a different kind of atmosphere...it's quiet and i love watching the sports... i usually go for happy hour... 3:30-6:30... get the Spinach con Queso dip... always hot and good... i am so obsessed with their smooth chip sauce... it's AMAZING... I love their Albondigas... it's not greasy and always has a lot of flavor... The drinks are good and the service in the bar is always great... they recognize us and are always friendly... if you are looking for an Authentic Mexican Restaurant ...yeah...i wouldn't suggest it... but it has rang my bell for the last 30 years and I will always be a loyal customer!
