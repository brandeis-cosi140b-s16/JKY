Went through with some friends before a show down the street. Grabbed some tacos, burritos and nachos so we could try a little bit of everything! Let's just say, for the price, the location, the service... on the strip even ?? 6 STARS!! Great food and friendly Rockin' atmosphere! (They play great Rock N Roll music that keeps you moving as you enjoy the food)
