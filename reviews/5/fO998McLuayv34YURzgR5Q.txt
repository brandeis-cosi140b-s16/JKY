Delicious, Hot, Mexican Goodness! For being a small shop, they go BIG at Don Tortaco. I'm not gonna lie, I can barely walk right now. The burritos are epic and stuffed full of meat and veggies, and the sauces provided inside (haven't gone through the drive-through yet) are exquisite. The gal who took our order spoke perfect English and was very friendly.
Now my one gripe is with their chicken burrito. It tastes great, but they for some reason take two big pieces of chicken breast and just stuff them in there, which makes it very difficult to eat! If you order this I strongly recommend asking them to slice that chicken up a bit first.
They have ala carte items that range from $4-$6 or combo plates (very filling), of which most are about $8 after tax. Very modestly priced because the dishes are, despite being a fast-food type joint, easily $16 restaurant quality.
Up to this point I have seen what appear to be some very unfair reviews, and I must say that I strongly disagree with them. If you are a good person with a positive attitude who just happens to live in Southern Highlands (maybe by accident? fate?), and you like Mexican food, this place is worth a fair shot.
But if you are one of "those" people, just go to Taco Bell... Its right next door. ;)
