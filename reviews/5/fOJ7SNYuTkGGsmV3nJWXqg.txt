First of all this is one of the cleanest and organized Robertos in the valley the staff is friendly and remembers locals. I've only been here 5 times(during grave) in the past couple months and the employees remember exactly what I order. Every time I'm here I see the cook rotating food or cleaning his work station the cashier is always happily taking orders or cleaning the place from the top down working hard getting the place ready for the day. My food came out quick and well cooked. I have been to many Robertos and the food has been either chewy or under cooked this place does not compare. 

It's a hidden Gem on the right side of Big Lots and Next to PT's if you wanna get your drink on while eating a taco.
