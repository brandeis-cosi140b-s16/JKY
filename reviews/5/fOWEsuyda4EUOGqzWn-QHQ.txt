I'm convinced this is the best place in Pittsburgh to just chill and eat some Mexican food.  The environment is awesome, especially the outdoor patio.  Had a great experience here my second time around and would highly recommend it.  Despite the fact that the chips are not free, the overall value is tremendous.  Two people can comfortably eat and drink for under $50.  That's great.  I'll be back.  A lot.
