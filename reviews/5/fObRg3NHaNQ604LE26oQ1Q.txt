El Conquistador serves  wonderful, fresh Jalisco-style Mexican food. All of the food is made fresh daily. Mark and Maria, the owners, are very friendly  and it feels like you're eating at their home. The chile rellenos are to die for as is the tortilla soup.

if the restaurant is busy, you might have to wait a little while but the food is well worth it!
