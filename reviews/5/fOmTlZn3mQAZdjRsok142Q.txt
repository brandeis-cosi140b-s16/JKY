I still love this place. A lot. Perhaps even more so now that I can walk there from my apartment. One thing I forgot to mention in my last review is their fantastic margaritas, which have squeezes from fresh orange or grapefruit, pack a punch and are very cheap ($6) for the size. 

I know I said I'm not much of a "regular," but La Condesa has made me one. Spectacular.
