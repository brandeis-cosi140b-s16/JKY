This is a regular visit for my girlfriend and I. Our biggest trouble is finding a place that gives me enough food cause I eat roughly 4000-5000 calories a day so needless to say when I go out to eat I want ALOT of food. 

I don't know how they stay in business because the prices are super cheap and they give you an ENORMOUS plate of food, and unlimited chips that they make themselves. I always get the Cheese Dip and these chips are amazing because they are about as sodium free as i've ever tried (anyone know how to make these tortilla chips from scratch?)

My entree is always Carnitas De Res...i love it so why take a chance on something else? I look forward to this everytime we go....You get tons of beans and rice but that sauce on the beef w/ this dish makes the plate.

Between my girl and I plus the cheese dip appetizer and tea's our meal is still always in the $20's and she will have leftovers. This is the best bang for your buck in Charlotte.

Atmosphere when we go (typically late) is generally very quiet and relaxed except every Saturday night they'll have a live band going.....we prefer the quiet time to relax and talk but if you want some entertainment with your dinner go on a saturday night.
