Stopped in after taking our kids to a play in Tempe.  Maybe I was just in a happy mindset and easy to please, but I loved this place.  

My wife and daughter split a standard burger with cheese, I went for the standard with bacon and cheese and my little guy wanted a taco.

While trying to get him to decide which meat he would eat (he said he wanted cinnamon, not a helpful response.....) and figuring out what I would need to take off the women at the register mentioned kids options.

These include grilled cheese, quesadilla, kids burger and tacos where you choose your meat and toppings.

We chose ground beef and added cheese.  The boy was happy, we were happy.

Tried a couple of shakes and chips and salsa.  All really good.  Salsa a little different profile, but I liked it.

Also had fries which were perfect.

Patient with ordering and the split up the burger and shakes without issue.  Very accommodating and attentive service.  Only wish I of the kids options earlier, but know I know.
