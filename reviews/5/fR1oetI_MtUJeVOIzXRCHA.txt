THE MOST AMAZING MEXICAN FOOD I'VE EVER EATEN!!!
This place has an excellent atmosphere, rustic and hip. Their menu is eclectic and a mix of Mexico meets the Southwest. 
Guacamole table side any way you want it--to die for!
Lobster tacos-tiny bit of heat and sweet buttery lobster. 
Salsa-heat, but flavor!
Seafood enchiladas robust with crab flavor and wonderful verde sauce. 
Tamale, refried beans and rice were delicious. 
Finished off with Tres Leches Cake which melted in your mouth and the churros, served with three dipping sauces in edible chocolate cups. 
A gem you wouldn't find unless you saw it on Yelp or your friends told you about it!!  Make a reservation!
