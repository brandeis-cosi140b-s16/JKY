Had the Al Fuego and cabeza tacos - both were awesome.  The carne asada had a distinct smokey flavor that went perfectly with the green chili.  I gave it a dash of salsa to add some heat and it was great.  One of the reviewers complained the meat is gristly - he's probably right, place is a bit of a dive and I probably don't wanna know too much about the ingredients.  Doesn't matter though cause the tacos got FLAVOR.
