My family and I went there last night and we were pleased with the authenticity of the food.
I had the Tamale plate and was surprised at how flavorful and fresh they were. I also had the Tripas tacos and they were the best I have had here in AZ. My wife had chicken tacos and my son had the asada burrito and both raved about the flavors. everything we had was cooked to order. 

The owner was very accommodating and checked on us several times to assure we were Ok.  

I read some of the negative comments and suspect it may be a little too authentic for some people's idea of what authentic Mexican cuisine is supposed to taste like.  I guess that is why Garcia's and Serrano's are so popular.
