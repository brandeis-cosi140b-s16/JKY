What a lucky treat, we got here on Meatless Monday, I highly recommend this option for vegetarians. The service was excellent, deep knowledge of the food and preparation. I had the Molitas (off the menu) which was the highlight for me, great smokey flavor in the sauce and greens, anchoring a portobello mushroom entree. Another standout was the plantain empanada, part of the appetizer sampler along with quinoa fritters. This place was a little out of the way and it wasn't as cheap as I expected .... but was well worth it.
