This place is a Phoenix gem.  The food is a great fusion of chinese and mexican.  They serve it up is an amazing array of  combinations.  

Make you you get some of the samples that are always being offered.

Things to try: Jade Red Chicken, Pollo Diablo (this one is great in a quesadilla, Machaca (in a burrito), and the Jerk Chicken.  For sides thing outside of the box and get the black beans and jerk fried rice.

And of course, their snickerdoodles make a great finish.....
