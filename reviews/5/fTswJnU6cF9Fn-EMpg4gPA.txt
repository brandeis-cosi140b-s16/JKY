Excellent food, all the way around. This is the kind of place you expect to have paper towels on your table, and you do, and you'll need them and love that you do. I lived in DC for a few years and there were a lot of pollo a la brasa joints all around there that I became addicted to, and miss.  This is very close in flavor, if a different cultural tone. Totally recommend this for an inexpensive, delicious, and low-maintenance meal with close friends.  Knowing basic Spanish is probably helpful.
