Amazing tacos-- most authentic in Madison. The steak taco is so good-- the quality of the meat is outstanding. My husband loved his crispy, fried chicken quesadilla. We were the only customers speaking English in the place, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Prices are really reasonable. If you don't have enough cash, the store in front of the restaurant takes debit and credit! Enjoy!
