Love this place! I used to go to their previous location on 20th st & camelback & am so glad they're open again. I prefer it to chipotle mainly b/c their meat is far superior. And I've never felt "cheated" by extra rice as another review said. If you don't like the amount of rice, just ask for less. Simple. 

Great employees too. Alex has always been fantastic!
