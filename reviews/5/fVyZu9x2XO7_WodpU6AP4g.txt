The White Sands Chimi is my regular favorite.  Best salsa in town but ask for the hot salsa which is my number one favorite.  Margaritas are great and HUGE.  Food is more New Mexican than Mexican.  It's spicy but excellent.  Ask for Raul.  He made us laugh and gave us great service.  Our favorite Mexican in Scottsdale.
