Yummy made to order.  No big sysco distributor dumping off a bunch of premade standard Mexican food at the backdoor here.  They make it!

This Saturday morning was dieeeinnggg of hunger, pulled the car over, got out the iPhone and dialed up Yelp - and found Verde - thank you Yelpers!

It's an unassuming place with a concrete floor and simple tables and chairs (no big cushiony booths here), and it's fast casual so you order at the window then they bring it to you.  Breakfast was $5!  Five bucks!  And soooo good.  The DH and I split the eggs and chilaquiles  and it was yummy, but I only read the reviews after I started eating - so we'll definitely be back for the green chile!

The owner was working his tail off (like usual I think) and he's really nice.  I met him cause I just had to go up and leave a larger tip in the jar.  I don't know why more folks don't go here for breakfast.  I hate a bland American style brekkie.  This was perfect.  yumm!
