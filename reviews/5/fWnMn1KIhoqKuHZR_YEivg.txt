This place was totally amazing! I couldn't understand anything on the menu, but the owner was behing the counter and ready to help. We found this place on yelp while in town on vacation. We didn't want Margaritaville to be our Mexican dining exoerience while in town, and I'm so glad we found this place! Only about 10 minutes off the strip and totally worth the drive. The owner is from Tijuana and this is how they do it there! Try the pork in anyway that they serve it. Its amazing! Mexican soda's are really awesome as well!
