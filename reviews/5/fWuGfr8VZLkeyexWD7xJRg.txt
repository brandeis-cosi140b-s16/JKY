If you are looking for a great street taco look no further..CIEN AGAVES has them.  Their entire street taco menu is mouth watering however I can never stray from the lobster tacos.

This place is a great place to go to before an afternoon Spring Training baseball game.  Their three tequilla taster is also a good way to sample the tequilla, if I can remember it is around $16 for 3 shots (heavy pour) of tequilla for sipping.

This place continues to get better and better and the service I recieve there is how any place in Scottsdale should be.
