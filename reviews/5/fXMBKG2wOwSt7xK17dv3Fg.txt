I love America's Taco Shop and used to go to the one on university, until this location opened up. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is always clean. I always get the bean and cheese burrito and chips and salsa trio! Both are delicious and always hit the spot. I definitely recommend this place and go here often with my friends. So good!!
