Great little taco shop!

This place is right down the road from my in-laws, and the last time my wife was back in Vegas they got take out from here.  My wife has been raving about the tacos ever since, and we've been trying all sorts of places around Dallas to find as good of tacos, even at the new ultra-trendy and spendy Taco Diner with no luck.

This trip out I was able to try them myself, and they are darn good.  We actually ate here twice during out week long trip.  I tried their beef tacos, the chicken soft taco, and the chimichanga.  All were great, expecially the chimi.

So, better food than the trendy spots, and much cheaper.
