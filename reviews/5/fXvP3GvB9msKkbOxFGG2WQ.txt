I had been to a few of these places since I moved out here four years ago, and I must say I have been disappointed with most of them.  However, that all changed with this location.  First of all, it is immaculate.  Whenever I go in there, they are always cleaning when they are not busy.  The kitchen, food prep area, and dining room are all in tip-top shape.  And the service is top notch as well.  They are all very friendly, and very fast with the food preparation.  And the food is always hot, fresh and good.  There are quite a few Roberto's locations around town that could learn a lot from the employees/management of this location.
