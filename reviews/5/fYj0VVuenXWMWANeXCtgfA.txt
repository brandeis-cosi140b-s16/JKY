Went on a random South Phoenix adventure wanting to try something new, and Las Glorias ended up being the destination -- very happy that it was! I ordered the camarones diablo, which was everything I could hope for when ordering Mexican style seafood. It was plump grilled shrimp with a Chile sauce that had just the right amount of spice. Add French fries and grilled onions to the mix and you get one mouth watering meal. My boyfriend was also very happy with his dish which was the filet relleno. The atmosphere was fun with the painted sea walls....We'll be back!
