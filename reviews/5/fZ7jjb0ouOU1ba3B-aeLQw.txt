My new fave Mexican joint & I don't say this without several different dishes under my belt (pun intended). It figures this place is owned by the same family as the iconic El Charro in Tucson. Every dish from the tacos to the apple chimi is flavor filled & presented in awe inspiring splendor. My gal & I can recommend the SirNoran dog, the Diablo shrimp tacos, the fajitas (not your average)   Save room for dessert as the apple chimichanga is amazing & unique. The drink menu is just as creative & tasty as the food. The outdoor patio is great place to enjoy all this great fare. Ole
