So I need to update my previous review. This location has gotten a lot better. It seems like they needed to iron  a few kinks out from being a newly opened location. They are no longer chinsy on the meat and the overall quality of the food is better. I've been going to Cafe Rio a long time and I'm glad this place stepped up their game. I'd recommend it to anyone!
