I am going to give this place a five star review for this one dish. I've never seen it anywhere else. I've never tried anything else here because of the unbelievable awesomeness packed into it.

What is this tasty tasty dish you speak of? Pollo Amables. 

It's essentially the chicken and veggies that would be in a fajita, but they're covered in cheese and saut√©ed with bacon. YES BACON! in Mexican food. 

Go and order it, it's awesome,

I had a margarita, I ordered the cheap one and it tasted ok, and it was super strong. Spend the money for the upgrade for the better booze
