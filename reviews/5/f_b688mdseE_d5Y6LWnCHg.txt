I don't even like Mexican, but I LOVE this place!  Hands down one of the best places to eat in Champaign.  Unbelievable food and also inexpensive!  

Everything on the menu is great, but my absolute favorite is the fried tlacoyo with pastor.  Words cannot describe how yummy it is!

Chips and salsa come with every order, which makes it possible for me to order one tlacoyo and be full for just FOUR DOLLARS!  Simply Amazing.  I love you Maize.
