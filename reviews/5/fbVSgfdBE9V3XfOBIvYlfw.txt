Prickly Pear has been closed for over a year and I still mourn the loss.  I used to eat there

EVERY

SINGLE

DAY

when I worked across the street.  Their salads could not be beat.  Fresh, home-made yummy tortilla shell with chopped lettuce, other fresh veggies, amazing freshly made jalapeno-ranch dressing...

I threw a fit when I found out they were closed.  Chipotle cannot TOUCH Prickly Pear for quality, price, and taste.  Do not blaspheme and compare them.  ... Not even of the same world.

Prickly Pear - open again in a less expensive location!  I know you can make it!
