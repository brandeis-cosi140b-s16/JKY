Like the other reviewers have commented....I second their thoughts this is the Real Deal! El Tlacoyo gets 5 Stars for Best Tortas and Authentic Regional Mexican Food from the state of Hidalgo. 

I originally found about El Tlacoyo Located on the West-Mesa/Tempe border from a good friend many years ago who spoke fluent Spanish learned while serving as a missionary in Mexico. He said the food was awesome and is one of a kind or a hidden, Diamond in the rough! Found nowhere else in Phoenix!

To start with you will be the only Gringo's in this place but fear not they have menus in both Spanish and English. By far we LOOOOVE the giant fully stuffed, Saturday ONLY BBQ Lamb Tortas. Oh my what great flavor! Just seven bucks each. We stock up on 4 or 5 of them and deep freeze them at home. This is what earns them Five Stars!

The flavors here are a bit on the spicey side with an awesome creemy green chili hot sauce and a sharp red chili too! The combo plates are one of a kind and these guys make some great Civiche y Mariscos. The Shrimp Fajitas are to die for!!! Most dishes come with Mexican black beens and rice with the authentic cheese toppings. 

Best of all the prices are great with a Ninos menu too and a nice atmosphere with the music alive and an occasional Fotbol game on the TV!!!    VIVA EL TLACOYO!
