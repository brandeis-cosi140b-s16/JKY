We have been going here for years and look forward to each visit! We have never had a bad experience here ever! The food is always delicious and freshly prepared.  There is a wonderful older lady who works there and she is always smiling and happy; it's always a pleasure to see her...she makes you feel very welcome.  The prices here are very reasonable and they have daily specials as well.  Whether you're dining in or getting take out, you will not be disappointed!  We recommend the carnita soft tacos or carnita plate...absolutely delicious!  Try the flan for dessert and you will be thoroughly pleased!  We definitely recommend this place!
