The Ricas Cemita is the best sandwich in Las Vegas. Tender carnitas, Oaxacan cheese, a roasted pepper on a hot sesame roll makes this my favorite Mexican restaurant. They also have good tacos al carbon and de carnitas. Skip the fountain drinks and go straight to the refrigerator by the door for Mexican cokes.
