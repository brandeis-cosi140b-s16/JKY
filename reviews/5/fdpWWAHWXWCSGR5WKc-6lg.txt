I'm puzzled by the bad reviews too.  Every time I've been there for lunch, I walk away a happy and satisfied hombre.  The chips are warm, served with two kinds of salsa. I asked for refried beans with my chips, and they accommodated by bringing a large portion with melted cheese... no charge.  

Today I had tacos carnitas for lunch. The pork was perfectly crispy yet tender.  The pico de gallo added the perfect heat, and the guacomole is delicious. The combo included three tacos with double corn tortillas, small green salad, extra pico de gallo, sour cream, and refried beans.  Deliciouso!

The service is good.  The waiter came around several times and responded well to eye contact.  It wasn't busy, maybe five or six tables being served.  Never been there at dinner time, so I can't comment on that.

Three of us ate lunch for $36 with three soft drinks, and were completely satisfied.
