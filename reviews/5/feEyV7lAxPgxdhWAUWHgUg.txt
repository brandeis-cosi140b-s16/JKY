Came here to celebrate my friends engagement. We ordered the seafood platter that had all fresh seafood of shrimp and perfectly cook pieces of octopus (not the overcooked, rubbery and hard to eat octopus you find at a lot of places). We also had some great shrimp tacos. Oysters we had were very meaty. Excellent service just added to the experience.
