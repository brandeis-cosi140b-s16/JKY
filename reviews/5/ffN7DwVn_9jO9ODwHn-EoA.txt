When you first walk up, you don't know what you're expecting. But it was a cute Mexican restaurant. The staff was very friendly, the food was good and quick. 
One thing that wasn't the best, was the bathroom. But really that's not a big deal. If you want a good friendly Mexican restaurant, this is the place to go. Amazing menus options as well.
