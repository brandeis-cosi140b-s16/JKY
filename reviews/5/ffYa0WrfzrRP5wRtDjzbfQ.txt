This is one of my favorite valley restaurants. Everything is awesome from the queso to the fajitas - not to mention the homemade tortillas. We always bring out of town guests and they always rave about it  wishing they had one in their home town. Salsa is homemade w/ a great kick. I know they have other items on the menu besides fajitas, but I have never tried them because I can't get past the fajitas when deciding - they're too good!
