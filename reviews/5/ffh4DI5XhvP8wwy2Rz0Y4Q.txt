If you don't like hot spicy food don't go here. Starting with the salsa it is a pure capascium burn. Really tasty. I prefer the Mesa location over the Phoenix location based solely on the fact that I rarely have to wait, while at the Phoenix location (Which has more ambience) there is often a wait.  I love the chorizo dip, even if it isn't listed they will make it for you. The green chili is also very good. Service is generally very good, even on a Friday night.
