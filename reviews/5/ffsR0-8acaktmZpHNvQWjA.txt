Wow, I'm pleasantly surprised! I'm from San Antonio so when it comes to Mexican food I have high expectations and honestly have yet to find a place in Vegas that is even comparable to San Antonio places but this place was good! No, it's not authentic Mexican food, more like Tex-mex but it was good. The restaurant was super clean and staff greeted us immediately. You order at the counter and they give you a number. They bring the food to you so just sit back and relax. 

I saw Aguas Frescas on the menu and had to order some and mmmm mmm it was good. The watermelon was so fresh and just fabulous. Reminds me of the stuff that I would get at Fiesta in San Antonio. The salsa with the chips was more like pico de gallo but you could tell that they use real fresh produce so I'm not complaining about that. 

Now for the main course I had mini tacos al pastor. Great flavor! I once had tacos al pastor in Puerto Vallarta and have not been able to find that fabulous taste again until today. Their corn tortillas were fluffy and light and the meat was perfectly marinated and tender. Yum! And if you read my reviews you know I had to try my fianc√©'s quesadilla and chicken taco and everything was delicious. Oh and the rice and beans were some of the best I've had. The rice was fluffy and flavorful, I hate when the Mexican restaurants make the rice all soggy, Mexican rice and beans are staple at Mexican restaurants. If you get anything right it should be the rice and beans and this place does it right. Love that it's near where we live! I'll be back for sure!!
