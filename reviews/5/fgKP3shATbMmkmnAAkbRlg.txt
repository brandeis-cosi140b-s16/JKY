this place is amazing. i started going to this place in chandler because it was a half block away from my moms old townhouse when i was about 15 or 16 and had the munchies at 3-5am. my little brother and i would walk there everytime we stayed at my moms. its amazing. for sure the best of these kind of mexican places! plus, its good if you dont have much money!
