I love this place.  I have been once for dinner with family, once for a girls' night out and once for a work party.  All three times have been on point.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  They are very attentive to drink refills and prompt with orders.  When arranging my company party here, the manager, Rafael, was very communicative  and quick with his email response.  Planning our event was a breeze thanks to him.  La Comida has a fantastic menu.  The food is mouthwatering!  I highly recommend the ceviche, and the tacos are great.  Sure, you could go down the street and find a taco stand with good tacos for less, but the ingredients won't be as fresh and high quality as La Comida.  You certainly get what you pay for.  While the food is delicious, the drinks are even better!  The Prickly Pear Margarita is by far the best margarita I have ever had.  Not too sweet, no tangy sour mix flavor... You can tell that it is a quality margarita.  The sangria is also superb.  Definitely give those two a try when you go. Finally, La Comida's ambiance is fun, clean and casual.  It is the perfect place to start your night downtown, or just grab drinks after work.  You should check this place out.
