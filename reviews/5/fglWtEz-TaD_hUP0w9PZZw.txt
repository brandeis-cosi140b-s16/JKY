Really great fish taco's, yes they deserve five stars.  
If you are looking for an expensive fine dining experience this is not the place, but if you are looking for great, homemade, inexpensive food, served with a smile then look no further.  I bring out of town guests here and would recommend to people even if it is out of their way.
Some notes:  Ask for the special hotter sauce if you like it hot, it is super tasty.  Get the fish taco's, even if you are unsure about liking a fish taco.  Also, they will make it your way, just ask.
I do wish they had chunky salsa for the chips and salsa, but that is a personal preference not a requirement.  If you are in the East valley you should stop here.
