LOVE!
Stumbled on this place when I was getting gas in Fountain Hills the other day. It was lunch time and appeared super busy. 
WAIT - so did McDonald's, and I never run back to try it when I see it's busy... Um, let's see, why did I want to go back "super busy" really isn't a good enough reason.

It was super busy AND it looked cute AND it was convenient to our house. There, that makes me feel better.

Okay, so my hubby and I finally ventured out and north up the Beeline for the first time since we've been here. On the way home, we filled up with gas and decide to give Senor Taco's a try. It was tasty. Hubby had tacos, which had quite a bit of meat, and I had the chille relleno and cheese enchilada combo. Mine was good, but would have been better if the chile relleno was beef instead of cheese - two cheese items on the plate didn't make sense to me. 

Lots of salsa options that were really good. 

There definitely will be a next time. Next time I'm going with the beef tacos for sure.
