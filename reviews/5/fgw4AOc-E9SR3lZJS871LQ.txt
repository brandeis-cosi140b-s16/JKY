Popped over for appetizers and had a few drinks. Love the ambiance the posole hit the spot and had just enough spice to it.

Cocktails were good, extensive tequila list. Gotta make it over here for breakfast/brunch looks real tasty.

Honestly, I'm a sucker for anything Silvana does, she's such a treasure.
