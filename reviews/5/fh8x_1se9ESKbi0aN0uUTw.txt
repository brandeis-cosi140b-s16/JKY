Wow!  i have not had torta's like this since I was A kid. 
Hung over and craving some mexican food, we past by this place and decided to try it...man did it hit the spot. The carnitas are sooo tenderand flavorful that you cant go wrong with these choices. It's to bad i'm not local, but i intend to hit this spot next time i'm town.
