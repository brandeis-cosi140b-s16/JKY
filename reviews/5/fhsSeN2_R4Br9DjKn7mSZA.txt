Love love love this place!  I have had dinner there twice now with the most recent being this past Thursday and both times were fantastic.  On both visits, my man and I sat at the bar with Johnny taking care of us.  Johnny is a great bartender (one of the best in Vegas in my opinion) and is always good for a funny or interesting story.  He makes everyone at his bar feel at home, whether he has known them for years or has just met them.

Who goes to a Mexican restaurant without ordering a margarita?  Definitely not this girl!  My favorite is the prickly pear and my man loves the guava, but we still have several that we haven't tried yet, just one of many reasons we will be back again soon.

Now on to the food, the obligatory chips and salsa are a great start to the meal, the chips not too greasy, the salsa not too chunky or too runny.  Personally, I would prefer a bit more heat, but the flavor is good.  The shrimp ceviche is served in a green chile sauce that has quite the kick to it.  It comes with crispy plantain chips that are beyond addicting.  My man and I loved this dish so much the first time that we had to order it again on our second visit, and it definitely did not disappoint.

Covering both visits, for entrees we had the shrimp tacos, carnitas tacos, skirt steak, and red snapper.  Everything I had was absolutely delicious, although I did not get a chance to try the carnitas tacos.  My boyfriend loved them so much he had already inhaled them before I had a chance to ask for a taste haha!

Lastly, I cannot end this review without talking about the tres leches cake.  This is one of my favorite desserts and La Comida's was absolutely to die for!  It was moist and creamy (but not soggy) with flavors of vanilla bean, cinnamon, maybe nutmeg, just all around delicious.  We will definitely be back for more, and soon!
