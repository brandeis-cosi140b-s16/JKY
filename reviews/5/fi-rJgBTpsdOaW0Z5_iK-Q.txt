This place serves traditional Mexican street food and it is freaking fantastic!  We had fish, steak, chorizo,  and barbacoa tacos and all were super fresh and delicious. Tacos are only about $2 each! It's great to have this place in our area, it's a nice break from the slew of Americanized Mexican restaurants. The owners are very nice, we will definitely be back.
