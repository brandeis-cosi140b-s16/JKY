I am afraid to write this review, for fear of it becoming super busy!

If you are coming here for the decor you will be disappointed. 

But if you are coming for some amazing food (and aren't a spice wuss), you will be blown away.  The service from the lone female server is always sweet and quick, despite a bit of a language barrier (...if you're a silly gringo who only speaks English, that is).

I shy away from meats, including the more interesting offerings here, but anything I've had that is vegetarian, or vegetarian after my slight adjustments to the menu, are delish.  

Annoyingly closed on Wednesdays.

Bonus: keep up to date on your telenovelas while you dine!
