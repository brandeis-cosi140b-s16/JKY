Very slow Saturday afternoon, no line at the counter. I ordered the HealthMex burrito which was ready pretty quickly. While I waited I loaded up with salsa samples at the salsa bar. YUMMMM. I like that they have a lot of fish options as I don't eat meat. The burrito was very tasty and came with pretty good tortilla chips too. Delicious, quick meal!
