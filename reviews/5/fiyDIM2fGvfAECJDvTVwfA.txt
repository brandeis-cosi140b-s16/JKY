I don't usually write reviews, but as a pregnant woman who is extremely hard to feed, I have to say something. I'm usually not picky, but with this pregnancy, I find it hard to find anything I like. Having lost 15 lbs in my first trimester alone, my husband was on a mission to find something I could take more than one bite of.

I do not like Mexican food. What I had last night, however, was pretty amazing. I opted for the grilled shrimp burrito with a side of refried beans and cheese dip. My two and four year old had chicken burritos and they both finished their meal, which is pretty rare. 
I'm not quite sure what my mom got, it was some sort of pork, which was similar to Filipino lech√≥n. I think my husband got enchiladas. Either way, the entire dinner conversation was about how good everything was. Even the refried beans were outstanding compared to other Mexican restaurants I've been to. 

The service was great! Even at 6PM on a Sunday night, the restaurant had only two other families, but the crowd started to pick up as we were leaving at 7PM. We were pleasantly surprised that our bill came to exactly $50, which could have easily been over $100 for our family of 5.

I will be returning this afternoon for a cup of cheese dip and salsa to go. I'm happy to say that I finally found our go-to Mexican restaurant.
