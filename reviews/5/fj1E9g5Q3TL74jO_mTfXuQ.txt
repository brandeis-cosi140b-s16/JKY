Holy crap this place saved my life. CARNE ASADA FRIES!!!!!!!! Do you want authentic SoCal Mexican food? Then eat at Los Cabos! When I moved away from Riverside, I thought I'd never get Carne Asada Fries again. I'm SO glad I'm wrong. (By the way, you wanna question my creds on this? Go through my reviews and you'll see years old reviews about my favorite carne asada fries joints. Seriously, trust me on this one.)

You know how Mad Mex says they're "CaliMex"? Psht NO. THIS is what mexican food in SoCal tastes like. I was so happy and impressed that I asked to meet the owners. They were so sweet and happy to talk with me. 

Also, their Chile Relleno is legit. I always judge my Mexican restaurants by their Chile Rellenos. It should be a poblano pepper stuffed with gooey hot cheese, battered and fried in a fluffy coating, covered again with cheese, and smothered in red sauce. Los Cabos hits this on every point.

Expect authenticity, expect a lot of spice, expect a divey feel (bc that is authentic and best), and expect yummy greasy food.

Also, BYOB!
