We love this place and eat there often. It has fresh food, is consistant and very clean. The staff is very friendly and gets to know its customers. So far, our best place to eat in our area!  The girls that work there have become like friends to us, Amber and Vanba especially.  We ate there again last night and again we were pleased.  You always leave there full and content!
We always wind up going back there.  We highly recommend this Rubio's to anyone looking for a good meal in a friendly, clean environment.
