I had a great time from the minute I walked in the door the live music was outstanding and there were salsa dancers how cool.  I feltlike I was transported by the food. Duck tacos with a spicey tomato sauce. I loved my entr√©e carnitas and served with warm handmade tortillas what a treat. My wife loved the sangria margaritas as did I. Our server mentioned that all the ingredients were fresh and boy could you tell by the flavor.  We can't wait to go back.
