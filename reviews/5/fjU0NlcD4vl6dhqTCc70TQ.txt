Love the atmosphere! Love the great food! Love the drinks!!!! Over all amazing! Exceeded my expectations! Will definitely be coming back! The waitresses are very polite and the manager or woman in charge was very nice! Couldn't get enough of that horchata either! I've gone to many Mexican restaurants and tried their horchata but this one is the best horchata in town! Definitely recommend!
