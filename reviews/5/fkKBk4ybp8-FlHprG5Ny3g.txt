When Guadalajara burned down I was bummed Madison lost its only passably authentic Mexican food.  

This place just opened up and it's as good as Guadalajara was.  For people in town who miss the authentic stuff, check this place out.

Complementary homemade chips and salsas are served as you decide your order.

Staff is really nice and the place is cheap.  We tried all the meats...  I think Carnitas was the best but they were all good.
