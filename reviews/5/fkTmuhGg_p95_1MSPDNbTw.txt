From the outside, Abuelo's looks well kept and inviting. When you step through the doors, you find the same thing. That alone goes a long way with me. I don't like walking into a place to eat and find that it's poorly kept or dirty.
Once seated, you are served freshly made chips and three salsas. I can't tell you much about them other than they were freshly made.
For my meal I decided on the Pescado Guerrero, which is Fire-grilled Barramundi topped with shrimp, sea scallops, mushrooms, spinach and roasted peppers, in a white wine sauce. It only took one bite and I realized that I was eating the best Mexican dish I've ever had. Everything was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and plated perfectly. The portion was more than enough, and I still finished everything.
If all of that weren't enough, they then brought the dessert tray. I can't speak for the rest of the choices, but I strongly recommend the Dulce de Leche Cheesecake. To borrow a line from a novel, it was "almost too rich to finish, but too rich to leave." Translated that means it was some of the best I've eaten. 
All told, I would put my experience at Abuelo's very high in the running for best dining experience to date for me. Just in general I can't think of a better prepared meal I've ever had!
Well done, Abuelo's!
