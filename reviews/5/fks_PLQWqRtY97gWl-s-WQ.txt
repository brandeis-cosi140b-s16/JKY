Love this place!!!!! Its very clean and everyone is friendly, I have tasted several items on the menu, i have several favorites, which are the gilbert, la paz and the seoul. Its about time there is something different and not the same ole burger/ sandwich place. I will definitely go back, looking forward to trying other items. Good job!!!!!!
