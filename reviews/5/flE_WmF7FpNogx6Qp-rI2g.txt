My girlfriend and I were waiting for her car to be fixed and we made the miserable mistake of taking a sweaty stroll in the 106 degree Phoenix "dry" heat.  But, our misery was quickly quinced when we found this cool spot.  We walked in and we were immediately enamored by all the vibrant colors and the family ambiance.  Then a very lovely lady, who was our waitress lucky us, served us.  The food came in a timely manner and we were happy as the cool cucumbers that we ate in our entree.  Well, actually the dish was a little spicy for me, but my girlfriend loved it.  The father/son duo, live music placed the calming cool sound in our ears to cap off our outstanding visit.  I cannot wait to go back!
