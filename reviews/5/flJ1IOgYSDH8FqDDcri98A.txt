Don't let the location or building fool you.  This is the best Mexican food in Vegas. Their tortillas are magic and their ingredients are always fresh. The drive thru line is usually relatively quick unless someone ahead of you orders for 10 people. 24hours makes this the perfect place for breakfast any time. Short on cash? Their rolled taco deal has fed me many times!
