Ribeye tacos!!  Heaven. Trust me, I was born and raised in Mexico city and that combo of little home made flour tortillas and beef colliding  with lime juice and salsa... Brings me back home..
Congratulations Tortas paquime. 
Tortas good not the best 
Place is spotless!! And their bakery is sensational. 
You have to eat here no matter what.
