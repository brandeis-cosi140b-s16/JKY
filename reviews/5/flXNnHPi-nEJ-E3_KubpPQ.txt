Absolutely outstanding visit to The Mission.  Dear friends from Toronto are visiting and we decided to take them there.  We weren't aware that one of our guests has major food allergies.  Adam our Server (and a Manager) is awesome and was so kind to her as he pointed out items she might be interested in and that he would speak to the Chef so her food would be prepared the way she could enjoy.  The table side guacamole is fabulous - LOVE those pumpkin seeds.  The service was marvelous and the food absolutely delicious.  To end the evening, Tom came over with an after dinner drink for us - 1921 - YUM!  We had never had it before - perfect ending to a perfect ending.  Thanks to Adam and Tom for making it so special.

I am a Concierge at a luxury residence club and recommend The Mission to many, many of our guests - they always come back and tell us what a wonderful experience they had.  After our experience this evening, I will continue to send our special guests to this special restaurant!
