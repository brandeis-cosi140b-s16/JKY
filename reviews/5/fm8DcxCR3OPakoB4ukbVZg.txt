THIS PLACE IS AWESOME. We tried this place after the Concierge from the Montelucia Intercontinental suggested it. When we drove up the place was not very crowded so we were a bit worried. During our meal the placed filled up and after we were done I know why. Hands down a great place. The service was excellent, our server was cheerful, friendly, and attentive. She explained the menu for us and was really great. The margaritas we delicious and the chips were fresh, salsa was incredible. 
Try this place you'll love it
