The only thing that would improve this taco trailer would be a concrete definition of the hours at which I can patronize them.  Patronize is of course intended to signify a giving of business, not a stating of "Oh, hey there champ, it's ok, you can do better next time."  Essentially, they offer chicken and carne asada, with three basic preparations: Tacos for $1 a piece, burritos for $5, and Quesadillas for $7.  There is also a burger and a hot dog,  but come on, is that why you are here? If you order one of the meats, it comes off the grill, and you get to watch them chop it up with a crazy knife, on what appears to be a well-worn tree stump.  You definitely want to order "with everything"  and an horchata to drink is also the course of wisdom.  Final note: the people watching is amazing, in addition to the almost cartoonishly cowboy-looking dudes, I had a random guy who parked in the front wearing an FBI (Federal Boobie Inspector) shirt and raced off as soon as possible when his food was ready.  Wouldn't want anyone thinking your love of the Charlie's taco made you...sexually ambiguous?
