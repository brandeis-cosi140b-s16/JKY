This place should get five stars for their chips and salsa alone,. The chips are fresh-made flour rather than corn (I am usually more of a corn tortilla person, but these are delicious).  The salsa is a green chili salsa that leaves a slow burn in your mouth that makes it hard to quit eating.

I have been here twice now.  The first time I ordered cheese enchiladas, which were good.  I noticed they had potato flautas on the second visit.  I used to love flautas when I ate meat and missed them when I went veg years ago.  I was stoked to finally find a place that served flautas stuffed with something other than meat.  They were good and topped with a very tasty guacamole. (I am sure that the meat ones are equally good if not better)  I look forward to trying the torta on the next visit.  (I returned for the torta a few days later and it is excellent as well.)

I am happy to have stumbled onto this place.  There are a number of small Mexican restaurants on this stretch of McDowell and I have been wanting to try some of them for awhile.  La Hacienda is right on the corner of 16th and McDowell. It has a unassuming appearance on the outside, other than its windows splashed with daily specials.  The interior is pretty cool though.  It is a lot more spacious than it looks on the outside.

  The wait can be a little longer than some places, even when it is not that busy.  Be prepared for a little lag on the service if you go and appreciate that you get to enjoy such good eats.
