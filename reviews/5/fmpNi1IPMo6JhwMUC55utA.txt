If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, look no further.

-Staff is extremely friendly! Haven't felt this welcomed in a restaurant in a long time.
-Carne Asada plate was delicious. Comes with mini tortillas which you can make some awesome tacos. Completely full and satisfied.
-Relatively new place, definitely will be back.

EDIT: Our car's battery died, and the cook was so gracious enough to drive us to O'Reillys to get a new battery. What a guy! Kudos to their kindness and generosity.
