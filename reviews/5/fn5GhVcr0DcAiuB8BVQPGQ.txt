I have been eating here since it was called "Senior Miguels".
I am not sure why the name changed to "Coasta Cantina" but I will tell you the food is the SAME consistency and quality. It is located inside the Suncoast.

You get started with chips, salsa, and bean dip. All are good. This last visit I decided to try the "Carne Asada" and it was soooo good! The meat was full of flavor and that was with them cooking it well done per my request.

On Wednesday and Thursday night they currently have the following special..
Endless Tacos, Enchiladas and Bottomless Margaritas - $9.99 
-Choice of ground beef, shredded beef or chicken tacos
-Choice of cheese or chicken enchiladas with red or green sauce
-Includes flan for dessert

We go for this all of the time you just can't beat it! If you haven't tried this place yet it is a must if you love good Mexican food and not have to pay an arm and a leg.
