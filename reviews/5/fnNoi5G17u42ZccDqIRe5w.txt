LOVE this place. Consistently good food, excellent service. 

We go here several times a month at least and have not been disappointed. 

Their salsa is good, not too spicy but not bland either. 

Favorite menu items include:

Chimichanga

Tamales

Chile Rellano Burrito

Veggie Burrito

Any of the above smother in the their green sauce.

Carne asada tacos are delicious as well. 

Definitely a bit of a hole in the wall but if you like Mexican food you will not be disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable as well.
