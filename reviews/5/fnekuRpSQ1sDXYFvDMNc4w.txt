I had tried Los Antojos a couple of years ago after reading John Curtas go on about how great it was. A friend and I went and tried a bunch of different things, like huaraches, and consome loco and were not very impressed.

Fast forward 2 years and everybody I know has been to the restaurant and are raving about it. My friend and I decided to give it another chance. This was three weeks ago and I have been back at least ten times. This place is fantastic! I have been here for both breakfast and lunch, and I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried. For breakfast they offer a ton of choices and if nothing on the menu suits you, they can also whip something up. I tried eggs with chorizo and huevos rancheros, both come with different sides like beans, tortillas, bread, etc. My husband tried the borrego (lamb), it comes with a side bowl of consome (super, super rich), cilantro, onions and your choice of bread or tortilla. The owner assured him that with his meal he wouldn't need another meal all day. He was super happy with it, although it was a bit too rich for me. For lunch we've tried the tostadas de tinga (holy crap, they are incredible), tostadas de pollo (meh), sopa de tortilla, tampique√±a and pambazos. Pretty much everything was great. Also, all of their aguas frescas are made in-house. 

Since the place is tiny it gets packed quickly, but you can get your food to go. My husband and I are quite obsessed!
