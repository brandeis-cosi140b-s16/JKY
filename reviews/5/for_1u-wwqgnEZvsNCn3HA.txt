My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times on random week nights. It's never super packed (which I have no idea why), but we've always left extremely happy we came. The service is great; everyone working there is attentive and friendly without being overbearing. The food is delicious. Guacamole is on point and one of my favs. The tacos are filling and fresh. The margaritas are solid and the huge ones you can share. I'm sure we'll be back again.
