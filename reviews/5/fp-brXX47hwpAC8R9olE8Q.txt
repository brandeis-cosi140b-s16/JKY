Carolina's is like that older friend you had in high school who carried a knife; there's an element of danger in the distance, but you always feel taken care of.  

I love that if the parking lot is full of fire trucks from Avondale, I can park at Homero's Christian Auto Care for $.50. 
 
I also like the cost of tortillas which are good enough to grab two dozen of and run to your car and devour them until you feel the need to put the seat back into the food coma position.

When I worked close by, I would stop in sometimes for the Oaxaca for breakfast...hangover be GONE!  Lunches usually steered me toward the green chili beef enchiladas. I once found a small rock in them and was not even swayed. Sometimes you just have to eat a rock, though I spit this one out. 

Now I don't mind that this place is run down and not how I imagine my dream home, my only real issue with Carolina's is the fact that they seem to use the cheapest, flimsiest plastic ware on the market. Otherwise, this place is all splendor.
