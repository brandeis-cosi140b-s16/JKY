Came here with my husband for the first time the other night for dinner and it was delicious!  The waitstaff was also very attentive, helpful with menu suggestions, and friendly!  

We had the pork tamales for an appetizer, I had the pork loin entree and my husband had the steak tacos!  Magnificent!!
