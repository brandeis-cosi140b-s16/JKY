this place is perfect.  some of the best authentic street tacos in the USA.

it's basically a stationary food truck / street mexican food stand that happens to be housed in a shitty small permanent structure...and that's exactly how it should be.

people complaining on here about customer service and pepsi or coke just don't get it and are better off not eating here.  you don't come here because of pepsi or coke.  you don't come here for stellar customer service.  you come here for some of the best mexican street tacos in the country.  

ever wonder why you're the only gringo in this place?
