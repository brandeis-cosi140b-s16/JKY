The Shrimp Diablo Verde burrito was excellent, and refreshingly not a huge gut bomb - the size was reasonable. In terms of tacos, I can recommend the shredded chicken, and carnitas, soft tacos; the potato one was basically a french fry taco which was too greasy for my taste (but YMMV). Similar fare to Round Corner Cantina, which is not surprising as the same people are collaborating on El Burro.

I'm excited to have a lunch place like this in Pittsburgh, but wish it was in Oakland instead.
