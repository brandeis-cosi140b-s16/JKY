After several returns I have to say I'm definitely impressed! They are fully staffed and the customer service has improved. Everyone including the chef said thank you after I picked up my order today! I really like this place because the food is consistent and the portions are great for what you pay.The place is clean and everything on the menu is Delish! This is your best option if you are closer to Avondale to get fresh pan dulce, gelato, antojitos, and dinner for the fam. There is something for everyone and the food has always had me come back. I'm a sucker for service so I'm extremely happy they were great and offered to let me sample the aguas frescas. I will be back!
