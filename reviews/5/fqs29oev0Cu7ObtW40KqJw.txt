After reading through these reviews, I have to say I am a little surprised at all the bashing this place has been getting. Arriba's happens to be one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.

I've been here twice, on a Monday evening and on a Friday night for specials occasions and each time the service has been fast, friendly, and wonderful. The chips were good, the salsa was fresh and spicy (just how like it), and our waiter was patient with how indecisive my dear family can be at ordering.

When we finally got our food, everyone enjoyed it a lot. It didn't take a million years to get to our table either. I ordered the Chile Poblano the first time and thought it had really nice flavor (the rest of my family thought so too considering they couldn't stop trying to eat it haha.) The second time I decided to order something spicier so I got the Hatch Chicken Especial. That was probably one of the more spicy dishes I've eaten in my life, but it still kept nice flavor. My chicken was thoroughly cooked, seasoned well, rice and beans were delicious, I loved it. 

I'm sad that some people have had such poor experiences here, I'm hoping it was just a bad server or an off day for them, because I haven't been disappointed yet. I should warn those that aren't fans of spicy (like my dad) to stay well below the 2 chile sign on the menu. But if you're more like me and love spice, try the 3 chiles. 

I hope this review helps!
