I love this chipotle. Very generous on meat unlike metro location! Not to be rude but, everyone speaks good English too. I get very upset trying to explain how I want my burrito at the metro location and its never right and they don't understand. Always fast. I always have the same lady when I pick up. She always writes my husbands and is name on the bag with hearts. She's very kind. I love this location.
