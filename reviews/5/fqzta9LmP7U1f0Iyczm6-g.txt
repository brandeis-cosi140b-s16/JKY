The best Mexican food I have ever had!    This place is authentic and worth the trip!    The atmosphere is like a little Mexico with shops and hard booths, but for that food I would eat anywhere!    Definitely a great place to check out.   I ordered a torta and my boyfriend ordered a burrito.   Both were absolutely fantastic and we had to get boxes because there was so much left over even after we stuffed ourselves!  Check it out!
