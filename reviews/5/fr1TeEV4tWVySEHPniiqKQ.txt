So last night was my first visit to Tacos Kissi. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the Kissi Roll. I can't tell you how good these tacos where!  I've had a lot of street tacos at many different restaurants around town and these are the best! These tacos are a little larger than average street tacos you get at most restaurants and not only are they generous with the meat but it is seasoned soo well. I liked the fact that you get your choice of corn or flour tortillas, I chose the flour, and I'm sure they are homemade. They also have a fresh salsa bar with several choices (I recommend the tomatillo) as well as fresh cilantro, onion and cabbage. The Kissi Roll was also very good, not as good as the tacos but on a scale of 1-10 I would rate the roll a 7. Very reasonable prices and the restaurant itself is extremely clean and tidy. Needless to say I went back for a second visit today. ;)
