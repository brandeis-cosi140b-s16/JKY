We stopped here by chance as we were leaving Vegas on a Sunday. It was a great stop for lunch and we will be adding it to our list of places to hit up off-strip. We ordered the surf and turf Cortas by recommendation of the server.  Also got a fish taco and an octopus taco. Octopus was cooked very well and nicely seasoned. Service was great too. I tried a Poblano chili and potato gordita, and it was also very good. I did think the chilies were very spicy in that dish, but attributed to luck of the chili draw. Definitely recommend giving this place a chance. They do tacos right.
