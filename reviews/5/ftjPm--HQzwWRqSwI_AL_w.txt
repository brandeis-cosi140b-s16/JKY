After hitting on a man in a dress I realized that I had probably one too many to drink and need to sober up. So I ran from the Sahara to a little place that reminded me of home and grubbed out at Tacos Mexico. Thanks, guys. This place had fast service that hit the spot and allowed me to continue on back to my hotel.
