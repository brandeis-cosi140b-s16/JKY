Work right by there and only ate there once before my family came to town and saw it rated well.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is so good.  First went there for lunch trying to satisfy my sister's pregnant hunger for something melty and spicy.  Much to say it hit the spot so well we were back the next night for dinner.

Both times we needed to wait 15 or so minutes for a table and this is not a small place.  We found out later that it was well worth the wait. The first round of chips and salsa/dip (there are 4 of them!) is complimentary and the next round is $2.95.  The chips and dips were great.  Some spicier than others.  There is a red, a green, a bean (which is not think), and a sour cream.  

Both times, I ordered the combination plate #3 which has a crunchy taco, an enchilada, chile con carne, a tamale, and rice and beans.  There are 3 different chile sauces and I went for red chile both times.  It is the best chile sauce I have ever had.  The refried beans were a little cheesy, really warm, gooey and delicious.  The rice was fantastic and anything the chile sauce touched must have turned to gold.  

The complimentary sopillas were terrific and  hit the sweet spot to finish the dinner so well.  All in all, it is a must go for Mexican food lovers but be warned.  GO HUNGRY!
