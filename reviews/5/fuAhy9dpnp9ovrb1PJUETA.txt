This is the best place to go for fresh made tortillas and carnitas (shredded pork, think of it as Mexican-style BBQ if you've never had it before) in Charlotte. This place is mostly a market, and is strictly to-go, but they make wonderful food. In addition to carnitas, they also make pollo adobado (chicken) and barbacoa (seasoned beef), and have good chicharrones (pork rinds). All of this is sold by the pound and makes for a fantastic meal. They also make delicious salsas to accompany the carnitas, and have good queso fresco. They also sell beer and soda and raw meats to cook at home. The chorizo seco is well worth trying.

Pro tip: as a rule of thumb, buy as many lbs. of tortillas as you do meat, and half as much of queso fresco.
