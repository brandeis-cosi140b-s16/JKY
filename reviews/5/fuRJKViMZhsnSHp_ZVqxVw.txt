Hi all, I wrote a pretty detailed review on Mexico City's old Yelp page and you can see some of the older reviews there. The menu has a lot of the same items on it but they added a lot more plus changed their style of preparing some of the meals.

This place is the best Mexican in the city! I'll take the challenge and go anywhere in the city to try YOUR favorite dish at another spot if you think this place is not the best. 

Here's the old Mexico City reviews:
