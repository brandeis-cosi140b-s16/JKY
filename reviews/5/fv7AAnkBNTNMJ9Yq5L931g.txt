We were driving around and stumbled across the restaurant on Lake Mead and Lamb.  The smoke from the barbecue caught our attention.  We stopped and went in to find a great menu and prices!  We had the tacos, tostadas and carne asada fritas and all were excellent.  A couple days later, before getting on a plane, we tried to find the restaurant again, we couldn't.  Our GPS did find the mobile truck so we were happy.  We ordered the burritos and whole chicken and they were delicious.  The employees are very nice and they give fast service.  While eating our food near the food truck, we saw people lining up constantly.
