Happy hour at On the Border can not be beat!  The Sangria Swirl and the Watermelon Rita for $4 is the best around.  We also enjoyed the queso guacamole combo for $4.  Reggie, Alyssa, and the other guy at the bar were cool.  Get there early to get your happy hour table in the bar.  4 people, $40, good buzz, great food, we'll be back.  Just make sure yu get a table in the bar, because they will not honor happy hour prices when seated at restaurant tables.
