Most of the bad reviews here are from a while back. This place really has changed in the past 3 years I have been going. I can say as a regular it is the best its ever been. The food is great, the service is great and the live music is a nice touch. They are very friendly if you want to watch something on the TVs. The back room offers a great place to relax if you want a little quieter atmosphere. The other regulars are great to get to know. A pretty good place to just hang out and watch the game. Try the green chili mac n cheese, bacon wrapped shrimp, and of course the deserts. Everything is good but those are my favorites. See you there.
