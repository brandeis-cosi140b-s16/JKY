My husband and I were so happy to have found this place.  Great drinks, love the decor and atmosphere that has been created here at Round Corner Cantina.  We've had a hard time finding places to enjoy a cocktail in Pittsburgh that aren't sports bar-ish or college scenes... so thanks for opening up this great establishment. Can't wait to go back and try the food.
