I'm very picky about Mexican/Latin American food; authenticity to me is my grandmothers cocina (kitchen) "Asado" is on point with all the foods I've tasted; salsa, elote, ceviche, shrimp tacos, beans...
The colors of the walls are great, the indoor lighting very soothing, upgrades since it was kokomo joes
If this was my restaurant, I'd invest more in Spanish, Mexican American Artwork we have lots of talent in AZ. Other than that Awesome place!
