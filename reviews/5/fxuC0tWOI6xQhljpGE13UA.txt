We came here because we got a good groupon for us and the kids. After readings the yelp reviews I was a little apprehensive because they weren't great but they are wrong!! We had a great time and the service was outstanding! It was only two ladies working so it was a little slow when they got busy but the food is so worth the wait! The chipotle chicken, carne asada, regular chicken, and guacamole are awesome! And the kids think the quesadilla was rad! I definitely recommend tacos4u!! :)
