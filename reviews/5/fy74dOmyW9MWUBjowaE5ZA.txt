Consistently wonderful food!  Our favorite Mexican food anywhere and we have been all over the world.  Our kids come back to see us and Sr. Tacos is the first place they go.  Then they continue to talk about how they can hardly wait to come back.  Top your meal off with Churros.  OMG delicious.  There is nothing bad on the menu.  Authentic food, very clean and lovely staff always.  Love it.
