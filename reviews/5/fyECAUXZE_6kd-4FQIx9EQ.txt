I went to this location as I was driving down 16st saw it out the corner of my eye and I'm glad that I made the stop, it was kinda packed but my party only waited about ten minutes. I ordered the gaucho taco that was recommended by our waiter that was one of the best tacos I had ever had and trust me I've had tons of tacos and don't even get me started about the shrimp tacos they have
