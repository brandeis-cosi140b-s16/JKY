We are new to the area and trying out different restaurants primarily due to the heat....who wants to cook at home with 110+ degree temperatures:)  As we came from Southern California finding a good Mexican restaurant was high on our list.  We were there on a Tuesday around 4:30 PM and were seated right away.  The staff was attentive and professional.  We were pleased with the salsa and the guacamole dip.  My husband deemed his chile rellano the second best he'd ever had.  I would like to be able to get a taco or burrito a la carte versus with rice and beans.   The portions very generous and we both had leftovers to take home.  We will be back.
