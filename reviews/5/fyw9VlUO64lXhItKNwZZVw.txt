Love love love this little bar. I have now been here twice and I like it more and more every time I come. The have a small but focused food menu and tons of great drinks.  The first time I went, I ate a green chile cheeseburger that came with chips and salsa. The burger was a bit oversalted, but other than that it was very good. I also had a drink called the Pitstop which was vodka with lemon soda and strawberries, kinda like a strawbery mojito. Overall it's a great spot to enjoy an awesome patio, some drinks and (although I've yet to experience it) live music. Excited to see some music here next time I visit!
