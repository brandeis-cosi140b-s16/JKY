The Rokerij is my favorite place to eat and get drinks in Phoenix!  It is a bit more expensive but well worth the price!  Their food is top-notch, the drinks are spectacular, the music is great and the basement is amazing.  Try the seared salmon! I never really liked fish until I had their salmon. The Rokerij is a hidden gem and there really is no other place like it in Phoenix!
