First time here when visiting Vegas. Had seen the restaurant on t.v. and knew we had to try it. Started with a white peach margaritas that, although sweet, was so good I ended up having three!  For a shared appetizer, the hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed a plate of pulled pork nachos.  Griffin, our excellent waiter, said he'd get the bbq sauce on the side because the kitchen can sometimes be heavy-handed with it, which was perfect, as my husband and I have differing levels of love for it. The nachos were spot on. So good that I nearly ordered a second variety as my entree!  Wayne ate fajita cheese steak with parmesan garlic fries. I had fajita chimichanga with green sauce. Both were outstanding.  We will be making Nacho Daddy's a regular stop on our annual trip out here from now on.
