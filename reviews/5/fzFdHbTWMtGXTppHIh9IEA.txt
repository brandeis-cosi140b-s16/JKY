Without going into too much detail because I don't have a lot of time, this place is awesome.  It's comfy, great location, welcoming, and most importantly, DELICIOUS.  The prices are awesome, and the staff (from the couple times we've seen) is the children of the owners.  But they always get the orders right and are friendly.  The parents have done a good job raising kids AND training them with good work ethic.  If you're looking for an awesome place to eat, give this place a try.
