Excellent little out of the way Mexican restaurant. It is inside the Clarion hotel but has outside access. Portions are large, salsa & queso are served for free. You can even mix your own salsa b/c they bring you a small bowl of pico to mix in. The meal was excellent and the place was nice and clean.
