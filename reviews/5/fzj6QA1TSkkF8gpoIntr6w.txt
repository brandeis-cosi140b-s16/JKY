Mad Mex is always consistently good. Tried the tomatillo-avocado salsa with our chips today. Delicious with a pronounced lime flavor and a little heat. The carnitas burrito was tasty and I really like the blue cornbread.
Our server, Joe, took good care of us, but when he found out why we were there, he went the extra mile. My wife and I had our first date, 12 years ago to the day, at the Oakland location. So, once we had finished our meal, Joe came by with a menu and informed us that dessert was on the house. Sopapillas, long weekend style, for the win. Thank you Joe, and Mad Mex!
