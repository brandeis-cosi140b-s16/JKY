Definitely better than anything in Caesars Palace.  

First, they serve you chips and salsa.  I grew up in San Antonio and this was still the best chips and salsa I've ever had.

For my entree I ordered the carne asada quesadilla.  The meat was tender and lots of it, just a hint of cheese, crema and a topping of guac and tomatoes.  Was a little salty, but quite quite good.  Texture was perfect - crispy outside, tender meat, luxurious guac.  Nice.  

Rudy was my server, he was quick to refill my water glass, check in to see how I was doing and his food recommendations were spot on. 

Very happy.
