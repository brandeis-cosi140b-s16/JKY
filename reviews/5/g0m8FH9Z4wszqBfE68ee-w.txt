We came a week or so ago on a Sunday afternoon, service was crazy good. The staff was fast and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. We started with chips and guac. Of course salsa comes complimentary. The guac was perfect , and paired perfectly with their warm chips. 
   Next we had chicken chimiganga, and chicken enchiladas. The chicken was juicy and perfect, the portions were big , and everything was cooked just right.

  This is located on main street downtown, so there is plenty to do when you decide to go. I love the history around this place, there is a lot to look at while you wait for your food.
