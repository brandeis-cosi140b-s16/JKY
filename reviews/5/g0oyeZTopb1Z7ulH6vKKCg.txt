Wow. Hats off to you Rick Bayless! What an incredible meal. If you are in Vegas, you have to check this place out. It's difficult to find but well worth the trip. 

The decor was beautiful. It had a really nice ambiance and the staff and service were super attentive to our needs. Plus, if you use yelp to check in, you get a free glass of wine :)

For appetizers we ordered the skewers and they were oh so yummy! The little salad on the side was soooo good and the meat was insanely juicy. Their entrees, we ordered the short rib tamale and the filet mignon relieno. I loved the relieno! My boyfriends tamale was delicious as well but I enjoyed mine more. 

To end our meal, we ordered the banana empanada which you HAVE to order! It is to die for! It's warm banana empanadas with a creamy sauce made of condensed milk and caramel topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. This was the highlight of our meal! My taste buds were singing!
