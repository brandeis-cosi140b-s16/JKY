the food was fantastic. the red jade chicken was so crispy and delish, i also loved the jerk chicken fried rice. both me and my husband were very satisfied. My only suggestion would be for them to update their dining room. it looks like it is getting a little run down, like a cafeteria. but we came for the food and were very happy. my husband was especially happy about the bonus cookie they give you for dessert.
