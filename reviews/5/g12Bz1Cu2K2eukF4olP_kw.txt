Great Service and Great Atmosphere!

Looking forward to going back! AND they have a sports book!
The atmosphere is great, relaxing, and very clean. The service was excellent as well! The shrimp cajun tacos were to die for. Being from Southern California, this place takes me back home to Huntington Beach! So happy they opened up in Vegas!
