Visited this restaurant last week with a groupon special, not expecting their best service since I was using a coupon. I was pleasantly surprised on how great the service was!  Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly which made for a great happy hour!  Their guacamole is great and their assorted chip basket made everything extra yummy!

I'll definitely be returning :)
