Okay, all you gringos. If you're used to middle of the road, chain Mexican food places, and get freaked out at the thought of anything deviating from that path, this place might be a bit too authentic for you. But, if you've been to Mexico, love the real stuff, and might even venture from the enchilada and burrito safe haven, this restaurant has your name on it. It's clean, bright and beautiful, very comfortable, very family friendly, and completely delicious. It has the requisite burritos and tacos and enchiladas, but it has so much more, for those who crave it. Great service, very friendly staff. After ten minutes on our first visit, my wife turned to me and said, "This is my favorite Mexican restaurant ever." Mine, too.
