Not your typical Mexican restaurant - if you're looking for authentic this is not the place for you... However, Burrito Drive has always been one of my favorite places to eat in Madison, delivery or otherwise! The big, rich burritos will satisfy your hunger and then some. Something for everyone! I especially recommend the Hungry Hippie burrito with pork.

I think people who have given a bad review have either tried to make their own burrito or ordered something that is NOT a burrito off the menu... I'd say if you're looking for a twist on the classic burrito, get one of their classic items and you will not be disappointed. Don't listen to the bad reviews, this place is more than worth a try.
