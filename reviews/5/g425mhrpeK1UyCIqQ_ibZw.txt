SWEET BABY JESUS!! ORGASMIC!

So I LOVE tacos and any Mexican food for that matter; they have GREAT food here! The price, quality, and quantity is ace! Everything was seasoned PERFECTLY! I got the muelitas and ordered some carne asada tacos for my son. I went to the salsa bar and was a little hesitant to get salsa (I'm a visual eater and this didnt look yummy) but I got some anyway along with some limes. I went and got my beloved horchata and was in heaven because it was a self serve!! I took one drink and seen cherubs!! It was def love! 

We got home and I salsa and limed up my muelitas and took a bite; I swear the earth stopped for like 5 seconds and I seen angels flying around!! PERFECT! Thank goodness I got the hot salsa because it was delish!!!! The muelita melted in my mouth and I was in love; I couldnt get enough! The carne asada, cheese, and avocado was totally mastered! My sons carne asada tacos were wonderful! We ate all the food up!

The place is pretty large and just a plain seating area. Remember! Youre going for the food, and not the ambiance!! I've been to super pricey restaurants and the food was hella shitty!

Go here NOW! And bring an extra set of panties bc you may very well cream them!!
