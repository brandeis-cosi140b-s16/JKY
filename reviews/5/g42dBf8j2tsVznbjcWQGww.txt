Ok I have to confess...Roberto's Taco Shop is my weakness...BUT not just any Roberto's...specifically this location because although it is a chain taco shop, for some reason this location on Bermuda and Cactus seems to make it slightly better then the rest.  Here's a few reviews for some of their menu items that are my fave...

The Carne Asada French Fries is nothing but greasy goodness.  In order for the fries to survive the attack of the guacamole, carne asada, refried beans, sour cream, onions, and tomatoes, you have to ask for the fries to be extra crispy.

The beef tacos are sinfully good!  They are definitely not stingy with the beef and shredded cheddar cheese.  There is so much in one taco that if taken apart you can make a second taco.

The golden fried fish in the fish tacos is paired with a tangy coleslaw.  A hint of lemon juice just adds the right touch and you'll find yourself wanting more.  

The salsa bar is made up of pickled jalapenos, carrots, and onion.  There is also a salsa verde that is just the right heat, regular salsa that is mild, fresh cut radishes and cucumbers, with lemon wedges and cut up lime.  What I like to do is make a cucumber salad with lemon, salt and tapatio...so so good!

That's it for now...gotta head to Roberto's...!!!
