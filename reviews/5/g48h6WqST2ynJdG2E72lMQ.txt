Compared to other reviews, I've had better luck with service at the counter or maybe my expectations weren't as high as others. It IS a very casual dining experience, people! This restaurant is very chill and the experience is the food. Every time I eat here, service improves. 

There are two separate counters; one for just tacos and one for everything else. If you are ordering nachos, don't wait at the taco counter because you'll be wasting your time. The taco counter is the first one you see when you enter. 

I think this is the best Mexican food in Henderson!!! How they prepare and cook their meats are authentic as you can get. They have the typical meats, like carne asada and barbacoa, but if you are a foodie-type person I highly recommend tasting the chicharron (pig skin) and lengua (beef tongue). You must get their Mexican-style corn on the cob too! My boyfriend loves their barbacoa nachos.
