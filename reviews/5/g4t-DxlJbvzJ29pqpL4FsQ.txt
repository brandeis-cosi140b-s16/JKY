This is one of my favorite authentic Mexican places in Charlotte.  So far, I've only tried the tacos, but they are outstanding.  Their shells are fresh and seem to taste better than taco shells at other places I've been.  

I took my parents here recently for dinner, and the service was outstanding.  My dad asked for a special order of guacamole with no onions and they whipped up a batch just for him.  Later when he ordered his tacos, the server even remembered to leave the onions off without him asking!

I can't wait to go back and try some of their other items.
