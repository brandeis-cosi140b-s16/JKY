Can I get a what, what? This place is freaking awesome! I come here frequently with mi esposa (wife) and we always split the "Two of a Kind" two shrimp tacos, they're amazing, and I am not even a big fan of shrimp!

Also their shrimp mango quesadilla is rather good! Either way, best Mexican Food in the East Valley hands down!
