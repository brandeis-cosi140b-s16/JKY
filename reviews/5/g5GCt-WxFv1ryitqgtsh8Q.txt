Friendly, cheap, consistently good, open 24hrs - really can't ask for anything more. Countless drunken nights have ended here, and its great no matter what we order. Favs are nachos (beef or chicken), chicken taquitos, carne asada quesadilla, carnitas plate, carne asada chimichanga. One negative is their horchata - not as good as some other mex places. Tastes almost watered down.

I have gotten food poisoning from the one off Bermuda w the drive thru, but never this one.
