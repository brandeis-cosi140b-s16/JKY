Our first  visit was excellent. So was this one. A party of six started with chips guacamole  salsa and three orders of mussels.  Main courses ok couldn't do it. More appetizers  duck taquito, fish taco and empinad's one chimmichanga. The food flavors best described WoW. Desert they brought bread pudding. Thank goodness  they had spoons once people tried it it was a fencing duel. We had to order another. We will be back.
