Mmmm...I was a fan after witnessing the spicy pork hang/marinate from a fresh pineapple.  Whatever sauce they place on top of the tacos is equally fantastic.  This was my first time trying cabesa (hesitantly, might I add) and was pleasantly surprised!   Best tacos I've had in a very long time, maybe ever.  They're also open late, which was convenient after going downtown.
