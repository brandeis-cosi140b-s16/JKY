Always exceptional service. Food is always fresh and orders arrive correctly. We eat here on average a couple times a month and have been for a few years now. The owners are unlike any others you will find anywhere!! I would highly suggest the Chicken Tortilla Soup (love the presentation), the fajitas, the Watermelon Margarita, or the taquitos. The salsa and hot sauce are also not-to-be-missed!
