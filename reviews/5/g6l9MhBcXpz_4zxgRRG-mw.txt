As good as it gets is right,  I had a breakfast burrito for lunch and it was awesome ! I have been coming to this place for some time and this time I asked who made this glorious burrito. The magicians name was joe ! if your in phx and craving a good meal and not denting your wallet go see joe at Cafe  Tranquilo !
