This is the perfect starter snack or late night stop after you've been partying all night. I'm not even sure if Rocking Taco even closes?!

The chips and freshly made guacamole with the spicy salsa is definitely the best snack meal around. They make these killer Blue Lemonade Margaritas that are to die for. 

We definitely made a few stops here for drinks and more guac!
