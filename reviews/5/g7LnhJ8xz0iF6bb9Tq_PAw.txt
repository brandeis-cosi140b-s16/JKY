We had a great experience here! It was my first time and I was overwhelmed with all the different options. Kris behind the counter was patient with our indecisiveness and helped us choose a great meal. I had the Salmon Chimichurri Burrito and my girlfriend tried a couple of their tacos. Everything was delicious and filling. The original fish taco is amazing! Thank you Kris for making my first time memorable. We will definitely be back!
