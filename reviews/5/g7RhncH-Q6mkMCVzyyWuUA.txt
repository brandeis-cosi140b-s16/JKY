Hola!

Just a quikie note. stopped in 4 our 10,000th burrito (or so it seems), and once again, great food great service. 

I have decided to update my reviews with a couple of new catagories. One will not change. this one I call "curb appeal" (this is how the establishment make me want to be there upon arrival,and how clean the entryway is) it will be rated 1 to 10, 10 being the best. And "the P factor" (this one is where I rate how the bathroom looked, as it is important for me to see a clean restroom. I take this as a sign that the rest of the place is clean. The two together work in combination and show me how clean the restaurant is. Even in open concept things can be decieving.

So that being said todays ratings are

curbage: 9

P factor: 9

Great job as always chipotle!
