This place serves up some of the best campechanas(mixed seafood cocktail) around. They also serve various other seafood and meat dishes. It is a little hole in the wall place that you wouldn't expect to find such good food. I eat here at least two times a week or more and can't wait to come back for more. The service is always great and sometimes the owner will come in and chat with customers to see how everything is,which shows he really cares about the customers.
