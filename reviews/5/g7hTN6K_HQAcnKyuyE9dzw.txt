I've been here several times and have no complaints yet. Service is always fast, even though the line sometimes stretches to the door at lunch hour. Place is clean and parking is doable even though it's in a relatively small strip mall area. I've seen it floating around the top 10 if not top 5 places in the Henderson area, and honestly it does deserve this stature even though it's a chain.

Random tidbits that I just felt like sharing:

- Just noticed today that pinto beans are cooked w/ bacon, according to the menu. No wonder they taste so good!
- Guacamole costs a lot to add. I was kinda shocked that my friend paid over $10 w/ drink.
- The barbacoa is supposed to be spicy, per the web site, but I didn't notice a thing. I can normally detect this.
- Didn't realize that the onion and whatnot mix comes with the burrito bowl. No wonder _that_ tastes so good.
