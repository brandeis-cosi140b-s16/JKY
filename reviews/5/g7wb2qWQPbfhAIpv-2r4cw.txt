For NYE dinner in Vegas, I chose Border Grill because, after seeing Susan Feniger on Top Chef, I have always wanted to try her cooking. Border Grill definitely lived up to my expectations. The restaurant is located in Mandalay Bay and is very nice. It's dark inside and the walls are covered in interesting modern art. The food was delicious! While the menu had a wide variety of choices included kobe beef tacos with a pineapple salsa and duck nachos (!), I chose the Border Classics, which is an appetizer but can easily fill you up. The appetizer included chicken panuchos, green corn tamales and plantain empanadas. This was a great choice. The chicken panuchos were small but delivered a powerful spice. The green corn tamales were sweet and I couldn't get enough of them, the texture was unbelievable. As for the empanadas, my god, they were absolutely fantastic. The combination of the sweetness of the plantains and the cotija cheese was wonderful. I enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler, which is a mojito with a cucumber twist. Delicious and refreshing! After coming here, I can confidently say that I'd love to go back to Border Grill again and again, I'm glad there are a few near where I live!
