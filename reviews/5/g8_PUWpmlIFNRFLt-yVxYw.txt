I don't bother reviewing fast food chain places unless there is something I really feel like I need to say...and today I do.

I've lived in a neighborhood where this is the closest Taco Bell for over five years...and I have kids. So they want tacos every so often.

And in all the times I've been to this place over the years, for late-night dinners, for offsite lunch during work, whatever, this particular location has impressed me in the long haul.

This Taco Bell has NEVER, not once, gotten my order wrong. I can't say that about any other fast food place ever.

This Taco Bell's employees have always been so polite, friendly, and kind that they may have given me diabetes.

These people do a job that is by comparison, pretty lousy, and they probably get abused by a lot of rude folks in town. But they deserve to know that their efforts are noticed and appreciated.

Hats off to the staff and management here, you are an example to the entire chain.
