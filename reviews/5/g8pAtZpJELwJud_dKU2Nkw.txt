This family owned and run Mexican restaurant is a fabulous addition to McFarland. According to an article in The McFarland Thistle, the family's inspiration comes here from the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, where their mother's family had a restaurant. 

The food is well prepared and deliciously seasoned with flavors I haven't otherwise experienced in other local Mexican cuisine. I particularly enjoy the Carnitas and Conchinita Pibil, a slow roasted, citrus flavored and savory spiced pork dish that is amazingly delicious. Their Tostadas are another favorite and served on corn tortillas that are perfectly friend (crispy, not too greasy). They come in beef or chicken, but the restaurant has graciously let me substitute El Pastor on several occasions. Can you tell I like their pork? :)

Speaking of perfectly fried corn tortillas, their chips are wonderfully addictive and served with a slightly spicy salsa. I recommend trying the slightly spicier green salsa and the even spicier hot red salsa, which has a unique, smokey flavor. Lastly, don't miss out on the fried plantains-- they are again, perfectly fried, and served with grated cheese, sour cream, rice and black beans. 

Even people who don't normally care for Mexican food will find something tasty to eat all times of day at Los Jarochos. They have a thoughtful menu that caters to many tastes. In addition to their great lunch and dinner,  they also offer both American and Mexican breakfast. 

The owners and staff are incredibly lovely people, friendly, accommodating and a welcome addition to McFarland. I've definitely fallen in love with them a little bit. If you are looking for excellent food prepared with love and care, give Los Jarachos a try!
