Chipotle has paleo food!  To most people this doesn't mean much, but to me it is very important!  When I am following my diet strictly this is one of the only restaurants I can eat at and on top of that I love the food.  I am so happy they use local ingredients when they can.  Perfect lunch place for me and it always feels like a treat.
