Opening day free food! Thank you. Cheese quesadilla was excellent. Daughter enjoyed the french fries. Tried the red salsa and the brown salsa. The brown was pretty good and the red was excellent. Chips were okay, but I tend to like a thinner chip. Restaurant was bright and clean, service was fast and cheerful and the overall quality of food was great. I will go back.
