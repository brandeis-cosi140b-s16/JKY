So great for fast Mexican food,  the taste is fresh and flavorful.  I always stop on my way home from and I always order the shrimp tacos or burritos and they rock my face. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Can't say enough good things about the shrimp and fish being that I don't eat red meat but I'm more than sure you'll be happy if you're a meat eater as well. I love how late they're open and how consistently awesome they've been. Great service and great food.
