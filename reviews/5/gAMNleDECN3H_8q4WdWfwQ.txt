I have been here several times...my goto is either the chili relleno or the habernero burger...depending on ny mood.  The relleno is stuffed with carnitas and smothered in hatch green chili...awesome.   the burger has chopped haberneros cooked right into the meet and then covered with sliced haberneros....hot but oh so tasty.
