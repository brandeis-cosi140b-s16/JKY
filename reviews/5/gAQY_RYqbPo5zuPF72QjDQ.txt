Boy, talk about HEAT!! Get ready to pant like a dog! The salsa had a different shade of color to it than the traditional red salsa. This was a bit dark orange/ brick red color. And boy was it HOTTTTTTT. Kicked my butt!!!!! It was so good I couldn't stop eating it. Even though I had tears and a runny nose. I ordered the Molcajete Marinero. It came with rice and beans. It was sizzling hot and mouth burning spicy. Just the way I like it! I'm not fond of octopus because it has a lingering after taste in my mouth. Next time I will have them omit the octopus. The red chili sauce in the bowl was very good but have something cold to drink handy because it can make you cry! I really enjoyed my entree but I think $18.25 was way too expensive.  My friend ordered Mixto Camaron y Pulpo. The portion was large, as it should be for $12.80. He said the flavor was good. The only thing that was disappointing is that it only had 4 shrimp in the entire bowl. The restaurant staff was very nice, accommodating, and informative. There are some authentic mexican restaurants that give us the feeling we are not appreciated there. Not, Marscos Acapulco. Everyone from the waitress to the cook made us feel welcome. I would like to return and enjoy another meal here. YUM!
