Nobody solves a problem like Maria! I love Mexican Food. I have worked in East Mesa for over a year now, and I am always trying to find quality places to eat out here! It's hard!

Well I have driven by this place probably a million times, I had even been to Corelli's pizza which was a couple suites down...which is now Mafia Mike's Pizza...I have yet to try it..but I never stopped at Maria's.

I finally stopped in Maria's last week, and got the 99cent tostada special which was amazing...with chips and salsa and a dr. pepper..I spent less than $5 dollars! 

I went to Maria's again today, and got their chicken taquitos. They were delicious, they come with lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream on top, and they are not lacking flavor!

One of my co-workers got a bean and cheese burrito, which he very much enjoyed. 
And my other co-worker ordered the fish tacos. He also enjoyed his.

So if you are around Higley and Baseline looking for some good grub, check out Maria's. And if there is anyone else is East Mesa Land, please post about every place you find! It's limited out here!
