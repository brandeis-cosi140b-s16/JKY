I love Anita's and eat here often. The sombrero is great and the chicken soup is perfect everytime I order it. Each order comes with chips & delicious salsa. Very fast and the customer service is great too. I would highly recommend it for takeout. There aren't many places to eat near my office, so Anita's is a welcome addition! I'll post the menu here soon.
