I'm ruined,  I am absolutely RUINED because now and forever I will judge all other Mexican food places by Jefes. The five star ratings are true and just,  the food was amazing and fresh and just so damn tasty! 

I ordered a Jefes Burrito which comes with Carne Asada,  pollo, and shrimp. My God the shrimp! Delicious,  plump,  perfectly cooked morsels of seafood goodness next to perfectly seasoned and seared meat and chicken. The meat was juicy and flavorful,  not dry,  and each bite contained the perfect ratio of meat, guacamole,  and sour cream.

I tried both their green salsa and red salsa and WOW! The green salsa had that nice little kick on you tongue,  while the red was a smoky sucker punch that hit you hard after the fact. Be careful because the red sneaks up on you (get those napkins ready!) 

Being from California,  I know my Mexican food and Jefes is the real deal. I can't praise this place enough,  with the outstanding food and quick courteous service,  this is a winner in my book.
