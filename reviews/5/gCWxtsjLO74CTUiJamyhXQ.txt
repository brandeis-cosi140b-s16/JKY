Once you walk through the doors you're transported to authentic Mexico.  In fact, this may be one of the most authentic restaurants in Madison.  

The breaded chicken torta blew my mind.  Really, really good.  Its $8 and it can easily feed two people (I like to eat and I didn't dare finish it).  

I haven't tried the tacos or the rest of the menu but the cooks look like the real deal.  

The grocery store has a surprisingly huge array of meats in its deli.  They looked fresh and the prices were cheap.  

I'm excited about this place.  You will be too.  Check it out.  I'll be back soon.
