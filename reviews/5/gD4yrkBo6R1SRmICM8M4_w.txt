I had their pizza for the second time today I had got their pick up special $5.95 each. I was not disappointed the crust has great flavor. I also ordered their chicken wings special 32 wings,fries and a two liter soda for $20.99 the wings were really good and their fries taste great. As always they have great customer service.
