I am addicted shrimp burritos. I eat shrimp burritos whenever I get the chance and they have the best! Very large portions. Really yummie chips made in house. I really hope they open another location, but until they do, I make the drive for their food! Nice place to go for lunch and sit outside or grab dinner to take home.
