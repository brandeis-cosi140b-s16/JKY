No complaints here! Hidden gem in the City of Mesa as it is hidden on the side of Extension Rd. My friend recommended this place as she is quite knowledgeable in where to eat the best "Mexican Foods" in town. Enjoyed this place so much went there the second time in two days.Had tacos the first night, and tortas the next night. And I have to say is quite big and most importantly delicious! Friend thought I wasn't going to finish it, but proved her wrong (brought the inner fat boy in me-hehe!). Had a 30-minute challenge of who could finish a whole torta, and if the contestant is successful torta is on the house. Might try it one day as I believe I can do it. Overall, loved this place and will definitely come back for a third, fourth, and fifth time until I get tiresome of tortas and tacos. :)
