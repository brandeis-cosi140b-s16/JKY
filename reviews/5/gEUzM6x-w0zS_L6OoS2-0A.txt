This place rocks!  Miguel, owner and chef, is awesome.  Besides making some kick-ass Mexican fare, he is a great guy.  He will serve you the food himself, and go out of his way to make sure you are satisfied.  Guacamole is not on the menu, however, you need only ask Miguel to make some.  And Miguel makes the BEST GUACAMOLE YOU WILL EVER EAT!!!  Garlic shrimp were great, and the beans that accompany the main courses are amazing (and i don't like beans!).  Fajitas full of flavor.  Endless chips and salsa to start.  I could go on and on.  We were in Scottsdale for 8 nights, and ate at some great places (Deseo, Roaring Fork, Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, Hiro Sushi, Rehab Burger Therapy, White Chocolate Grill).  If I could only return to one of them again in my lifetime, it would be El Ranchero.
