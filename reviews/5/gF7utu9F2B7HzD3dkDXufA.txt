Delicioso! Awesome experience from the time we walked in the door until we left.  We were immediately greeted and escorted to a table. Drinks, appetizers were beyond amazing!  Guac and margaritas is what we had. I had the carne asada and the husband had the pollo relleno. Dessert was sopapilla!  Mike D. was our waiter and treated us like royalty!  It's a small place but great ambiance.  I really liked the intimate vibe.  The music playing was great too! Highly recommend and will come back!
