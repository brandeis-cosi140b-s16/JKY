After experiencing the wonder that is Carolina's West, I decided to check out the original location. 

To say the place is rough looking would be a major understatement. It is an old building in a marginal area. The floor in the place looks very garage-like, only with water and spilled soda puddling on the floor instead of motor oil. It all adds to the overall charm of the place. 

The food, of course, is top notch. As good or better than their West Valley location. Service is quick, and sometimes even friendly, though not uniformly. It was an experience I hope to repeat soon. Just great, basic, Mexican food.
