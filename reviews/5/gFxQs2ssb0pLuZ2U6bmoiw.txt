Please remove that closed sign you have written across my old review.  Don Jose's is back in business!  I know.... miracles happen.  After 41 years as one of the best and most authentic Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix Don Joes's closed for a short period of time.  But alas, we can all stop the sniveling.  Don Jose's has reopened after a good deal of remodeling.  The best news is everything else is the same.  All of the great, reasonable and made to order food is one waitress from you getting exactly what we loved all those years of weekly dinner at this family owned restaurant.   Don Jose himself will be right there to greet you.  Same food, same great customer service.  What a great way to start the New Year
