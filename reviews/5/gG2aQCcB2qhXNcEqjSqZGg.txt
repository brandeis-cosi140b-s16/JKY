My husband and I met some friends here last Friday after work. It was my first time being at the original Aunt Chiladas . I had been to the one in Tempe but didn't realize they are not affiliated?  The history and the character of this location is amazing.! From the service of our waitress, to The delicious taco bar and the personality of the chef JD , it was an overall phenomenal experience . Exceeded my expectations ! cannot wait to go back!
