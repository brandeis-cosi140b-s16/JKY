After first when I heard the name I was skeptical. The business on the inside and outside is quite nice. It was also nice to walk into a restaurant that was busy, but still a calm atmosphere. We were helped right away and our order (the ceasar salad and a taco salad) came out 10 mins or under after we ordered it! :) Their salsa is phenomenal and the service was great also, nice server named Adam. I recommend the Cesar salad. Definitely go again.
