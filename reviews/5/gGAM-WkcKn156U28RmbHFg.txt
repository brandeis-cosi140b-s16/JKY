The wait at the drive thru is RiDAMNdiculous, so long you would think they are slaughtering the chicken back there or cooking them with the Damn sunlight(This is Vegas-that  last scenario is perfectly plausible). However the food is off the chain.Loco chicken doesn't get better than this.I recommend this particular branch highly just bring a work Tablet and get some graphs done while  waiting in the driving thru. Two thumbs up from me-Loco for you El Pollo Loco!
