Fajitas is the only place I will eat fajitas. Usually do dinner there with friends every two months or so and have been doing so for 10+ years.  There are five of us and we always order 1 1/2 pounds of pork fajitas, nothing like being in a rut, but they're the best so why switch. I thought it was finally time to write a review.

Last night was no different, same time, same place and same order. We were seated quickly in a large both. Chips and salsa to start with sodas and iced tea for all. Chips are OK and the salsa has just enough kick. Placed our order with what turned out to be the BEST server we've ever had at Fajitas, Tiana. We've never had poor service at Fajitas, but Tiana was above and beyond. Always a smile, drink glasses never got below half before she brought another refill and our order came out spot-on. Tiana kept checking back and brought everything before we had to ask, that's good service! Pork fajitas didn't disappoint and come with fresh tortias and more as needed.

If you want great Fajitas this is the place to go. I can't comment on any other food items because I've never tried anything else. I kind of have my favorite places to go depending on what I'd like to eat.
