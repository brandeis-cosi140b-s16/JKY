Another great visit 
Friendly and quick service. Taco Tuesday 99ea 
Choriqueso burrito with chips meal very filling. 3 taco w/chips great. 1 beef (good) 2 chicken (tasty &  moist).
Choriqueso dip little greasy like meat wasn't drained but still yummy took what was left home! 
Plantains with yogurt sauce such a yummy desert!
