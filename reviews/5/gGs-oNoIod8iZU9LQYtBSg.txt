A friend and I went to Urban Taco for the first time last night. When we first got there, all the seating was taken except a small table by the door and it became obvious there was only one waitress/server. We almost walked out thinking  service would be lousy. I'm glad we didn't. Our waitress was with us in just a few minutes and took our orders. The food came out very quickly and we were delighted with the service. The food was absolutely delightful, and we really enjoyed the selection of salsas. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for something new and unique. And we learned later, that a member of the waitstaff and walk out earlier that day.
