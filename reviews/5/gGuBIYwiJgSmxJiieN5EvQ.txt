Very friendly staff, even though it was crowded. The bathroom was super clean! Which is always a plus! The dining area was super clean and well taken care of, considering that I noticed at least two transients coming in and out of the restaurant. They upgraded their food menu which is actually for the best, and still retaining some of the "old" favorites.
