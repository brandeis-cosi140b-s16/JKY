Best Mexican in Charlotte! Authentic and where all the locals eat. The restaurant is not in the best part of town, but do not be afraid the atmosphere is great. The staff is very welcoming and the food is delicious. Generous portions for the price. Ask for Abraham he is the bomb and is the best waiter!
