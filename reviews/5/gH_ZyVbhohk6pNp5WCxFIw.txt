I have eaten here about 4 times.  The food and service were great each time.  This is a casual dining experience;  you place your order with the cashier, pay, and then someone will bring your food out when its ready.  No alcoholic beverages served,  but they have bottled sodas from Mexico which are tasty (Made with Sugar,  not High Fructose syrup). Defianetly one of my favorite places to eat since Ive moved to Queen Creek.
