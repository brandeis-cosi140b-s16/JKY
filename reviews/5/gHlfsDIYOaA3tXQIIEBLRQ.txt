Fabulous food. No I mean Fabulous food. Like the kind you could eat every day.  Best beans in town, great margaritas, great chips. green corn tamales-yum. Bean burro enchilada style-nummy. chicken tacos with jalapeno cream cheese - wow. 
That the food was great is part of the experience. The people, the service are outstanding.
