Amazing.  The rest of the Mexican restaurants in Champaign do not even compare to Maize.  I got the Volcanes --- truly one of the best dishes I've consumed in a while! 

The good things about Maize: 

(1) Maize had fresh ingredients.  The cilantro tasted like it had just been harvested from a garden this morning.  Seriously.  Most of the other Mexican restaurants in the area either do not use cilantro or use barely any at all, so Maize's generous serving of fresh cilantro was a definite plus.

(2) Maize appeared very sanitary and clean.  Some the restaurants on campus are somewhat grungy, but this restaurant seemed very well-kept and clean.

(3) The decor and music put me in a very good mood.  From the outside, Maize may look a bit drab, but once you are inside, it's bright and colorful. 

I kind of wish the place were bigger and had more parking, but I don't really think it's a huge deal.  The small size of the restaurant gives it "character."
