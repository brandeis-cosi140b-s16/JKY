Best Veggie Burrito around!  The Staff is always friendly and kind and quick.  The restaurant isn't so easy on the eyes, but really great places seem to roll that way.  I would recommend calling in your order in advance if you want it TO GO.  Not much room to sit around and wait for it to be done.  My GO TO place for lunch when I am craving Mexican!
