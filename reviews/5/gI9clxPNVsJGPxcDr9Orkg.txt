This place is bomb! Reminded me of my hometown in Sonora. I had the carne asada burrito and the carne asada fuego taco. Both were very tasty and i recommend this place. This is the second taco shop in town that I have personally found to be the most authentic to Sonora. It's been tough for me to find a legit burrito/taco place. So, when I find a gem, i think its important to let you know.
