My apologies to every taqueria I hold near and dear to my heart...this place is hands down the best I have ever been to.  Our office goes to Vegas a couple times a year and we all CRAVE Gordos.  Cabeza tacos are my favorite but there is one thing so ridiculously good that we never see even in California...mulas.  For God's sake make sure you get mulas, they are heaven and you'll be hard pressed to find them anywhere else.  Go here and make it part of your Vegas experience, be sure to thank me later...
