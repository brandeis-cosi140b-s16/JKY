So here is the deal. In the phoenix area you will find plenty Mexican food however this one is different.  Here is why. Most the Mexican food you find in Phx has a northern Mexico/Sonoran influence which is good but it is different than central Mexico.  This is one of the best authentic central Mexico restaurant. If you don't believe me just try the Mexican enchiladas with chicken and green sauce.  Don't forget to ask for avocado.  You will not be disappointed.  Your welcome!
