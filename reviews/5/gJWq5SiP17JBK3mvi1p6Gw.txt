Someburros has amazing chorizo, enchiladas, chimichangas, salads, churros, and pretty much anything else you'd want. I love their original Tempe restaurant, and the Chandler restaurant is just as good.

The staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. I couldn't love it more (I come almost once a week.)
