I have seen a number of posts
 looking for authentic Baja style fish tacos here in the Phoenix area.. At 328 E. University drive in Mesa (NW corner of University and Mesa drives) Rosa's Mexican Grill serves fish tacos in 3 varieties: white fish, salmon and shrimp tacos. They are marinated and grilled, not fried. and topped with an excellent verde salsa.
