Is it Wednesday? Yes it is and that means .99 tacos at Roberto's!! Oh yeah!!

Roberto's Tacos, originally from CA, has locations all around the Las Vegas area and they are all pretty much uniform: Good Mexican food, fast. They serve traditional Mexican fare at a very reasonable price. 

Everything here is pretty good, but my favorite dish has to be the Carne Asada Nachos. I will warn you however that you may never be satisfied with any other nachos if you try these.

As someone posted earlier,  they don't do Tex Mex. They also don't have ground beef like substance or tacos within a taco.  I consider these a pro.
