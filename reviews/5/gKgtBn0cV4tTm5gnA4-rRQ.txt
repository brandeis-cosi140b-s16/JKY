I love this Restaurant, I have been going to San Diego bay for years and the food is still great. I was raised in Mexico in the state of Jalisco and this place really reminds me of home. If you are looking for Chimichangas, Burritos, Cheese melted everywhere this place is NOT for you. You are looking for a Tex Mex or chain Restaurant. Every time I have gone to San Diego Bay the food has been very fresh I love their plate of raw oysters, Tostadas de Ceviche, and Campechanas. Oh and Tilapia is very common in Mexico because we have many lakes and we also farm raise it so YES this Restaurant has Tilapia. Also if you are hung over the Michelada is a must have, Beer and Clamato I know it sounds weird but it is so good!! My Fiancée had the Mariscada which is a mixture of Octopus, Oysters, Sea snails, tilapia and shrimp sautéed in yummy garlic goodness with rice. Needless to say he loved it I was not surprised. When I get nostalgic for REAL Mexican this is about as close as you can get in the Valley. Fresh sea food and an ice cold Pacifico  oh yeah!
