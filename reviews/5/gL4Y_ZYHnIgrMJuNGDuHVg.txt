This is a no frills just good mexican food restaurant.  It is clean and the food is great.  Today was my 3rd time in and I've never been disappointed. I've taken my hubby a couple of times now and he totally agrees.  I do have to say the first time I went in and saw the pictures on the wall of the food I thought uh oh, but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had the Chicken Chimichanga.  It is huge and easily 2 meals for under 8 dollars.  (It's actually 3 for me but I'd expect to make it 2.)  The chicken is white meat NO FAT or grissle.  Seems like high quality ingredients.  I'm thrilled to have found this slightly hidden jewel.
And if you want to know why I'm raving it's because yes they are slow and I'm going to be bummed if they close. So go check it out.  :-)
If you're coming from the south just turn left on Oakey and then right into the Pizza Hut parking lot, it's behind Pizza Hut.
