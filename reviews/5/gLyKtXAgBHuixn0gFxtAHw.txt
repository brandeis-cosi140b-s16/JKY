Customer service is the best.
Had a burrito today and had a bowl last time coming here.
Superb flavors whichever way you go. Portion size is large enough to fill me up and I'm not a small guy. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Prices are low for what they serve you.
Overall 5 star. I highly recommend Braddah's.
