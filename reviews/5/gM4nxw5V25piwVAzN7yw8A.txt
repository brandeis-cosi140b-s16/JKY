Oh tacos Jalisco, you are my everything. Coming from a border town flooded with authentic Mexican food, I set my standards pretty high for tacos and the likes. Tacos Jalisco reassures me that I don't need to go back home for my fix. 

These tacos are legit! I recommend the al pastor, cabeza, and lingua. So good I got my vegetarian girl friend to try one just because the smell of the to go box in my car was driving her crazy.

Oh, and the lady who took my order was a sweetheart as well.
