Discovered this place driving by it on Broadway, just east of Alma School.
Lots of taco shops in the valley, but this one has a few things that simply make it better than the average slew of "(insert random name here)berto's" type places.
First off, the tortillas they use to make the burros are delicious, almost as good as Carolina's.  My favorite item is the shrimp burro.  The shrimp are nice/firm, combined with rice and other filling to create an extremely tasty burro!  They offer a Diablo version of the same if you are feeling spicy!
Their breakfast burros are also quite tasty.  Other items I've tried include hard shell tacos, taquitos and these tasty bags of tortilla rounds they either bake or fry and coat with sugar and cinnamon.  Simple, yet delicious!
I have no opinion on the refried beans as I usually don't have them on or with anything I order.
You can dine in (a few tables inside) or go through the drive thru.  I recommend going inside to see all the tasty options on their menu board. (You will find misspellings on the board, but hey, I'm more concerned about the food and service than an absolutely correct translated menu board)
Is the place perfect, no, but what is?! I would agree with one of the other reviewers, that the fish tacos are not the best choice here.  Also, they have been a little slow on preparing orders a couple times, but it's always been worth the wait.
Lastly the place is always very clean and the staff are very nice!
