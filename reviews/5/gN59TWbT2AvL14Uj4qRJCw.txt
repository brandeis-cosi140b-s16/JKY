I have recently relocated back to the Valley. After a recommendation from a friend I decided to give this place a try. I was NOT disappointed! Chips and hot sauce were great, just a nice perfect touch of heat. I ordered the smoked pork street tacos and beans and rice. One of the best meals I've ever had! Smoke was not overwhelming in the meat, just perfect! Service was top notch, it is cash only but there is an ATM on site if you don't have any cash. I will definitely be back!!
