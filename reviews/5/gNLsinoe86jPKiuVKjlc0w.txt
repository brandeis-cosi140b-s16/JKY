Here's the scoop...

Picture it: This place is located near my house and the building had been empty for years (NOTHING had been able to stay in that building too long... Mexikenny's, Baracuda's, some steak-restaurant or whatever... you get the gist). However, yesterday I was driving to work and I noticed they had hanged a banner on the front of the building saying "Grand Opening!" with their name and I thought, "Hmm. Sounds interesting," so I told my family we should check it out for dinner that night (we like to support our fellow local small businesses).

So we went there for dinner... Ohmygodddddd.

Ah. May. ZING.

No joke, THE BEST Mexican food that has ever passed my lips. I don't honestly like Mexican food, but-like most Southwesterners-I partake every once in a while... but El Rico's food converted me. Yes, I now am a Mexican food lover. I couldn't even tell you what was my favorite. All I know is they have a great grilled shrimp taco salad, awesome bean dip, and their guacamole? Bomb dot com. And it wasn't just the food that made this experience memorable and wonderful... They have great customer service and the inside decor makes you feel as if you're actually seated on a patio! SOO excited to have such a great family-run eatery nearby. Spread the word... El Rico's Dos Mexican Food! :]
