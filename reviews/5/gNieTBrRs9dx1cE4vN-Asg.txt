I have been coming here for years and have been remiss for not reviewing it sooner.  Customer service is great, ambiance is great (given about 200 sq/ft of dining space) and food is delicious texmex style Mexican food.

I have only ever dined in at Caminero and a real testament to their awesomeness is the fact that I have never gotten my order before they fulfilled a takeout order.

Some might say that's bad customer service, but I look at it as though Caminero has so much takeout business that no matter what day I go in, someone else already has an order in. 

Similarly, I've never waited more than 10 minutes for food, so I can't really complain.  The menu is simple yet varied and I have never been disappointed with an order.  Even if I were, I'm sure they'd make it right; they once tried to comp my entire order ($30) because they had run out of shredded beef for my ONE taco and would have to substitute ground beef. 

If you're local and don't know about Caminero, go there.  If you're visiting, go there too.
