Roberto's Taco Shop - 10030 W. Cheyenne Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89129
I love this location and the food. I tell my husband everytime we eat their food that I would rather order this and take it home than go to  any Mexican Restaurant's here in town. I have read otehr reviews where peole say it's not 'authentic' tasting, but my taste buds think otherwise!  The staff here are so nice and they are very quick.
