OK those were the best shrimp tamales I've ever had in my life.  Perhaps the only shrimp tamales I've ever had -- but they were OFF THE CHAIN. 

We had the pig wings and taco toes (spell check refuses the real spelling) they were very good but my Mexican husband claimed the filling was too spiced -- not hot spicy but too much of the flavor 

$32 for everything.  Whut?!?
