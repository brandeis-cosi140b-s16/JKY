It was a lazy day so we decided to just order out. Unfortunately it was like pulling teeth trying to order over the phone. I did, however, have a pretty large order. When I was finished, she said it would be ready in 10 minutes. Sure enough, it was waiting for me when I got there. 

The food is always good. I have a mild obsession with their grilled shrimp burrito. It's also very large, I wouldn't even be able to imagine eating the whole thing in one sitting. My husband and mom usually get the pork carnitas and chicken burritos for my 3 and 5 year old. My kids aren't super picky, they'll eat whatever is put in front of them even if they don't care for it. However, my boys love the chicken burritos from here. 

The manager is a great guy. Whenever we come in, he'll stop by and chat with us for a while, play with the baby,  bring some extra tortillas for the little one.. 

This place continues to excel in my book and is definitely my go-to place for Mexican food.
