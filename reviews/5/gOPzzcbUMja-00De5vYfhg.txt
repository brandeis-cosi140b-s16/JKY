Ritos is incredible! I actually go to the one Downtown, but couldn't find it on yelp so deal with it. 

The tortillas, OMG! Dying delicious.  The red and green sauce are good and all, but its the tortiallas that make Rito's so freaking good. 

The steak inside the steak burrito is cooked perfectly. Chewable, savoury, and chunks of steak, not little bits 

The place is bomb. The line is worth it so just enjoy!
