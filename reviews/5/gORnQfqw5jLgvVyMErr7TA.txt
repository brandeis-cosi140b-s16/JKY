By no means am I an expert on Mexican food nor do I have a trace of Mexican blood running through my veins...unless there's something Grandma wants to tell me.....but GODDAMN the al pastor here is amazing!!!!  Its almost got a Chinese bbq pork quality to it.  

The supreme tacos are definitely the way to go for $2.45 each.  2 grilled tortillas with melted cheese in the middle w/ piles of al pastor, cilantro, sour cream and pineapple.  I felt like I was on a vacation eating this thing.  Heaven!!!
