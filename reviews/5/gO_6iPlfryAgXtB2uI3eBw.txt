Joy for Joyride! I'm obsessed with the food, especially the "standard" taco, which is really sort of a misnomer because there is nothing basic about it.  It's flavorful and divine! Nothing here is greasy or overdone-- the food is fresh and light but very, very tasty.  I also love the carnitas taco, and the cheese dip appetizer is to die for.  It's topped with fresh jalapenos, other peppers, and tomatoes/ onions.  Soooooo yummy.  

The atmosphere is casual, fun, and very social.  I also love that it's a Mexican joint but they play great indie tunes.  No mariachi! My only complaint about the layout is the seating in the lounge patio where you wait for your table.  There are these little poof seats that put your arse right at the same height as the table and they're uncomfortable.  Yes, this is a very picky little thing but I'm trying to keep myself honest and not just give an all-glowing review.

If you love fresh and light Mexican food, give Joyride a try!
