Honestly, I have had Chipotle approximatley 1,000 different times in the past 9 years since I first fell in love with it. This location is in the top 5% of best visits to the restaurant that I have had. Customer Service was top notch, food was perfectly cooked, chips done right (not too much salt, hint of lime), and the speed of the line was outstanding. Even with the Lady with two kids meals in front of me.
