This is the best meal I've had in the valley, period. The pork in banana leaf, the guacamole, the salsa, the elote and the burritos were all incredible. We enjoyed the live music and the staff was very helpful in creating something suitable for picky little kid eaters. I'm sad it will be another year until I'm back in AZ and back to Barrio Cafe!
