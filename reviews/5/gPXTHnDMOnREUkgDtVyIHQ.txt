Great street tacos that taste better that the higher priced "authentic street tacos" at more expensive places. I judge a "taco-chop" like this on how good the tripas are. Knocks it out of the park! Crispy, seasoned just right and small enough so you can have several and relive the pleasure again and again. The birria and cabeza are tender and oh so juicy.  Write this down...real street tacos don't have lettuce, tomatoes or cheese.
