My husband and I love this place! I normally don't like much authentic Mexican food but I have not had a menu item from here that I don't like yet. I've had the chicken chimichanga a few times,  steak tacos,  bean and cheese burritos, and the Mary tierra special and they all have been amazing. Plus their churros are good and their horchata drink is delicious! Everything is always so fresh and hot. And the dining area is always really clean and the staff is nice.
