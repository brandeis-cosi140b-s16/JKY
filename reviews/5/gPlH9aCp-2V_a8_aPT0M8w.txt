Went to Jaburrito Saturday, it was amazing. Quick, easy, healthy and delicious. We were greeted happy pleasant servers. Because it was my first time I asked a lot of questions. They were very knowledgeable and helpful. Food was super fresh, I had the Redondo and would highly recommend it. We will definitely return, I like having a fresh healthy alternative  to lunch choices in Vegas.
