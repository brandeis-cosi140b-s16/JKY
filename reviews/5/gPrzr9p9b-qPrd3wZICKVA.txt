Just watched a customer bring two burritos back to the counter because they weren't wrapped well enough to eat by hand (they're pretty large) and ask that they be re-wrapped. The owner had the staff make two new burritos for the customer instead. The WiFi is still free but you need the code from the cashier, now. (Hint: It's the Taco Spot phone number)
