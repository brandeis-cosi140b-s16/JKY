This place is AMAZING. My husband and I are travelling from Texas and have yet to come across an authentic mexican restaurant that serves clean organic non gmo dishes. Even the desserts are clean. I ordered the carne asada burrito with green sauce and goodness it was tasty! We live very close to the mexican border and this food tasted like home. So happy to have found this place and wish we had one back in South Texas.
