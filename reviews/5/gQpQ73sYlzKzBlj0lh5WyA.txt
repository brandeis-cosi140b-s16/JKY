First time I had this was when I lived in SoCal -- Pasadena location.  It was AWESOME.  I got a shrimp burrito and never looked back... Well OK that's a lie.  I looked back when I went back almost every month for this!  (It was almost an hour drive or it would have been WAY more often)

I AM SO HAPPY THERE IS ONE IN LAS VEGAS!  It totally channels that SoCal surfer dude feel and the employees seem to really dig their jobs -- which makes service awesome.  As much as I love their burritos, I have found something else that makes my heart cry for another:

Chronic Fries.

Oh my DSJHFSKD dude, get these with carne asada and slather on some baja sauce and go to heaven.  Bro, these fries are legit.

Bottom line: Awesome prices, good service, good seating, and epic food.  Join their Chronic Tacos Loyalty Program and receive random discounts n'stuff!
