I was flying up 24th street late for a business meeting when I cut the wheel into the nearest strip mall shopping center to grab some lunch.  Opened the door at Tortas el Rey into one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had.  Lemonade with fresh squeezed lemons. Home styled salsa with the right amount of good heat.  Fast service, and large portions of fresh onions, peppers, chorizo, quacamole, and homemade tortillas served steaming. I had the house signature dish Alhambra de Res.

Que bueno!
