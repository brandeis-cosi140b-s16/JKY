Ok, it's a Chipotle Mexican Grill. It's exactly like all the others, and the menu is the same.

That being said, it is inside a mall, and has a reasonably large and clean seating area outside the restaurant in the concourse. The food was good, and the staff was efficient and served promptly and hot. It is possible to get some variability in the freshness of the food and cleanliness of the location of course, and on both points this location was great.

The only reason I'm adding my review here, since I don't think every single Chipotle needs a review, is that it was one of my best meals in Vegas. The last time I was in Vegas it seemed a little easier to find something vegan. Especially in some of the $100+ per person restaurants, I'd expect the chef to be a bit more accommodating.

Anyway, two thumbs up (and five stars!) for finding a Chipotle convenient to my hotel, the Palazzo.
