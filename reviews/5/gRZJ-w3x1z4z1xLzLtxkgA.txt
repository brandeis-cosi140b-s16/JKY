Had lunch with a friend of mine after dress shopping and this is officially one of my best taco spots in town. I've struggled in finding an authentic taco place in Phoenix since I moved from Mexico (ironic, considering the amount of Mexicans living here), but I found it! The salsa bar is my favorite part, but try the shrimp tacos, the gaucho taco and the maya taco, you won't regret it. No sour cream or cheddar cheese non-sense here! Pure authentic Mexican fare (I lived in Mexico for 27 years, I know what I'm talking about!) Make sure you're here early, lunch time is packed, but is totally worth the wait.  Tip: It's easier to park around the corner.
