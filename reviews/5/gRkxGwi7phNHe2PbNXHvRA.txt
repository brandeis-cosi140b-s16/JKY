In the era of unique burger chains that have been popping up all over town, this place is one of the best. As someone who loves burgers, mexican food, and spicy foods, their Arizona style burger with green chile beef on top of the burger patty is incredible. I added pepper jack cheese and topped it with lettuce and Cholula hot sauce. What resulted was a fiery yet delicious burger that was entirely unique in flavor and ingredients. With so many burger joints around, it's hard to find such a uniqueness anymore, but Bueno Burger delivers. I highly recommend it.
