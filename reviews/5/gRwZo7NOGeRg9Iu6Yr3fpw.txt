On the way from Tucson to Vegas, we get the urge for tacos... and we find Anita's... and we take god and every Mexican that we did.

From the outside, it looked very nice. When we walked in, we were instantly greeted and given a variety of seating options. Out server was an absolute sweetheart.

Sitting among locals and those who stop in every time the pass through, we quickly learned that everything on the menu was good and that you have to try all of the salsas. 

The mean was just fantastic. Tacos, enchiladas, rice, all cooked and seasoned perfectly. A full dinner for two, for under $20, and served with a very personal touch.

We will stop in any time we find ourselves in the area.
