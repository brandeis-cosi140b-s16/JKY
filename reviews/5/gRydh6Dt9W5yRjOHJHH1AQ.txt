Actually stumbled on this place when looking for a cheap, quick mexican joint.  We first went to filiberto's but walked out since the whole place reeked of dirty water.  

Their shredded chicken is very good here.  Seasoned right and cooked right.  My girlfriends favorite enchilada / taco place in the east valley thus far.

Their carne asada burrito will probably end out being the best burrito in the east valley for me.  It's very good quality meat, and the burrito is actually a full size burrito.  The meat isn't the typical chewy type that you usually encounter at your fast food mexican joints.

They have a big menu and serve all different types of meats... carnitas, chicken, lengua, carne asada.  Also have quite a few shrimp plates including shrimp cocktail so I'll definitely be trying that.

The prices are your standard fast food mexican prices, which makes this place even better.  If you roll in here drunk and have their carne asada burrito, it's probably nirvana..... be prepared.
