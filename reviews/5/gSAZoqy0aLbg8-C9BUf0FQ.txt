If you are looking for a nice, sit down restaurant - don't stop here.  If you are looking for some real honest to goodness Mexican food, this is your place.  Yep, it's a bit divey.  But, their red taco sauce is some of the best I have ever tasted (and while tasty, it's not too hot).  I had their Number 5 plate - enchilada and taco - wow!  Their enchilada sauce is also something worth trying.  This restaurant is best for driving through and taking back to your hotel to eat.
