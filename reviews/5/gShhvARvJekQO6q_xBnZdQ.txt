Fajardos is what was once know as Lily's Cafe.  I have been going there since the mid 80's and still love this place. 
When Zip the chef and owner died in 2006 we not only lost a great friend but we lost our favorite restaurant.  When the Fajardo family reopened the place it was really like a dream come true. 
I still really miss Zip but I know he would be happy that the restaurant lives on without him. 

The food is still the same and wonderful. The Salsa is great and I find myself eating a few bowls of it before i ever even get my food.  

My suggestions are the green chile soup and the special burrito (once called the Zip burrito.  I do admit though i have never had a dish there i didn't like.  

This place is one that you must check out.
