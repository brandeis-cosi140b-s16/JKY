I am NOT  EVEN a hot dog fan but this is no ordinary dog . Wrapped in Bacon you say  ! Mmmmmmm. Being back on the east coast it would be worth a trip back to AZ for one of these great dogs . Not a fancy place but WHO CARES ! This place was fantastic all the trimmings you can ever imagine & the service was superb ....love this place .
