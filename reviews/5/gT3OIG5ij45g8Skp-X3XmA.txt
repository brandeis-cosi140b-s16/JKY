It seriously upsets me when people bash this place! They obviously have zero taste for real Mexican food! We have been eating here for years, and have loved it all the way! We especially love the remodeling, friendly staff and if course delicious food! I love the beef flautas with guacamole, green chili anything, the been and cheese burrito, and the chicken supra taco salad! And don't forget the hot salsa! Oh so good! This place is always packed, so that also goes to show Espos is a favorite among many!  Leon has really made this a great neighborhood business.
