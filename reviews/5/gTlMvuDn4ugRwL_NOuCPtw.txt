There is something for everybody, seafood to mexican, to pizza(which is wonderful)  they have a wonderful happy hour if you are lucky enough to get a seat around the bar :)  And don't miss the chance to have the roasted garlic platter, it is to die for!  (just make sure everyone with you eats it too ;)  Easy to make a reservation on yelp so what are you waiting for?  Go NOW!
