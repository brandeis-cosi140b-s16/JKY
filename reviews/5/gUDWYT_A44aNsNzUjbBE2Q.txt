Awesomely awesome awesomeness. That is how I describe La Palapa restaurant in the southside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.

This means that truly authentic Mexican food finally has arrived here in the southside. Forget all other places, go to this place immediately. They recently won the best vegetarian soup in the most recent soup contest in Pittsburgh...this made me order one of their soups. The Frijoles Charros was amazingly tasty and perfectly cooked. If you get nothing else, get this (it isn't vegetarian...the bacon says so). 

For my main course, I ordered all of them, or just about. Trying to eat the Charola Para Dos! is tough. It's the sampler platter from the entr√©e section. Everything was great. Get it, but unlike me, you can share it with friends. The platter includes a tamal, quesadilla, flauta, one pork rib, chicken with mole, and one very extremely and most delicious empanada. I literally ate half of each one and I've taken the rest home for me to eat over the next day or two. 

As a southsider, I will be back to this restaurant again and again and again and again and again...
