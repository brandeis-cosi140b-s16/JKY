Chipotle, how I love thee!  This one does a great job at making everyone happy.  Food is fresh and generous.  Friendly faces keep the line moving.  The guac?  The best, ever!  My fav Iced Tea and here's tip- add green Tabasco for a yummy taste on top.  Nice amount of seating and even a little patio.  My only wish is that Chipotle HQ would let us have more comfy chairs.  But, I'll plant myself on the hard planks to enjoy a wonderful meal here!
