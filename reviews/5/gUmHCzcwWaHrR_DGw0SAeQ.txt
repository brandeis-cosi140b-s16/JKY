I love this spot.  It's totally economical (i.e. cheap), it's cash only and it's super quaint to say the least.

But warning, don't come here expecting anything other than a supercharged 'Bertos experience.  And when I say this, I'm making the clear distinction that the food here is awesome.  The enchilada sauce, the red chile and the green chile are super on point.  The beans are pretty good, not on that Carolina's level but close.  Tacos are head and shoulders above tons of other places.  

There is no place to sit.  The only seating area is a little shack type area with old school booths, gated style good walls and an a/c that serves it's purpose but this is Phoenix and it's flippin hot.  There's about 8 booths in there.  

My go-to is the 3-Way burro which is red chile, green chile and beans.  It's the best.  They have a 2-Way which is just red and green plus they have the line up of usual suspects that are all done nicely.  Grande Burro is on my list of future orders.

For this type of fast food, Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, I do feel El Norteno is doing it right.  Go there.
