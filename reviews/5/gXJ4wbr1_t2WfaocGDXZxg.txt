It is my second time eating here. I am not a local so i cant enjoy this place as much as i wish i could so when i am in Vegas i make sure i eat here at least once. The food is great! Some things are not completely "authentic" but its as close as you can get. The table-side guacamole is so good. I has the beef flautas this time and they were so good. The place is not cheap but the portions are huge. The agua de Jamaica was delicious! The bus boys/waiters are on it! As soon as my cup was half full they immediately came to refill it, and when i say immediately i mean it... They are so attentive and i never had to ask for anything since they offered way before i even thought about it. We enjoy eating here so much because the place looks so nice and authentic, the service is great and all the food we have tried has really surprised us so far. Definitely recommend this place.
