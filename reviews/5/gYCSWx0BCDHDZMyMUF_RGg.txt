My favorite Mexican restaurant is the Mi Pueblo on Union Hills. My 2nd favorite is this Mi Pueblo located by Metro Center. The only reason it is my 2nd favorite is because it is way out of my neighborhood. But it is delicious.

No, it's not a coincidence that it has the same name and incredibly awesome food just like the north location. They are owned by 2 brothers. Interestingly enough, the food isn't exactly alike, but there are certain flavors and menu items that are similar. 

I do like how this location has sit down service AND booze. Contrary to what the yelp description says about alcohol, it does not only have beer and wine. There is a full bar. And the last time I went, their margaritas were on special for only $2! And they were good and very STRONG... My husband was thrilled that he got me drunk for only $4.

They have an expanded seafood menu with all the traditional Mexican seafood cocktails... 

Chips and salsa VERY good.

I had the spinach enchiladas which were heavenly. Not too greasy with 2 delicious enchilada sauces. Beans and rice were great too. My husband loved his fish tacos.

Service was perfect. Attentive and friendly. 

Highly recommended! Give those big chains a break and try this family run little joint.
