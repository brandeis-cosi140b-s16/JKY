In high school did you ever have a friend of the opposite sex who you were platonicly close with but then lost contact with post-high school only to see them years later and they are completely grown up and boneable? Yesterday's visit to LPS was just like that, the poorly presented delicious Mexico city Mexican food of my youth has been transformed into well plated, incredible tasting fare. LPS has some of the BEST salsa, ever, a spicy blended red, a tamatillo/avo green, and a mixed pico. I had the pork flat tacos with a side of the chilaquiles. (greatest dish ever, ench sauce, cheese and chips baked together... kind of like a mex baked ziti actually) The roomies had chk enchiladas and beef tacos, both were spectacular. The service is really hit or miss, our server couldn't split the check to save his life and spoke little English but it could have been worse.
