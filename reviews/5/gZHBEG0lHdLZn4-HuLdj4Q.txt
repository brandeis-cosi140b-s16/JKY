Yayo is amazing. The food is good and the vibe is awesome. Its really a college student hangout. If you don't like the live music which is on often, take your food to go. There is no reason for you being here obviously so just take your grub to go. Most of the shows are local underground shows, and they often play a lot of punk stuff too, so the selection isn't really to most peoples taste. But I love it.
