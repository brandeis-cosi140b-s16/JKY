Wife and I just moved to AZ from Seattle area where there were no Del Taco's.  What a pleasant surprise!  The food was better than we anticipated considering how great the prices were.  It was so good that we tried it again a few days later and we were equally impressed.  The service was excellent as well. Del Taco is an excellent value for the price!
