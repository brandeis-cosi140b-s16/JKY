I am in love with this place! It has a wonderful atmosphere!  And great Wall decorations! I went on a Saturday evening, and was greeted promptly upon entering. Very sweet staff. Our waiter promptly got our drink orders and even refilled our chips and salsa while we decided. They had a female live singer singing beautifully (and not too loud). 
I ordered the enchilada platter and chose chicken with red sauce. They also offer beef as an option (but no carnitas) and green sauce. The chicken was moist and perfectly cooked. The enchiladas had just the right amount of sauce and heat and cheese !!!! Oh it was absolutely delicious. The plating was beautiful and everything on my plate came out hot and fresh! 
My friend ordered the pick 3 combo and had a crunchy taco with carne asada that looked out of this world and she said it did not disappoint, it was as tasty as it looked. 
I also had a mango margarita that was soooooo yummy (but not very strong) ! Absolutely perfect for a Saturday night meal with your girlfriends or buddies or family !! And it's in a great area ! I will definitely be returning!
