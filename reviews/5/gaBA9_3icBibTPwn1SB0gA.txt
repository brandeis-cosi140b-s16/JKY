Came to The Mission recently for our company holiday party and had an amazing experience. From the ambiance to the service to the food, everything was top notch. I was the first to arrive in our party of six. We had a reservation on a very busy Sunday evening and the table was ready and waiting for us in the back of the restaurant. I was greeted right away by our waiter. He came over and took my drink order and brought it out very quickly.

I was able to have a good look at the menu before the rest of the party arrived and good thing that I did because everything looked and sounded so good. When the rest of my party arrived, we decided to get table side guacamole and it was very fresh and delicious. I decided on the short rib tacos and a side of street corn for my entree and both were extremely good. The short rib was melt in your mouth good and the three tacos were perfectly sized. The street corn was served in a spicy chipolte sauce and I could have eaten it for days. I also asked if they had a spicer salsa and our waiter said that he could bring me out a sauce made with ghost chile. I went for it because I LOVE spicy. I knew to use it sparingly and it gave me the zip I was looking for to both my corn and tacos. Two of the people in my party were vegetarians and ordered the butternut squash tacos and absolutely loved them as well.

The manager/owner also came around to our table to see how we liked our dinner. I though that it was a great personal touch. He was very nice and attentive. Our service was outstanding.

I will definitely be coming back here soon. That street corn is enough to bring me back for sure and I would love to try many other items on the menu. Highly recommended.
