Great, great, great!!!!  My wife and I got hooked on this place when there used ot be one up in North Central Pho (7th AVe and Camelback). They hand make their tortillas, all the meats are good and seem pretty authentic. Salsita is the bomb (and I'm sure I gained close to 20 pounds during the year or so I was living in the house i own nearby). Their carnitas is the best I've ever had. They have a great salsa bar with super good somewhat runny guacamole, yum. The Torta Cubana is the real jewel on the menu, all though I never had anything there I didn't like. Top off your meal with a Horchata and your in So Pho food heaven. Don't forget to try the super nachos (best with carnitas, IMHO)
