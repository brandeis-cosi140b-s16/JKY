This place is fantastic!  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and the most importantly - superb food!  The Mexican penne pasta is seriously to die for.  Get it with shrimp (they don't skimp) to make it even better.  All food is made with fresh ingredients and not only is vegetarian and gluten free friendly, but also for clean eating.
