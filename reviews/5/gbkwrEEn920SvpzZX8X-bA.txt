This place is great. Their tacos are only a dollar and they're really good for what they're worth. I've also had they're carne asada fries, tortas, and tamales which were also very good. There are many other taco shops around me, much closer than this one, but this is my go-to place for Mexican food. I really wouldnt go anywhere else.
