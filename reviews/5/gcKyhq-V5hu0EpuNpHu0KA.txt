Honestly the best Mexican food in town. I grew up on the border and have a lot of family in Mexico. It is hard to find food this good even in Mexico. Try the Chicharron Quesadilla. It's not like most quesadillas at all, it has a mild savory flavor that is difficult to describe but I promise you won't regret it. 

The Lamb Adobo was my favorite entree. It is a very large portion so come with an appetite. Oh and I can't forget to mention the guacamole, it's hard to get such a simple dish right but they nailed it. 

All in all a great dining experience and this new location has a much larger indoor dining room for those really hot or really cold days when sitting on the patio is not really an option.
