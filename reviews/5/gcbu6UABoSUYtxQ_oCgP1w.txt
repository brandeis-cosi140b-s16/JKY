My friend and I came to Chpotle for dinner we start ordering but I noticed that the steak was not ready so when the worker "Justin " asked me what did I want I said a burrito with chicken and steak but because the steak was going to take a few mins to be ready he gave me a cup for me to get a drink while I wait at this time my friend already had her food and drink at a table so by the time the steak was done and it was a huge burrito Justin again has to help her co worker to heat up 2 tortillas to make the burrito roll now this was nice to my surprise the cashier Taylor told me I didn't has to pay that it was taking care because I had to wait for that long,I'm very happy for the caring and the 100 % customer service here I will come back again and tell everyone too
Thank you Justin,Taylor and Chipotle you Rule.
