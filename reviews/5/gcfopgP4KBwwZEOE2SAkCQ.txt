This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER. The ingredients are fresher and pack way more flavor. They make everything in front of you, so you can get it exactly the way you want it. The tortillas are even better too!!

My favorite: The sweet pork barbacoa salad! AMAZING! It's a pulled pork  that's marinated in this sweet tangy BBQ sauce that is really different from your normal mexican spices or even your southern BBQ flavors. YUM! And my favorite part: they pile the salad high. My recommendation is to get the vinegrette dressing which is basically clianto and lime. Absolutely perfect!
