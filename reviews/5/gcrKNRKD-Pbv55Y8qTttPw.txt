This is OUR favorite spot, we visit at least once a week.  The ladies are awesome, super friendly and know us well.  Its like going to a friends for dinner.

My husband likes to tease, and they call him a trouble maker.  My little man always gets the perfect taco for dinner, or the bacon and fruit for breakfast.

Thank you Thank you Thank you
