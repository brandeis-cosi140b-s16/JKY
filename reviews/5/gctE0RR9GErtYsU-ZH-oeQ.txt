Back again. Really great food at ridiculously low prices. Today when our food was ready they forgot one of our taco plates. A few minutes when it was ready they also included another at no charge for their oversight.  I mean who does anything like that? It was just a few minutes extra I had to wait for my food which was no big deal. And then another plate at no charge. This is a great place.  Food is delicious. The salsas are excellent. Everything has that homemade taste. It's food served fast but not in anyway you would classify it as fast food, like the mainstream fast food Mexican places.  Delicious rice and beans. Excellent tacos and burritos. 5 stars for sure.
