One of the best Arizona Sonoran style Mexican food joints in Arizona, or anywhere in the USA!

Great thin hot chips with typical, but good Arizona style salsas...
 
My favorite meal on their menu is the #5, Green Chile Chicken tamale, Sour Cream Enchilada, Rice & Beans...

The tamale has lots of meat in it, not like most tamales that are 85% Masa and little meat. 
The green chile they cover the tamale with is absolutely wonderful, very fresh green chile flavor and not to spicy as to mask the flavors of the masa & chicken. 

The sour cream cheese enchilada is amazing, wait till you taste it, seriously the best Sonoran style enchilada this Chef has ever had....an end product you can only get with using the finest of fresh ingredients!

The only downfalls EB has is no hard liquor, which equates to no REAL Margaritas (Ay, caramba!.....but they do have cold beer & and wine) and sometimes theres a wait for a table....

buen apittite!!!
