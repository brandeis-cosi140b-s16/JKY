Wow! We ordered so much food and just had to finish it. It was delicious and the team was most welcoming and friendly. Our waiter, Richard, knew exactly what to recommend and made our first experience a unique one for sure. We ordered a braised rib/avocado cheese crisp, green chili pork enchiladas, sopapillas, flan, guacamole and the seasonal vanilla cinnamon margaritas and nothing was less than excellent. Andre genuinely cared about our experience being a great one as well. He seemed to be very connected to the guests and his team. Considering the newness of this location, I'm quite impressed as they perform as if they've been here forever. Even the staff that was not immediately responsible for our table was smiling and checking our table. 

I recommend ordering both the flan and the sopapillas and dipping the spoonful of flan into the sopapilla honey. Yummy! Maybe they could serve with local honey drizzled over the flan. 

The pricing was very reasonable as well. I would have expected to pay more. Don't get any ideas though. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant. Thank you, Blanco! We will be back for sure.
