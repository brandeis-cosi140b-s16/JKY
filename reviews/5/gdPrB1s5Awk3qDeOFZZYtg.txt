Great food! Saw them on the news and had to check them out. The food was amazing! I love the corn appetizer and the chicken burrito. It melts in the mouth. My dad is extremely picky and high class and he loved this place so I will be coming again. They just opened 2 weeks ago so I think some of the other reviews are a bit harsh. Every just opening place has to work out the kinks in the beginning. I say give them a chance or wait a month until they've got their flow and rhythm. I'll be coming back for sure.
