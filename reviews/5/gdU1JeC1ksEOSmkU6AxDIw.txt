This is a great Mexican restaurant in Cave Creek, alot better than the bigger one in the middle of town.  They have great food and a great staff.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all great.  The outside patio is really nice.  Just had my husbands birthday there with about 60 guests and it was perfect, great food and service!  Bill, the owner is very accomodating and is a pleasure to work with along with his staff.  My fav is the chili rellenos and my husbands is the green pork chili.
