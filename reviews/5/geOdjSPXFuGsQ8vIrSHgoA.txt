This place is great, it always has been!!!

I am going to start with service, It could not have been any better for the environment, fast friendly, accommodating, and just kind. Not gushy or desperate, just all around good especially from the cashier, who might be the manager or owner, and the guy with the FREE CHIPS and Salsa. "if you would like more of either, just let me know" Wow that alone makes me want to come back.

My lunch was exceptional, with 2 big stuffed shredded beef tacos with rice and beans with a Pepsi for less then 10 bucks. The tacos were as good as I remember and the rice and beans were just the right size, along with some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes. 

The place itself was welcoming for me because every detail in the lobby was perfect from beer cooler to counters, the floors were spotless and the beverage station was well stocked and gleaming.

If you are wondering if this should be on your list, I say YES. its casual and you order at the counter but there is beer and Margaritas so enjoy a little casual done right!
