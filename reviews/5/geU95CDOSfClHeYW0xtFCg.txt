Have been going to this restaurant since I was in a high chair, seriously! We don't go back because it's where we've always gone, but because of the good food and great service. Their chorizo with beans and rice is very good, and so is their horchata. My dad gets the shrimp tostadas and menudo and enjoys is every time. Price for all the food you get is not bad at all. If you're in the downtown area and really want some good Mexican food, this is the place to go.
