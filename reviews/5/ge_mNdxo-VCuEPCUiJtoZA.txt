Great place to watch an Iowa game if you are in the Phoenix area and the atmosphere is a huge reason.  The uber hot waitstaff is another.  U of Iowa fans get drunk and rowdy.  Since game times are at 9, people arrive early and get breakfast.  Lots of HDTVs, all tuned to the Iowa game.  There is a huge and loyal Iowa following in the Scottsdale area, so seats fill up quick.  Drinks are pricy, but the hotness of the waitresses tend to distract from the bill.  It is HIGHLY recommended to attend the Iowa vs Iowa State football games at the Sandbar.  It is INSANITY. 


Looking for more Iowa Natives to review this bar, though.
