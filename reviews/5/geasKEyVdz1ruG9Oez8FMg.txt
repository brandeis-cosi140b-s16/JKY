We were at the park across the street and felt like Mexican so we went in for a quick lunch with our 2 little kids. What a pleasant surprise. Salsa and guac were great, lunch specials were tasty and priced very well and the atmosphere was fun. Our food was fresh vs the often heavy-cheesy Mexican restaurants out there. Definitely recommend.
