I live in the area of this restaurant, and we decided to go for happy hour on Tuesday. I had low expectations for this place. I was impressed they had Modelo on tap for $2, which is a major plus! The chips, salsa, beans, and hot salsa were excellent with free refills on the chips and salsa. $1 tacos on Tuesday! I was expecting a small crappy taco, I was wrong! This taco was awesome, and you cannot beat the price!! I found my new Taco Tuesday place!!
