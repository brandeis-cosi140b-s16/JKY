The best street style tacos I have ever had. Holy crap was this delicious! Very very busy, be careful what line you get in as they sometimes only let you order what's on the sign. 

We had taco de lengue and al pastor. (spit roasted on a rotisserie with whole pineapple in the center with the pork cuts cooking around it. 

Wanted to try more but it was late and they were crowded plus I was stuffed! Unless you are headed to Tijuana you won't get it this good or fresh anywhere. Don't miss this!
