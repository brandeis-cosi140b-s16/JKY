There's nothing better than street tacos from a sketchy part of town. The carne asada is amazing and the birria tacos are fantastic. Fantastic! Warm corn tortillas, juicy meat, seasoned to your salsa preference. The salsa bar is slim but don't be deceived because it's absolutely delicious.Sooooo good! The chips are great and the charros are hands-down the best. These beans actually stand on their own they are so good. I think the secret is in the broth. But this isn't soup; its a hearty bean dish and its delicious. I didn't try the sushi but I have to admit I'm intrigued. But oh! The tacos!! Man I miss this place.
