Thank you to the taco gods!  I have lived here for 3 years and have not been able to find a simple, delicious taco.  Your eye does not immediately go to this building.  It shares a parking lot with Woodman's.  

Take a chance and go there.  Wow.  I got three steak tacos with lettuce, cheese and cilantro.  Simply delicious.  They have daily lunch specials, tamales on the weekend and a bakery.  When you walk in the smell of the breads and pastries are intoxicating.  

I can not believe that I have been driving past this place for so long.  The steak was not fatty and the toppings were generous.  I appreciated the double layer of the corn tortillas, it is the only way to go.  

The pastries are good.  I am from Chicago and I have been homesick for a taco.  I sighed when I ate this taco.  It was amazing.
