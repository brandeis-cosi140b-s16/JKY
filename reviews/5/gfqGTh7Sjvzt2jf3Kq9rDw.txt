My fianc√© and I first saw this place on Groupon & it happened to be close to us do we tried it out. Basically-this is now one of our fave local Mexican food spots! The servers are always so sweet and the food is great-reminds us of home made. The place has a cute bar, great margaritas, and awesome salsa. Food is always consistent-I highly recommend trying this spot out.
