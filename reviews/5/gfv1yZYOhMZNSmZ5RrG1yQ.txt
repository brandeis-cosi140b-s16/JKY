Love, love, love Gran Agave!  By far the best Mexican food in Pittsburgh, and on par/above lots of Mexican food I've had down South.  I've tried nearly everything on their menu, and have loved it all.  In particular, the carnitas,  tacos and quesadillas are delicious.  Their food always tastes fresh, and it's not too greasy or smothered in cheap cheese.  At the bar they have a serious variety of tequilas, as well as beers; and the owner makes his own margarita mix, so no yucky neon green bottles of mix here.  For me, though, I go with a paloma every time. 
The one thing I would change is having to pay for the second batch of chips and dip, but I guess I can't always get what I want ;)
