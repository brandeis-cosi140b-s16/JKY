Yummmmy!!!!!!!!!

This place is amazing!!! Real authentic drive thru mexican food!!! Omg! the best.

I was a little sad at first cause their menu showed no vegetarian option so I asked for a specific burrito without meat, the worker then told me they do in fact have a delicious vegetarian burrito.  My suggestion to them would be to put it on the menu. 

Other then that this place is my go to fast mexican food.
