The more I go to Q doba, the more I like it!  I lose weight eating GREAT food there like the naked taco salad, and naked burrito on their 2 for 6.19 value menu!  The steak is so good, and unlike Chipotle, the don't piss and moan when I want to substitute something.  The workers there always give me the service I deserve as a customer.  Giving the trouble Chipotle had with hiring illegals in Minnesota, I  feel  much better eating at Q-doba!    I get what I want, they way I want it, quick!  Love this place!
