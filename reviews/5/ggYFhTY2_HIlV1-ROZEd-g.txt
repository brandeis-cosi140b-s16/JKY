I used to run a Mexican restaurant so although I'm not Mexican, I know my Mexican food. And, this place was great. It was authentic, all handmade in house, with friendly service and great prices. There seems to be a lot of Mexican joints on this stretch of Tropicana, and this one was the busiest as far as we can tell - a very good sign.

We've been in twice and both times were great experiences. We haven't tried everything so we'll definitely be back again.
