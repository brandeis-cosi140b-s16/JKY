I have a habit of finding a food location, eating everything on the menu everyday for over a month, then getting sick of it all, and that is yet to happen here! First off I love fish, and fish is their speciality, so the relationship is now mutual. Getting a delicious Ono Burrito after a hard workout at the gym is a great pick me up. They have your typical steak and chicken burrito options if your not in the mood for fish, and these are also great. There is alway some new flavor on the menu to try. There food items are not swimming in grease so you wont feel like you swallowed a lead ball when your finished chowing down. If its your first time I recommend the Blackened Ono Burrito. If you want some shrimp, give the Mesquite shrimp burrito a go. This location is next to Whole foods on lake mead off the 95 exit.

Oh, comes stocked with a salsa bar as well. Grab a churro and enjoy!
