Yumilicious.  What a fun night.  Went with my dinner club friends to Distrito tonight and had a bite from just about everything on their restaurant week $30 per person menu. Wow.  Great food.  My favorites were the grilled squid salad (warm and so tasty), the mahi mahi tacos, and the plantain with black bean side dish.  Everything was superb.  We had a party of 11 sharing food, and no one disliked a thing.  The bartender and drinks were amazing too.  The margaritas - delish.  The design scheme  has clean lines, fun & beautiful colors, and a quirky vibe.  The staff was so friendly too...so helpful and provided excellent service.  I.love their "Hencho en Mexico" t-shirt with jeans uniform.  Highly recommended from our group of 11!
