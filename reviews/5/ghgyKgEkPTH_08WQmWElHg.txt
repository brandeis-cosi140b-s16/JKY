months later after first going here still love this place anyone that comes to town its a must to take them there its like ok you're in vegas yea lets go to the strip and then frijoles! lol every single person I have taken loves it! My cousin from Canada knew about the place and asked me to take him there before I could even make the suggestion. Needless to say this is my favorite place to eat I'm so sad that I will be moving back to California! PLEASE COME TO CALIFORNIA FRIJOLES!!!
