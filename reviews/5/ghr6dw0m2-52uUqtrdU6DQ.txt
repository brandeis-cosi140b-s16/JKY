after moving away from san diego, i always miss tacos el gordo for their amazing sopes. i do not care for the tacos or whatever else they seem to make. it is their SOPES people. all my friends order sopes too, cuz they know what's up! its awesome to know vegas has two locations now!

get their carne asada sopes.

i repeat, CARNE ASADA SOPES!!!!!!!!!!!!

if u dont love it, meals on me. :)
