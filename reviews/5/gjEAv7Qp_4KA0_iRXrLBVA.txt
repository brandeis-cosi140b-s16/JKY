Great food. I passed by this restaurant Monday night and saw the sign outside for Caldo De Res. The next day my husband and I decided to stop in for some caldo since it was chilly out unfortunately the caldo de res is only served Monday and Thursday but the caldo de pollo was great! we will be going back tomorrow for caldo de res! my husband had the albondigas de camaron it was a little spicy for me but it was all amazing! i cant wait to go back!
