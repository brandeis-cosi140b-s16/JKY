This place is amazing place to go eat. . The portions are huge especially the burritos. I tired the fusion burrito with meat in it  its good . The other highlight of the meal is the complimentary guacamole with the chips . The price for the food is good. they even offer Stevia to sweeten the iced tea. I thought  it was great. Overall this is a must go to restaurant everything is so good you wont regret it.
