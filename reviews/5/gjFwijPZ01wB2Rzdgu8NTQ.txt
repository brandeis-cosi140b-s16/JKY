I like their food especially the enchiladas. I got an order for a friend on Mother's Day and she loved it. The restaurant is very clean and the service is excellent. Oh, and the price is inexpensive and they have great salsa, and other garnishes that are a nice (free) addition to any meal. We're always happy when we chow down here.
