I somehow missed the fact that this place is next to a gentleman's club when I was researching on Yelp! No worries though... it has a different entrance from the club. They start you off with free chips and salsa. Great street tacos (you can mix and match, just ask) served with choice of beans and cilantro rice! I checked in and got a free flan which was smooth and delicious as well. Paco, the chef/owner came out at the end of our meal and thanked us for our business which was delightful. All the employees were friendly and didn't notice any questionable patrons (on a Thursday afternoon).
