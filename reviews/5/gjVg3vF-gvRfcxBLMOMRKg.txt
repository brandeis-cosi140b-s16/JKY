I can't comment on the variety of the menu here because I've only ordered the same thing each time I go...and I dream about it. The veggie fusion chimichanga with kim chee is amazing! I forget how big it is until it arrives. There's enough to make two full lunches. Free chips, salsa and guac as well. They close out the meal with orange segments and fortune cookies. Worth the wait if there's a line.
