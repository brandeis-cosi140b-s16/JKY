Although it may be a chain it is always delicious and the employees are always friendly. I come here often and the burritos are consistently good and the staff is always friendly. Although there may be a line and you may have trouble finding parking it is for a good reason, it's delicious! PLUS, many of their meats are organic and they support family owned/operated farms which is great.
