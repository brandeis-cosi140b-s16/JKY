Never write reviews but had to for this place. Anything next to a strip club, especially food, should be considered suspect... Being that I'm more into food than Strip Clubs and the great reviews we decided to try it out. Cool vibe and Amazing food! Chris (Native/Mexican/Merican/Angeleno/witness protection program) server was awesome! Iv been in Vegas 25yrs and on of the best Mexican places around!! Come check it out!!
