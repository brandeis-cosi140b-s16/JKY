Looked up a place to stop on our road trip and found this place on yelp. Excellent food, excellent service, best meal we have had in the Las Vegas area in many many years. They seemed so happy to see us and the place is in the corner of a strip mall so it would be easy to miss; but this is a diamond that is worth finding. We will be back! You should definitely go here; it is not your normal place.
