If possible, ask to sit in Jenn's section. She is basically awesome. Courteous, patient, prompt, and personable. We've sat in her section before, and she never disappoints.

As for the food... SO good. I honestly would go just to eat chips, vats full of salsa, and cheese crisps. But the fajitas are good, and so are the burritos.
