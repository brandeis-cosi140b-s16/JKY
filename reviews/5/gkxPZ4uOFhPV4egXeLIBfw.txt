This restaurant has great authentic dishes. Be sure to bring your appetite. The Tortas are packed tall with meat, veggies and cheese. The enchiladas are to die for. Even as I am writing this quick blog, my mouth is watering and my stomach is growling. Seriously....You should make a trip to this unique Mexican restaurant. The food is great and the order & pick-up-at-the-counter style means that you don't have to leave a tip. You can also ask for a frequent Torta card to get credit and earn a free Torta after a few visits. They have offer happy hour and flat screen televisions to watch the "big" game. It's close to Jobbing.com arena and University of Phoenix stadium. It's worth the trip and I bet you will be back. I will probably see you there!
