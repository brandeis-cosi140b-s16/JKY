Finally! We have a chipotle in the East side. I love chipotle, but this one tops many that I have been to. On all the occasions I've been here they have never been stingy with their portions. I always ask for extra hot sauce and corn and they truly do give me extra. Restaurant is always clean and workers work at a fast paste. I would definitely come back.
