I eat here frequently, often with large orders for the office which we submit online. When I walk in, even at their busy times the staff is friendly and often greets me by name. Teresa is always happy, friendly and takes time to make sure our orders are correct. They will even call to make sure you are satisfied with your order if it's placed online.

I have been to this location both take out and dine in and it has always been a wonderful experience. The food is very good and even for those on diets or with restrictions there are plenty of options. The service is friendly and fast and the location always looks well maintained and clean.
