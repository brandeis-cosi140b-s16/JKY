I honestly had a terrible,  long day. I came here for some dinner. Karen helped me. And I have to talk her up. It is not often you have an actual friendly person help you, especially with food places. Karen was so nice and friendly and accommodating. It was very appreciated! Its late at night and I can see they probably close soon and she was still a sweetheart. So was the blonde girl (didnt catch her name.) Seriously thank you for  being so awesome and not a crab ass like most people are in customer service these days!
