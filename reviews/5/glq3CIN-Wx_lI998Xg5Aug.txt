I found this place during my lunch break. I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The booths are comfy and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I feels authentic and the waiter was funny and attentive. The food came out fast. I ordered the beef machaca and it took up half of the large plate. The beef was savory and tender, the tortilla was fresh and the toppings were mouth watering. Price wise they are very reasonable. Wonderful place to eat!
