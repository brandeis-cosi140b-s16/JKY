When I moved to Charlotte from Ohio four years ago I PRAYED for the day they'd open a Chipotle down here! It pains me to admit it, but before there were any in Charlotte I did drive to the one by Hanes Mall in Greensboro to get my fix. Yikes, I know, right?

Aside from the food being great (uhh, obviously if I'm willing to drive 2 hours for it!) everyone at this location is super friendly. I had only been in there two or three times for lunch when the staff recognized me as a familiar face. They're very accommodating, and in stark contrast to the employees at several other 'quick' restaurants, they seem genuinely happy to be making you great food, and to be working together.

I've since turned several friends and co-workers on to this location as it's convenient and quick for many of us during the work week lunch hour. 

As with any Chipotle location, if you need to get in and out quickly you can call or fax your order in so it's ready when you arrive. Or if you're feeling *really* fancy you can order AND PAY using their online order tool or their iPhone app and just grab your food and run! At first I worried about the accuracy of this method, but not once have they messed up my order or had me wait for it when I got there. 

**My favorite from this restaurant: Steak burrito with black beans, corn salsa, sour cream and cheese with a  side of chips and guacamole THEIR GUACAMOLE IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! (but does cost $1.80 extra on your burrito...but is so worth it!)
