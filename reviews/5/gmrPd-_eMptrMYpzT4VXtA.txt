I'm so glad to see this 'place' on yelp!  It's a hidden gem you can only get on the weekend evenings.  It's conveniently directly across from the LightRail stop @ Camelback and 7th Ave.  

It's basic menu makes it easy to choose something good after many hours of drinking.  Especially if you aren't sure if you intentionally or inadvertently ended up inside Charlie's and line danced with gay men in cowboy hats all night.

Also I love their Horchata (Cinnamon Rice Milk) - it's especially wonderful on a hot Arizona night.
