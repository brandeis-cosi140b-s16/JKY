OMG.. The last two nights, I got off work extremely late with no lunch breaks. So of course, I am starving...The first night I go to McDonalds that is right down the street from my house (bad service to begin with)...comes to find out as I was walking in thru the gas station part that they were closed due to upgrades on their computer softwares. DANG IT. So I drive down the road to Taco Bell (also bad service).. DANG IT DANG IT... I had to drive even further which was Carl's Jr. As I am going thru the drive thru, the computer comes on and says that they were closed as well. WTF.. All the restaurants by my house are freaking closed and I WAS HUNGRY. Now, I am pissed, hungry, and sleepy....So I made one more attempt and went even further away from the house to Del Taco... YAAAAAAAYYYYY Someone was open. So I ordered the combo #5 which is the two BIG FAT tacos, fries, and a soda. Then I ordered a side order of jalapeno rings. The total came out to a little over $9. Boy was I satisfiied. Then there was last night as well that I was starving once again with no lunch break from work. So I went thru the drive thru again. This time, I ordered two orders of jalapeno rings, a chicken del taco carbon, shredded beef del taco carbon, and the steak del taco carbon. My stomach was full, but I was happy to have a full stomach after long night at work. THANKS DEL TACO for being open 24 hours.
