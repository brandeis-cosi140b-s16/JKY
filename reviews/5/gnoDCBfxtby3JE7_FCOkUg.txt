Heard there was (another) new place in the food court at the PV Mall...turns out there were two.

There is a new Vietnamese place where McDonalds used to be (no Bun and no Cafe Sua Da = no deal), so we decided to try Mucha Lucha Taco Shop.

Ordered the 5 Street Tacos and asked for one of each of your favorite 5 - ended up with Carne Asada, Green Chile, Barbacoa, Red Carnitas and Tinga Chicken.  They were all pretty good (though either the Carne Asada or the Barbacoa (hard to keep them all straight) tasted mostly of salt).  She told me the Tinga chicken would be spicy (it was, but not a lot) and she suggested leaving the hot salsa off of the Green Chile, because it was spicy (it was - pretty hot).

Also got a Jarritos Lime drink - pretty good.

This is probably my favorite food court restaurant at this point, so I bumped them up a star as being 'best in the area'.  :-)

Give 'em a try 

(and best of luck to the new taco joint at the mall!!!  we'll be back!)
