Tonight was an example of why I love Yelp. Husband and I searched for "tacos" and this place came up with glowing reviews from fellow Yelpers. I had passed this restaurant a million times, but had never given it a second thought. 

I had the tlacoyos with eggs - the thick tortillas were supremely satisfying, and the nopalitos were the best I'd ever had. It was a treat to try out Mexican cuisine different from the usual Sonoran fare found so often in Phoenix.
