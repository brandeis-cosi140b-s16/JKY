I had the steamed fish tacos and they were really big.  I had to eat 2/3 of the filling with a fork before I could pick up the tacos.  These were the best fish tacos I have ever eaten.  They have a filling bar so you can top your fish any way you like.  I will be going back.  They offer steamed or fries fish and/or shrimp tacos.  Next time you go to Costco or Walmart, stop in Tortilla Fish for a taco.  You won't regret it!
