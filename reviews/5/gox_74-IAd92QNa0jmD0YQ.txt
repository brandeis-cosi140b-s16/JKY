I absolutely adore Mexicasa.  We've been going there since it opened.  For starters, the salsa is spicy - I abhor going out for Mexican and getting wimpy salsa.  They also offer cheese dip and guacamole on the appetizer menu, and both are worth a try.
I have tried just about everything on this menu, and I have found nothing that I do not like!  The seven layer burrito is my absolute favorite.  I especially like that they will adjust ingredients per your request.  Super service, great people, and really fast take-out service!
