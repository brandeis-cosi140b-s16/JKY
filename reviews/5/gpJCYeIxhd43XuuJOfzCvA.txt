J.B. is an idiot, I have no connection to this restaurant but we had nearly the same meals the food is very good and the margaritas are good and inexpensive. Please don't listen to self absorbed little people that take great offense to the slightest perceived grievance.

We enjoy this restaurant and come often and will continue to.
