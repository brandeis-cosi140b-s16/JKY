On my first visit, the man behind the counter gave me two free veggie tacos to sample!! Score for me. And yes, they were divine.  I'm not sure what kind of veggies were in the taco, but I know that there was cheese and the hot sauce.  After eating the free tacos, I immediately grabbed two more.  

The set up is simple and clean. Obviously the customer service and food are wickedly good.  This is place is so sure of their food they gave me tacos to sample first.  Generosity gets me every time. 

Anyways...I will have to visit this place again to explore more of the menu. I will be back for damn sure.
