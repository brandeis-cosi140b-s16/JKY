Salt foam margarita was very good.  After we ate there, I was dreaming of the dim sum.  I have been eating shu mai and BBQ pork buns my entire life and those were the best I've ever had.  The pork and scallop shu mai are so juicy and flavorful, it's crazy.  They gild the lily with gold leaf on the scallop one.  I think they have a tasting menu to try as well, I cannot wait to go back here.
