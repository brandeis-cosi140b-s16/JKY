i came here for lunch today after checking out from Aria and it was my first time, but it was so good. I wasn't even hungry but still managed to scarf down two tacos. The guy slicing our meat was super friendly and nice... that made me love the place even more. 

I asked my bf to get me foil so i could save my last taco for the car ride home. While I was attempting to wrap it, one of the lady's that worked there came by and helped me, but because I'm dumb I thought the shiny side of the foil was suppose to be covered... apparently I'm wrong! She took my tacos and had the guy wrap it for me. 

that's what i call customer service, and it left me with a smile. i hope they read my review and know that I really appreciate great customer service. I never asked for help but she passed by and just helped me... like so motherly!!

come here, you won't regret it!! the workers all looked so happy and really nice. in LA a lot of taco establishments are kind of nerve wrecking to walk in especially some of the king taco's I've been to.
