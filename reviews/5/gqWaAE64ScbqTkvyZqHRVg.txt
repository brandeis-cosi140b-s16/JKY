I've been going here regularly for the past five or six years.  They've recently changed their name, but the menu and taste remains the same.  Get the Bombero if you want a mouthful of awesomeness.

UPDATE: Salazar got bought out and re-branded a while ago.  The food is now of inconsistent quality.  Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's booty.  I occasionally roll the dice, but times sure have changed.

UPDATE #2: A friend let me know that the official Salazar Bros lives again, this time at 48th St and Baseline.  Back to 5 stars, you go.  Easily the best of the Mexican fast food joints.
