We accidentally found this little gem - and then we mistakenly thought it was just ice cream. SO GLAD WE WENT IN! It's amazing! Burritos are delicious! They make their own tortillas (we took some home). Yummy! They make their own horchata - it was to die for! AND, sit down, they have Thrifty Ice Cream! 
I should also point out that the shop is super clean. 
This will be on the list of regular stops!
