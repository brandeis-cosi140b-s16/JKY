I have been meaning to review Sabor. 

They are not your grandmothers Mexican food, so if you go in expecting some high end del taco you will be disappointed. If you are that kind foodie you are not likely to be on yelp.  

They do a fun twist on chips and salsa that includes bean dip, spices, and plantains. Which led us to believe we were on the right path.  The corn tortillas served were tasty and helped cut some of the very spicy flavor of one of the salsas.  

Personally I have eaten here three times.  The scallops were very inspired and I loved the bed of corn they sat on. The Shrimp Diablo was spicy and tasty and the mint rice was a nice counter balance.  The tropical fish I ordered was okay, the portion was too large and it was not as good as the other two.  

My husband ordered the seafood pasta(I dont remember the name) and raved about it quite a bit.  He is a true convert as he made us drive all the way back because he didnt want to eat at Agave which is near where we live. 

I also had a tamale which had nice texture and really great mole flavor.  

The kids had food and they both liked it and the servers were so nice to the girls.

They also have a dart board and place to kick back, possibly for happy hour specials.
