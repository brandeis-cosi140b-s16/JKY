Best pico de gallo salsa I've ever had. But it is now limited to 4 little containers per take out regardless of how many items you purchased.  And the containers are smaller than before too. :(  

But the food is great, the girls at the counter are usually very friendly, and the food comes out relatively quickly.  

I really like their daily specials, especially the Tuesday taco specials. 

I wish menudo would last into the evening (they could always serve the leftover the next day I would guess).  But it runs out by early/mid afternoon I guess.

One time they gave me the wrong item, but they corrected that on the next visit.

Wish they had free chips to go, but only free chips if you eat in.

They have a very big menu selection.  I have yet to try breakfast though.   Regular prices are a bit high in general but I try to get the specials of the day or splurge now and then.
