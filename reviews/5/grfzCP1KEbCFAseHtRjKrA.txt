My new favorite taco place!! Everything is fresh and yummy. 
Elaina the owner is very nice. 
Very casual.
All the comments about coupons are weird to me, the pricing is totally affordable, not sure how they can go any lower. Tacos are 2.50, sodas are 1.50, come on people, they gotta make some money to stay open. 
Support this taco place and the family who runs it, you won't be disappointed.
