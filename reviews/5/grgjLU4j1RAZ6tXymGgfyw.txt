I travel to Scottsdale frequently  - 3 times a year and each time I go here to eat lunch/dinner. The service is great. The food is so good and the atmosphere is worth the drive it too. 
  It's the perfect place to kill an afternoon drinking alcohol, staring at the pond and eating their chicken. 
   I eat Mexican frequently so for me to rate this place so highly - they had to be good.  If you are on the border about this place - just go- based on the other reviews - you're likely to love it then hate it.
