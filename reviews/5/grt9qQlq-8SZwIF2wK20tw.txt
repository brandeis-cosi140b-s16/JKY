The food was great and the prices are awesome! The girl who took our order and brought the food to our table was very accommodating and checked in regularly to make sure we were ok. This is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter and serve yourselves beverages, so the way she " waited" on our table was above and beyond. The place has a fun, clean vibe. I will def go back again, to game and eat~
