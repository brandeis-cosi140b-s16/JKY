The first time my boyfriend took me here I ordered the steak quesedillas, which I was not very fond of. However, as this is his favorite restaurant, we came back a few weeks later.

I ordered the chicken taquitos. They were delicious. The rice and guacamole that came with them were to die for. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri, served with whip cream. Also very good. 

The service is quick and friendly. Don Carlos is a great server. SUPER friendly & quick. We now come here a few times a month. This restaurant is amazing.
