Great food in a hole in the wall place!!  Don't let the atmosphere deter you.  We are from SLC, Utah and found this place on Yelp. It had four tables, so is small, but well worth it.  They had a Mexican telenovela (soap opera) on TV while we were there but it was quiet.  We had tacos and huevos rancheros with beans and rice; all of the food including salsas were great.  To drink we had the Mexican apple soda, so tasty!  Give it a shot!
