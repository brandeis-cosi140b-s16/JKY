Great and unique beer selection. Staff seemed to be on it. Very friendly and she gave good recommendations. I've been here about 5 times and everything I have had is great. I love that they are open late night. Occasionally they have a DJ and their happy hour is insanely cheap. $3 Mexican beers and $2 tacos. Shut the front door! 

What else do you want people!?!
