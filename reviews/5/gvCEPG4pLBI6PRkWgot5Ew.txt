This place is conveniently open 24 hours a day which is great! So when I'm up late, I can fulfill that late night craving for Mexican food. I love the bean and cheese burritos, carne fries, and rolled tacos. They charge $1 for cheese in your burritos and $1 for sour cream on the side which is a little much... But it won't stop me from coming here. Love the food!
