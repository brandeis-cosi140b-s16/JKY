This is an incredible taco stand, where you can fix it up however you like.  The homemade hot sauce/salsas can get quite hot, so watch out!  They are very flavorfull though.  I think you get bigger tacos, so more bang for your buck than the stand in the strip.  Flavor wise, they are awesome, but a bit different than the ones in the strip. The Oakland location can be a bit of a pain to get to if you are driving due to a lack of parking, but if you are in Oakland, absolutely check this place out.
