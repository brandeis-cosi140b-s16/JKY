Tortilla Factory is one of our favs in Scottsdale. The food is great and they have amazing margaritas.  Most of the seating is out on the patio. They have tons of patio heaters, so you are dining comfortably outside even in January.  The staff is always super friendly. Everyone that works there seems to be really happy.  We took our toddler there on our last visit for an early dinner. She loved all of the action. Check it out if you are looking for tasty Mexican food and drinks!
