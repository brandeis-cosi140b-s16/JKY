Fantastic Mexican food at a truly family run establishment. The staff makes you feel like family, and the food speaks for itself; fresh high quality ingredients, delicious food and generous portions! We had a big group coming in but they took care of each and every one of us, and we got our food quickly and it was sizzling hot. The ambiance of the restaurant is very pleasant both indoor and outdoor. Definitely worth the trip from the strip, and I'll make it back every time in town from now on.
