The food here is simply amazing. When I walked in, i did not know what to expect. But, my friend assured me that this place was the real deal. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were made with perfection. This place is exactly how I like my Mexican food. We sat outside on some benches which had a real cool southwestern feel. (which was wonderful since I am not from the area) Can't wait to try this place again!!
