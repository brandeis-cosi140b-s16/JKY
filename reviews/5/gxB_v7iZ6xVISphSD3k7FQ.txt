Having been here a couple of times, I can see where visiting Cabo Wabo at night could be downright annoying. It caters to the dudebros.

So why five stars?

Breakfast, my friend. It's the most important meal of the day, and Cabo Wabo had a damn good breakfast special. 2 eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast usually sells for $9, but on my last trip it was on special for $4.99. Plus add a $4.99 bottomless mimosa special that lasted until 11, and the most important meal of the day gave me a happy happy buzz.

Consider that finding breakfast under $15 in a sit-down restaurant on the Strip is becoming difficult, this was a great discovery.
