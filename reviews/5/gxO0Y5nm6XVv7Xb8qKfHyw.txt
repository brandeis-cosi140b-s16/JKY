Breakfast burrito or AM crunch wrap, both delicious, truly freshly made and not that expensive for breakfast. 
I don't know about the waffle breakfast taco, it doesn't look very good and I won't try it.
A GREAT idea Taco Bell, but I doubt that the workers there are too happy to be up so early in the morning.
