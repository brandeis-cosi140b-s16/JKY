WOW! Not only is this location nice and fast service but the customer service is AMAZING! There is a lady there named Sabrina that is SOOOO delightful! From the moment she greeted me at the drive through she was so darn pleasant, I couldn't help but to keep a smile on my face the entire time I was ordering my food. When I left there it literally made my day because she was so joyful and happy! Definitely left a great impression on business and this location specifically! :)
