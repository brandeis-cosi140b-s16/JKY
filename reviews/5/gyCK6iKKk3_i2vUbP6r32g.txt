This place gets it! 

The name says it all. What a great way to market themselves I could not think of a better way myself. 
Let's face it if your here it's because at some point you have had a great experience with food  in either Juarez and or El Paso, and you want to recreate that experience.

This place delivers is value taste and customer service. The food is legit, they are fast and friendly the restaurant is clean and inviting. 

You do feel as if for a second you leave Vegas and are eating at your favorite joint in either of these two cities with great culinary staples known to each. 

Great job to whoever brought this much needed concept. The only thing I'm sad about is not coming sooner.
