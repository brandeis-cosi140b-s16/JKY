We absolutely love Los Betos!  We have always been treated well and the food is always hot and fresh!  We have breakfast from here at least once a week and it's also our late night snack place!  The breakfast burritos are big enough for 2 people, and the tacos are always stuffed too!  The tortas are also outta this world!  Never get sick from it like other places either!
