I've never had better service at a mexican restaurant.  The food is great as well.  Don't skip getting the cheese dip.  It is killer.  Our 9 month old boy knocked over my drink as soon as I got it.  The staff was so friendly with getting it cleaned up and making sure our experience was excellent.  I think that this is now my go to mexican restaurant in University Charlotte.
