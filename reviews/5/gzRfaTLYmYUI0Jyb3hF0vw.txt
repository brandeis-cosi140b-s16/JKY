I seriously enjoy shopping here. I cook Mexican-inspired meals a lot at home, and their shop carries some of the most authentic stuff for that purpose. Bonus: even though Reyna's is a specialty shop, they're not over-priced for a specialty shop.

Some highlights: Their tortillas (corn and flour) are made fresh daily in the shop. Bring your kids; they will enjoy watching the tortillas trolley on the conveyor belt. There is a variety of flavors, too. I enjoy the garlic and herb, AND they are only 80 calories!

Also, if you love tortilla chips -- or if you need a large quantity for a party or football game -- get the huge bag of them. You will never go back to Tostitos once you've tried their chips. They are the real deal. And the large bag is a great buy -- you can buy 4 bags of the On The Border Brand at Sam's Club for the same price and still not have as many chips combined as what you get at Reyna's. I got a bag of supermarket chips after having theirs, and the supermarket chips were so bland and tasteless in comparison.

Their salsas and guacamoles are fresh and vanish within hours of opening them. Buy more than you think you need. It will disappear.

I have yet to try the Taco Shack, but am curious to what they entail. I am sure they are worth it, and I know I will wonder why I waited so long to try them.

Also, the family that runs the shop are so nice and friendly! I have gotten in many conversations with them, and they are willing to help in any way they can. And they take pride in the products. That's the most important thing.
