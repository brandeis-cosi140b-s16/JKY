I used to think America's Taco Shop was the best, but I was wrong.  I found Taco heaven here.  I get take out here about once per month.  I've had the chicken street tacos, carne asada burrito.  You can mix and match anything on the menu and they are cool with it.  I've never dined in but it is a very sleek casual design.  The staff is really friendly and it seems like it's a family-run dining room.  And it's super reasonable prices.
