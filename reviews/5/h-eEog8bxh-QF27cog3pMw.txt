I'm not even sure why I'm writing a review since the amazingness of this place is not in question buuuut...

Holy crap.

Bloody Mary's are outstanding.
Guacamole is so tasty.

The fish torta is maybe the best sandwich in the valley. Fresh, amazing flavors.. Even the bread is vibrant and yummy. 

Who's hungry??
