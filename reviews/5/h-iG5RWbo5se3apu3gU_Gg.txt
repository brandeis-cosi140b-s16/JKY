My brother and I love it here! The portions are huge and the sweet pork is to die for! They also have a lot of home made drinks. Their strawberry lemonade is amazing and I couldn't tell it was sugar free. Make sure you are very hungry when you do visit because I mean it when I say the portions are huge. 

I ordered my usual of the sweet pork salad. It has rice, beans (your choice), sweet pork, and your choice of toppings. All in a tortilla bowl! Definitely something to try with extra of their guacamole ranch sauce.
