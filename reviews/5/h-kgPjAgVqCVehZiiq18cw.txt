My son had been telling me about this place, so I finally went with him.  He ordered for me:  Carne en su Jugo.  WOW!  It is amazingly delicious.  I wish I knew the secret to the broth.  It is absolutely wonderful.  Reading the other reviews wants me to go back and try other items on the menu.  I've already told several other people that it is a MUST VISIT place to eat.  I'll most definitely be going back - even though it will be a 25+ mile trip.
