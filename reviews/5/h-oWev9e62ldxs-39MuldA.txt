I'm from California where there is a Mexican food joint on every corner and when I first moved to Phoenix a year ago I've been on the hunt for a legit Mexican food place, not a Filiberto's or Macaios :P. Living in Ahwatukee, the only legit places I was able to find up until a month ago was in central/downtown Phoenix (Rosito's and La Canasta). As much as I love those two places, the drive sucks! After all this is Phoenix, there has to be a good place right by me!

Finally, I was advised to go to Los Taquitos from a friend of mine saying they have BOMB carne asada so I had to go see for myself as Elliot Rd is down the street from me (YES!). When I entered this place, it felt like home as it reminded me of one of my favorite places I used to go to back in Cali. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome! I personally like the green over the the red but they're both good! You can choose a la carte or a meal plate and they have a breakfast menu to boot! Now was the carne asada BOMB? YES! The carne asada was to die for, it was juicy and cooked just right. The tacos are small-ish but hit the right spot without putting you in a food coma afterwards. I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed. The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size, again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys! Oh and I forgot to add that the tacos are CHEAP, $1.15 a piece. If you want a 3 tacos plate, its 6 bucks, comes with rice and beans. So for the south phoenix/ahwatukee/chandler peeps, I recommend this place, its delicious, cheap, and clean as well!
