Favorite place in Ahwatukee for Happy Hour.  $5.00 appetizers and $1.00 off chambord margaritas.  But only have 2, they are strong.  And the pulled pork nachos are out of this world.  It is very hard to eat that appetizer by yourself, unless you are me.  Give it a try.  Keegan is a great bartender also.
