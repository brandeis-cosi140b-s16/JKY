Delicious tacos. We found this place on yelp when we were visiting Vegas and it did not disappoint. Friendly, personable owner and unbelievably good food. I had the carne Asada taco with guac, sour cream and cheese, it was my favorite authentic taco I have ever eaten. Seasoned to perfection. My husband and son had the Jr. burritos with carne asada and my daughter a delicious generous size quesadilla. We we're all impressed. The side of rice and beans was 2.00 and so good. Reasonable price for families. Don't miss this place if your in Vegas! For Real!!!
