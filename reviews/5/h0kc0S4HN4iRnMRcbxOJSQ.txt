Out of all of the 'bertos and 'andos in the valley, Rolando's is easily my favorite. It is exactly what you expect from the cheap, greasy Mexican joint down the street. The food is fast, hot, cheap, delicious and horrible for you. 

The building leaves something to be desired, they don't take anything but cash and the bathrooms....wow, but the food more than makes up for it. In particular I recommend the Super Nachos or the Potatoes Bacon Egg & Cheese burrito, both doused in red sauce. Unfortunately they close at midnight now, but I've left the bar early just to get here. It's that good.
