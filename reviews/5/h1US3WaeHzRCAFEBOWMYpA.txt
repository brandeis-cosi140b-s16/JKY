The place is very small but it's staffed with very energetic people. They have a massive list of tamales that can be pre-ordered(highly recommended) or take your chances with ordering what their making when you arrive. We arrived at 3pm on the Monday before X-Mas and there were 20+people waiting for tamales. We finally got a chance to order and we were lucky enough to get a half dozen of red pork and half dozen green chicken. They were fresh out of the steamer. They are big and fresh and delicious! If you love tamales, I would highly recommend this place!
