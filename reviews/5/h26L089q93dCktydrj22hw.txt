The food is beyond amazing and the service is great too. Constant refills and genuinely nice. My boyfriend and I come here all the time. One of my favorites. Spinach enchiladas are to die for. It's also nice that Don's isn't a chain restaurant so you know you're getting perfectly hand crafted, authentic Mexican food.
