Wow. Everything tasted incredible. The waitress was a sweetheart, I didn't get her name but I remember she mentioned she was 17 but far more mature for her age. She was very attentive and offered great suggestions. 

The chicken nachos were delicious, possibly the best I've ever had. A bold statement, but my boyfriend agreed. We split the sampler dish and loved it all. Generous portions, we both left stuffed and took home the remaining food. I highly recommend and I'm already looking forward to returning soon!
