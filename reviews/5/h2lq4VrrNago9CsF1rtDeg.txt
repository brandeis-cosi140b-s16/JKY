I've known about this place for sometime and finally went.

Went to the Charleston location and made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday afternoon. The wait was over an hour, and we had to make friends with people that were already eating to secure a table for when we got our food. BUT it was well worth it! 

Here's what we got:
Carne Asada tacos-average. I think they only had it on the menu to offer something familiar to the people that usually go to robertos
Lengua (tongue) tacos-very tender and beefy flavor
Tripa (intestine) tacos-fried and crunchy, a little greasy, tasted like pork rinds. Good, but are probably better after a night of drinking
Adobada (marinated pork) tacos- delicious. The green sauce on it made it so much better
Adobada quesadillas- same as the tacos but with melted cheese. Good, but I could have done without
Suadero (beef) tacos- by far my favorite. Whatever they marinade/season/cook it in is amazing

There are 3 lines and each one only makes specific items. One strictly for adobada and the other 2 have a mixture. You order/pick up your food at the window cafeteria style and take it to the left to pay and get drinks. The employees hustle. They definitely have a rhythm about what they do. We spent quite a bit, but as you can tell,'we tried a lot. If you go in knowing what you want, it's pretty reasonable. 

While in line, we talked to a few people that were out of towners. Surprising to see how many there were since this place is nowhere near the strip. The new location is even further.

Overall, great experience and will definitely be back time and time again
