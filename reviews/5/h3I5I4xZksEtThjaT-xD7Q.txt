I could eat chipotle every single day. They always do a great job on the food. The people are always nice. Even if they are not smiling from ear to ear when it's packed they are still polite and I can tell they're trying their best to handle the rush. I work in retail so I can understand that. They are clean and fast. The only bad thing is that sometimes they are stingy on the portions. I think they are required to only give a certain portion. But that's no problem because you can always ask for extra for no charge except on the meat and guac of course.
