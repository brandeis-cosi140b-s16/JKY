Gordas Baja Taco is simply sensational. Do yourself a favor by keeping things simple and picking out a few tacos to try. That's what I did when I moved into the area and I've been coming back ever since, sometimes multiple visits a week, don't judge me please.  

The tacos remind me of the best tacos available anywhere, the ones you can only get on the streets of TJ. Barring a lengthy drive to get those, you should check these out. All of the old standby favorites are there but my highest rated are the adobada, carnitas, and the asada. They recently added some seafood options as well but I haven't had enough time to adequately try them all so I can't review those. 

The other great thing about this place is that they have a salsa bar (green, red, and hot) so you can fix'em up however you like. I'm pretty sure it is family owned and operated and everyone who works there is extremely nice. If you are anywhere on the west side it is worth stopping by here to try. I've even driven here from Tempe on my lunch break, that's how good these tacos are. 

I'm torn because I want them to get more business but I also don't want to wait in long lines if more people figure out this place exists....
