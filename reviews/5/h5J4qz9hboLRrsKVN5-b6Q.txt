I don't usually write reviews but this place deserves one big time!! The beach house burger is quite possibly the best burger I have ever had. The prices were unbelievable and the staff were seriously the best in the business. This place is a BIG WIN. We will definitely be back and we will highly recommend it to all of our family and friends.
