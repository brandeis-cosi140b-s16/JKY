Best dining experience in a long time! Brought some out of town work peeps to Barrio Queen. First, our server (sorry didn't get her name- woman with cool faux hawk style hair and a great accent, she was training someone too) she was amazing! Eloquently described the menu and how different dishes are prepared, gave us a sample of the aqua Fresca which was to die for! The food was delicious, so flavorful. Table side guac was so good- wasn't sure if I'd like the pomegranate seed in there but the flavor all worked so well together. Great night, amazing service, thank you, thank you!!
