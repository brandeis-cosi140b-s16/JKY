This is my go to favorite restaurant in Vegas for every day eating. They can make vegetarian or full of delicious meats. They can be gluten free, healthy or add a home made chocolate brownie. They can make your meal super spicy, garlic or mild. This is the place to take the fussy eater or go to lunch with the full team.

The staff is friendly, the space is always super clean and the price is great! I highly recommend Zaba's!
