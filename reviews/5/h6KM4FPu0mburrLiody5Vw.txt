It's just plain good! The staff was ultra friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was fresh. If the service was any faster, I swear someone read my mind when I walked through the door. I enjoyed my carne asada burrito so much, I went back and ordered two carne asada tacos. Everything was delicious. I'm not setting foot in Phoenix and missing an opportunity to grub here again.
