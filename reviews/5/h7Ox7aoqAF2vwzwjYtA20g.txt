We've gone here several times for lunch and have ordered takeout as well. (We went to the original location in Henderson many times before this one, though; so imagine my excitement when there was one closer to home!) I must've forgotten to do a review on this place. This is one of my favorite places to get nachos, my favorite pig-out food. (I have a restricted diet monday through friday.) 

My favorite place to get nachos used to be Mickie Finnz but honestly, there is no other place to get nachos anymore. Out of the fifteen nacho types, we've tried about eight of them! Our favorite is "Nacho Average Burger Nacho."

Doesn't look very big from the outside, but when you get inside, the bar is on the left side (probably bigger than the dining area), and the sit-down dining area is on the right side. The bathrooms are at the very back, right side. The counter (where to go for your takeout order) is to the right, front side, of the restaurant. Every server we've had has been very nice.  
Not much parking, but a couple spaces in front, if you're lucky, for the takeout order.
