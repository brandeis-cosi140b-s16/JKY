I sometimes get stuck on ordering one or two things I know I love... Today at AZ Kitchen I decided to try something new: Baja Chimichanga. OMG it was excellent! The chicken was packed in and the flavor was wonderful! Cheap lunch prices, perfect chips and salsa and excellent hometown service.  So looking forward to my next visit.
