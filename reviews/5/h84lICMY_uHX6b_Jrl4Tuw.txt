The wait staff was super friendly and made sure we had an enjoyable dinner experience. There was even nice entertainment with a female singer. The guacamole is amazing, tasted natural and fresh. The rest of the food followed suit with great, fresh flavor. The serving sizes were just right as well. Will definitely be going again.
