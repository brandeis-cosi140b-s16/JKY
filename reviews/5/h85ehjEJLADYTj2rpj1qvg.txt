I love this place!  I first expereinced Super Burrito at an office party.  I ordered the pork tacos and was blown away by the freshness and tastiness of the taco.

Needless to say since that office party I have been to the Henderson establishment at least once a week.  I usually get the carne-asada quesadilla, taco and enchllata.   A friend of mine recommended that I try Roberto's  taco show and boy was I disappointed.  I could not, for the life of me, understand how anyone could eat there if there is an option like Super Burrito.

If you like fast & more importantly FRESH Mexican, this is your spot.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that they do not use refried beans.   They use pinto (i think?) .  I can not allow that to affect my ratings, since that is a personal preference.
