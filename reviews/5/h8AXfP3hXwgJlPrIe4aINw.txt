Every time we go to the Phoenix/Scottsdale area we make it a point to stop in. They offer two types of delicious salsa - one that is a basic salsa and a second that is more like a pico de gallo - this makes both my husband and I happy! I always get the chicken tacos and they are to die for, and my husband rotates between the tacos and the chimichanga both of which he loves. The service is great, and we always feel like we are stopping in to see family when we are here. It is kid friendly, which is a major plus.
