I love Barrio Cafe. Everything about it: the tiny wooden tequila bar in the front of the restaurant, their spotless interior with thick cloth napkins, that they bring out a spicy olive tapenade with sliced baguette in lieu of salsa and chips, their phenomenal brunch which at times is accompanied with live flamenco style guitarists, the cholo-esque mural on the outside of the building, the lucha libre artwork inside, and the playful and creative dishes chef Silvana offers up that cannot fail to please even the most finicky of palates. If I was forced to think of a downside to Barrio, I would suppose it'd be the parking situation, it being sparse at best. Barrio Cafe is a Phoenix staple.
