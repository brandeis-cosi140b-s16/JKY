I came to this Chipotle prepared for regular Chipotle fare (which is already pretty awesome), but instead it was even better!

Ambiance: This is one of the newer/cleaner locations I have been to, and it is also sufficiently spacy. Well done, Chipotle.

Service: Although there was a line the workers did not rush, nor did they skimp me on the ingredients.  I've been to many Chipotles where they hastily scoop small amounts of each topping to push you down the line. Not here! I got great service with generous scoops.

Food: Just as good as always and better, RED FAJITA PEPPERS (they were in season) !  I'm not sure if it's a southern US kind of thing as they still only serve green peppers at my Nor Cal locations but awww yisssss mothaF'in  red pepper.  Added whole new dimension to my burrito bowl.

Overall, very pleasantly surprised with this location and wish I could come back more often.
