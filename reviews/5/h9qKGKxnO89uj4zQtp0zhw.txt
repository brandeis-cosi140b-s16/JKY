After a long stretch of poor food and worse service, Tubb's is finally back in the hands of capable staff. There's a wide variety of tacos to try, and I've enjoyed all those I've had (El Pastor and Backyard BBQ are my favorites). I don't know if it's authentic Tex-Mex or Austin-style, and I don't really care. There isn't anyone else in town doing what they do, so this is my go-to for tacos.
