Good food. Similarities to chipotle. Recommended eating here all the food is freshly made too. I don't  recommend the zalepenos . No flavor and it's like a potatoes smashed in side a fritter rolled in a ball deep fried . I like that they have taquitos tacos and burritos. I like the shrimp and the nachos with homemade cheese sauce . They also have healthy ingredients too.
