This place is mine and my husbands breakfast spot.  Nice charming and delicious food.  I always order their combo meals and my husband loves the green chili.  Get on their text group and get daily specials sent to your phone.

Their Mexican sweet bread is like eating the fluffy clouds of heaven....an out of body experience.  Enjoy the ride folks!!
