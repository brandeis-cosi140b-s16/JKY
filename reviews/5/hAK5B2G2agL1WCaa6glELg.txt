The best Mexican food anywhere!!!!

Start off with a trio of salsas and chili bean dip with fresh chips...We have had several entrees and they are all good. Chorizo fundito and shrimp Monterey are off the hook. Mango margi yum like a drink and desert in one, worth every penny! Service was excellent and friendly!
