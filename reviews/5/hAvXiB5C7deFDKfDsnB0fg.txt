Went to Mexx32 this weekend with my friend who loved Revo Burrito! I haven't been here since it has been renovated and what a great new feel! I love how chips and salsa is FREE and their salsas are very fresh! Our server's name was Patrick and he was GREAT!! If you go there, make sure you sit in his section! We will be back for sure!
