COME HERE!!!!  First found about this restaurant on yelp looking for a hangover cure so decided to try it out with some of my friends visiting from Cali and boy is it the best Mexican Food I've ever had!! and its real authentic Mexican food. I even recommended this place to my parents that came for a Vegas trip a couple days later and they ate there everyday. The service is amazing and food is sure to more than satisfy your taste buds and that hangover. Mariscos Playa Escondida is the place to go!
