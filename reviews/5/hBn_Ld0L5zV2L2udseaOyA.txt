The place is the bomb for authentic Mexican food. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, the place itself was like the size of a person's living room, giving the restauranteur a homier feeling. A word of advice: make reservations since they have limited seating. The NoWait app is a great way to make your reservations. My favorite dish to get at Mexican restaurants are flautas and the ones from La Palapa do not disappoint. Their portion size is huge and I ended up having a lot left over. Whenever I crave for Mexican food, I always think of La Palapa and can't wait until I go back!
