Just had dinner at mercadito at red rock casino. Never experienced this type is tapas style dining! Was pleasantly surprised! Food was excellent and brought out in a timely manner, we had some modifications to our order and everything came out correctly as we specified! I cannot say enough about our server, Bryan, who was attentive to our questions and our requests along with explaining everything in detail! I was so impressed with his knowledge of everything we asked about on the menu! It was our first time at Mercadito and we would travel the distance from Green Valley again just to experience the culinary expertise and well as  Bryan's excellent service and friendliness!
