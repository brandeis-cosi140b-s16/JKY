Since having a daughter with celiac disease, we are always on the lookout for gluten-free friendly places. All their GF items are marked on the menu, even their tortilla chips are gluten-free, where many restaurants contaminate the chips by frying them in the same fryer used on breaded items. 

Everything we have had here so far was excellent. Baja and carnitas tacos rank as my favs. I also think their tortilla soup is outstanding. I don't do a lot of mixed drinks, but my wife loves the blood-orange margarita. I tasted it. Good and strong. The atmosphere is nice, staff is on their game and bathrooms were clean. 

Once it gets cooler, this place will be even better. They can open large doors to two separate patios. Maybe even bring in some talented, live local music, like Vinyl Station.
