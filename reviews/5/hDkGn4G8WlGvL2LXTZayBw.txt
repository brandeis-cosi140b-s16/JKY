I was checking out this Art district and there was live music with several studios in the area, I went over to the "Of The Earth Cafe" and out front there was a taco stand with the owner Shane grilling up street tacos.  I had both the beef and chicken and I have to say they were both great.  The chicken had a great seasoned flavor and he even made his own homemade green chili hot sauce that tasted so fresh and flavorful.  I heard that this area gets hopping ever first Friday but I decided to stop by after the Suns game and check it out last night.  Also ask about the sweet potato taco desert they have!
