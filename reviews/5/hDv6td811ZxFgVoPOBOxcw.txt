Hands down the best tacos I've ever had!!! The "rajas con creme" and "veggie" are my favorite! The house margarita or red beer are the perfect compliment to these entrees. The service was amazing! The bartender even remembered me from a previous visit! Everyone was friendly and knowledgable of the menu and specialty drinks. The manager "Chuy" checked on me to make sure I was happy. The restaurant was clean and the seating very comfortable. They also offer outdoor seating under a covered patio. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family!
