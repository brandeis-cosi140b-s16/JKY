It was less than 15 minutes to close when i pulled into the drive.  The woman who helped me was so nice, more than good customer service nice, i could tell she was a really nice lady. I read about the fruit juices on yelp and needed to try them, but couldn't decide which one. she asked if i wanted a sample. i was expecting a little dixie cup of juice, so i ordered a bean and cheese burrito, came with chips and salsa and watermelon juice, with a sample of the pineapple juice.  

When my order came I was so surprised at the gargantuan bean burrito, bag of crispy, salty tortilla chips, watermelon AND pineapple juice, no dixie cup in sight. My friend had a horchata, so we were able to sample three of their juices and they were all very good. 

The burrito's tortilla was flakey and chewy and perfect, a very generous portion for only $3.00. Really fresh ingredients and excellent quality.

The horchata has a different but very good texture, it feels almost powdery but in a pleasant way (more enjoyable than the watery, waxy, or shake-like sugary sweet horchatas at some of the more generic places around town). I ordered the drinks without ice, the horchata and pineapple could do well with light ice next time but i liked the watermelon without.  I sat their after my meal, delightfully sipping away at the pineapple until i heard a slurp which snapped me out of a food coma. 

I was not dreaming, this place is fantastic.
