Had brunch here with some out of town friends. We've had dinner and happy hour here before, but only at the bar. A favorite sport.
Brunch however was amazing. The food was delicious, but the standout was our server Lonnie. She anticipated every need, answered all questions, made awesome recommendations and kept our bottomless mimosas full. We will definitely look for her in the future!

Go to Mericadito!!!
