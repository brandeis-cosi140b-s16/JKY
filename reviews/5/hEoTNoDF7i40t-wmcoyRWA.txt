Fun restaurant and bar. Very diverse crowd that is very accepting of the LGBT crowd too. Karaoke a few times a week is awesome with a large selection of songs. Food is good, onion rings are homemade fresh and amazing. Service is friendly and attentive. I highly recommend it, especially on karaoke nights.
