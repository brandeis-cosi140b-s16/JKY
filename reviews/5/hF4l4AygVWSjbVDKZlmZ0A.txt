I have been coming here for about 5 years and I love the food, the service and the price. The funny thing is... I can go to Abuelos and spend 40 dollars or I can go somewhere else, but I really like the "no hassle" service.

I don't ever need to wait for a table. The food is always fresh and available. 

I have had places like Olive Garden tell me they ran out lasagna or Paradise Bakery run out of mushrooms. 

I never have ever had a problem here. I love the enchiladas and fish tacos!
The burritos are pretty good too.
