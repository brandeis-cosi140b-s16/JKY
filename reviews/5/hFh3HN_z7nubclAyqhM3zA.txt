I don't know if I am lucky or unfortunate to live so close to this Mixteca. You see, the food is just so good and cheap that it us difficult to use any self restraint. The ambiance is unique and there are regular patio events that look fun too.

Prices are on par with any valley berto's shop. Place your order, grab some chips and salsa from the bar and take a seat. Food is typically served quickly, but I have been in there when there was a crowd and wait times can increase. Worth it though, because the food is plentiful and superior to other area taco shops.
