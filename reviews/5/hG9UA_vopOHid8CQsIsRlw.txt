If you are looking for cheap eats, this is a great place to go.  Each night of the week they have a 99 cent special.  It could be anything from a tostada, nachos, to a burrito.  Don't the let cheap price fool you, the nachos are a very large portion.  Their other food choices are good too.  I like the carne asada and the carnitas.

The joint is right next to the bar Money Plays, with a door that passes between the two.  They also have great graveyard specials too.  It's not the fanciest place in town, just a decent place to kick back and have some cheap food.
