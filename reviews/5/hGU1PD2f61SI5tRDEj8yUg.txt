I love Mexican food and I love the fajita's at this place! They do a wonderful job making fajitas. The ambiance and service are good. I had my bday once and came with my bf and later with my mom. Always ordered fajitas, always loved it  
If you want to order cocktails, get their seasonal ones soits made out of fresh fruits.
