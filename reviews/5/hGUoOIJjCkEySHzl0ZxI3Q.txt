I was at TI for a conference and we were looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  

We opted to come here because it wasn't too busy at the time and it had a warm and inviting atmosphere. 

We both got chopped chicken salads and they were the BEST!!  A few beers and a glass of wine where all we needed.   

Later a group of us from the conference went back in the evening AGAIN... and loved the soup as well!!!    Nachos are good with a few different salsas!!!

During the third day of the conference I over heard some others talking about the Soup and Salads here and how they wanted to go again!

I loved it!!! YUMMMMMMMMMM
