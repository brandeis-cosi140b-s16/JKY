All their ingredients are fresh--the tortillas are baked on site and very good. They give you great chips and salsa to start, and even a cup of some unknown but amazing little soup. Plenty of comfortable places to sit with huge windows but the inside is still nice and shady. Friendly staff. 5 stars.
