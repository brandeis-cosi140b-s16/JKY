It's so nice to have a part of Tucson in Phoenix. This place is a Tucson staple. We drove 30 minutes to get here. I don't know if it's just nostalgia but I still felt tucson was better but nonetheless it's still delicious. They own the corner and they have a large room that you can se e through to  view how they are making their food from scratch.

Always get the Sonoran dogs. That's the best and main attraction. Bacon wrapped dog with beans, mustard, avocado paste, tomatoes, onions, sour cream. It's so amazing. Followed with a real sugar Coke in the glass.
