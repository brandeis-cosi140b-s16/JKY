I was super excited when I saw another Mexican restaurant opening up near me. Mad Mex is great, but can get a little repetitive. Patron has much more variety and everything I've had has been super good. I was a little worried about the bad Yelp reviews, but one try was all it took to change my mind. 

I've been here three times now, twice with my boyfriend and once with friends. Their margaritas are awesome, especially if you get one made with one of the premium tequilas off of their pretty impressive tequila list. The sangria is also nice and fruity and is pretty strong - none of that watered down stuff! 

The guacamole Patron is also delicious. I'm so glad I found a Mexican place that does guacamole right! Plus, there's unlimited chips and salsa, so you're not left with a whole bunch of guac and nothing to eat it with. 

I've now tried the chimichanga, the enchiladas, and the chicken fajitas - all excellent, though probably not so excellent for my waistline. I also always have enough leftovers for a good sized lunch the next day.

All of the servers I've had have been extremely attentive and helpful, and the manager even stopped by a few times to ask us how everything was. I'll definitely be back!
