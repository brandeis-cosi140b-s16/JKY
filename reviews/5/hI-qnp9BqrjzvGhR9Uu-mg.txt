I have tried fili b's and federicos.. Lazaros is by far the best taco shop in Phoenix! Everything is very very good! Their carne asada burritos, supreme nachos and fish tacos are AMAZING! You really cant go wrong with anything in the menu! Their portions are very well served and They have a full salsa bar that complimets your food very well. The staff is very attentive, friendly and nice.. Its a very low key place to grab a quick bite.. They have no drive-tru but the food is so good its definitely worth getting out of  your car for.
