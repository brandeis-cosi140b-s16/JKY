This is a little tacos shop that has amazing tacos and more. I have yet to eat something here that I haven't liked! Their ceviche is amazing and one ceviche tostada to-go is enough to almost make three of them, so the portions are huge. Definitely a must try if your in the mood for some good Mexican food!!
