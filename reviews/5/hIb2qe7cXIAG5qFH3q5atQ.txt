I waited a bit to write this to give them some time to fix all the problems with opening a new store. The first few times I visited there was excessive waiting. I was there around 8pm and it still took roughly 30 mins to get thru the line with about 20 people. Very excited they have fixed the issue and the last few times I have been were just as quick as any Chipotle I have been to. The food is the quality you would expect at any Chipotle. This is one of my favorite places and I am excited it is down the street from me
