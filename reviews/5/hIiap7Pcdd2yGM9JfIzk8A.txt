La Santisima Gourmet Taco Shop is my favorite place in Phoenix to get fish tacos and Mexican seafood.  The ingredients are really fresh, and everything tastes yummy.

Service can be a bit slow and seating is limited.  So, I recommend calling and placing to-go orders.  If you try to eat inside the restaurant during peak hours, prepare to wait 30 minutes.

I usually get the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Tacos, but I also like the 
Cabo Shrimp Tacos.

My boyfriend prefers beef, pork, and chicken dishes.  So, he usually gets the Sonoran Carne Asada Tacos or the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Tacos.  He also likes the Aztec Tinga Tacos.
