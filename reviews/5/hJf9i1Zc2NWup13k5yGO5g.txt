I eat lunch at Qdoba at least once a week and here's a list of the reasons why: 
1. They have THE FRIENDLIEST staff of anywhere I have ever been. They remember what I like to order and they are always happy to see me! 
2. The 3 Cheese Nachos with steak are to die for. I think I've become an addict. The food is always fresh, I always see them grilling chicken, peeling avocados, etc. in the kitchen. 
3. It is always very clean inside and the service is fast, but not impersonal. 
4. They have an amazing FREE rewards card! Double points on Tuesdays! I am sure that I have gotten at least 3 free lunches since I signed up for one! 
5. You can have a beer with your lunch if you want!  They have a liquor license, so it adds a little something extra!
