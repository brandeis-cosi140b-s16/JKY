You MUST go here!!!  We just moved to Chandler a few weeks ago and tried this place.  The BEST mexican food I have had in a long time.  The staff there is also very nice and helpful in explaining the selections.  We got our order to go and the woman who took our order (I think she was the night supervisor there) recommended how to put the order together and answered all of my questions patiently and was very informative (she knew their menu extremely well).  The food was AWESOME and correctly packaged and labeled.  Our kid's even loved the tacos (ground beef and potatoes with cheese only--not something I thought they would like, but they did!) and the cheese quesadilla we got for them (and they are very picky).  I got the cheese enchilada with red sauce and shredded beef tacos, both were very good.  My husband even loved his steak (carne asada) burrito (tip:  he got it deep fried and loved it).  It doesn't have an overhead sign on the building yet, but it is near to where Rosati's pizza is...look for the sign in the window (if I remember correctly).
