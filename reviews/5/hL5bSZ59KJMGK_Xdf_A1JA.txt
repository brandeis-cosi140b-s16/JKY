They have huge Margaritas for only $20. Not bad! We came here to watch the Vikings beat out the Raiders, winning me a nice $53 bucks. While watching the game, we ordered some food and drinks. 

The drinks were great but the food stole the spotlight. We had a huge plate of yummy chicken nachos and table-side guacamole. Not just regular guac either, no King Crab Bacon Guacamole. It was the best of all worlds coming together. And do you want to know how you make sure your guac is fresh, get it table-side. Our kind waitress made it right in front of us. It was soooo goood. 

Great place, good prices, and right on the Strip.
