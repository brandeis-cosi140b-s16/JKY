Loved the beautiful setting on the patio. Our server was Joe and really it couldn't have been any better. We ordered the jalapeños rellenos and the carne aside burro. The carne asada is the best I've ever had. The meat was tender, flavorful, and lean. The jalapeño appetizer was also very good and spicy. This will be our go to Mexican restaurant.
