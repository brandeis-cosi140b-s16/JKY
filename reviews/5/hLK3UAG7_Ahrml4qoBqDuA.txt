What can I say... The Giant Caramba Burrito is ridiculous, great tacos, fajitas and green chili. It's a step up from a 'bertos' type place but not quite a great sit down restaurant. 

They have a pretty good Mexican beer selection. My wife got the sangria tonight very tasty and only $3.50. Just like the other reviews watch out if you order more than one margarita!

Lastly the fried ice cream is dang good!
