Finally, I have a favorite Mexican food place downtown!   The carne asada taco's are as amazing as they claim,  simply melt in your mouth delicious. You can't order a meal without getting the guacamole too, it's awesome.  Top it off with some Horchata and you have a great meal, which is also affordable.   Terry (owner) is really friendly, drives a cool car and just built a new deck to expand seating options at the restaurant.   Can't go wrong here!
