The service was great!  Everyone was really friendly and kind.  We went for lunch (around 1:00 on a Thursday); so, it wasn't very busy, but there were a few other tables full of people in there.  We checked in on Yelp, which meant we received a free order of queso.  OH MY GOSH... you must get the queso!  It was unreal.  Their chips are fantastic as well.  Between the two of us, we got the queso, a cheese quesadilla, and two street tacos (they are tiny, fyi).  I had the fish taco which was awesome, and my friend had the shredded chicken (tinga), which she said was great.  I highly recommend PAZ!  I actually want to check out their brunch because I've heard such stellar things about it. :)  Oh, and get the margs... They are only $3 at all times!! Super smooth and tasty.
