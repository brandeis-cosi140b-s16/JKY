This is place is amazing. I have only been to the el ecanto dos up until this point. The original el ecanto is beautiful and surprising, it has a large pond with ducks and the seating area is huge.

The waiter came very promtly, kept out chips and salsa full. Our food came out very quickly, I ordered the pollo fundido and I have to say I have been dreaming about it since, so delicious!

The ambiance was awesome and the people there were great, definately check this place out.
