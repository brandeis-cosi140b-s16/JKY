You know?..there are plenty Mexican restaurants in town, but every now and then you you run into one that totally stands out from all the others and lucky for me this is the case with Las Tarascas Michoacanas. The food is amazingly good!
 The place is nice and clean with minimal decorations and although it lacks some more Mexican colors, the arches on the wall are a nice touch giving it a feel of authenticity.
 Service was great, this is a family owned restaurant and they really make you feel like you are part of it. They constantly check on you to refill your beverages and to make sure you're enjoying your meal to the fullest.
I ordered the gallina Zamorana, thats chicken covered with a special strawberry sauce and mushrooms, something I never had before and it was delicious, specially with the freshly handmade tortillas. We also tried the enchiladas Do√±a Andrea and we loved them but let me warn you, this are authentic Mexican enchiladas and not the ones most people are accustomed to here on the states, so if you're a "green grow", I recommend you try the regular enchiladas.
We really had a great time here at Las Tarascascas, ask for Viri (I think that was her name) she will definitely take good care of you! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu that sounded delicious, the only bad part is that I live so far from this place, but as my friend would say..... I usually don't hang around on this side of town but when I do I eat at Las Tarascas Michoacanas.....don't stay hungry my friends..
try them!
