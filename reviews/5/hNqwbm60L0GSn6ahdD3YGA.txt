I wish I would have eaten here sooner!  I only recently discovered this little gem and had to go back within 48 hours to get another fix.  The food is amazing.  During my first trip, I had a chorizo taco Mexico style (cilantro & onions) and a chorizo quesadilla.  Holy chorizo, Batman!  It was so good and such a huge serving.  The taco was ah-freakin-mazing.  I love that you can order Mexico style with cilantro and onion or American style with lettuce and tomatoes.  The quesadillas are overstuffed and toasted perfectly.  One quesadilla could definitely feed two, especially if you throw 1 or 2 tacos in the mix.  I've also tried the steak taco, American style and the chicken quesadilla.  The food is so fresh tasting and the meat tastes like real, high quality product. 

Another huge perk... The workers!  They are so friendly.  During our first visit, we were given some homemade pickled jalapenos to try.  They were amazing.  They aren't on the menu, so I'm not sure what to ask for next time I want them!  

You have to try this place!  It's cash only and they will wrap your food to go if you prefer to not eat at the picnic table.
