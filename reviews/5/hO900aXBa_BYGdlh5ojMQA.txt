Our car club made a trip up to the orchard and decided to eat here for lunch. We had 20 people and they were able to accommodate us very easily!  The chips and salsa were excellent and the food was so hot and fresh!  Our server took great care of us with ease. I will definitely come back and recommend them to my friends!!
