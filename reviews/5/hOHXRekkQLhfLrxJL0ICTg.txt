My Wife & I had the pleasure of dining here the other night. We were greeted very politely when we arrived. The hostess are all vey sweet & courteous. 
Our waiter, Jeff was extremely versed on the extensive menu & helped us pick out just the right starters & main dishes. The 1st plate was lettuce cups filled with BBQ Pork Belly and assorted garnish. They were excellent. The main dish was roast pork shoulder with a habanero & pineapple glaze. 10 small hand made corn tortillas accompanied this with assorted garnish. Onions, cilantro & Cotiga cheese. We also ordered the table side guacamole & salsa.  This dish was to die for. So many flavors going on.  Just awesome. I washed this down with a ginger pineapple mojito. Which was also great. 

Throughout the dinner, Jeff was checking up on us. What a pleasant and enjoyable young man. Needless to say we loved this place. Can't recommend it enough. 
Thank you for this culinary exquisite experience.
