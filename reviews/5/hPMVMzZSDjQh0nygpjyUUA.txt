This was a great restaurant! My husband and I were a little hesitant to eat here because we are really picky about our Mexican food, but I am glad that we did! The service was good and the food came out fast. We were only looking for a late night snack. I got the steak nachos, and they were excellent. They had a lot of cheese, beans, and good quality steak on them. My husband had their chicken tortilla soup and he loved it, I tasted it and it was really good a flavorful. Their prices were really good for what you get. I would definitely recommend going here if you are in the mood for good Mexican food.
