Oh. Mah. GAWD!!!

So I am ADDICTED to their nachos!!  *drools just thinking about them*

Unfortunately the nachos are literally the only thing I've tried-so really this is a review about nachos (in case ya haven't already figured that out..hehe)

First off:  The service is GREAT!  It's family owned and operated, they are ALWAYS pleasant..an added bonus for me is they already know what I'm getting when they see me walk in!  After you place your order, someone will bring out chips and salsa.  The verde sauce is the best!

Wen your food is ready, they bring it out to your table (of which there are 6-7 to choose from). 

The only drawback is that they recently changed out their soda machine and switched over to offering canned soda and water, which I guess adds to the authenticity, but makes it unappealing (for ME) to order a soda.  

So about those nachos:  They make their own chips (of course), and they are a little thicker then a processed/storebrand tortilla chip.  This is good since they can withstand various wet ingredients and still BE A CHIP (not a pile of mush!)  Piled on top of these delicious chips is: carne asada meat (perfectly seasoned and tender), pinto beans (not in a sauce, just naked and happy to be eaten), mouthwatering pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and queso fresco (I believe).  There is too much for one person (unless you grossly overeat)-even when my fiance and I ate like fat people, we still barely finished it TOGETHER!! Also, the nachos are $6.30!!  So it's a great deal!

So check this place out if you're in the area..I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed!
