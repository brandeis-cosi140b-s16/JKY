I love 1900. The service is always spot on, your drinks and chips stay full, the inside is super cute and there's plenty of parking across the street. The food here is great. I normally get the mole enchiladas because I'm a sucker for a great mole sauce and this one is outstanding. I haven't had anything on the menu that I haven't liked (the pastor tacos are to die for, by the way). The portions are pretty large, too, and it's reasonably priced. 
Plus, they have a great beer selection.
