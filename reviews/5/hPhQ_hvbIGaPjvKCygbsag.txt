We were looking for a place to go have dinner since we had gone to Arizona for the Dodgers spring training for the weekend. We were all craving Mexican food. One of our friends who lives out here recommended this place to us so we googled it to get the address. 

We got there and took at look at their menu, it was a hard choice. Everything sounded too good!! But I guess cause we were super hungry. Well we ordered not knowing what to expect.  It didn't take to long to get our food either wit it being kind of busy and only 2 people working the front floor. We sat down took one bite of our food. And let me just tell u! It was beyond bomb!!!! for it being our first time we were impressed. They meat has a delicious taste to it. We would definitely go back when we're out in Arizona.
