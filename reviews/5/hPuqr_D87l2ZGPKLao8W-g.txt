My boyfriend, our roommates, and I drive by frequently on our way to Sun Stop Liquors in the same parking lot. We've always been disappointed because Jorge's looks so nice but we've never seen anyone in there. One day, we decided to try it and we were very impressed. We were the only customers so our service was wonderful. The server was very nice and the restaurant was clean. I ordered the Original. I had never had chicken and waffles before but it was amazing. Haven't yet tried their bar service yet but the food was prompt and the atmosphere was laid back. The four of us have decided to make Jorge's our haunt.
