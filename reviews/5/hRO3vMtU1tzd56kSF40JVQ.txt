Absolutely delicious!  This is a fun place to go while out and about in Container Park. While there aren't many tables to sit at inside there are plenty offered outside. The carne asada fries were unreal....staying fantastically crispy all the way to the end.  The sopes were also amazing and fantastically crispy.
