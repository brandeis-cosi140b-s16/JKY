OK, I cook, but I eat for fun....  I'm breaking foodie law here by going happy on Hanshik, a Korean- influenced taco wagon run by a gringo dude named Ron.  When I find something this good, I want to keep it to myself, my fellow chef buds and their friends I want to sleep with... but man, I liked  Ron from the first bite, he has the guts and chops to open a very high end, high quality roach wagon in a liquor sore parking lot.  I ate the best damn veggie burrito I have EVER eaten, and yes, I include the Little Chihuahua in SF. If the man can do good veggie, I know the meat is a slam dunk. 

My first trip there was a drive by, I spotted the big red wagon parked in Lee's Liquors parking lot on Lake Meade and first  thought '"rolling grease barge for day laborers", but it just seemed a little to weird for that. So, I pulled in, got my tires rotated next door at a tire shop, and dropped a five. No regrets, next time I bringing my low-budget entourage of foodie wage slaves.

Coming from the NYC food thing, I miss the street food where you can stand, eat, yack,  and spend next to nothing. Hanshik fixed me right up.   

Go, before the red rope goes up and Ron's bouncer-friend named Rod starts taking reservations for parking lot spots.
