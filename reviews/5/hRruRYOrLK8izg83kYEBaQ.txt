"Oh.My.God" -says I
"what?!" -replies friend
"What in God's name is a Brulee burger!?!"
I quickly grabbed a paper menu off of the clean counter near the cash register and flipped open to the burgers.  I know what brulee means, burnt sugar, but how could this relate to a burger.  In my wildest sugary dreams I could have never dreamt of this.  A burger, delicious and meaty, on a very nice toasty bun, with Havarti cheese, Havarti people(!), bacon, porky crispy salty bacon, a fried egg, runny and delicious, and yes, BURNT SUGAR!
"Two please...
wait, no no, one, two would be silly.....(but if my friend wasn't here to witness this I would probably get 7)  and sweet potato tots please"
What saint, what angel, what GOD could create this masterpiece?  What twisted sugary mind could come up with this concoction?  If ever I meet the mad scientist who put together this beautiful monster I am liable to leave my husband and marry them.  

And their shakes looked really good too, I'll get one next time.
