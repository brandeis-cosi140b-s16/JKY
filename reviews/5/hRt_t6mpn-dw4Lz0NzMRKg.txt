The Excellent: 
* They give you salsa, and a bean dip before you eat. They were really good. 
* The enchilada sauces were excellent. 

The Good: 
* The Chicken enchilada filling (chicken) was a little dry. Still good with all the sauce, but could have been more tender. 
* Really fast service. 
* The "Ranchero" beans were just good. Not bad by any means, but not overly awesome 

The Bad: 

* Nothing

Overall it was a great "hot place mexican" place. I'd go back next time I'm in the area and craving hot place mexican. 

(hot plate mexican: Where they drop the plate off and say "hot place", and 9 times out of 10 whatever you order is covered in melted cheese and sauce).
