My husband and I went last weekend for the first time with a Groupon. The food was absolutely delish and fresh as fresh can get! We didn't look to see their hours, and arrived right at 7 PM (when they actually close) and they still happily took our order and let us eat in the restaurant. They were very sweet and the food was very good. We are going back tonight! My husband and I have been craving Z-Lantro all week!!!
