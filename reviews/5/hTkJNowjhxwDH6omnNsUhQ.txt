Our favorite Mexican food place here in Phoenix. It's a New Mexico style place so if you are looking for traditional style this isn't your place. We always get the Pollo con Queso. The spiced cream cheese is amazing.  Hot and fresh chips with salsa.  The mild salsa is a bit too sweet for me but I love their hot. Service is usually excellent.
