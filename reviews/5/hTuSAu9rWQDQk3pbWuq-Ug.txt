I did a double take from the road when I saw the Chipotle sign go up a few days go. These guys are brand new and already busy as ever at lunch time. They're doing a great job of handling the surge of customers, who I am sure were all just as excited to see this wonderful sight from the street as I.

They skimped on my burrito bowl today, but I'm sure they'll make up for it in time - they always do. I'm a big fan of the steak and/or barbacoa bowl, brown rice, pinto beans, drenched in both pico and corn salsa, lettuce, cheese and sour cream. Everyone was really friendly and got me through the line quickly. I want to go back already!
