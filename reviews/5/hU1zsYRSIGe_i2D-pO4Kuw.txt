Ok. So you know what I'm gonna say. The Carne Asadas were so good. I got the burrito with everything on it. So much flavor and the beef was so tender. I'm from out of town and needed a place to stop and eat before we went to Sedona and this was the closest and highest rated restaurant. I'm so lucky I found this place! If I'm ever in town I will def be back!
