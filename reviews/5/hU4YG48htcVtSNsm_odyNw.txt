The owner / operated is super friendly, even remembered me from almost a month ago. I happened to stop in bc I was getting my tires rotated next door...and had to go back because the chicken tacos are AMAZING.  His unique blend of spices are awesome...I think the chx tacos only have chicken and lettuce on them...seems super simple...completely incredible.  This little stand is WAY worth driving out of the way for.  And a guy this passionate and friendly and customer service-driven deserves to make it...and somehow I think he will.  He threw in a little sweet bread puff (forget the actual name) while we waited for our order.  When the sun is out, the umbrellas provide shade if you want to eat there (don't know what angerball was talking about with no shade, and I think everyone is pretty sure it's not "Korean food." It's fusion...but anyway.  Oh, and also- how many trucks/stand have misters...seriously, I don't make a habit of commenting on others' posts, but that one seems unusually unfair...)  

Anyway, anyway.  Honestly one of the BEST tacos I've ever had.  Five stars for being exactly what it's suppose to be as far a taco truck goes...and for having food quality worthy of an established restaurant, which, if it existed, would be bumpin'. 

I'm super stoked to go back.  

OH. And notice photo with the giant yellow umbrella.
