This was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had!!!!  The staff was so friendly.  I was in town on business and ate at the bar alone.  The chips and salsa were perfect and the #5 combo with red chile was simply amazing!  I'd suggest washing it all down with the kick-ass margarita.  OMG!  The entire experience was wonderful.  The place looks a little scary when you first pull up and walk in but do not let the fear take over.  I'd live there if I was a local.
