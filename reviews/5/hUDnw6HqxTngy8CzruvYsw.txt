Hands down, best tacos in town. Okay, it's possible that I'm biased as I'm from south San Diego and love Tijuana style tacos. They'e the smaller "street" tacos, but in my opinion, are made the way tacos are meant to be eaten.   

Because the tacos are smaller, it's advisable to order at least three -- or more if you're a hearty eater.  I, of course, recommend the carne asada tacos.  The pork adobada is also really good.  Also, try the mula; it's quesadilla meets taco.  I'm not quite sure why the carne asada french fries are $10.  In San Diego, carne asada french fries are $5, tops.  However, if you're feeling like a baller, the french fries are also an excellent option.  

The place is very casual (read: not fancy), but authentic as it comes in 
Vegas.  In short, it's well worth trying.
