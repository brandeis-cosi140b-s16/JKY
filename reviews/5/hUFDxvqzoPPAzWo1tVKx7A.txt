Fantastic.  Stay away from Filiberto's unless it's the one on Dobson and Main.  Actually, that one might even suck now because of the dregs of society getting off and on buses and the light rail racket.  

This place, in contrast, is great.  Great service, great portions.  All-around best quick Mexican food joint around.  I risk a bunch of idiots showing up at this place by writing favorably about it but so be it.  If you want your rolled tacos to actually have meat in them, get a dozen of them here.
