After living in Tempe for 5 years I finally discovered this place just a few years ago and it's been a solid Lunch experience ever since. 

I can't say anything for the dinner crowd, but get here before 12pm, order off the lunch menu and you'll have a healthy portion of fresh delicious Mexican food in under 10 minutes. 

I normally get the Half-Ass Burro, that comes with an excellent side salad and am stuffed every time I leave. 

I can also say for a great strong margarita pull up a seat at the bar, have some chips and enjoy. 

Without a doubt this is a perfect break from status-quo fried, rice and beans dishes normally found in the Valley.
