I was told that I must go here by another amazing Yelper and boy was he right, this place is amazing! The tacos come plain and then you pack them with toppings from their fabulous salsa bar that has everything that you could ever want on your taco! The bar consists of a ton of salsas, hot sauces, jalapenos, cabbage, slaw, avocado sauce, homemade ranch, tartar sauce, cucumbers, pickles onions,  limes... seriously, you name it, it is there! I ordered their beer battered fish tacos and holy yum, I was in heaven! On Taco Tuesday, it is buy 2 tacos, get 1 free! ...Can't beat that! We may be regulars here very soon!
