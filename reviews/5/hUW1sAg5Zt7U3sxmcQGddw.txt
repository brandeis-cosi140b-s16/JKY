The hubs and I were there for dinner last night and it was amazing! The service was impeccable, the were very attentive to us, even thought there were some large parties seated near us. The servers were not wandering aimlessly throughout the restaurant, they were on a mission to please the customers and make sure that they felt as though they were the only guest in the house! Jose, our waiter was excellent, his other server-bus was literally running throughout the tables cleaning up, serving chips, and checking on tables...Our food came out in a timely manner and was excellent! The homemade flour tortillas are outstanding and the manager inquired as to how our meal was @the end of dinner and was genuine about it! It is close to nellis afb which was perfect! We may have to go back for cinco de mayo!
