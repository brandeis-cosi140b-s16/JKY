I have to say I really like Rubio's. The food is always good and I love the fish Tacos.
I just spent a few days in Cancun for my Birthday. So I have wanting Mexican food ever since I got back.
However, the food in the states is not as good as down there.So it is hard to find a match. I am going to say the Rubio's is right on it. 
The food here is fresh and good! Really good. The salsas are fresh and delicious as if they are made every day.
 I always like them ,no matter which location I try.
The place is clean, the food very good. Even the restrooms are clean and well stocked. I highly recommend This Rubios!
