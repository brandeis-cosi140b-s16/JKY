Note that, as per other reviews, this is hidden in the back of a grocery store. 

Very good tacos, with a very good price. Service can be a little slow, and ambience can be lacking, but you're not going to get 3 tacos of this quality for 6 bucks anywhere nearby. 

Also, they have solid Horchata so don't miss out on that!
