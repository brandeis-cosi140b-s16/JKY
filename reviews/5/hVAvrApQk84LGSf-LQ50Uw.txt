Although this place looks like something from a shanty town, don't let that scare you because the place is sanitary and serves great mexican food. It's decently priced and I haven't had anything I don't like. Everything is home-made as far as I can see and tastes delicious. Just make sure you remember the hours since they're a little odd. I love their green chile pork and potato burrito. Large servings fill you up so you could even split a burro if you don't eat a lot. I would put aside any prejudice from the look and give this place a try.
