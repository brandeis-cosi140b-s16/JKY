Sushi burritos do I need to say more! Upon walking in the staff was extremely helpful and polite. They helped us choose which ingredients that went best with our chosen proteins, which was super helpful since I'm no expert at sushi ingredients. They also asked us if we want to take home some of their other sauces so we could try them on our burritos. Overall amazing food and staff will definitely be back! P.s. the Diablo sauce is no joke, super spicy!
