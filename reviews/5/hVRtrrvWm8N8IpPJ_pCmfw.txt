Excellent service, great food, and the Milagro margarita is superb. It's everything you could ask for in a chain restaurant, without the hassle of bad service or sub par food. 

I've been to this location on 3 separate occasions and every experience has been exactly the same. Wait staff was attentive but not pesky, food was ordered and delivered to table within 20 mins of us sitting. 

The margaritas particularly the Milagro which is not displayed on the menu is a fine choice it is made table side with Agave nectar.
