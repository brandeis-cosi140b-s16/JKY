I had this very bad craving for a torta today and I found this was the closest place to my office and it looked like it had very good reviews so I decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did, because this was the best torta I had since I moved to the states. I had the Al Pastor which was moist and properly seasoned and the horchata water wasn't overweeningly sweet like other places. Grandma cooking in the back is always a good sign of great food to come. A little bit expensive for a torta (I mean, in Mexico you get really god ones for 2-3 bucks) but I'll be definitely be back.
