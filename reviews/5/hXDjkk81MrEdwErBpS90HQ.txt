One of our favorite places! My husband would eat here weekly if I let him. The staff is wonderful and the hot salsa sure is hot! 
The food is always fast and good! We took my family here for a quick dinner when they came to visit. Everybody loved how good the food was and it's affordable. Love salsa Blanca!
