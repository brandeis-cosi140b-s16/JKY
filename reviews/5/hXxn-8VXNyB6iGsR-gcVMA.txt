I love this Rubio's! The staff here is really nice and remembers you if you're here often enough. The food is always fresh. Taco Tuesdays ($1.50 for a fish taco) is amazing! The salsa is fresh, the food is great, and the staff seems like they actually care if you're having a good experience. I've been to local restaurants and gotten fish tacos that weren't as good as the ones at Rubio's. Plus they have beer. Go and get some!
