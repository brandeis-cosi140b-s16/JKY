I'm giving this 5 stars but it doesn't deserve 5 stars.

That's stupid, you might tell me, and you might be right.

I don't care.  I love Chipotle.  I love it so much. I'd drink their sour cream.  I could eat their guac all day every day and nothing else.  I love their rice.  I love it all.

What I hate is that, much like every other business in Maricopa, the service here sucks.  They're inconsistent, they dont know how to wrap a burrito right, they seem to miss easy/simple things and take forever to do stuff, sometimes the line looks downright sloppy.  The layout of this place is the worst for any Chipotle I've ever been in, and trust me I've been in a ton.

The parking lot of the entire strip mall is so bad.  Does Maricopa just get second-rate engineers and architects at all times?  Why is every parking lot in this city so awful?  Why is it so hard to get in and out of this freaking place?  Are they stupid?  I think they might be stupid.

Then again, I think I might be stupid because despite all that, I gave it five stars.  I did that because I love Chipotle, and I hate the lack of options in this town, and I could live at this, the shittiest of all Chipotles, forever simply because there isn't anything else better here.
