Best CHIPOTLE in town. 

I've been to several locations, and this one far exceeds them all. The food is consistent, staff is awesome, and it's always clean. 

While lunch during the week can be really busy, they move the line quickly so anyone can get in and out. (The other day 21 people were ahead of me, and I probably waited 5-6 minutes).  Tiana is always super friendly. 

This location tops!
