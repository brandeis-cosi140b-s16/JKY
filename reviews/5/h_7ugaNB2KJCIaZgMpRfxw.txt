La Palapa is great! Their food was delcious and the service was really good. The waitress gave me lotsa chips and salsa, always checked on my drink, and got my food fast. Their salsa is SOOOOOO good. The chips were fresh and not greasy. I had menudo because I was feeling slightly hungover that day . They have a HUGE menu. I would like to try lots of other things here. The restaurant is very clean and relaxing.  The prices are decent too. I will definatley be going back soon.
