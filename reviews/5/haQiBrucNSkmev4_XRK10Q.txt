My all time favorite Mexican food restaurant (and I'm a native folks). Hefty, no frills Sonoran-style food. The chips and salsa are addicting and the prices beyond reasonable. When you're craving for enchiladas smothered in melted cheese and a serving size that practically spills over the sides of your plate, this is the place.
