This place has negra modelo on tap.  I would almost give them 4 stars alone for that.  The food here is incredible, very reasonably priced, and is mostly locally grown and raised.  Add in there musical taste, a mixture of latin and indie rock, and you have a place about to explode from too much hipster cred.  I mean that in a good way.  We live in the east valley, so this is a haul for us, but this is THE place we take our out of town guests.  Everyone loves it.
