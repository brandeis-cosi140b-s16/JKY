I live in the NW side of town and had been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did!! We ordered shrimp tostadas, shrimp cocktails and fish and shrimp tacos.  The food was amazing and the service was great!!  This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food.  It was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go again.
