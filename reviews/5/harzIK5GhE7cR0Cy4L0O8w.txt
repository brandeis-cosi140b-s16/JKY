this is my GO-TO Taco spot... AUTHENTIC!!! and a Full Menu (burritos, tamales, enchilladas, tortas) none of that imposter mexican food, like Roberto's, Baja Fresh, and Taco Bell.. If i wanted lettuce in a burrito, i would go there. But here you get real street style tacos for 90Â¢..Meat, Onions, Cilantro, Salsa...easy ryt?...they will have the meat of your choice.. Asada, Chicken, Carnitas..and if you want some Lengua, they have that too..Small Salsa bar, but it doesn't mater, cuz the Red salsa is all you need..grab a couple cups of red salsa, sit down and grub..and occasionally glance at all the celeb deco around... and last Lunch specials (well now they are all day)..cuz everyone loves a special during these times... 5 Bux..gets you 4 Tacos, rice, beans, and a drink.. So go grab a special with a Horchata or Jamaica and enjoy...
