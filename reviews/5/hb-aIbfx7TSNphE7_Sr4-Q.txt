I'm always a little hesitant to try new authentic Mexican joints but what a find I had today! This place is so freaking good and the prices are ridiculous. Had 2 tacos, so did my man, for 10 bucks. The chicken and steak street tacos were the bomb and had free chips and salsa and the even gave us candy bc it's Halloween! Place is SUPER clean they obviously take pride in the place! We loves it and will be back even though we live pretty far away! Awesome food and people were really nice!!! BAM!
