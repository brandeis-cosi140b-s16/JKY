I heard about this little gem when I overheard some people raving about it at the top of camelback mountain. I try to treat myself after my hikes, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It's a hole in the wall(those are always the best!). It's crowded  with people waiting for their order. It's not a typical sit down place. You order at the window, pay, and move to the side with everyone else and wait for your food. It's a bit of a wait, but wow, you won't be sorry for the wait. I got the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Now, I can't tell you what makes it so good, it just is. It's messy and absolutely delicious! They have several tables outside(no inside seating), but most people get it to go. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.
