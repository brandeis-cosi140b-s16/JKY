A great experience at FÃµgon. The food was delicious and merits both recommendations to friends and to my yelp family as well as a return visit to satisfy the desire to eat everything on the menu.  Your Bubbys brisket has been reinvented into a sensational enchilada with layers of savory bites topped with a tomatillo salsa cooked inside the adobe oven after it was heated table side.   These Adobe ovens are amazing. They cook fast and evenly, a Mexican microwave but all natural.  Abuelita's chocolate ice cream dessert is memorable and worthy of return.  The mango nopale salad was a refreshing start that invigorate the tastebuds   And the rice and bean sides are the best I have had in a long time.  Felicidades!  Please Support tjhis Restaurant.   The service was also excellent.
