After a long hard run at carowinds we decided to stop here. Of the 5 times we have been here there was 1 time that the food was just not as good as the other times. We brought it up to our waitress and she said if it's like that again to let them know. They have the best salsas and selection of salsa that they bring to you. Finally since my family and I moved here we have found real salsa that has a kick to it instead of the full and bland. Every place Mexican restaurant we have been to when asked if they have anything spicier they bring back chili oil which is not how you make spicy salsa. Cecilia's is the only place we eat at in irmo, sc because her food has never disappointed us , the salsa is amazing and we will never go anywhere else unless he head up to carowinds.
