I've never stayed to eat here but always satisfied with my beef or chicken chimichanga. Others who have been here complained about the utensils/ plates being plastic/ paper, but I've been to Mexican restaurants where plates and utensils were all pretty but food wasn't all that. I recommend to others to try it out.
