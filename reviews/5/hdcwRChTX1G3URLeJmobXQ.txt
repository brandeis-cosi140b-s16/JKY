This review is for their tamales only.  I haven't been to this location, I bought mine at the Phoenix Public Market.

OMG these are some of the best tamales I've ever had!!  I've tried the beef with red chile, the green chile chicken, the chicken chipotle and green chile corn cream cheese.  There was plenty of filling and you could even tell by looking at it, what it was filled with.  The taste was amazing, and spiced nicely.  They heat in 2 minutes in the microwave (I left them in the paper wrapper and corn husk) and they steamed inside to a perfect moist and hot tamale for your eating pleasure.  These tamales are exactly the way all tamales should be!

I am happy to know I can buy these at the Mesa Farmers Market on Fridays without having to go all the way downtown.  You can be sure I'll stock up again!
