One of the best Mexican Restaurants in Arizona! It's delicious! Your food is ready very quickly, it's very affordable, good customer service and the owners are very nice. Every time I come in, they already know what I want! They're very good to their customers and I definitely recommend this restaurant to anybody in the area. Loaded Nachos and breakfast burritos are great. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
