After a long night out at casino and dancing, me and my family HAD to stop to enjoy some of the best tacos de carne Asada!  first time that I have gone there and will for now continue! The waitress was nice and she was quick with our orders being taken, as well as bringing them to our table! And although it was like 4am, the vibe of everyone there was still on a roll!
