I love El Toro Loco! They have great prices, large portions, and really fantastic margaritas. I read a few other reviews saying that people had experienced bad customer service here, but that was not my experience at all.
My husband and our toddler came in a few weeks ago, and we were sat at a normal table, which was fine by us. When our server came to greet us, he immediately asked if we would prefer a booth which was very thoughtful. It can be difficult keeping a toddler seated at a normal table. This particular server went above and beyond for us, fixing the table wobble and even making silly faces at our son to entertain him while my husband was deciding on an entree. When our chips and salsa were empty, an older woman walking through the dining area asked if we would like a refill. 
The food is somewhat americanized, but much more authentic than anything else in the south hills. Very fresh, delicious, and satisfying. Aside from El Burro, this is the best mexican food in Pittsburgh.
