I picked up a half dozen empanadas on my way home from work, and I have to say that this was a great way to wind down the day.  When I got home, I opened up a bottle of wine, turned my oven to 350, and after like 4-5 mins the crusty hot meat pockets were good to go.  To be truthful, this was really my first experience with empenadas.  Being from Hawaii, I'm more used to manapua (pork bao bun), but to my surprise, they actually had a Kalua Pig empenada!  

I also got the bbq shredded beef and the beef with red wine sauce and olives.  All of them were amazing, and I definitely will be back soon.  My bill for a half dozen was about $10.50, and they were the perfect appetizers for my wife and I.  

Next time I come I'm going to try an order of their tacos.  From the pics they look really good.  End of the day, these guys care about their food, and in turn it makes me feel like they care about my experience when I go there.  With that I say Salud to The Corn Flower and welcome to the neighborhood!
