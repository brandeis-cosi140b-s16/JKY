This location was actually a lot cleaner than expected being that its located on the Las Vegas strip where there's so much traffic. We walked, so it took a min to get to it, but the prices were the same as any other location unlike some of the other chain restaurants on the Las Vegas strip. Its locates downstairs to its sister company McDonalds, which is where the restrooms are located. I order a bowl with chicken, cheese, lettuce and beans. The food was really good. The service was great and the prices were reasonable.
