Loved this place! My husband got a steak quesadilla which was fresh and the meat was juicy, tender and flavored perfectly. I wasn't very hungry but wanted to try a taco so I went with the crispy fish, so glad I did. It was really good. The restaurant was pretty packed and the workers were all busy but the service was fantastic. Can't wait to go back !
