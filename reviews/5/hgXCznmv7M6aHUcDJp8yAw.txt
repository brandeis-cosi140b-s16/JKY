Absolutely my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale! The service is ALWAYS friendly, the food is excellent and the price is right. What else can you ask for?
My husband and I always split the Parrillada for two, which is amazing. Their homemade chorizo is to die for, and their roasted jalapenos are wonderful.
Even their simple tacos are incredible.

Get there before noon or go after 1pm if you're going with a group and want a table at this location!
