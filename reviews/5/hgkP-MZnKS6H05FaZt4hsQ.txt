I love this Mexican food place! This is the place you want to be if you love tacos, burritos, and nachos. If you want to taste Mexican Authentic food then this is the place to be.  They have different type of salsa and the sauce spice goes from mild to hot (whichever you prefer).  I love spicy food and this Mexican restaurant has the best spicy salsa ever!  The carne asada burrito is good too; Chipotle has nothing compare to this place. This restaurant definitely has more meat and the marinated meat is cook to perfection. Don't forget to get some japanenos!!! They are so good!!!
