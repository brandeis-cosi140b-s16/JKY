WOW......the most authentic Mexican food I have had since eating my mother-in-laws home cooking.....sorry Nellie, Frank and Lupe' is better!
A cute charming hole in the wall. If you are looking for upscale or Americanized Mexican food.....do not go here.
If you are looking for the BEST authentic home cooked Mexican food, this is the place!
Their beans are out of this world, not completely mashed and nicely smokey tasting. Their Spanish rice was the best I have ever tasted, not heavy on the tomato sauce at all but super flavorful. I also had a tamale that was again better than my M-I-L's and up to this point no one could make them as good as she does. The enchilada was good and OH MY the chips and salsa. The chips are thick but very crunchy and the salsa was amazing, not too spicy with a terrific flavor.
I have seen reviews about poor service and bugs.....we saw NONE of that and the place was FULL. 
The prices are also very reasonable. My combination plate that included a chili relleno, taco, tamale, enchilada rice and beans AND two sopapillas was only 13.75 and I had enough to take home for lunch the next day.
If you truly know your Mexican food and love home style cooking, this is the place to beat!
