We came here because it was highly recommended by a friend. I'm not usually near the strip during lunch time, but I had just dropped some people off at the airport, so I figured i'd give it a try! 
I was happy when they offered us a kids menu and some crayons for my 3 year old son. I wasn't sure if it was going to be that kid friendly, but I felt very welcomed. Like most Mexican restaurants, you get a complimentary basket of chips, but these are house made and baked in sunflower oil, and you can really taste the difference. Plus you get three different salsas to dip them in with different spice levels. 
The food came out quickly, was hot, flavorful and filling. What more could you ask for? I know, a Summerlin location!
