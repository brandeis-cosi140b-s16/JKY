It's about time old town Scottsdale offered a trendy, inexpensive, atmosphere that offers AMAZING Mexican food! Also, my favorite thing about this place is that there are healthy options! This is a great location right in the heart of old town surrounded by plenty of shops, art galleries, among many other things to do. 

Diego Pops offers both inside/outside seating. Tables, booths, couches, and bar stools. There is also a bar with more fancy drinks without the use of Tequila than I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant! Don't get me wrong...the Tequila was definitely flowing;) I'm a HUGE fan of coconut so if there are any coconut fans out there I highly recommend getting your drinks right from an actual coconut!

There was a lot of great items to choose from on the menu and my favorite go to item on this menu was the tacos. All of the tacos were great but the one that stood out from the rest was the shrimp tacos! YUMMMMMM! We had the s'mores dessert that tasted just like it was right off the campfire minus all the work it takes to make one! 

Our waitress was very attentive and the manager was present ensuring that all of the customers were receiving the best service. Overall, we loved this place for the atmosphere, food, drinks and service and will definitely frequent here!
