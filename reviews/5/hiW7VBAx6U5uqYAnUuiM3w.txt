Oh my goodness, if you love authentic street tacos, you will die and go to heaven at Wadaa. It is a simple walk-up window and there are no tables so plan on enjoying your scrumptious tacos elsewhere. The menu is very basic, you order chicken or steak, flour or corn tortilla (meat comes with cheese sprinkled on it) and then you add your own fresh salsas, cabbage, lime juice, etc. They are literally to die for! Each taco is $3 and for me, 2 tacos were plenty because I loaded on the cabbage and salsa! I got 1 of each and loved them both equally! I will be back very soon!
