Even though we had to wait for an hour to eat, we came with a group of 8 without reservations...so that's obviously not their problem. It was worth the wait! Chips with a variety of salsas, awesome margaritas, build-your-own burritos, and a friendly, attentive waitress made for a really enjoyable night. Even the hostesses were great. We chatted with them while waiting for a table. 
We love this place and are even happier it's in Centennial!
