First Off...Salsa is some of the best I've tried...growing up in  So. Cal.and now in Az...that's a statement!
My friend and I ordered both Mexican pizzas....We enjoyed both equally, and could not choose a favorite! 
Service is very good, and the owner dropped by for a quick chat and greeting.
Prices were very reasonable and the portions were large.
