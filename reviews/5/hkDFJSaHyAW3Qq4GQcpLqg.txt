The $10 for $20 in food Yelp deal caught my eye. This place is amazing, and even without the deal, the prices are reasonable. The people there were friendly and the food was made quickly. The food was better than Roberto's and even better than some of the way more expensive sit-down restaurants around here. I'd definitely recommend this place, and I'll be back!
