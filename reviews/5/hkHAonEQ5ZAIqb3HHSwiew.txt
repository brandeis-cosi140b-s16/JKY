Husband and I moved to Wisconsin from Southern California, land of hand-made tortillas and bombity-bomb mexican, and have been looking for non-gringo mexican for the last month.  It's been a hard, painful, sour cream-filled road.  Up to Habanero's, the closest we'd found to the real thing was el Mariachi in Lake Mills (really good, and more capable of making the spice sweat-worthy, but unless you specify they will default to the bland side).

Finally, a restaurant where the place was packed but we were the only gringos.  Fast service, killer portions (beat out our old standby in LA with the taco meat portions), and the flavor that we've been craving.  Get one each of barbacoa, steak and pastor, your taste buds will thank me.

Not sure about the 3am rumor though, we wanted a second round after getting out of the Barrymore at 1am, and they were closed.  Still, if you're craving the food and wanting seconds the same day, that's a definite good sign.
