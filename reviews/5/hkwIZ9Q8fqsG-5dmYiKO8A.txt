Visited the Zabas in our neck of the woods last night... What was that? Did you just ask me if I wanted a Wheat Tortilla?... And brown Rice..... Hmmm Something did not seem right. The chicken breast was delicios in my warm wheat tortilla with brown rice and HOT salsa. This place was pretty good. I can see the resemblance to Chipotle when you walk in but the food beats out chipotle by far. The parking lot is a tricky one, that would be my only complaint. Great Food, comfortable atmosphere, Crappy Parking, What else can you ask for!?
