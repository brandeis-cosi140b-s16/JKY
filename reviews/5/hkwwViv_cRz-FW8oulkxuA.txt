Visited So Cal Fish Company tonight. My husband and I asked our excellent waiter for a recommendation. We ordered the beer battered mahi and shrimp fish tacos as he suggested and we were blown away. So delicious. Hot and flaky fish was perfectly battered. The combination of sauces and accompaniments were perfectly paired here. We also were equally impressed by our appetizer- a platter of coconut shrimp. The batter was crispy and flavorful, while the shrimp was fresh and hot. Patio dining added to our experience. WE WILL DEFINITELY RETURN- YUM!!!
