Well, been here for the first time and I think this is the only place in vegas that you don't get ripped off. Hookahs are really nice. The staff are super friendly and caring. The owner is a really nice guy and takes care of you like he knows you for a long time. You feel like you are in your home. Highly recommended. Best hookah spot in vegas for sure.

You guys must stop by here
