This place is awesome. It may look intimidating when approaching the counter but the helpfull staff guides you through the ordering process while loading you up with samples. With the concept, the quality of food, the execution of the concept, as well as the staff, I can can honestly say that place is an instant classic.

If you like Mexican Food as well as Chines Food, then this place will blow your mind!
