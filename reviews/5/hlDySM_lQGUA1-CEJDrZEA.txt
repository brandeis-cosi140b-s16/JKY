Great service. Staff is very friendly. Food is on point. Open late!! Great for going in after hours when you're hungry. I really enjoy the carne Asada tacos. They get busy after 2 so come quick. The drink specials are also very good. They have fireball Friday's which is great to start off with especially if you need to watch your budget. What better than $3 shots?
