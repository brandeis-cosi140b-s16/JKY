One time I walked into this exact chipotle with my gf who was on crutches at the time the manager turned her frown upside down by saying crutches are no fun your burritos free I was happy but at the same time a little skeptical of whether or not the manager really cared for the way my gfs day was going or if he was just flirting but about 2 months later I walked in there to grab lunch by myself and the same guy said just you today I replied and said yep and he said well smile lunch is on me today lol just a cool guy I guess
