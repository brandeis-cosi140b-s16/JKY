I have been going to Zaba's for about three years now. I have gotten everything from a steak burrito to fish tacos. I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly. Some employees have been there since I started going and they are always fabulous. You can have more of a conversation than, "What would you like on your tacos?". Everything is grilled fresh and you can taste it. The cilantro pesto is exceptional. It tastes great on everything. Today, I stopped by for lunch and got a vegetarian burrito. I added sweet potatoes to it and I was a little leery but the guy serving me told me it was really good. He was right!! I think Zaba's beats Chipotle any day.
