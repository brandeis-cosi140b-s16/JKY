Fatboys is AMAZING. Abel the owner and his wife are such hard workers. They're always in the kitchen ready to take care of you. Abel knows our orders off the top of his head, he really cares about his customers.

The burgers are GREAT. We always get the bacon cheeseburger. Seriously, every single bite is perfection. You get an even amount of everything on your burger and it's portioned perfectly. The fat fries are great too. 

This place is great, eat here!
