This is my favorite restaurant. In town only for the weekend and had to stop in. I love their fresh tortillas and fajitas, I never get anything else. 
Tonight I had a melon margarita because it was on special but I love their pi√±a coladas. 
Their salsa is tasty, flavorful but not overbearing. 
Their chips are thin and very crunchy, I believe they are made in-house.
