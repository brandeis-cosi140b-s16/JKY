Hands down the best breakfast burrito joint in the area. My boyfriend and I were slightly obsessed for a while, and still would be if we had not moved. He always ordered a ham breakfast burrito with potatoes, egg, sour cream and cheese. I'm a weirdo and would always order a breakfast burrito with bell peppers, potatoes, sour cream and cheese. Or maybe it's not a breakfast burrito since there's no egg? Oops.

Anyways, I think one of the most distinguishable things about this place is the salsa bar. I love my salsa. Mild, medium or spicy... Red or green... I will bathe my burrito in it and devour. They have some great salsas here, folks. They also offer chips so you can have some chips and salsa while you're waiting for your food. My boyfriend also likes munching on the cucumber and radish slices. 

The parking is not the best around this joint, but I highly recommend the place overall.

Also, they do TO-GO orders! Always great since this place is always busy on weekend mornings!
