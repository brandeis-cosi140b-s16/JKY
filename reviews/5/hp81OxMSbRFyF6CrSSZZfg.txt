Happy Hour is a great way to try a variety of appetizers. My husband and I did not expect the large portions of high quality Mexican fair. We had planned to sit at the bar first for a sampling of food and drink but ended up quite full after just 2 apptzrs each. I was very impressed with taste, portions, presentation and creative twists on traditional Mexican food. I was pleased that they allow you to mix it up on the taco plate that comes with three tacos; For example you may choose chicken, carne asada, and carnitis-my favorite. Enjoy!
