Be it cats or dogs, this location has been my local carne asada watering hole for over a decade now. Sure, it's dirty. Sure, there's only outdoor seating and sure, there are occasional bullet holes in the ceilings, but nevertheless the food is always the same; greasy drunken night goodness! I love you filly b's! You always know to keep me regular.
