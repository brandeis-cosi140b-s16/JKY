Very good mexican food!
I've been here multiples times, never disappoints. 
I got the shrimp chimichanga, not only was it delicious, but it had SO MUCH SHRIMP!!
Chips and salsa were also very good. They have two types of salsas, a spicy one and a chunky one. Both good, but my favorite was the chunky.
