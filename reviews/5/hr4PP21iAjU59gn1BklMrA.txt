Is it the best Mexican food I've ever had?  No.  Do I care?  Not really.  The outstanding service more than made up for it.

The guacamole actually was incredible, and the rest of the food was about what you'd expect in Vegas.  The prices on everything were quite reasonable, especially considering it's on the Strip.  And again, I have to say the service was some of the best I've experienced anywhere.  We never had to wait for anything, and everyone was extremely helpful.
