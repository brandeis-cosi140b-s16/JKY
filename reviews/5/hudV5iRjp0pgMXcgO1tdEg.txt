Absurdly good Mexican food. When I got to the restaurant, I wondered if I had gone to the right place - it does happen to be next to what calls itself 'the world's largest gentleman's club'. But the interior was surprisingly upscale and tasteful, and the food was something else.

The entire (bulky) menu looked attractive, but highlights of what I tried for me were the carne asada, the fajitas and everything that contained shrimp. The quality of the ingredients used was exceptional, and the server made guacamole to taste at the table. Everything was freshly made ('as fresh as it gets in a desert', the server quipped) and I would be surprised to hear of a bad dish on the menu.

The desserts were also phenomenal, which came as little surprise. After we ordered, the executive chef, Paco, came over to ask us as to our opinion of the food and to share some info as to how it was cooked. The flan recipe was his grandmother's last gift to him, and I take it his grandmother was a formidable cook. That was by far the best flan I've ever had - and amazingly, it's free if you check in on Yelp.

I've spent a good amount of time in Mexico and this was up there with the best Mexican food I've had. It's difficult to recommend this restaurant highly enough.
