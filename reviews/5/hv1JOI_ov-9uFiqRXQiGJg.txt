Best tacos in town!

As was mentioned, it's setup Qdoba/Chipotle style. Quasi-cafeteria, semi fast-food. Service is quick.

That's no knock however, because the food is amazing. I've only had tacos, but I have tried all the different meats available. All are well seasoned and spiced, and you get huge portions of meat.

My advice? Get your tacos w/ only onions, cilantro, and the habanero sauce. Your tastebuds will thank me. 

I am of the opinion that too many toppings detract from the quality of the meat, and you lose some of the flavors. Get it authentic style, and enjoy!
