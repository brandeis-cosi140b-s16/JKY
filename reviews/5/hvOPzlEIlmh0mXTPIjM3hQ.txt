This is my number one Mexican choice. You have to like spicy food. If you don;t you will hate it and probably write an inappropriately bad review. Carne adovada ribs and shrimp vera cruz are the only two choices in my opinion. If you get something else, it's at your own risk of wishing you had ordered one of these two items. I always order the beer on draft, unless it's a night for some margaritas which will knock you out (a little expensive, but really strong). The downtown location is my favorite, followed by the Mesa joint. Downtown has the best scenery but you have to wait a long ass time. I love this place.
