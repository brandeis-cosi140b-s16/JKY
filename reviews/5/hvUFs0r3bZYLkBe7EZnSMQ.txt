Wow! If you are visiting Las Vegas and want to have REAL, authentic Mexican food, then you have go here. The state of Michoacan is known for their Carnitas so I would suggest you try them. The food is amazing and the customer is outstanding. It seems like more and more restaurants are incorporating  the buddy system. We had  several waiters and this kept everything flowing, everyone was happy and had a great time.
