The Mole Negro and Paella are both excellent and this time we tried some of the playful side dishes (sweet corn dusted with Mexican cheese and smoked paprika and some snow rolls that had egg noodles, shrimp and I believe yellow beets... both delicious). The best part about OTRO is that Mr. Robson could easily charge 25 percent more for his food but doesn't. Added bonus: On this Saturday we had a stellar soundtrack provided by the jazz three-piece What's the Big Idea, which played jazzy versions of contemporary rock songs from Weezer, Pink Floyd, Muse and Guns N Roses. Brilliant. OTRO has assumed the No. 1 position on my Phoenix Restaurants Power Rankings.
