The staff was friendly. Small place so seating was adequate. Had the Booze Burger and chips with a rainbow shake (vanilla with sprinkles). Burger was good and I was not disappointed. I like their unique take on the burgers. Will have to try some others when I am in the neighborhood. Always like places that do homemade potato chips. The shake was very good too.
