This place is a gem!  The food is excellent.  I would challenge you to find a better shredded beef taco anywhere in the valley!  The atmosphere was fun and in the parking lot was a car club show ( I hear they do car show every Friday and Saturday night).  Absolutely should be on your list of places to try!
