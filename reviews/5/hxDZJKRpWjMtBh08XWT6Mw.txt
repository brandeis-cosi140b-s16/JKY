Located in the Aria.  This is what I would think Mexican Gourmet SHOULD be!!

Great food; great service.  Pricey but well worth it.  (But not obnoxiously expensive like Nobu, for example)  Fantastic, diverse menu.  I didn't have any alcohol this time but my friends told me the fancy Margaritas they ordered were sublime.

Take your time perusing the menu.  They have a fantastic selection from meats, to seafood, to what I would call "mexican combo" plates but that would be a "misnomer" from what we are used to at normal tex-mex places.  This is a GREAT date place, too.  But make reservations.  It can get busy on a weekend.  

The decorations are amazing and noteworthy.  The photo of the wood carving I'm attaching supposedly has the owners caricatured in the top right corner.  There is also a glass margarita tree that is part of the decor that looks a little Chihuly'ish, if you know who he is.  

All in all can't miss place!!  Highly recommend everyone trying it.
