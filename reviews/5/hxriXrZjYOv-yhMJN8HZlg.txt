AWESOME LAS VEGAS! Man do there employees work there asses off! I had god knows what I can't remember, but the scenary hellow right outside the L.V sign. nice trees, plus you see people taking pics on the sign. It's crowded, but the atmosphere is up in arms. Just tuff to get a place to sit. and there is a mall across the street so yup. The taste was so off the hook!
