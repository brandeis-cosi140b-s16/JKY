Excellent! The service was great! Go out of the norm and try their arepas, elote loco, house made special tea. Simply delicious. The fresh made salsa for chips was no where close to regular salsa. They have some unique salsa, for e.g. Guacomole salsa - who would think guacomole, cucumber and cilantro will taste so awesome together. A must go place if you are in charlotte uptown
