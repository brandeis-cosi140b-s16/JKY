Being a native Southern Californian living in North Carolina, I miss Mexican food like mad; taco shops on every corner, bomb Cali burritos and carne asada fries. There's good Mexican food here in Charlotte, but it's just not the same. This place, while different from my San Diego joints, is really good. This isn't health food though, so don't go if you're picky about that. There's no seating to speak of, so plan on taking it to go or having a picnic. An intimate setting, colorful paint scheme, and a fairly small, but delicious, menu give this place a lot of character. The staff was super nice too. Mexican food, and burritos in particular, are my passion and if you're anything like me, and looking for just straight up good Mexican that has you licking your fingers afterwards, give this place a try.
