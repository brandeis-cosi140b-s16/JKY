I love this place! They have the BEST happy hour! Everyday! 

The first time I went to Sir Veza's was in the Tucson location and it was just the worst experience ever. I've also been to the one at the Phoenix airport to grab a drink from time to time. So when this location opened I was hesitant to try it out and I'm so glad I did anyway!  I've tried so many items on their menu!

The sonoran dog is really good. It's a bacon wrapped hot dog, with beans, salsa, tomato, and it comes with fries. I've also had their Johnny Vegas which is really good. The cilantro cream cheese that comes with it is delicious. Now if you ever order their burrito bowls, make sure you are REALLY hungry because this thing is huge! I got the Go Shaker Chimi and couldn't even eat half of it. 

Their margaritas are also really good! and are usually on happy hour. I recommend the strawberry one on the rocks, Get the 14 bomb! 

The customer service has always been good. I love their outdoor patio. It is also dog friendly. (I've taken my little monster with me) And it even has a photobooth! What more can you ask for!
