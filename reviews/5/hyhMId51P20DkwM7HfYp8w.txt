I have to update to add the extra star for the great customer service I had at the most recent trip to The Stand.  We were greeted with enthusiasm and excitement, personable and friendly... Top notch for staff!  The food was de-lish and fantastic as usual.  I had the chocolate milkshake...seriously, AMAZING.  They've also worked on their speediness for to-go orders! I'll definitely be thinking of this place when i want a quick, higher-quality-than-Wendy's burgers!
