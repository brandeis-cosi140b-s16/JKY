I can't believe I have never reviewed or checked in here before. We go all the time and its boyfriends favorite burrito place.

I always get the adobada and he gets a variety of things including the rolled tacos which are always good. The breakfast burritos are great too.

The people are always super fast and nice and its cheap!
