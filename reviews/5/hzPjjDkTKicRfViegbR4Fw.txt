Just LoVE the decor!  Very quaint and so much nicer than the typical Mexican food places in the valley.  I ordered the Green Chili Enchilada and it was FANtAStiC!!  Took several empanadas home.  Some of my favorites were Beef and olive, Hawaiian and spinach corn.  I have also tried the corn chowder and the mole enchilada, both of which I loved as well.  Try Corn Flower!
