La Comida is fabulous!  We stumbled upon this restaurant on our recent Vegas visit and had a delightful experience.  

First, if you have a chance to have Frank as your server, you're' in for a real treat - he's incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, not only about everything on the menu, but also about the wide array of tequilas they offer.

The atmosphere is charming - one of those places that feels good just being there and, even when it began to fill up, it didn't seem overly noisy.  We began with a tequila tasting flight, which, if you enjoy sipping tequila, this is definitely the way to go to enjoy a blanco, repasado and anejo. The food was delish!  My Sweetie had the Pollo al Horno - a large, flavorful & moist breast of chicken cooked in a banana leaf and I had the Enchilada de Pollo w/a delicious mole poblano sauce.  Very generous portions, so no room for dessert.

We'll definitely be back and will recommend to any of our friends/family traveling to Vegas.  It's worth the stop...more than once!
