I really enjoyed my visit to Mexx 32. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Tessa was our server and she was excellent. Chico is another server, who is a great friend of mine, referred me to the place. He stopped by our table to help w/ recommendations. Guacamole w/ pomegranate seeds was tasty. My gf and I share the Mexx 32 chopped salad w- carne Asada. It came with a fresh basil buttermilk dressing that I loved. Also ordered 3 taco plate w/ 3 different selections. A smoked pork, battered cod and mushroom chipotle w/ creamy rice and black beans. Best flavors I've had in awhile! I will be back for more. Thank you!
