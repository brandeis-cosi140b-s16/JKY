Las Palmas is the platonic ideal of the ultimate mexican taco stand.  I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:

1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat

2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!

4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!

10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!

7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!
