I have been frequenting this place lately for lunch and it is even better than before. I love the amount of food you can get. I went from the Chicken Burrito on Wheat Tortilla to a Salad with Chicken. I go for the corn, black beans, fajitas, brown rice, chicken, pico, cheese, guacamole, green salsa, and cabbage. Top it off with a water cup. 

Healthy and delicious. And very quick service. There is another place I will not name on the opposite side of the building that takes a very long time to order and get your food. This place is a great alternative!
