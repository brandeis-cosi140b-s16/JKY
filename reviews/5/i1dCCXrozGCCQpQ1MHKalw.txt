I have to say, I'm a little baffled by the one-star rating for Queso Good.  I had an excellent experience!  The gentleman who took my order was friendly and helpful, and there were so many delicious options to choose from!  I decided on the Toro Verde because I'm a sucker for all things green chile.  My order was ready in five minutes, max.  The quesadilla is a great value.  The portion is huge and you get a side of chips.  It was cheesy and had a perfect amount of shredded beef.  Oh, and it was delicious!  The salsa verde was wonderful too....I'm glad I grabbed two cups!  They definitely earned five stars. :)
