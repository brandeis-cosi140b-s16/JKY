Su casa es Mi casa! Walked in yesterday looking for some take out tamales. I was greeted by a very polite and knowledgeable person who walked me through all their various varieties of Tamales. I am old school as I am from New Mexico where the standard of Mexican food is very high. I grew up with fresh food at home and the food I took out of this restaurant brought back memories of my childhood. It was truly a great and exciting time for me as I have a very hard time with all the yuppy food others are trying to pass off as genuine. THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL DEAL. I will recommend them to all my friends and hopefully they will stay afloat long enough to become one of my favorite haunts. 

If you can read this review, THANK YOU for such a wonderful experience...you will be seeing me again soon. I will be looking at your beans and enchiladas next time and will be dining in.
