Wowwwww what a great idea!!!! This little Shop is really new and still renovating outside.  This is the sister company of soho Japanese restaurant, and being a fan of that restaurant, I had to try this one. 

It's the concept of burrito mixed with Japanese ingredients... And omg it's so good!! 

They have some popular burritos already built with certain ingredients, or you could choose to build your own. Since it's my first time here, I decided to get one of the popular ones.  My boyfriend and I had the Redondo and Rockport.  You can pick your wrapping with seaweed, soy paper, wheat tortilla or flour tortilla.  We both got seaweed since that was the most popular. 

Redondo was really good with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, Masago, jalapeño, Onion, tortilla strips.  They were so good together, the sashimi were so fresh! 

The Rockport had spicy tuna, crab, soft shell crab, jalapeño, onion. 

Both were just super yummy, and we got a side of home made taro chips.  It comes with cheese for dipping, but it totally hides the flavour, it tastes the best with nothing because it is seasoned.  

They definitely need to get one of these restaurants in Toronto!!! We went during lunch, and it was pretty busy, like a subway, with 4 people dressing the burritos, and one cashier! Can't wait to come back to Vegas and try another jaburrito!!!
