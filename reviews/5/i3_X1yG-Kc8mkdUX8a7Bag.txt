I'm a big fan of Planet Hollywood.  The ambiance is pretty nice and the staff is friendly.

YOLOS is conveniently located adjacent to the entrance and the casino floor.  I ordered three bottled Miller Lites, which were delicious as always.  The bartender was an attentive hottie wearing a black tank top and yoga pants.  So I've got no complaints there.

My friends and I, who were killing time before the BRITNEY show chatted with a couple of young ladies at the bar who were also seeing BRITNEY that night.

All in all - this is a nice place with good energy :-)
