Hidden Gem! Stopped in for a quick snack before church and it was sooo delicious!! The outside looks like it's actually closed... But don't let that stop you. When my husband walked in, he said "Now this is an authentic Mexican restaurant." He felt like he was in Ensenada! We bought about three burritos and it came $12. You can't get that price anywhere! We got the bacon-potato and the Green Burrito! That Green Chole Burrito is awesome! My favorite!!! Sooo tasty!! And the tortillas are so light and buttery. We ate it all!!!
