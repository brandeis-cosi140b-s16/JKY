Back at El Dorado cantina again for Father's Day this time and it was awesome as usual. Sean is the manager we ask for every time and he was working thank god. He always makes sure we get the VIP treatment. The server Rorac was great too , it was our first time with him and he was solid. Did the Carne Asada plate and a couple of different burritos ( try the new shrimp burrito recommended by Sean). It's the bomb. I can't say enough good things about this place or the staff and Manager. Will be back every time I'm in Vegas, and that's a lot becouse my parents live in Henderson .Oh yeah it's all organic and GMO free, can't be beat.
