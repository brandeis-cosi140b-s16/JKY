I have made two trips to this restaurant. The first visit was at about 4:30 in the afternoon and although the service was FANTASTIC, the food was good, but nothing memorable. However, we decided to go back for a family member's birthday party and this time the food was AMAZING. Also the views of the entire valley at nighttime are to die for. However, I will agree that later in the evening, customers are packed in there like sardines. However, the coma you will be put in by the most authentic tortillas I've had this side of the border will make you forget about everyone around you. Can't wait to get back to Lindo Michoacan!
