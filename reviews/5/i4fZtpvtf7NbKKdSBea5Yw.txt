Chipotle is one of my ultimate guilty pleasures. Each burrito, weighs in at approximately 900 calories. I feel like I have to run a marathon just to burn that thing off. 

I've been to both the UNLV and Lake Mead locations and at both places, the employees assemble the burritos at super-sonic speeds, with the precision of surgeons. They know just the right proportions to give. I mean, they have assembly down to a science. 

At the UNLV location, I've seen the line go out the door, but don't be discouraged, they move that thing along like the Matterhorn line at Disneyland. 

Okay, am I the only one that notices this? When you mix tomatoes and sour cream, it makes this awesome dressing. And the sour cream at Chipotle is really runny, so it mixes instantly. I feel like when I eat their burritos, there's a party in my mouth. 

And I rarely eat meat because of ethical reasons, but their vegetarian burritos are tha shit. I don't even feel like I'm missing out. 

Bonus. Their pork is free-range and all that good stuff, which actually takes care of those ethics issues. So sometimes I indulge in a fatty pig burrito (carnitas). 

My boyfriend swears by the Barbacoa fajitas burrito. He can inhale Chipotle burritos in one sitting, but it normally takes me two. 

Susan R is right, though. Its Subway meets Americanized Mexican food. I mean, come on ... they're owned by McDonald's.
