This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Madison area.  Attentive and quick service, great food, and good drinks.  Get the Burrito Monterey with the arbol sauce on top.  It's great if you enjoy spicy food that you don't need to douse in hot sauce.  My fiance and I always sit in the bar and get great service from the bartender Juan, as well as other staff.
