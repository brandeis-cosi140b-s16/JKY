Best restaurant experience I have ever had, and I've been to some really amazing ones all around the world. Our server Jammar was the biggest reason for this. He really broke down and explained everything you needed to know about The Mission. From the restaurants history, to the chef, to the food. He was totally on point with all his recommendations and knew exactly when we would want our next course. We started off with the table-side guacamole that was by far the best guac you could possibly ever have. In addition to that Jammar also recommended street corn dip which really balanced the heat of our guacamole. For dinner we had the pork shoulder tacos which were melt in you mouth good. Finally, for desert Jammar brought us their pumpkin bread pudding. Best dessert I've had in awhile.  It was truly an incredible dinning experience.
