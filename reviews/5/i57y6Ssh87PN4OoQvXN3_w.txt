My hubby and I always loved bike riding over to Chuy's and now love CC's.  The chicken strips were better, the french fries were better, the california tacos - the chicken was absolutely awesome but could have used a little more of the special sauce.  I missed the Chuy's BBQ sauce, and the salsa was really good, yet just a little heavy on the onion.  Can't wait to go back for cocktails as the liquor on hand was impressive!

Update:  Order the tamale plate!  It is incredible!!!  Super moist tamale, incredible flavor, I think I had pork and had it with green sauce.
