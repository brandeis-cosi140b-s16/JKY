A disclaimer: I worship this place. I made sure it was the last (New) Mexican food I had before leaving the southwest for several months. The South Mountain location is better (because the kitsch factor is higher, and they *really* don't hold back on the heat there... or the booze), but this is still a home run.

I'v eaten here more times than I can count. If you're not into spice, there are a few things on the menu, but you're missing the magical dishes and I'd recommend going somewhere a bit more... mild. As someone who has an unhealthy love for spicy... It's adovada at its apex. Terrific tamales. Salsa that leaves you longing for its bite. Love.

And the margaritas and sangria are deadly strong. If you care about such things.
