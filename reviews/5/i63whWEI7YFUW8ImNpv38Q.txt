Was out and about wanting to just have a beer with a friend on a Friday night and came about Chi Chi's Tacos right outside Lost Leaf on 5th. Man oh MAN are they good!! Had one of each and the Sweet Potato Tacos are to die for!!! If I weren't watching my girlish figure I'd of eaten 10!
If you see Chi Chi's Tacos STOP and try them out, you'll be glad you did!!!
