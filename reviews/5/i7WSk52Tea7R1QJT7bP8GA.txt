Plaza Bonita is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to. My wife and I have been coming here since they opened and we have never been disappointed. They all but know our names and the staff treats us like family from the moment they see us approaching the front doors. The ambiance feels authentic, the servers are incredibly friendly and of course the most important, the food is great!

Some of our favorite dishes are the crunchy chicken tacos which are clearly made from fresh tortillas, not store bought factory made garbage. The chimichanga is fantastic if you want a larger portioned meal. My wife either gets the tortilla soup with a side of flower tortillas or the seafood enchiladas. Everything we have ever tasted has never disappointed. Also, if you are into spicy, you must request the salsa verde(green salsa) which is to die for. I have often times asked for some to go for different occasions. Go check it out, you will not be disappointed!
