Ate here for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed our meal! We sat outside on the patio and it was a beautiful evening. Joshua gave us excellent service and the meal was delicious! I had the Farmer's Burrito which was good and my husband had the Chile Relle√±o dinner which I am going to order next time :). We shared the margarita flight which was a fun way to try the different margaritas. We will definitely be going back!
