We have always had the best service at this location!! One person in particular has helped us out on a couple occasions and has always gone above and beyond. His name is Triston. Talk about awesome customer service! This kid should own the place some day! The food is always good and if they do not have something, they have always suggested other items or sauces etc that would compliment the food. I have never felt rushed and Triston has left a lasting impressing on us that we wanted to be sure we point out what an excellent job he does!
