I thought the menu, though limited, looked stupidly awesome! Had the ahi ceviche which was very good, served with plantain chips. Street tacos are great, too. Don't usually go veggie, but this veg taco was extremely good. Chatted with mgr about future plans and look forward to watching this place grow!
