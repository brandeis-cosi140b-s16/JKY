I love going to La Unica. The service is great, and the food is better. They offer a pretty typical mexican restaurant menu, but the food is MUCH better than your typical cheap mexican eatery. 

Free Chips and Salsa when you are seated, and service is always fast and friendly. Lunch is always quite busy, so you might have to wait for a seat. (Large crowd just shows you that the food is that good!). Due to the lunch rush, they do require that your whole party be there when you are seated.
