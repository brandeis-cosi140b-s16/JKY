Awesome place. The food and drinks were great. The staff was very friendly and helpful when selecting things on the menu. As an out of towner, it was really nice to stumble in on a place where it seems they have a regular clientele and know what they're doing to accommodate their patrons. If I'm ever in town again, I will definitely return.
