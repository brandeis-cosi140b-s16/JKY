My fiancee and I come here often, we just love this place!  They have really good complimentary chips, salsa, and bean dip.  Also have some very decent lunch specials available Monday-Saturday.  

Tonight was our first time coming for dinner in a long time.  Monday night, we figured it wouldn't be too crowded, and we had a coupon we got from being in the rewards club (you should sign up too).  There was a short wait after coming inside, but we were promptly seated.  I thought there might be a lot of noisy children, but we were seated in the bar area so it was the perfect quiet date night.  

As I said, we had coupons for $1 off the 2 Enchilada meal with Rice and Beans.  My fiancee got machaca and ground beef.  He is very picky about his food, but he enjoyed it.  I loved my veggie enchiladas!  We were too stuffed to order dessert.  Will most certainly be back, we both really love this place.
