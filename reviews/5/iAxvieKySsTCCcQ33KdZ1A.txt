We loved Tortilla fish!! I been there twice.  The service is excellent and fast. The place look very clean all the time. The food is amazing I tried the fish machaca taco, and my husband had the fish and shrimp. We both loved them all. The topping are fresh and different from other fish taco places. I also had the shrimp garden salad and is made with very fresh ingredients. Go and try this awesome pace!!!
