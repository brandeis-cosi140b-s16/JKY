I've found my new home! If your like me and you are drawn to places that are a mix of color, character, funk and a touch of danger, this is the place! 
I've driven by numerous times, I didn't even know if was a sit down restaurant, because I always say a line of people ordering from the takeout window at the front. Craving some good mex food, I was going to hit up one of my regular places, but decided to try somewhere real close, and ponchos came up.. Walked past the line of large parties waiting to get in, they had some tables for one in the back. I walked past a very eclectic mix of people, bikers, couples, tourists, and what seemed to be a lot of regulars. The atmosphere, decor, smells and sounds transport me to a place of sheer happiness.
The Food: I probably could have been served a tv dinner and still loved this place... Chips and a full bottle of salsa appeared seconds after I sat down. It took me 4 bites to decide that I liked the peppery salsa, but by the end of my meal, only a half inch remained, I realize this may be something I will crave if I ever have to go more than a few weeks without. 
For my main, I chose the pollo fundido, as it seems that is the go to dish here. It really was fantastic. Not complicated, greasy, or light, just simply delicious! 
For a beverage, I had a small margarita, which had no price, listed. When info the bill it was only $4.00 which was a nice surprise. 
After cleaning my plate, I just wanted to sit back and enjoy the vibe, listen to the ranchero music, and pretend I was an actor in a Tarantino/Rodriguez movie. 
So if your in town on a smoldering saturday night, you'll likely find me here indulging a neon green bowl o happiness and an empty bottle of salsa.
