My thoughts are only on the Barbacoa, it's the only thing I eat here.  I LOVE IT!!  It's spicier than some of the other options.  I get extra rice, double tortilla and the hotter green salsa.  This is one you craze if you don't get it enough.  :)  The barbacoa may not be your favorite but there are lots of other options, my husband like the burrito bowls with chicken and guac, etc...  It's like a subway for Burritos  enjoy.
