Ok, this is the best of the fast burrito joints around town. You know, all those berto places, this beats them hands down. If you live in or around Old Town, you need to get yourself a late night burrito from this place pronto. Although, if you don't know about it yet, I'm not really sure I can get on board with your life choices thus far. Who are you?
