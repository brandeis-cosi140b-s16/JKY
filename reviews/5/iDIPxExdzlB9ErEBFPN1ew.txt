Thanks yelpers for reviewing this place. We stopped here on our way from SF to Miami as we had to try native Arizonan food.

What a place. The description of the other yelpers is true, it's kind of bare and all, but the food, the food. Wow.

I had the Native Taco with shredded beef. I'm not quite sure how you eat this? Folded up with your hands? It was too big for this for me, so I picked at it using my fork and tore off bits of the delicious fry bread.

My wife had the Green Chile Steak fry bread. While mine was excellent, this seems to be their true star. I have never tried such delicious stewed beef before. I don't know how they do it, it is just so good.

You get a lot of food for not too much money. While the restaurant probably seems out of the way for most people, I would definitely recommend going there. It wasn't too far away from I10.
