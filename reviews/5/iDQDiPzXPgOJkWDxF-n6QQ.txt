I work across the street and have been waiting for a good place to eat nearby and finally I have what I wanted. Pollo Picante is not just good it's Great! Before you even walk in the door you begin to smell the amazing chicken on the grill. The menu is simple, bbq grilled chicken and a few different sides. They serve some of the best chicken I have ever had. The owner has a passion about what he does and his recipe is great! 

The place is extremely clean. The staff is very nice and friendly. The prices are a great value. I'm a loyal customer already. Everyone should try this place!
