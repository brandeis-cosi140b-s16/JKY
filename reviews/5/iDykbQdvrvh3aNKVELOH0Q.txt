Have been wanting to get to The Revival since it's opening and finally made it in for dinner last weekend. We had made a reservation, were greeted by a friendly host and seated right away. Our server was attentive, pleasant and helpful. The decor of what looks like reclaimed barn wood, the copper topped tables, the lighting, all gave a comfortable feel to the setting.

The list of wines by the glass is extensive and reasonably priced-hubby and I each tried two different selections. Can't remember the names, but really enjoyed the Ros√® and and the red blend.

We started with the scallop appetizer. Perfectly seared, melt in your mouth delicious. And, hello, deep fried avocado-yum!

Hubby had the salmon and I the braised short rib. Both so well prepared, beautifully plated, and many a step up in the flavor department. We would have loved just a little larger portions, simply to prolong the goodness!

The Revival is a keeper, I'll be back for more!
