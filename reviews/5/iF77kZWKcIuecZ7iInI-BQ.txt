Best mexican around! Food always made fresh to order . I usually get the family favorite Chile colorado which is stewed/simmered to delicious perfection! Comes with 2 corn or flour tortillas which are huge. Next time I should just get the burrito since I can do without the beans and it'll be rolled for me. :)
