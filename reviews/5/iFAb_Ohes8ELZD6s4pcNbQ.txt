Went here last week. This place is amazing. First off, it's very clean and everyone was really nice. Second, the prices were very good. And third, the food was authentic! Amazing dishes. I had chicken enchiladas with rice, beans and a salad. Loved the sauce. Reminded me I grandmas cooking. Maria our server was really nice and fast. And of course like every good Mexican restaurant, the chips and salsa were on point! Definitely going back again.
