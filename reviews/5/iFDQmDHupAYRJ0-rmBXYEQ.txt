I came here on a Sunday for lunch with the bf and thought this place was awesome, especially since the reason I came here was due to a travelzoo coupon, $20 for 2 ppl; 2 aguas frescas, 2 entree's, and a dessert. 

Love that this place gives free chips and dip, not to mention how yummy the (i think) banana or could be plantain chips were w/ the mango salsa. 

DRINKS: I got a beer and was upset that they didn't have anything on draft and the only bottles beer that I ordered was out, so I had to settle for something else. I think they could have stocked this place better, but then again, it was a Sunday lunch day... perhaps they were in the process of ordering more. With our voiuchers we each ordered a aguas frescas, I thought the sweeter pineapple definitely triumphed the orange, but both were really good. The orange was a bit more watery.  

ENTREE'S: First entree was the Teberna's steak tacos, which I thought the meat was cooked to perfection and the flour tortilla was delish. However, I didn't care for the rice and beans too much. The second entree, the shrimp salad had large meaty shrimps that were juicy and grilled w/ a yummy seasoning. the sald part, could have used more dressing or a dressing with more flavor. 

DESSERT: We shared the flan. To be honest, I'm not a big fan of flan to begin with, but I can definitely eat a nice soft flan, so that was what I was hoping for. Instead, this flan, definitely tasted of flan but had more of a cheescake texture, thick and creamy. It was good, but even with both of us sharing it, we weren't even able to finish this rich dessert.  

All in all, I give this place a 4-star for food, but with my coupon have bumped them up to a 5-star. How can you beat all that for $20?
