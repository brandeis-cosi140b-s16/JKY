By far THE BEST PLACE to eat in Phoenix!  The food paired with the atmosphere is completely SPOT ON when it comes to southwestern comfort food!  I've had the opportunity to come to Dick's only on a couple of occasions since I live out of state but it has now become my must-go-to-spot when I fly into town, even going so far as to adjust my flight schedule to accommodate my craving.

All I will say is SMOKED PORK!  OMG...it's like sensory overload when it comes the pork paired with the hollandaise sauce on the benedict and then you add the beans and potatoes, it's quite possibly the best breakfast on the planet!

Know before you go:

It's called "Hideaway" for a reason...it's virtually impossible to find.  Look for the hardware store and the door will be to the left.  There is no sign.

It's always crowded so be ready to sit at a community table if there is no room in the bar.  It may seem awkward but you can meet some interesting folks AND you have a great view of the fireplace with just a slight sent of mesquite.

Their Bloody Mary's are BOMB-diggity served with a shot of beer which I like to pour in.  Great hangover remedy!

They open early at 7am to accommodate my early arrival flights!  Booya!

Kids are not recommended and they're not afraid to tell you.
