We found this place by doing a Yelp search for 5 stars and $.  Wow. This place is THE place to go if you're in the Vegas area. Super yum.  We had the fusion tacos and they were insanely yummy.  The guac and chips were fantastic as well as the house made hot sauce.  The service was great too.  Love it.  Will be back when we visit Vegas again. Oh, and we loved the little sliced orange at the end!
