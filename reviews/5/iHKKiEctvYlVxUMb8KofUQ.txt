We went here on a Friday night in late January. What a wonderful highlight to our Vegas weekend.  We were there for Happy Hour...great service, amazing food and perfect cheap prices!  The waitress even let us preordered our next drinks before Happy Hour expired...and delivered when we were ready for another.
