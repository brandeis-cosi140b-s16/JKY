When you're craving good Mexican food, this place is it! Their no frills menu looks something straight out from those authentic hole-in-the-wall places I frequent whenever in Mexico City. I usually do my test with the basic: if you have good guacamole then I can only look forward for a delicious meal. Jarochos also serves one of the best tasting camarones (shrimp) burrito in town--their burrito is crammed with beautifully cooked shrimp that you can taste with every single bite (no skimping there!) and mixed in with rice and pico de gallo. Get a side of roasted peppers and you should be set! Other dishes we've tried and loved includes their tacos de tripas--simply tasty and worth trying if you haven't already and also their empanadas which come filled in your choice of succulent shrimp, chicken, or cheese (I recommend trying all since they are small enough). Los Jarochos is truly a gem of Las Vegas, good food and good service at a fair price!
