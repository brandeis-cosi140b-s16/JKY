What a great find.  Best tortillas in Pittsburgh - my fiance and I were beginning to despair of ever finding 12-inch flour tortillas to make burritos (which we like to do way more often than our arteries appreciate), when a fortuitous series of events pointed us to Reyna's.  The cooler near the front of the store had plenty of 12" tortillas of varying types, and some smaller flour tortillas, but none of the kind we wanted!  I asked one of the employees if they had any 12" flour tortillas, and he led us to the back, where he opened up a large box, pulled out two packages of exactly the kind of tortilla we wanted, and said, "How many do you want?"  

Now, that's my kinda place.

We proceeded to grab everything we'd need to make burritos that night, short of the chicken we already had at home.  And then, for good measure, we got a jar of roasted green chiles for another night's chile verde, and some pineapple-and-chili-pepper lollipops, because, where else in this city have we seen those???  I can't wait to try out the taco stand one of these days.

Reyna Foods is a quintessential Mexican grocery.  Hie thee hence for all your Mexican grocery needs.
