Visited Scottsdale for Spring Training and found good reviews for this place on yelp. It's upscale Mexican fare was delicious. I had the cornmeal crusted mahi mahi and my boyfriend has the pork tenderloin. Both were well cooked and flavorful. Atmosphere and decor were cool. Trendy scene for groups, yet still romantic for couples. The food took a long time but the waiter kept apologizing. Extra credit for the funky restaurant name!
