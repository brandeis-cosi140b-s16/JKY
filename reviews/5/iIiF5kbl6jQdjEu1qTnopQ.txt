Great food, I had the 3 taco, Cilantro & Lime Rice, with black beans. It was VERY good! My uncle had the Enchiladas dish with beans & rice which he liked very much! We were seated right along the Canal which was great too! We also happen to catch "Happy Hour" and got $5 Margarita's which how couldn't you love that!?!? The prices were great it's a must try!!
