My husband had scouted this place out and we remember it as "the old Firefly". One thing that reels us in is Happy Hour - and a late one at that. The late night Happy Hour is especially great because it's a great pitstop after being on the Strip. It's 11-2 AM every day. 

The food is amazing. I find it to have flavors way better than any other taco I have ever tasted. The service was also great - your drinks and water are always getting filled and multiple people come by to check on you. The tacos are $2 each and we tried most all of them on the Happy Hour Menu. 

We especially loved the Al Pastor and Puerco Verde tacos. The Al Pastor has pineapple in it and that's what gives it such a bright and great taste. They also give you a starter plate of chips and salsa - also very fresh tasting.

We went back to the restaurant a few days later during their afternoon Happy Hour from 3-6 PM daily and again, it was equally as good, both food and service. We were checked on multiple times and never had to ask for anything. 

The very next day, we told our friend that we had to take them to try Happy Hour. So yes, three times in one week. I am happy to say that we are so far 3 out of 3 in food and service. Amazing all the way around and I can't wait to go back. It's refreshing to have a Happy Hour that has really really good menu items at such a reasonable price. Three tacos and I'm full - at most four tacos. 

The last time I was there - also tried the Churros. Delish!!!
