This is another great dining establishment in Madison.  I was here for a quick dinner with friends before a Badger's hockey game recently.  The menu was big, and the prices were reasonable.

I had combo with a chicken burrito and taco.  They were cooked well, and very flavorful.

One of the great things was how quickly everything came out.  The service was fast and friendly.  Will definitely stop back and I highly recommend.
