There is too much to say but I am so full I have to take a nap this place was great service cute sweet waitresses food was plentiful servings are large u get more than what u pay for on quality and quantity I'm a truck driver so I see a lot of restaurants and I have had 1 other restaurant that was this good and it was on the border of Texas and I could walk behind the restaurant and be in Mexico and this has to be my number 2 spot. My final words are DO NOT PASS THIS PLACE UP TRY IT EAT AND U WILL LOVE IT
