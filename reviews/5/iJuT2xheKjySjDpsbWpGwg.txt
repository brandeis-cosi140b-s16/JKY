fast, friendly, cost effective, get it right, close to the office and never has a long line.. I cant say anything better about Del Taco. I come here to pick up taco packs for the office and a few tacos for the hubs when he cant leave the office. It's priced very well and I can drive off with a lot of food for under $5 for 3 people.. I cant cook for less that that!
