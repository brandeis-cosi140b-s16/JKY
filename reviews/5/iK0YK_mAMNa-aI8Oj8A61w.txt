I've been coming to this little spot for years now!! Its fantastic!! The secret is Taco Thursday! My family and I often make our way in on Thursdays for there taco special!

Dollar tacos and dollar house margaritas!! I mean how can you beat that?! For this special you get to choose between 3 taco options... Carne asada (my favorite) Beef Taco (only one that comes on a crispy shell) and the Fish taco (Yummmm). The margaritas are small but powerful! if you want something on the healthier side go for the fish taco with no tortilla its still awesome because the fish is always fresh! 

The nice cute as a button ladies (all of them are wonderful) greet you with a smile and as soon as you sit down they bring over some chips and salsa but my favorite part is the AMAZING bean dip! ooooooh soooo good I could drink it! The cheese crisps are also to die for they come with green chilies (not spicy) so they give it a little something extra (sooo delish).

Another must try is there Tortilla Soup! Its hearty and full of think chunks of veggies including avocado! Great for someone who's not feeling so great (a touch of nani's cooking does the body good!!)  

Cecilia is they most amazing server ever and I'm pretty sure my family would adopt her (basically has) if they could! She is seriously amazing its come to the point where we don't even have to tell her want we want to eat because she knows our order like the back of her hand! Shes always aware of whats going on in the entire restaurant and is always on her A-game!!!  We love our Cici!
