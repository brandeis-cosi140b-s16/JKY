Since I've lived on the east coast my entire life until I moved here 2 weeks ago, this is the first time I've ever tried a Rubio's. I have to say this place is way better than Chipotle, Taco Bell, or any of the other chain Mexican places. I ordered the Coastal Trio, which came with a shrimp taco, original fish taco, and a tilapia taco. Shrimp was my favorite as the shrimp was tender, fresh, and not rubbery at all. The fish in the original fish taco was crunchy on the outside, and soft and flaky on the inside. I loved the contrast in textures there. Also, the girl at the front register was an absolute sweetheart. I claimed my free birthday meal and she didn't even charge tax. On top of that, she gave me a free fountain drink on the house! This is now one of my favorite fast food joints and will come back for sure.
