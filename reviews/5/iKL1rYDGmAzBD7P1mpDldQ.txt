At first glance it does not look like much, but looks are deceiving. This is straight up authentic Mexican food. 
Pure awesomeness in my mouth! 

We were the only people in here, and I was a little hesitant at first. Then, the food came out! It was awesome. 

There are a 3 signs when I go to a Mexican restaurant that I look for----I'll Tell you them:
1.It has to have real Mexican cheese of some sort. Chihuahua Cheese is my fav.
2. I need to see Verde----like truly good tasting tomitillo homeade sauce.
3. I need a Steak Taco! A good flank steak taco can not be beat.

This place knocked them out of the park! 

Also they brought a nice mixed Mexican veggie bowl that I really did appreciate. It was fresh cactus along with a pico. Totally unexpected and awesome. 

To really push my in love with this place, I was handed a free piece of cake on my walk out the door filled with fresh strawberries! I almost gave the waitress a hug I was so excited!

Great true Mexican food in Madison!
