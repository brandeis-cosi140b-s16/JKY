This has become an regular stop for me.  Their carnitas are worth a try if you like it.  Their is juicy, with a nice crunch.  Comes with rice/beans and fresh tomatoes/red onion/guac for toppings and your choice of tortillas.  Always way more food than I could eat - and make a great leftover.

The staff is there to please.  When we were there last time I overheard a young guy at the table next to us thanking his friend for bringing him because "that was an excellent Mexican meal".
