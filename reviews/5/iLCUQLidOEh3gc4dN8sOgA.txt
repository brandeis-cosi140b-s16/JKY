Really happy we stopped in here. The salsa is excellent, multiple layers of flavor with smokey overtones. I am used to enchiladas served the midwestern way, and did not like the difference. Our server took it back and replaced it with an awesome veggie burrito.

We were not going to have margaritas having been out in the sun all day, but glad we changed our minds. They are delicious and flavorful, tasting like they were made with fresh lime juice instead of some mix.

My friend loved his chicken flautas, remarking on the filling, not just chicken but an array beans, peas, carrots and TENDER chicken.  The refried beans have flavor and the rice cooked and seasoned just right.

Don''t drive by this place ... give it a try!
