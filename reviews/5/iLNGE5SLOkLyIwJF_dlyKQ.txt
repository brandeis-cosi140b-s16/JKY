My second visit to this little hidden mexican food outlet within a mall.  This time I ordered the  Carne asada burrito.  Beef, rice beans, pico, guaq, mild salsa, garnished with some fresh squeezed lime for each bite.  All I have to say is WTF, why is this place in a mall.  The food is awesome.  From what I have ordered there has always been a balance of fresh flavors.  You guys rock, I will return to try more items on the menu.
