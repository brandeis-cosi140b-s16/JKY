Owners are very nice and they offer a good selection of meats. I wanted a nice, thick "hanger steak"  and all they had was pre-sliced arrachera. (It sells the most, so it would make sense that they pre-sliced it.) 

The butcher wasn't familiar with my request, but went out of his way, opened a new bag of meat and gave me the cut I was looking for, instead of brushing me off and saying he can't help me. Fry's or Food City wouldn't of done that for me, so that's why I buy my meats here.

They will also marinate your meat free of cost and sometimes have promotions where they throw in a bag of ice if you buy meat/beer.
