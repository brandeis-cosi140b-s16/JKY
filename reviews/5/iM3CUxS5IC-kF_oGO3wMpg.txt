I visted Tacos El Compita #2 afew months back and today I came in to check out their #1 shop. I must say I would prefer their #1(this shop) because it's more spacious. The other place was tiny and cramped. Just to add, both places had great service-- the workers were nice and friendly.

Despite my preference for spaciousness, the tacos at both places were crazy-good! Each taco was $1.05 and I ordered 4-- tongue (lengua), pulled pork (carnita), steak (carne asade), and marinated pork (pastor). All you need is to Squirt some lime for a hint of sourness and drizzle some extra smoked chipotle sauce on the tacos and it will be complete. All the tacos came out hot with generous amount of meat (see pics). The tongue was super soft, like butter in your mouth. The pulled pork and steak was my two least favorite-- not because it wasn't good, but bc if I had to chose and recommend, it will be the tongue and marinated pork. The marinated pork was super tender and tasty that if you look closely at the pork, you can actually see speck of spices!

Yummy in my tummy! Come here and get their lengua and pastor tacos at $1.05 each. Totally worth it!!!!
