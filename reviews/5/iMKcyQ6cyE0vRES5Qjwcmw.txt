To define a genuine Mexican street food is often to associate grease and fat over flavor, at least that's what I've been told by some of my dear Hispanic friends. This fast food joint elevates street comfort food to the next level, and by that, I mean favoring flavor over the mouthfeel of grease and fat.

First off, their seasoning and marinate on the cooked meat distract the tastebuds from the greasy aftertaste it leaves on the mouth, then reinforce them with the freshest vegies and tasty salsas, plus a sprinkle of lime, and there you have an explosion of flavor that makes me want to thank the Virgen de Guadalupe for being on the corner street a few blocks from where I go to church.

Lengua, lengua, lengua, try this taco and i'm telling you your tongue will be smiling in a magic carpet ride. The Soles can Chili Verde is a kickstart favorite too. For culinary delight in layers, I recommend the highly advertised Sonoran hotdogs, but please please don't eat it like you are in a hotdog eating contest - remember remember to satiate them in layers. Now to cap it off, wash all the goodness with their agua fresca, horchata or strawberry, is spot on delicioso.
