First time here  very good menu a little of everything. I had the #4 combo with a shredded chicken burrito with rice and beans. Yummy. :) very good flavor. It did not need salsa or anything. By the way the salsa was really good too. My friend had the mangos salad. It was loaded with avocado chicken lettuce tomato etc. nice size salad which she said was very good. Over all I would go again.  :)
