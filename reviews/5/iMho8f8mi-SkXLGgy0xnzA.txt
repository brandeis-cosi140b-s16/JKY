Amazing Mexican food. The service was fabulous as well. 

We started with the complimentary chips and salsa, along with guacamole and cheese dip. Our waiter brought the ingredients for the guacamole and prepared it right at our table. It was fresh and very tasty! The cheese dip was served in a skillet with veggies and seasoning mixed in.  I had never had cheese dip like that at a Mexican restaurant, and it was GOOD.

For our entrees, I had the Arroz con Pollo (chicken with veggies, rice, and cheese) and a cheese enchilada. My boyfriend had the super nachos with shredded beef. Both were very big portions, hot, and delicious. We can't wait to go back!
