Picked due to good Yelp reviews & 2 $$. We missed Chevys that closed down:( Looking for more simple Mexican food..FRESH being so important. We were greeted quickly, plenty of open seats on a Saturday night. Wow amazing fresh salsa A+ chips plus bean dip. We ordered a Chimi & chicken corn tacos w/ a side of black beans. Yeah..new favorite Mexican place! Plenty of food for your $ that is made w/ love. Fresh & tasty makes me happy!
