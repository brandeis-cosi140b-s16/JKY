I ordered a beef soft corn tortilla taco and a side of beans. I loved the chunky salsa. It had a little kick. The guacamole was very good and usually I'm very picky about how I want my guacamole. The food came fast. The restaurant was very nicely decorated and I liked the Mexican songs in the background. The customer service is great. The manager is very friendly. I would definitely come again.
