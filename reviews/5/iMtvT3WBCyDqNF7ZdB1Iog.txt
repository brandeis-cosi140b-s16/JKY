Hands down Best Traditional Mexican Food in town...
Highly recommened.
Can be pricey taking the whole familia...& you know mexicans..grandma, tia, tio by the time everyone orders your starving..
not to long before they bring you a small bowl of fideo (soup). Fresh tortillas, cold corona, sizzleing fajitas...
wow, im probably gonna go after work.
