Amazing taco place for those late night (or afternoon urges). Great flavors and sides to put on your plate as well. Only things I wasn't thrilled about  (and it's not really the vendors fault) was this homeless man behind me was swiping some of the cut up vegetables at the condiment station with his bare hands while he was waiting on his food. In sure it was a vary rare scenario (not many do this and it's a risk when getting food from a food truck) but worth mentioning since there are homeless that live in the area.
