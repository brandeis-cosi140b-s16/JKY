The only complaint that I have about America's is that I can't get enough Carne Asada.  It is wonderful.  I usually stay away from the beef in Mexican restaurants (especially "Taco Stands") fearing dog, cat, or other animals might have been harmed in the process.  The beef is outstanding.  For $20 bucks, two people can get a taco and burrito, chips and salsa, and 3 coronitas each.  Is there are better deal in town??

If you go to America's, make sure to try the Horchata and Iced Coffee blend.  It will blow your socks off.

To top it all off the staff is very courteous and nice.  The owner will pop his head out from time to time and make sure things are going well for you, and that you are enjoying your food.

All around a great experience, and one that should not be missed.
