This place is awesome, and I am deciding is my favorite Mexican food restaurant (restaurants-both locations are pretty much the same) in the Phoenix area. I have eaten here (and at the Glendale location) a total of 4 times, and each experience has left me wanting to come back. 

The salsa bar is the best I've experienced with an amazing variety of tastes, fresh ingredients, and mild to moderate spice. Order extra chips straight away if you love chips and salsa.

The food is outstanding-from their pibil to their arbol, to their beans and rice. They use very high quality fresh ingredients with KILLER flavor and spice. While there is a very strong Mexican feel to the restaurants (no gringo influence that I noticed-Thank you), there is also a modern feel to their menu. So I've started out with the more popular dishes/recipes, but I am excited to try out some of their other offerings that appear more modern.

Their margaritas (I've only had the house) are the best, period. End of sentence.

Finally, you should be aware that the physical spaces are pretty different. I'm going to guess the owners are young and without the resources to afford something more expensive. But don't be put off by the space. I love that they have more modern art, and the food more than makes up for any misgivings one might have about the space.

If you really love Amazing Mexican food, you must try this place. I can't imagine you will be disappointed.

PS, I don't think their prices are reasonable/not expensive.
