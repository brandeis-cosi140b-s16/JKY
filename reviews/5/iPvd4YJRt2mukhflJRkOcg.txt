Leticia's! Where have you been all my life? I have searched endlessly for a great Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. I was losing hope until Leticia's came along. This Mexican Cocina has got it going on! I love the vibe and decor of the restaurant. My first visit was on a Friday night and boy was it packed to the brim in there! The wait was about 40 minutes. If you come during prime time, be prepared to wait a while.

Complimentary chips and salsa are pretty good. I really like the chips. They're warm and super fresh. Vegetarians be warned! The bean dip has chorizo in it. My husband can't get enough of that bean dip. The chorizo gives it an unexpected sweet taste. 

The menu is hefty and prices are a little higher than you're average Mexican restaurant. I was ecstatic to learn that Leticia's had potato and cheese flautas ($13.98). Whhaaa! I'm all about that vegetarian flauta life! The entree comes with 3 flautas and a side of rice and beans. The flautas are topped with guacamole, pico, and authentic Mexican queso (the tasty white crumbly cheese). This entree is way too much food for me, but I do my best to eat all I can, savoring every bite!

The Mexican rice here is where it's at it. I am particularly picky when it comes to Mexican rice. The Mexican rice at Leticia's, however, reminds me of the rice my mom and grandma make. I get all nostalgic eating that stuff! 

Service could be better, but it's sufficient.  

In a nutshell:
Food: 5
Ambiance: 4
Service: 3-4

Of course I'll be back! This is the only legit Mexican restaurant I've come across in Vegas.
