Went there for a family breakfast on a Sunday, really packed but it's because the place is super good, we mostly had menudo and it was excellent, chips and salsa were really good as well, second time there my first time I had the parillada and it was also really good! This place had the reviews and just adding one more if you love Mexican food you will love this place!
