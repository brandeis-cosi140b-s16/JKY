I have heard whispers of this place for quite a while but am not one to rush out and let that bubble pop so easily. What a great place, no really. The people are genuinely nice the food smells, looks and is delicious, what they don't have in tangible ambiance they make up for in a feel good vibe. There's a couple of other gems in that same shopping center I must visit. Kudos for not disappointing me, to be honest I was trying not to set my hopes too high and you really made my day. Support this place! Visit often and tell a friend!
