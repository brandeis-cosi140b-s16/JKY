Big City Burrito is downstairs of Vista Del Sol, so right across the street from ASU on Apache Blvd, close to Rural.  I've been here twice.  The first time I ordered the vegetarian burrito.  It takes a little longer than having a meat burrito, because they cook that to order.  it took only about 5 minutes.  So the wait was not long at all.  There are many types of tortillas to choose from.  There is White, Spinach, Tomato-Chili, Wheat, and more! There are also two sizes, regular (which I think is 10 in) and super (which I think is 12 in).  Then you can choose what salsas you want in your burrito, black or pinto beans, rice, and guacamole and sour cream for an additional cost.  

The first time I had the vegetarian burrito, as I mentioned before.  It was very good.  I came around 9pm. (They are open really late). The food was very good and the service was great.  The girl who works there is a vegetarian, so she recommended me to try the potato burrito next time.  When I went in there today, it was a complete different staff.  The service was still good, just not as great as the first time.  I ended up ordering the potato burrito on the Tomato-Chile Tortilla, which was great.  I will definitely be coming back to this place. 

PROS:
Good food
Quick
Good Service
Reasonable Prices

CONS:
If you do not go to ASU, hard to find parking.
