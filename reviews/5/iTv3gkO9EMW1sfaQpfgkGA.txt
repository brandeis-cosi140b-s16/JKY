Went here for the first time on MLK and it exceeded my expectations. 
It's hidden behind the Tacos Mexico in the Chandler shopping center. I used to be a Las Islitas customer BC of their music, but their food is no good so I decided to try a new place.  I had a small shrimp cocktail and a taco gobernador n my husband had a shrimp ceviche tostada and a michelada. Micheladas were huge and only $5!!! Everything, including their salsa for their chips, which was authentic and spicy, was absolutely delicious. The waitress was awesome.  She took the time to treat us like people, not like another number in line.   I am definitely returning, although I will give my criticism: $10 for a small shrimp cocktail is a couple of dollars too much. I would say $7-8 is a fair price for that size. The shell they use for the taco tastes like something you would get at Taco Bell. Next time I go, I will request the taco on a real fried tortilla or a soft corn tortilla. Looks like they have a Juan Gabriel impersonator on Saturdays! Can't wait to go back!
