Rokerij is easily our favorite place to eat when we go to Phoenix! Family, friends, all ask when are we going to go here when we do our annual Arizona trip. Amazing food and drinks, with very generous sized portions and always a friendly staff. Can't go wrong with a lunch or dinner plate! We will come back here every year, as well as tell others how great this place is!
