Went to Mundos' on a Sat night when there were no performances at the Smith Center, so it was easy to get a table. Parking is a bit odd, wondered if I was in the right place, but it is just a short walk if you choose not to take advantage of the valet service.  

My friend and were not crazy hungry so we passed on the appetizers but next time I am getting the grilled Calamari. After some recommendations from our waitress, my friend got the Chilean Seabass,  said it was heaven on a plate, perfectly seasoned / steamed and the portion was just right. I decided to go with the Pork Tenderloin with a side Mexican risotto and was not disappointed.  Cooked perfectly, great flavor and portion size but I have to say the risotto was Awesome! I would go back just for that.  

Service was excellent, not overwhelming but there when you needed a refill or had questions. 

My only suggestion and this is being picky...  I wish the chips with the salsa would have been served warm. 

The prices are fair for the portion size and quality of food.  I will go back for sure!
