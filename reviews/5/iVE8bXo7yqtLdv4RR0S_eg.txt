We're back in Phoenix this weekend, ready for some good food and after seeing this place on Man vs. Food, we wanted to be bold and try the Big torta!  We ordered one to share and I still couldn't eat the whole thing.

The King Carlos V is the largest sandwich I've ever had, and the layer upon layers of food is endless.  There is breaded chicken, beef, ham, egg, cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce, mexican sausage, mozzarella and it goes on and on.  It is served with chips and by cutting it into smaller bites, I was able to tackle some of it, but eventually, I had to abandon the bun and just pick apart the layers.  I finally surrendered and quite altogether.  

The sandwich was really good, the different layers eaten together were good, however, it is just way too much.  There is a large menu with many other delicacies awaiting another visit.  Good service, very crowded, many locals!
