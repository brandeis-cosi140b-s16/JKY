This place is on THE list when I visit Vegas.
The food is AWESOME, make sure you try the Namesake-Molcajetes... Shrimp, chicken, beef, dip it in the juice...the Ceviche tostadas and chicken Kabobs are Bomb-Diggity! 
Wash all that goodness down with the Micheladas! 
Make sure you tell the owner that Johnny & the Homie from San Diego recommended it!
