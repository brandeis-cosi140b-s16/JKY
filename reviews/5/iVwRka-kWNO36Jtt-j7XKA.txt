When I moved to Dallas in 05, one of the first things I looked for upon my arrival was a Rubio's. Imagine my shock and total dismay to find out that the Big R had not migrated out here to the Big D yet...... 

So on a visit back to see the fam last week, I made multiple stops at Rubio's and stocked up on the magnificent fish tacos and the shrimp burritos. One of my friends asked me (on the third visit) if I had gotten sick of Rubio's yet....I looked at him like he was from another planet. Sick of Rubio's? Could he really be serious????  Besides the great food, reasonable prices and friendly staff, this fast food joint sells Corona beers...what more could one ask for?
