Wow! I headed to Mi Amigo's with a group of friends in search of amazing (and cheap) margaritas. What I found was a restaurant that serves up $2.50 margaritas (the "blue amigo") and has amazing food! You HAVE to try the Chile Relleno. Seriously. It was the best Mexican dish I've ever had! Definitely check this place out when in Phoenix!
