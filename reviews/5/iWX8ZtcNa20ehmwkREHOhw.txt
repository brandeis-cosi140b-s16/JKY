This is by FAR my fav place to get lunch when I was working in Chandler. I usually order a combo with 2 meats, jerk fried rice, black beans, and it comes with a delicious warm snickerdoodle cookie!! The portions are quite large. The staff is so friendly and if you call in for take out they prepare the food super quick! One time I forgot to call ahead and just stopped in on my lunch break, they were quite busy and said it would be a long wait to get my food but I told them I was on my lunch break at work and they rushed it for me!! :) absolutely love this place!! The food is great, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick affordable lunch!
