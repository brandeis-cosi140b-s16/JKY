I've eaten mexican in Chicago. I've eaten mexican in southern California. I've eaten mexican in Texas. I've eaten in Oaxaca mexico. This place is right up there. I'll admit the first time I went I was skeptical. It's way too small, and the chips and salsa leave something to be desired (but, seriously, who cares?). Once the food came I was absolutely convinced by the hype. The al pastor buritto was incredible. The flavors were authentic, the meat was moist and delicious, and everything about that burrito told me that this place was a winner. Every time I have been back since the food has been just as good. Tortas, tacos, burritos, flautas, sopes, you name it; this place has it all and it's all fantastic. I have yet to try something that didn't leave me full, satisfied, and waiting to be hungry again so I could come back.

This place is sensational. The prices are low and the food is first rate. Just, do yourself a favor and order to go. The place simply isn't big enough to house all the hungry maize addicts trying to get their fix.
