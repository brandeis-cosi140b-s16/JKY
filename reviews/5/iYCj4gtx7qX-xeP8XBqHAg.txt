We stopped by this place on the recommendation of a friend of ours who works at Fiesta Mall. We just happened to stop by near his lunch hour and enjoyed a nice, quick lunch at Pancho's with him.

I had never even heard of this place before but boy did I enjoy it! Upon first entering, you can pick up a tray and pay for your meal. It was very inexpensive, under $6 a person. You can then go down the line and the servers behind the buffet will dish out what you ask for. After you are seated there is a salad area as well as a delicious dessert area. Once you finish your food, you can raise the small flag at your table and ask the server for anything you like - definitely be sure to try out the sopapillas! They are huge, fluffy and absolutely delicious.

I tried each dessert, as is my habit, and liked all of them. The sopapillas and flan are my favorite. As for the main course, my favorite of the choices was the chicken soft taco.

I think this will be our regular lunch spot when we are near the Fiesta Mall area of Mesa.
