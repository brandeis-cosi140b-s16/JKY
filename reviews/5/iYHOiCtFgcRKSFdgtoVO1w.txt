Anytime I'm craving fresh, healthy mexican food, I head on to Zaba's. I no longer go to Chipotle! 

I love that Zaba's has a choice of wheat tortillas and brown rice. Last time I went to Chipotle (which was awhile ago), I don't think they had brown rice. I also like that Zaba's will add fajita veggies to your bowl at no extra charge. I'm also all about supporting local eateries vs. the chain ones.

I agree with the others that parking kind of sucks there. It doesn't even connect to the shopping center with Marshall's and Target. You have to go around to the other entrances. 

I normally get the chicken, steak or shrimp bowls. All cooked wonderfully and seasoned well. I recently been trying the tacos which are fat tacos with the filling always falling out cause there is so much.
