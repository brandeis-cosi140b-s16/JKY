My family went to El Ranchero recently without any knowledge of how the food  or service was there. I had my usual bean burro, enchilada style (red sauce). It was awesome. The taste was great and the price was very affordable.I think it was $3.99 for the bean & cheese burro. I don't recall the cost of adding the enchilada sauce, but it was reasonable. I took photos of the burrito and the outside of the restaurant. I will take some daytime photos in the future. My brother loved his chicken chimichanga, and his wife really liked her chili relleno. My Mom also loved the dish(?) that she had. We will all be back in the near future. There are located just north of Thomas Rd on the west side of 68TH St. I forgot our waiter's name, but he was the friendliest one I have had in many years. He also owns (or co-owns) El Ranchero. They will season the food as you like it: just let them know when you order if you like your food mild, spicy, or something else. If you love Mexican food, I would try this place at least once to see what you think.
