My absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in Arizona! The prickly pear margaritas are seductive and delicious, the pollo fundidio is to die for, the atmosphere and ambiance are lovely and the service is always good. Any out of town/country visitors that come to stay with me get to experience El Encanto and they all still rave about it. There's often a wait in the evenings on weekends but you can hang out and have a drink at the bar, I always choose to drive out to Cave Creek because I think it's a cool little spot and enjoy the character. Would highly recommend this restaurant.
