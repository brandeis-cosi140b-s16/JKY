We had my soon to be sister in laws bridal shower here. They bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of. It began to sprinkle and we were sitting in the lounge couch area out back which is uncovered. They quickly put up an easy up tent thingy and we were totally kept dry! Service was amazing, food was outstanding. I've been there a few times with a friend and loved the ombiance and food/service. I wanted to do the shower here because of the great experiences I'd had, now after Having been there in a larger group I am so completely amazed that they kept up to the high standard set in previous dates. Service and quality that is absolutely Above and beyond is usually hard to find. I love this place!! Oh yes and The shrimp tacos are to die for!
