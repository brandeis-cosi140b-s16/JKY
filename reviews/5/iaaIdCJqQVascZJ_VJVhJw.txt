If you're not from Phoenix like myself then you know how difficult it is to find late night food. It just seems like every restaurant in the Camelback/Biltmore area closes by 10 p.m. and trying to find a good taco place can be challenging if you don't know your way around the valley. 

In a recent quest to find a taco spot after 11 pm I was about to give up go back to the hotel and lo an behold I come across Salsitas with a sign reading: Open 24 hours. I thought it was a mirage. 

Since it was the only place I could find that was open, I gave it a try and was not disappointed. I'm from L.A. and know tacos. This place is not fancy but they are serious about the food. There are various meats to choose from, a salsa bar, and a serve yourself pot of beans (yes, help yourself to some beans). I ordered asada and green chile tacos and they were solid. The tortillas are made on the spot and tacos are only $1.50! You can't beat it. 

Give this place a try. They even have a drive thru.
