Broke da mouth, OMG, amazingly delicious food. Can't wait to go back and I just had some a few hours ago. Fusion tacos for about $1 and fusion burritos for about $4, cheap and nice size portions, I don't remember the rest of the menu but your going to love this place.  Did the bulgogi fusion burrito, the first bite was so out there it was ridiculously good, never tasted anything like it ever, each bite got even better than the last until it was all gone. The owner, Linda I believe, hooked it up, with some pretty good egg rolls, with salsa and guacamole , tortilla chips, oranges for dessert nicely presented, and bottled water. The egg rolls aren't a regular item and need to be ordered in advance. Everything is made fresh so your food gets to you a little longer but well worth the wait. There's also a good selection of bottled juices and sodas. Love this place.
