Made out to Phoenix again last month and again, managed to hit up Los Taquitos on our last day there. This time I had a shredded beef chimichanga, and of the three I had while in town (also went to Valle Luna and Filibertos), it was the best. It was also the smallest but that isn't necessarily a bad thing since most Mexican food place have such huge portions. And at $6.99, it was a bargain. The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful. 

I have to get my fill of chimichangas when I am in Arizona because here in Texas, they tend to put all sorts of stuff in them and smother everything in queso and red sauce. i also have to get my fill of green sauce because what we have here isn't as good. What impressed me is that when I bought some green sauce to bring back, both the young lady who took my order plus the lady who was on the Triple D program took the time to make sure that what I bought would retain its freshness and how to properly freeze (then bring to a boil before cooling) it to store what might be left over after a week. I appreciate the extra effort given since they both knew that due to my location I can't be a regular customer.
