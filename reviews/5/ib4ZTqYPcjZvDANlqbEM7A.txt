Restaurant is fabulous, cozy, comfortable...
Service is exceptional, quick, informative, friendly....
Food is FABULOUS!!!
The Grilled Mexican Corn on the Cob is delicious.
We also tried the Tre Street Tacos. One each, chicken, pork, and shrimp. The tacos were very tasty... my fav was the pork... very juicy and flavorful. My least fav was the chicken.... a tad dry.. I added the hot salsa that the waiter brought on the side and it helped kick them up a notch. 
The star of the lunch.... Carne Asada Nachos..... duh.... it is called Nacho Daddy!!
They were perfect!!! Really one of the best nachos I have ever had!
I saw on yelp some people were upset at the prices???
First of all, good food is worth a few extra dollars!!
But our bill for all of the above was $34....... It was plenty of food to fill up me and my husband and we left HAPPY!!! 
And...
They have a very extensive menu... not just nachos. Burgers, Chicken Wings, Vegan dishes... (the Daddy's Big Burrito caught my eye for my next visit for sure)
