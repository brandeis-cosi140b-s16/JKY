I am in love with this place!!!! I can't believe it has so few stars. Perhaps it is because some people have a distorted view about what it takes to make good food, whether it be Mexican, Italian or American. This idea of "cheap" Mexican food really peeves me, because the care, quality and ingredients in this restaurant rival many of the "finer" establishments in Madison. 

The food is delicious, the service fantastic and the atmosphere jovial. The chicken fajita salad was beautiful and so fresh. Lots of chicken and various veggies. Perfectly seasoned. The sangria (red) has always been my favorite. With large chunks of fruit and an ample glass. The salsa! Mmmmmmm. I could drink a gallon of it, it is that good. 

I have frequented this place on and off throughout the years, bc I don't live in the area anymore. It is so worth the visit. Beautiful colors, beautiful people, out door seating. And great food. 
I have to tell my friends to write reviews of this place bc everyone I know thinks it's great.
