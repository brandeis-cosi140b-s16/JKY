This is my GO-TO place for a Paleo-style lunch or dinner that gives nice big portions, keeps everything fresh and juicy, and doesn't put much of a dent in the ol' wallet.

Favorite meal:  carnitas salad bowl with all the veggies no dairy and a lil' bit of guac

I don't know if every Chipotle is like this, but every now and then one of the employees will work the dining room and refill drinks or give a little extra service.

That's nice and they are pretty friendly when you walk in the door, too.  Even though they're mostly behind the counter.

Can't lose here!
