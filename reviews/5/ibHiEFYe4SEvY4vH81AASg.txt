This place is fantastic. Not only is the food good and authentic, the service and atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. The connected bar is relaxing, has great bartenders, and is priced amazingly compared to other places. Nothing beats tacos and a giant margarita after a long Friday. Especially a giant one. Must go if you're in the area and if visiting you will not regret it. A+ 5 Star place.
