One word... WOW!!!
The Torta El Rey is a must and the Camarones al la Aeracruz were to die for!
It was clean, fresh and friendly and very authentic.  The portions are ridiculously huge and affordable. We went on a Sunday so they were out of a couple things but, nothing to fuss over the menu is HUGE  just like the flavors there!
