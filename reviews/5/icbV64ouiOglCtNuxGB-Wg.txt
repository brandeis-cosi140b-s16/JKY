I still can't believe how much I enjoyed my meal here. I was a little hesitant to try such a unique concept, but after 5 minutes of entering Chino and being offered a variety of samples, I completely fell in love.  The server was so helpful and friendly, offering a sample of almost everything on the menu.  It is definitely like the Panda Express of Mexican food, but 100x better. 

I ordered the combo with fried rice, black beans, jade chicken and pork carnitas.  Every single bite was delicious and flavorful.  Definitely a must eat when I go back to PHX. 

Oh yeah, the snicker doodle cookies they give you free are chewy gooey goodness.
