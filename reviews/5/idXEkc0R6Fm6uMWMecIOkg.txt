We stumbled on Los Molcajetes looking for some authentic mexican food.  WOW! AWESOME!  Went there last night and the food was superb.  At first a little intimidating because we were the only non spanish speaking folks there.  The combination platters are plentiful, tasty and cheap.  The Carne Asada is superb.  And I ordered 10 tacos!!  Awesome.  In fact the place is so good, we went back there for lunch today and intend going back for dinner tomorrow night before we head back to Washington DC.  If you are looking for a fancy joint, or tex mex, don't go.  If you are looking for fresh, home cooked, authentic mexican food at unbelievable cheap prices........this place is your winning lottery ticket.  I will come back to this place everytime I am in Las Vegas.  Forget Morton's and all the fancy joints, this place beats them all for quality.
