*This review is for the cocktails only!*

The drinks they make here are phenomenal!!! HIGHLY recommend the Cilantro margarita, with Don Julio tequila, the Black and Blue margarita with Cuervo Black, the Blueberry margarita with Cuervo Tradicional.

I must note that as to the choice of tequilas I am biased as I work with these tequila companies - but that in no way affected my opinion of the taste of these drinks!!! They were SOOOO good! Trust me - if you don't try that Cilantro marg - you will regret it! Delish!!!!
