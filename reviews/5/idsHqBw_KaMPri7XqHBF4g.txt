I can not get enough of the Mission. Having lived in the Scottsdale area for nearly 10 years and trying almost every restaurant they have to offer, there is NONE like the Mission. Nothing even comes close.

They specialize in margaritas with at least 50 different tequilas. The service is so attentive to the patrons. They really make a point to treat you more as a guest than another tip. The knowledge they have about the food is remarkable. The pork tacos are my absolute favorite! They slow roast the pork for 8 hours and let it soak in a pineapple glaze sauce that has SO MUCH FLAVOR!!! "Sweet but Savory" they say. When it comes time to chow down on the pork you don't even need a knife, you could eat it with a spoon it falls apart so easily. With great friends or a great date your experience at this restaurant will be memorable and you will be craving their food and a chance to re-live the experience. I would highly RECOMMEND this restaurant.
