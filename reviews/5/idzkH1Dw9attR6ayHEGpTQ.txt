Stopped by for a quick lunch with my boss, neither of us had been before and we were both craving mexican. I was a little apprehensive, because it  has a little of the whole in the wall look to it, but I am usually happily surprised with the rougher looking establishments. I order the chicken chimichanga, which I believe is the yes way to judge a mexican restaurant.... it was probably one of the best I have ever had and if you know me, you know I LOVE mexican food. The service was great and there salsa was amazing.  I will definitely be going back!!
