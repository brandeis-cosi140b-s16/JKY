Our family loves this place. Tuesday night is "kids eat free"...so that helps too. Every item that we have tried has been excellent. My mom and dad usually get the bbq platter which includes ribs, chicken and brisket. Almost every time we go they get that meal and split it. I had the Cobb salad (without black olives) last night and it didnt disappoint. I would highly recommend trying this place out. They have a rather large menu too.
