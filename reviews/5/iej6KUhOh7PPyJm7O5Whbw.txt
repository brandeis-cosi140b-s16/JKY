I love this restaurant. Very cheap, very clean, the food is sooo good. My mom and I eat there once every couple of weeks, sometimes twice once a week. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The environment is very comforting. I recommend this place to anyone who loves cheap but tasty Mexican food.
