I've been looking for a place like this up north for awhile. While I still hold a sweet place in my heart for first burrito (south Scottsdale), habanero's definitely hits the spot. 

Had lunch last week including a chicken fajita burrito with voids and guac. The chips and guac were tasty and fresh. The burrito was awesome, I'm talking better than chipotle awesome. Washed it all down with a cold negro modelo. 

If you're looking for a solid, quick and tasty Mexican meal, don't miss habanero's.

Another yelp success!
