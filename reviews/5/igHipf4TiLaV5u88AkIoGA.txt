Picked up 5-rolled taco Supreme and Carnitas Burrito...both were amazing!

Rolled Tacos:  5 rolled tacos, freshly fried and presented with a heaping mound of cheese, sour cream, guacamole, and about 1/2 lb of carne asada to top it off.  Delicious!

Carnitas Burrito:  The flavor exploded in my mouth!  The carnitas were very tender (great quality pork) and tasted delicious!  My burrito was 2x the size of a carnitas burrito at Fausto's.  

Overall,  I'm a fan and will be bringing my colleagues back.  The owner and staff are very friendly and are very proud of their establishment, as they should.
