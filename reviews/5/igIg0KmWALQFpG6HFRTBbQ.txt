At work we always  order lunch from El Taco Feliz 
The food is ALWAYS delicious! The price is always ECONOMICAL! 
I have had their chimichanga lunch special. 
It was a big burrito with shredded cheese and other yumminess, served with rice and beans.
The food was very flavorful and came with guacamole and pico de gallo . 
Delish-us! 
Pleasantly surprised as not only was it tasty and affordable.. they DELIVER! 
That hits it out of the park for me!
