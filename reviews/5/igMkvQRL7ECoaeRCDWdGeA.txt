WOW! Is all I have to say. I'm from Texas and I've been looking for a place just like this. Cheap and very very good!

I got the chicken fajitas to go.The fajitas were mixed in with colorful bell peppers and cooked onions. The homemade tortillas was there to compliment the mix. The also put a great portion of beans and rice. To my surprisement there were also guacamole, pico de gallo, and sour cream ready to put inside my torn off tortilla.

I have moved here about a year ago and this is my place I love more than any chain or off chain restaurant for mexican food. It's almost as if I'm right at home.
