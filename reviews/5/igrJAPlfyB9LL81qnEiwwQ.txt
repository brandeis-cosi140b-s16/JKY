Went there for the first time today and my god... It was amazing. Second best taco shop I've ever been to. (when it comes to burritos anyways)

I ordered a California Burrito al Pastor (not on the menu but the very nice lady behind the desk was happy to accommodate my order) and three orders of tacos: one carne asada, and two carnitas.

My burrito was $4.60 and each taco was $1.50. AMAZING prices and it was done in 10 minutes.

The burrito was excellent, second best I ever had even, but the tacos were the real stars. Best I ever had. Also, the place smelled AMAZING when i walked in.
