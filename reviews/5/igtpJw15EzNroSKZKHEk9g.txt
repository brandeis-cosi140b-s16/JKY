We are slightly obsessed with Upward Projects so last year we took a road trip out to Gilbert to check out their newest concept: Joyride Tacos. You can imagine how excited we were when we heard they were opening a location here in Central Phoenix, just a couple of miles from our home. By opening weekend the staff seems to already have the routine down. We were quickly greeted when we walked in the door, and received excellent service throughout the night. 

Drinks were good, but our favorites of the evening were the chips and salsa (one of the key elements for any Mexican restaurant), and the chicken enchiladas! I don't think I could say enough good things about the enchiladas. Excellent!!  We had another stop planned for the evening so we skipped dessert, but we will definitely be trying it on a future trip. 

Our one complaint would have to be our table. We were unfortunate enough to be sat at one of three small tables for two. The tables are in a row and all right next to each other. We felt cramped and a little like we were joining our neighbors dinner party. All the other tables in the restaurant looked great though, next time we will make sure we aren't sat there.
