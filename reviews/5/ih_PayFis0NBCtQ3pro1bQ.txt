The best burritos ever.

I get the shredded beef and bean and add extra cheese. These suckers are juicy so make sure you have plenty of napkins. Add red sauce with each bite and you'll be absolutely in burrito heaven!

My babes gets the steak and egg and I hardly ever actually see the thing he mows through it so quick.
