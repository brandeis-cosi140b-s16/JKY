Let me start off by saying there were three of us in our party and we are all lacto-vegetarians. I love Mexican food and have eaten it all over the country. I am new to AZ and had only had Mexican at the local favorite, Macayo's. Camarones was such a welcome surprise! We all had the enchiladas with the blue corn tortilla's. It was great to know that they had vegetarian beans and three different sauces to choose from. Two of us had the mild sauce and one had the hot sauce. OMG!!! We loved, loved, loved the food. I had the cheese enchiladas with the mild sauce and it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. I usually only eat half of a plate of enchiladas whenever I have them. The manager stopped over to our table and was totally pleasant and talked to us for a few minutes. My husband and I were meeting a friend for dinner and we must have been there for two hours chatting it up. We had a great dinner all around. So far, still being relatively new to the area, this is now my favorite Mexican restaurant. Not to take anything away from Macayo's who serves a delicious corn and cheese tamale.
