This place is great.  I usually get the pulpo tostadas, but everything is sooo good it's hard to decide.  It is usually packed during the lunch-time hours, especially on the weekends, so if you're in a hurry it's  probably better to go on more off-hours.  But DO go - it's clean, fresh, and delicious.
