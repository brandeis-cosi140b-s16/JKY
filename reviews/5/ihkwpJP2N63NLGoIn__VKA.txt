Came to this place over the weekend, wasn't too busy but was still enjoyable. Didn't have to fight my way to the bar to get a drink and the bar staff seemed busy yet attentive which is always a good thing in a loud place where yelling doesn't get their attention. I was here for late-night so didn't eat this time but have before. I enjoy coming here and hanging out and would recommend it to anyone that wants to enjoy a night out without regretting it when they look at their bank account the next morning!
