Put the Molcajete on your bucket list. How I ever survived 62 years without ever hearing of let alone ingesting this fabulous dish is beyond comprehension. As close as I can come to describing this dish is that it's a tomato, seafood broth with loads of cheese (which surprisingly does not make for heaviness) that hides about a quarter pound of PD & C tail off shrimp. Great balance on the seasonings. 

The establishment is clean and well lit. The staff very friendly and willingly explained the dishes to their Polish/Gringo guest (moi). If you get the chance to meet Lupita, the owner, do so ... a truly caring restaurateur and a lovely woman. 

This is the type of place that can't be duplicated.
