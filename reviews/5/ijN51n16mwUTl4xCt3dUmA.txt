This is my favorite breakfast/brunch in town.  The Carne Adovada is perfection, and therefore I get it every damned time.  Tender, spiced, sauced porkwads with eggs and I believe breakfast taters on the side.  The spicy bloody is perfection.  I faintly recall the Jalapeno Eggs Benedict being yummy--whoever ordered it shared sparingly and guarded it with their life.

The joint is dimly lit, so you don't need to wear shades to nurse your hangover.  You sit in cushioned, isolated little adobe booths tucked away in corners--feels intimate to me and never loud.    The staff's always been really friendly.

Ten visits and going strong.  I'd be there right now actually if I'd run the prerequisite ten miles this week. :(
