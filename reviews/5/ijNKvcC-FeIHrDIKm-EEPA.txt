I'm updating because I'm now vegetarian. It's a rediscovery of my usual restaurants, when selection is reduced. The vegetarian burrito is still good. I think because everything is fresh, it doesn't have to rely on meat to make it have flavor. I love the hot salsa with the smoky flavor. I was still satisfied after eating a burrito with no meat.
