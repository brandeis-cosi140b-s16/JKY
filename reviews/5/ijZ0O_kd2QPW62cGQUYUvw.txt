My husband, kids and I love Rubio's, especially me.  I've been to a lot of Rubio's and I always get the same great service and delicious food consistently, that's why we continue to go here.

We got an Ancho Shrimp Burrito and it was so yummy.  Used a birthday cert and I gave my son the burrito and he wolfed it down.  He always gets some shrimp thing.

TJ, the manager that helped me when I went to pick up my order comped the rest of the burrito for the birthday.  So, it was completely free instead of making me pay another $1+.  That was very kind of him and totally unexpected.

We just happened to be in the area and my son was hungry and I had a certificate to use, so we stopped by here.  Will come back to again when we are in the area, but we have been here a few times over the past 2-3 years and always excellent!!

Thank you, TJ!
