I feel terrible I cannot remember our waiters name! We were a group of 11 adults and 3 kids and our waiter was so awesome! I wanna say his name was Jadon but I'm not sure. The date was Saturday July 11 at 6 pm. I really wanted to give him RAVE reviews!
The place has a great atmosphere. Good was good too! We had a reservation and the high chairs for the kids were all set up in perfect locations. 
Everyone's meal arrived at the same time, and all correct! Thanks kitchen staff!
We are from CA so I can't say we'll be back soon, but I would return!
This place has everything from typical Mexican to specially prepared dishes that were so good!!
