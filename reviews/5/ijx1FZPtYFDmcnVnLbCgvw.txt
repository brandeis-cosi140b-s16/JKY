I'm a BIG fan of Los Taquitos! I've been searching for a nice hole in the wall taqueria since I moved from California in 2009. . 

The tacos are superb. You can mix and match meats-carne, pollo, pork etc.  I could have probably eaten about 10 tacos.

On my taco combo place (3 tacos, rice and beans) i chose 2 carne and one marinated pork. Both flavors were excellent. I think I may have preferred the pork slightly over the carne. Both meats had a little bit of a bite, which is nice.

I really liked the taste and texture of the rice. The beans were good, not my favorite refried beans I've had. 

Coke products are served out  of the fountain. There is also bottled Coke and Orange Crush (personal favorites) among some other sodas..

The menu is pretty diverse and has all the standard fare-tacos, burritos, tamales, tortas, enchiladas etc.

Overall a great meal at a very reasonable price per dish.

Can't wait to head back and try other items!
