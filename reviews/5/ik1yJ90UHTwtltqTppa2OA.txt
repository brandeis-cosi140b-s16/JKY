When it comes to Pittsburgh, one thing we haven't really been able to perfect is the Tex Mex/Mex/South of the Border/Whatever you want to call it experience. I don't mean to knock Mad Mex, Emiliano's, Veracruz (RIP), Mi Ranchito, etc., etc.--sure, Las Palmas has a solid taco stand, and sure, Bea's in the South Side provides a nice experience, but something has always been missing...until now.

El Burro caters to that deep longing that every burrito lover has yet doesn't know exists. El Burro makes Qdoba laughable, puts Chipotle to shame, and hits you smack in the face with what a real burrito should taste like. The guy who runs the place makes his own hot sauces, which are pretty dope. If you need hotter, he buys some pretty good hot sauces you can use, too. The carne asada French fries come loaded with everything you didn't know you wanted on French fries, and the chips are fresh and delicious.

Now, it isn't the Mission or anything, but it's damn reminiscent. And if you don't want a pop with corn syrup, they also sell Mexican Coke (made with cane sugar for that real, rot-your-teeth-in-the-best-ways adventure).
