Looking for a great Mexican restaurant that's not like all the others? The next time you want Mexican food, try Plaza Bonita. I like to frequent local, family-owned businesses whenever possible, and this place is no exception. From the minute you walk in the door, the festive atmosphere instantly uplifts you. The menu is filled with delicious options, but I like the tamales best. And, the margaritas are the best! (Try one with Silver Patron.) They also have a Happy Hour menu that's sure to please. The staff members are friendly and the price is reasonable. But get there early! We've been there all times of day and it's usually busy...another sign of a great restaurant!
