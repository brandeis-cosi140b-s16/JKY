Let me begin by saying that I grew up in SoCal and have traveled extensively throughout the southwest and had my fill of Mexican food, looking for the good stuff.  The two dishes I look for are tamals and chile rellenos:  both specialty dishes that require careful attention to detail, and both of which can be done badly.  

Dona Maria's had the BEST tamals AND chile rellenos I have ever had.  First, the tamals:  most places have a thin layer of meat wrapped in corn meal.  Here, you have a rather sizable portion of meat wrapped in a thin layer of corn meal.  

Next, the chile rellenos.  If you don't do them right, you have a gloppy, oil-soaked eggy mess.  Dona Maria's were done perfectly:  crispy and filling.
