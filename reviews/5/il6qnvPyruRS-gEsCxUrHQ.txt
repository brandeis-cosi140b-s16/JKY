The food is always delicious. The freshest best sourced ingredients prepared fresh each day! The selection is perfect with the right amount of options. My favorite is a bowl with white rice, pinto beans, fajitas, chicken, fresh tomato mild salsa, and guacamole. The chips are amazing, made fresh each day. Even during their peak hours, the line moves very quickly. 15 people in front of me today and I had my food in about 5 minutes. I haven't tried it yet, but the margaritas look yummy. The employees working are always super friendly, they actually visit the dining room to check on the food and ensure the tables are clean.
