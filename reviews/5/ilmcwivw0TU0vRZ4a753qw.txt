Everything was a lil on the pricy side but hey you're in Vegas I get it. The food wasn't amazing but it was good. Didn't try any of their drinks. Service was awesome, so nice and helpful thank you! I do recommend anyone who wants a fresh yummy tortilla (flour) come here!!!! They are bomb, fresh homemade just like abuelita made. I will be back just for them alone!
