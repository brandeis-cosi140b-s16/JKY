hit la mexicana for lunch on monday with a small group.   My kind of place.  it's a very casual mexican restaurant.  One large room with about 20 tables, you order and pick up the food at a counter.  Besides your standard, tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc, they had a slew of items that sounded good, but i'll be damned if i knew what they were.

the standard street cart taco ( a couple soft tortillas, meat, onion, cilantro and various sauces from the salsa bar cost 85 cents.  Given my pathetic limitations of low carb, i basically ordered 4 carnitas tacos minus the tortillas , placed in a bowl - very good, yeah, kinda dull, but it hit the spot.

others had the tacos, cuille relleno, gorditas ( i just thought that was a taco bell thing ) tamales and some sort of stew made with pork rinds - it all looked great and everyone was pleased.

the lunch crowd was hopping - that's always nice to see in a local mom & pop restaurant.

highly recommend if you are in the area and hankering for mexican food at a place high on quality in a casual setting.

Happy Eating !
