This is my picky seven-year-old's favorite restaurant on Earth, and she has loved it since before she was born! We love the food--favors are light and full, and food is served fresh and hot--and we especially love the people! The staff at this Salsaritas feel more like our extended family than restaurant staff. Thank you Deya, Sharmice, Nuri, and especially Eddy! We will eat here for years to come!
