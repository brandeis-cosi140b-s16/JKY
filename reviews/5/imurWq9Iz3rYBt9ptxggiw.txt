We stumbled upon Los Reyes de La Torta from a nearby hotel for some take-out. The food was excellent for all of us, from the 4 year old looking for a quesadilla to the 70 year old vegetarian grandmother. The service was great and the price is right. A perfect way to top off a weekend stay in Phoenix. Thanks!
