If you want a good margarita (Cadillac) and the best chips and salsa, this is your place. The staff is friendly, family owned and operated, and the atmosphere is good. Usually, I order the fish tacos or the carne asada tacos, also the Rocky Point Fajitas are fantastic. Beans and rice are the best around.
