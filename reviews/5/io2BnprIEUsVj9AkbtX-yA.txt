This is the greatest Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  The salsa bar offers more choices than I've ever seen.  The meat was perfect.  Even the rice was filled with flavor--which was a real surprise since I don't remember ever having rice I could actually taste.  And the margarita was much better than anything I can remember.

Outstanding food at reasonable prices  in a non-pretentious atmosphere.  What more could someobody want?  I'll certainly come here again the  next time I'm in the area.
