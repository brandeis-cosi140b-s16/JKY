I've been eating here since I moved to this side of town and I love the food here. It has been consistent and I have never gotten bad service over the years. The staff is always professional and nice, I never have to wait long for an order which is good when everything is freshly cooked. I'm skeptical of Roberto's because if I order Carne Asada fries they are prepared by the time I get to the window. So, was the meat sitting around or were the fries? I prefer their food to Roberto's any day.
