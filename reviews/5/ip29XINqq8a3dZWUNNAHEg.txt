I, too, am VERY disappointed that this place closed. One of the very few REAL mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. Having moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Dec 2010, this was an oasis. Now I'll have to get any Oaxacan food (mole, etc) in LA on visits. The mole tamale appetizer was one of the very best dishes in town.

PLEASE reopen, even if across town. I beg you. 

And I apologize for not reviewing sooner.
