Was at the annual Hoolaulea in September visiting from San Diego.  Won a gift card to Braddah's at the festival which gave me the opportunity to give it a try.  OMG!! The food is totally delicious. It's the Hawaiian version similar to Chipotle...build your own meal concept, but in no way any comparison.  I got a "mixed plate" salad cuz it was too hard to decide what to get...the pork, meat or chicken.  So fresh...excellent flavors and taste. Reasonable priced. The staff is super nice.  You don't find that at other places  The coconut bark rocks!! Look forward to returning next September when I am back in town for the Hoolaulea.  I hope they have a food booth at the festival then.
