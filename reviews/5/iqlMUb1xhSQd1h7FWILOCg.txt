The food at La Hacienda at the Fairmont Princess never ceases to amaze me.  It is always amazing with a creative twist.  I always wonder how they think of what to put on their menu, which is always changing.  With the fire burning and the mariachi band playing, its atmosphere is relaxing yet with entertainment.  With Bourbon Steak and Rande Gerber's new lounge, Stone Rose, opening soon, La Hacienda and the Fairmont Princess must be on everyone's list to visit.  La Hacienda is like no other Mexican restaurant that you have been to; it's gourmet Mexican!  And don't forget to order the flaming coffee - this is a must see!
