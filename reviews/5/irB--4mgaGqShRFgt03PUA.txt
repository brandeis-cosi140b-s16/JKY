I love this place. From the decor to the service to the food.

Ok, so I'm sure everything is great here, so why not try it all? You have to do the Chef's Experience. It's like 50 dollars, they bring you a sample of everything. It's small plates, but they literally bring you like a million. (you'll think you're done and they just keep bringing stuff out). It ends up being a lot of food. Its all delicious and beautifully displayed and exciting to try new things. I really enjoyed the fusion and take on flavor. 

Also the their specialty "TradeWinds" cocktail (it's like a margarita, only like super pure). It's so good, but get a pitcher (they're 16 dollars a glass and tiny glasses, so I just got a couple and then just switched to Corona).
