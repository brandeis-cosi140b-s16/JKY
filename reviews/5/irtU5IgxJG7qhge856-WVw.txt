I generally dont leave too many reviews, but the food here is awesome and we hope they stick around for a while so I went through the trouble of resetting my password just to leave a review for these guys!

We've been here a few times already and I have tried to order different things each time and have been impressed each time! They have really good specials too ($1.99 Burritos on Mondays, a little smaller than their regular burritos but still a good deal!) They have a pretty legit salsa bar too, these aren't just generic salsas either, they're all really good.

With a "bertos" name, you would almost expect them to have a drive thru but I dont think it's worth knocking off stars for... However, they do put your order together pretty quickly and you can call your order in for pick up if you're that impatient.
