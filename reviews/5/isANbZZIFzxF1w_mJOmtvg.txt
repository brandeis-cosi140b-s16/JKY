Incredible staff provides excellent service and you really get a great value for the money.  Tecate Carnitas were ridiculous, chile rellenos were great, plaintain empanadas were really good and the special soup of the day was fantastic with pieces of chorizo in a wonderful broth with loads of beans and veggies.  All around excellent experience and can't emphasize enough the bang you get for your buck.
