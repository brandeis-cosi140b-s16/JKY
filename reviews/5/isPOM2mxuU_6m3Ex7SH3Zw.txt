My wife and I had a wonderful and pleasant surprise this evening when we had dinner at Tacos & Tequila Cantina Grill in Matthews, NC.  From the name, I was, well, expecting "tacos and tequila".  We could not have been more pleased with the excellent greeter, server or ambiance of this restaurant.  The menu is extensive and authentic Mexican (no Taco Bell stuff here).  We had to ask our server to interpret and explain some of the dishes on the menu.  She was excellent and highly trained.  They started us out (complimentary) with a large basket of fresh tortilla chips with three different dipping sauces (yummy).  Our dinners arrived in a timely manner and everything was fresh, fresh, fresh and very tasty.  Just right.  We'll definitely return to Tacos & Tequila Cantina Grill.
