I'm here having lunch and taking the time to write this review because I had to take a break. Ok so this isn't the most luxurious restaurant, however, their food is really good!! I had the Alfonso burro and it was huge and fresh. They are clearly a mom and pop place and they don't have hot sauce but it's made up for with the food!! This is definitely my most favorite spot for Mexican food!
