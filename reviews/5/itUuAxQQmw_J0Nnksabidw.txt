Everything we tried was awesome. We're staying at the Clarendon so ordered in on our first night, then went back for breakfast & dinner the next 2 days!! Met a group of friends for dinner on our last night in town, place was full, but there was not a ridiculous wait for our party of 10 which was awesome for Friday evening!
Had: 
Flap jacks
Granola w fruit
Fruit bowl
Freshly squeezed OJ
Freshly squeezed lemonade (so tangy and good!)
Chicken burro
Chicken tacos 
Salmon w veggies
Elote appetizer 
Guac & chips 

No complaints,  all so tasty!!
