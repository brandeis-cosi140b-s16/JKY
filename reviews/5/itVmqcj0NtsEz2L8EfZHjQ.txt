EVERY time I have come here, the people have been super nice and welcoming. They have offered me samples and told me what everything is and how to eat it the best way. 

I have been here probably 4 times in a 30 day span and I am never disappointed. I tried a torta for the first time and I came back with friends to have the delicious taste of what makes this place the perfect Mexican late night food stop. 

Oh, btw they have $1 tacos from 8-10pm and if you check in on FB you can get a free drink on the bar side or the food side. 

Definitely somewhere to stop by when you're in the mood for some delicious, authentic Mexican food.
