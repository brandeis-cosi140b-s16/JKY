What a find!! Sol, you make me so happy. Came here on a Sunday on a whim for lunch, and much to my surprise they had brunch from 10am - 3pm. I am a sucker for huevos rancheros, and the claim on the menu, "the best huevos in town" had me drooling. 

But, on this particular day I couldn't help ordering the Crab & Shrimp Cakes "Benedicto". Two HUGE crisp-fried crab & shrimp cakes topped with poached eggs & chipotle-orange hollandaise sauce, double-smoked bacon, avocado & refried black beans. RIDICULOUSLY good!! Kids (ages 6 and 9) ordered bean & cheese burritos. Everything was fantastic. 

Our waitress was terrific, and really allowed the kids to pick exactly what they wanted and even offered to let them "assemble" them. Very cute and appreciated. Service was fast, efficient, and friendly.

Washed it down with a glass of sparkling wine. Live music in the background. Yes, I best believe this was the best unexpected 2pm Sunday brunch I've ever had!! I could definitely make this a habit.

I cannot wait to head back for some happy hours and the huevos!! Great addition to one of my favorite spots around - Scottsdale Quarter. Man, I love this town.
