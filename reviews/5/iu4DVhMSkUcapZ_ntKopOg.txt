The wife and I used to come here every month or two. It was 15 miles away from my house but worth the drive! salsa is very good.  Most of the food I have tried has been outstanding! Very authentic we even had them cater a party for us and the food quality was excellent! now that I've moved out of state I really miss this place. did I mention that their service is amazing?  Always refilling drinks and checking on you. Owner works there most nights.  not surprising that they are opening a second location!!!
