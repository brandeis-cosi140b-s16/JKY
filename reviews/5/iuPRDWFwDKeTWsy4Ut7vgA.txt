Ok so while I was living near here at 215 and flamingo I used to get zabas probably three times a week, was it healthy? No. Was it delicious? You bet! I still am tempted to go on my way out of the gym sometimes, and I still often stop in and get a burrito. Heres a tip from an experienced patron, get chipotle ranch instead of sour cream. Sour cream has no flavor, trust me you will be glad you opted for the chipotle ranch. Also the sweet potatoes are excellent! I highly recommend trying this place.
