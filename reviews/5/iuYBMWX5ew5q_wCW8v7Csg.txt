Everything about this place is awesome. Ambiance, food, decor, service, everything.

The food is unbelievably fresh and the service is the best in the city.

We are always treated like royalty and have always gotten consistently greeted with a smile.

Love this place and we think it's one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas!
