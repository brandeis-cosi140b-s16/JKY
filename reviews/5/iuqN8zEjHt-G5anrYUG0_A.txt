When I moved away, these were the tacos that I missed! 

I stopped back today, and must say - it was exactly how I remembered!  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced at $5.99 and come with two items and rice and beans. I always get the hard taco - seasoned shredded beef, lettuce, and cheese in a deep fried corn tortilla - and the cheese enchilada. I could eat the rice and beans alone, both are so well seasoned and they definitely don't skimp on the cheese! The only thing to watch is that the red hot sauce can vary from visit to visit - some days it's super hot, others - not so much.

The wait staff is exceptionally friendly and always try to help me because my Spanish is so limited. The interior is large but very modest, there aren't a lot of fancy decorations - this is a place to come for the food and service and  not th ambiance. 

Still, one of my faves!
