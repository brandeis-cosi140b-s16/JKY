This was the real deal.  Just past the Stratosphere. Tacos were about 1$ and some change.  Had to stop here on the way back from the Premium outlets.

The tacos pastor were very good.  It was shredded pork and grilled onions.  Extra cilantro, spicy salsa and lemon is how I do it.  The carne asada was really good, Perfectly seasoned, and only a couple of chewy pieces of meat!  They were not greasy They also had pazole, but that is not something you eat before hitting the strip. 

Every time I come to Vegas I have to get one taco from this joint.  If you want some good no frills Mexican this is the spot. Better than most places that I have had in Mexico. I suppose this could be a bit sketchy late night, but that is half the fun es√© !

My only complaint is that the hot salsa could have been a bit more spicy.

The prices are listed on menu, so I'm not sure what that other person was talking about.
