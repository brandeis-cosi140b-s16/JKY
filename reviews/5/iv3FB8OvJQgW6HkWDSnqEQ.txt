I am a Colorado Mexican food girl. However, this New Mexican style is amazing. We ate there twice in 5 days while in town. The second time we took 10 people with us. The service was amazing! The chips and salsa good. They are $3...who cares you will spend that in 3 minutes in a slot machine. 
I had the Rib eye tacos! YUM!!! Delish! So tasty and so full of steak! My hubby had the sweet corn enchiladas. He was in heaven. With beers and tip it cost us about $60 for both of us. We left full and happy. No complaints. 
Well one! There is not one near me!
