My family has been eating at this location since they opened. When somebody says "Mexican food?", we really mean "Serrano's?". Over the years the salsa bowls have shrunk in size and the newer menus are not as great, but the quality of the food and the customer service are always top notch. Stand out is the Chicken Serrano's Special Quesadilla. Ask for 2 or 3 bowls of their excellent salsa and cover the quesadilla in spicy goodness. Crispy chicken tacos are always dependably good. Not big into bean dip but everyone I bring here raves about it.
