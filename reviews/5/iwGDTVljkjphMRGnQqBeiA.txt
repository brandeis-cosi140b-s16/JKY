Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well.
