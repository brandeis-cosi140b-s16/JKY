This is great little hidden gem 3 doors down from harbor freight! The food is wonderful and very reasonably priced. We liked the shredded beef enchiladas and the shrimp tacos! The staff are super friendly and hospitable. It gives you the feeling of a family owned restaurant. My husband and I have been twice in a week. The ladies bathroom was exceptionally clean, probably the cleanest I've ever seen in Vegas! Lol!! So you know their kitchen is clean. :) give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!
