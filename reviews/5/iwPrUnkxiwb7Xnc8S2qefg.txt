My husband and I came in from Florida late one evening last week and decided to eat here before our 2 Hour drive to Sedona.  We used yelp to find a good restaurant to eat and decided on this place because of all of the great reviews it got. It definitely lived up to the reviews! We did the any three taco special and did a combination of the pulled pork, steak, brisket, and mushroom and to say it was good is an understatement. These tacos are fresh and delicious. They are definitely not your typical fried and greasy Mexican food. It is fresh and light while delicious and filling. The ambience was really nice, the bathrooms were clean, and our server was wonderful! I would definitely eat here again.
