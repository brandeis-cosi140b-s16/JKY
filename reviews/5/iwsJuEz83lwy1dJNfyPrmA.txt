This place is the bomb! I moved out here from L.A. and couldn't find a good fast food Mex place anywhere here til I went to Faustos. Roberto's is open 24/7 but their food and service sucks. Even when my family comes into town from L.A. they want to go to Faustos(they live in East L.A.) 
My favorites are the super nachos carne asada,California burrito,chimichanga plate and menudo for the quick hang over fix. Lol Everyone at work also loves Faustos. Trust me, you can not go wrong with Faustos. Enjoy!
