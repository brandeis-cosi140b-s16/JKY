Excellent food. The service was fast. The employees were nice and helpful. Clean clean and clean. My husband and I are happy we are here today what a treat. We had the fry bread taco with red sauce and I had the chimichanga with green sauce rice and beans. We ended up getting a fry bread with honey and powder sugar to go. This is the place to go! Yumm!!
