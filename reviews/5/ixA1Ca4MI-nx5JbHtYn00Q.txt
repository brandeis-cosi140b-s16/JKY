Not your everyday Mexican restaurant; Wedge offers a very stylish bar scene with a unique twist on your typical Mexican food. The fish tacos were AMAZING! My boyfriend tried the shrimp, and we both agreed that the tilapia tacos were better. (I even indulged in a pomegranate margarita afterwards!) Overall great first impression!!
