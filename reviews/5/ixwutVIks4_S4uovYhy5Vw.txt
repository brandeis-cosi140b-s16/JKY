Verdict... delicious!

I get to pick what gets put in. Just the way I like it. Price range, same as your standard taco joint in every corner of San Diego CA. Hours, 10pm the latest. Man, everyone sleeps early in Maricopa.

This shop, prices fair. For the amount and taste, you can virtually create any kind of combination there is without breaking a hole in your pocket. All they need now  is a seafood option, and they'll be complete.

The staff are friendly, just not outgoing unless you initiate the conversation. But then again, there are those who might say "I am not here to talk, just here to eat". For me on the other hand, I wouldn't mind having the staff  be a bit more outgoing.

In the end, I love this taco shop. It's small and homey. A great place away from home. I missed San Diego even since I moved to AZ, but this taco joint makes their food just like the taco shops in CA, and that to me is... As good as it gets!

Thanks Cilantro's. You helped me with my homesickness.
