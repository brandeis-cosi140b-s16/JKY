Scottsdale has no great restaurants anywhere near 101 & Shea or 101 & Cactus corridor.  This is a great fast-food type Mexican restaurant with quality cooking, pleasant service, and a diversity of dishes of interesting tastes.  The salsas are homemade and add robust flavor.  Thank you for being there, Federico's!!  Keep those prices where they are at and people will come from near and far!
