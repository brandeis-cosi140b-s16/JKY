We came for the Preparados - also referred to as Michelada - so yummy and refreshing when you feel a little crappy after too many drinks the night before. They're very satisfying here. 
I also got the cactus appetizer which was super juicy and fresh, very large portion, too. My friend got the steak with rice and beans and the steak was super flavorful and tender. 
The beans they serve have so much flavor and I ate them w chips over the salsa because the salsa gave me a crazy cough attack (I think a little bit of pepper was stuck in my throat) which was embarrassing and something I didn't want to happen again lol
Also, the service was really good. We were laughing because I would ask for something and they would bring it two seconds later. We started to think they could read our minds!
