Come in it's chipotle you shouldn't need to read a yelp review to tell you it's good. I mean everything here is awesome. You can be healthy if you want with a salad or just got all out with a burrito. What I would say to do is get a quesadilla and have them wrap the burrito with the quesadilla. Wonder how that will be.
