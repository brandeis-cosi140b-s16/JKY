I have never been to or heard of America's Taco Shop prior to visiting this location. I am now a BIG fan!!! I go at least once a week for lunch or dinner! The Chicken Burrito is so good and fresh! The guac was AMAZING!! I like to make a dip with their beans and guac!!! Very good! The people are always smiling and nice!! I rate a place by customer service and the night manager is on it! Thank you for coming to the neighborhood ATS!!
