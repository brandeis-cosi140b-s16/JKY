Came here with a friend of mine and dined on the patio on Saturday night.  We had such a great time!  The tacos were so fresh and delicious, as well as the table-side guacamole with pomegranate seeds.  I had the Al Pastor tacos (a personal favorite of mine), and they were fantastic.  I can't wait to go in for their Taco Tuesday to try more!
