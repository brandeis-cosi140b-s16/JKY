One of my favorite places to enjoy good food and tequila.

Ambience is not typical Tex-Mex and the inside/outside patio is perfect for lovely AZ weather.

So far I have had the pork, chicken and beef tacos, all extremely unique in flavor and very tasty.  The guacamole  is great and the pozole (which is seasonal) is back on the menu and exquisite.

Service is stellar and there is live music on certain nights.  A+ for being a cool place to hang out that isn't pretentious or a dive.
