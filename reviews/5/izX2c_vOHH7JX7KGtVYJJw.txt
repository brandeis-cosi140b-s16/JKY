After reading many other reviews, and needing to get some really decent Mexican grinds going on, I suggested this location to my former boss and coworker who is moving out of state.

Upon entering we were warmly greeted by Frank, who reminded me of my best friend's family and all of her uncles who warmly greet you and treat you like a compadre even though its your first meeting.  I observed him warmly greeting his regulars by name.

Frank kindly explained to us that you order at the counter and then they bring the order(s) to your table.  The food is brought out quickly once the order is placed.

There were a lot of choices and really hard to decide but ultimately we both ordered the chile verde combo plate (rice, beans and tortillas) with a med. drink that was this week's special for $7.89 each.

The combo plate was excellent and reminded me of eating at my best friend's house who are Hispanic, so I grew up eating the "good stuff".  Frank also explained and presented to us 4 small cups of different types of salsas, pico de gallo, I think a tomatillo sauce all which tasted fresh and yummy!!  My tablemate took the 2 milder sauces and I took the two others.  The red sauce was pleasantly hot and was very tasty.  I liked the green sauce also.

Frank and his family who were also are servers made sure are drinks were refilled and never made us feel unwelcomed as we sat for close to 3.5 hours at a table talking.  We only wished he served cocktails, so we could at least pay for our extended stay. Frank did mention he may be in the process of obtaining his liquor license to serve beer and wine.  It sounded like he may also open on Saturdays again when he gets this license and Sunset Road opens up.  Let's hope so and because its hard for me to get to this place on the weekdays.

Oh yeah, Frank also provided a sample of his barbacoa which was succulent and tasty.  he described a sandwich they make, and that may be my next choice.
