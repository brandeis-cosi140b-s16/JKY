Awesome service and awesome food!  I live in maricopa but this place is out of the way when it comes to restaurants or bars but it's always worth the extra miles to go to.  Last time I went here it was the afternoon after dove huntin' opened and they had us sample some fresh hunted dove jalape√±o poppers... Freakin delicious!  Add some summer shandy and you is in heaven:) things like that keep me comin back and bringing friends to this place from out of town. 6 stars easy!

Cheers
