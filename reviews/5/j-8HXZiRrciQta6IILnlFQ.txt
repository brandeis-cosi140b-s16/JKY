I give Rubio's 5 stars two reasons great customer service even at rush hour lunch time and for the shrimp filled burrito. I thought they were going to be stingy with the shrimp but it was loaded throughout the burrito. When I first bit into it I got three shrimp. I thought "awe man all the shrimp are in one end of the burrito" but it wasn't it was throughout until the last bite!
