We LOVE Bonita's!! Owned by the same wonderful people who own Pullano's, Bonita's is turning into our new favorite place. It's honestly getting hard to choose between Pullano's and Bonita's... but Bonita's wins for those nights we need a quick, convenient meal.

First: the prices at Bonita's are phenomenal. We get a ton of food, plus a drink plus churros, and never walk out of there paying more than $25.

Second: Bonita's is not Taco Bell, nor is it Filiberto's. It is SO much better. Yes, it's fast-casual (meaning you can eat it there or take it to go, it's not a sit-down-and-get-served place), but everything seems to be made fresh and is definitely made to order.

There are way too many items I could recommend to you, but some of our favorites are the bean & cheese burrito, the tacos (any kind) and the CHURROS. I can't say enough about the churros - I've tried churros far and wide, in many different states, and Bonita's is seriously amazing. 

Let me repeat: If you don't order the cajeta churro, you are not truly experiencing Bonita's. I don't even care if you're allergic to caramel - try the cajeta churro!! If you don't like it, your tastebuds are officially dead.

So good. Go. You likely won't be disappointed... and you definitely won't be disappointed if you choose that cajeta churro!
