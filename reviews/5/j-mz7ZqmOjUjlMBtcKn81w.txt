From the friendly service and comforting and playful family vibe to the fresh salsa bar and the overly generous amount of meat in the tacos, it's places like this gem that keep my expectations excessively high when I am in the mood for authentic Mexican food. Which is always. And the horchata...their horchata is the first I've had in years that didn't make me wish I could add my own touch to it. Perfection.
