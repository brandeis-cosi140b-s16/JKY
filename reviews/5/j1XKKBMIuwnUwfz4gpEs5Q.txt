One of the best burgers I've ever had.  No frills or gimmicks.  Just a simple bun, meat, and cheese burger with some spread & lettuce. High quality ingredients will beat out gimmicks for me anyday.  Or maybe i was just experiencing euphoria from their Salted Dulce de Leche shake which is an absolute delight.  

The short rib taco is also a quality offering if youre not feeling like a burger.  And I still need to go back when their Street Corn is back in season.  

The Stand is a Great place.
