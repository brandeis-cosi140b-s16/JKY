Wow. What a pleasant surprise.  Stopped by for what we thought would be a snack.  Turns out the portions were much larger than expected.  We had four tacos. The street type with onions and cilantro. Two chicken, one carnitas, and one carne asada. A side of beans.  The tacos were at least twice? the size of what we were expecting.  The salsas were delicious.  We will be back!  

Been back two more times since I started the review. 

The food is wonderful. And surprisingly inexpensive.  Great meal for 4 for less than $25. Terrific value and delicious food!
