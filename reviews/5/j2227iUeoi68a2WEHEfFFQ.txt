We were visiting Champaign and my guy wanted Mexican food. We were headed to Chevy's because had it once before and said it was ok. I used Yelp to find out the rating. I saw that Mas Amigas had a higher rating and I was feeling adventurous so I said we should go check it out. When we pulled in my first thought was run-down greasy spoon. Then I saw a gentleman on a nice, clean red shirt and apron so I said let's go in, the staff looks good. The inside was small and the restrooms even smaller. The visual did nothing to prepare us for anything. Soon after we were seated the place filled up, people were waiting in line to be seated. Once we got our food, I realized why- the food was amazing!! I lived in Texas for several years and this was better than anything I had there!! I had the Pollo Pablano, my guy had the steak and shrimp fajitas and my daughter had a combo plate. For dessert we shared the fried ice cream,  not really fried ice cream but hood none the less. It was the server's first day so the rest of the staff kept helping her make sure we had refills, napkins, etc. Our experience was awesome! We will go there next time we visit!!
