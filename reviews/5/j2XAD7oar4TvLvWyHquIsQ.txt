Maria's is a great family restaurant with friendly employees who make you feel right at home.  My daughter and I tried Maria's a couple of months ago and we've been going every week since.  You quickly build a friendship with the staff and they are always happy to see us and give my daughter a big hug.  We felt like family.  The food is great especially for the price.  I suggest the burrito texano with the shredded beef.  The flavor in the shredded beef is incredible!  My daughter loves the kids steak burrito with rice. Maria's is amazing!
