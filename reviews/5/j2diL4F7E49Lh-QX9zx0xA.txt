Not a restaurant for ther faint of heart, lots of spicy food BUT there is food for wimps.  The steaks, pasta, chicken and mexican food are all winners.  The basic margarita is excellent.  The Chinaco skinny margarita is a real winner.  On the weekends the mimosas and bloody marys for $5.00 are a bargain.  NOTE make reservations for weekends.  ALSO go next door the the Rokerij , same food with a  few additions, The DUCK is fabulous. Great wine list also. Both places are mid priced. Also Dicks Hideway same food for more of a bar atmosphere
