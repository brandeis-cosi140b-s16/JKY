The food here is very delicious! I got camarones a la diabla and actually got more then 6 shrimps on my plate unlike Lindo Michoacan.. the staff is pretty cool manager actually helps his staff on assisting customers and the prices are reasonable... my favorite thing is as soon as I walked in its decorated like a typical Mexican person house I loved it
