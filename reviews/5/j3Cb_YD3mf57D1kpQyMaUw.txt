This Chipotle went above and beyond. I feel that it is too common today for big companies not to take care of their customers, but to give them a product as cheap as possibly while quality and service suffer. I never find that to be the case with Chipotle and especially at this location. I am moving to a new apt and after being mistreated and robbed from Direct TV and Century Link among many others. I felt as if no large company actually valued their customers anymore. This Chipotle ended my day a little better by proving me wrong. I requested steak for my burrito which they were momentarily out of. I had to wait literally less than a minute for the steak to finish being prepared. Because of my brief wait Chipotle comped my meal. Shit if I ordered something from a traditional fast food restaurant it still would have taken longer than the 2 minutes it took to make my burrito. I understand this isn't something Chipotle will do every time in this situation. But I have always had a great experience at Chipotle so on top of that today they reminded me, not only do we put out a great, fast product, we also give a fuck! Thank you to the crew working tonight at 8:30!
