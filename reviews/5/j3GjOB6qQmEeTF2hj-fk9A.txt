Another five for marias. My favorite mexican food restaurant. This is the first time I have been here since I've started yelping, but have ate here since they have opened. This is home made mexican food, like my aunt makes. This is real mexican food, not the generic americanized restaurant. And a million times better then the hard to eat even when drunk filibertos. Don't come for the atmosphere, it just a little hole in the wall with great food. These little gems are hard to find, its great to have one in gilbert.
They have great red and green chillis. I prefer the red, I also order them meat only. They are still great with the rest of the fixings. My favorite place for fajitas, good tamales, and the best chile relleno. Only place I know of with caldo de res (beef stew), and of course if you like, they have menudo.
Now lets start talking breakfast burrito. My favorite is the califonian, steak, french fries, and the best pico. The rest come with your choice of sausage, chorizo, bacon, ham, machaca, or steak. 
A must try, dont let the atmosphere fool you, its high quality food, at a great price. Thank you Maria!
