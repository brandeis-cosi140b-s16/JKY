This is my all time favorite Mexican restaurant!! They now know us and bring us our drinks without ordering :) They are always so friendly and willing to help. If you don't know what you want they will help with that as well. Oh and don't let me forget there delicious margaritas!!! Had many different kinds and don't think you can go wrong with any of them.
If you are looking for good Mexican food you have found the place!
