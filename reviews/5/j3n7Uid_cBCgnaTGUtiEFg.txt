Is there anything not to like about Mexico City?  The mom & pop feel of the place, the soft yet substantial tortillas, the incomparable selection of delicious fillings, fresh chips, and some of the best guacamole in Pittsburgh.  Heck, their beans are good, too.

Everything on the menu, which has enough of a selection, as long as you're a fan of Mexican food, sounds inviting and tastes great.  While I haven't had a chance to try everything yet (and that might take me a while), the giddy anticipation of placing an order is always met and satisfied when I take my first bite of south-of-the-border delectitude.

The meals are quick, filling, and very affordable, making Mexico City a little oasis of flavor in downtown Pittsburgh.  Seriously, check this place out.
