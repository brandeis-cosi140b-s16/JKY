Adobado tacos. No need to order anything else. 

Bit of a walk from the strip but definitely need it to burn the calories from all the tacos you will eat!! 

You must get a side order of the grilled onions and ask for pineapple chunks! Also,  make sure to tip the man slicing the meat! My guy worked very hard and fast to get my 20 orders of the Adobado tacos. 

I didn't taste any difference between this location and the one in Chula Vista.
