Chef Oscar is amazing! We had a sangria sampler followed my 2 pitchers of sangria. The watermelon and the red sangria were our 2 choices for the evening and did not disappoint! The chef sent out his queso fundito to get us started. We had 5 entrees served family style. Halibut, camarones a la diabla, short ribs, and the Del patron for 2. Everything was perfect! The halibut and the shrimp were my personal favorites. The chef wouldn't let us leave without tasting his bread pudding... Nothing short of heavenly. The ambiance was quaint and and sophisticated. I highly recommended!
