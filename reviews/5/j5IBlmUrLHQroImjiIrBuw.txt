This place probably has the best Mexican food I've had in Surprise, AZ. It has a wonderful atmosphere and decor and the food is always hot and delicious. 
Just a warning, you better come hungry. The portions are huge. The nachos literally come on a pizza pan and are enough for 4 people, lol. 
The soups are awesome and taste homemade. I definitely judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and chips and Rio Mirage has some of the best. Their salsa is very fresh and I love the cilantro in it and the chips are always warm and fresh.
Bottom line, you won't be disappointed and you'll leave with a full belly and a smile on your face. Great place to take the family or a special someone for a romantic date.
