Ok... So I was under the impression that Robertos was the place to go after a night of indulgence.  (Which I have done many times). Having said that I could not provide an accurate review due to lack of memory. I know I was always happy with the food in my belly but at 3:00 am I was not in a position to accurately describe until now. On a recent visit to Robertos during the day with zero alcohol in my system I had the pleasure  of enjoying one of their chicken burritos. Omg this was good. I mean really good. All white meat, saut√©ed onion and green peppers. I added beans and sour cream. For $5.50 this can't be beat!  I enjoyed 1/2 of that burrito for lunch and finished off the rest at dinner. Yum
