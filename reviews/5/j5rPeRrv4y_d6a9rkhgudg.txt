I discovered this magical place my freshman year - almost 8 years ago. I'm not in Madison anymore, but every time I come back I have to come here (if I am financially stable to do so at that moment in time). That being said, please do prepare yourselves! Both for the excessive amount of spending and eating. Huge portions = huge chunk of my wallet. This place is pretty expensive, BUT it's well worth it for unique blend of american and traditional Mexican food. You will not be disappointed. I've gotten almost every dish here and I have never regretted any once. They take a much longer time than an average restaurant when getting food out - which just goes to show that the food they prepare is fresh and detailed. You can taste that in the food. My favorite dishes? The Rajas, hands down. If you're looking for a mix of sweet and salty go for the Beef Caribbean Plate. Those are the two that I get most often. Among the other dishes there I'd also recommend the Plato Azteca and Carnitas.
