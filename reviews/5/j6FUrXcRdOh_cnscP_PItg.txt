Thrifting about the countryside of the Sunnyslope area finding amazing deals on everything, including a gently used pair of Merrel's for $2.50 at Goodwill, makes you forget about your grumbling tummy. My husband and I are big fans of the Two Hippies Beach House on Camelback and have been meaning to try out some of the new locations. My secret desire is that the Two Hippies franchise will soon take the place of a few local McDonalds, bringing hope to the next fast food generation. When we walked into this location it was clean and friendly. There is much less kitsch on the walls than the other locations, it's more roomy inside and the menu is clear and easy to read. We strolled up to the counter and Mike asked for our order. He and my husband talked until our food came and he never ventured from being polite.
Great atmosphere. Great service. Now, the food.
I actually shutter and am still having a hard time with this. But, it must be written. Better than the Camelback location. I didn't even know what I was missing. I could taste every ingredient in my fish taco from the first to last bite. I could taste the fresh cabbage, the fish, the onion, the sauce. The cilantro was fresh (and I grow my own herbs at home, so that's saying a lot.) Before it all blended together. Now it all had it's own flavor perfectly matched inside a tortilla. I don't even like taco's, that's why I was so impressed with the Camelback location. But this was no taco, this was a foodgasm. Smaller portions, better quality, same fantastic service. Thank you Mike and your family for being the perfect Two Hippies owners. You will do well.
