It should tell you something, that 99.9% of their brisk business is Hispanic.

This is not a sit down restaurant, but a Latin takeout restaurant.

They speak adequate English, and they are friendly, so don't be intimidated. Trust me, it is worth the effort.

The food is superb and inexpensive. The house made tortillas are so cheap, that they're practically free.

They have elephant ear sized chicharrones, and no, I'm not exaggerating their size. 

When I come here, I purchase carnitas, barbacoa, queso fresco, tortillas, and salsa.  For $12, or thereabouts, one can make enough food to feed five or six people very well.

Another suggestion is to stop at the nearby Compare supermarket on North Tryon, and purchase at least two or three ripe avocados. I have never found Hass avocados cheaper than at this Compare supermarket. I add sliced avocado and sour cream to the above ingredients, and the carnitas are heavenly.

PS: I take the huge portion of left over tortillas, cut them into quarters, and fry them in peanut oil on the stove top over medium to medium high heat. I sprinkle them with garlic salt as they come out of he oil. I pair the fresh tortilla chips with salsa or guac., or whatever foods that need some added crunch.
