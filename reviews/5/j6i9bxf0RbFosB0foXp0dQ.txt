If i Only could give it 10 Stars!!! Best tasting tacos and tortas. My husband always has the Carne Burrito, but I have not really taste it... I am always just so obsessed with my "Torta con Pastor", that I really can't pay attention!!!! My 15 yo daughter can put away 5 of their pork tacos (carnitas or pastor, based on her mood) and can finish off my torta.. This girl can eat and rightfully and especially so... here! Everything is spicy as it should be, so be prepared! We also love their green  "avocado salsa/sauce - so if anyone from the Taqueria is reading - can we please have the recipe? Pretty please with a taco on top! 
That is all folks - just some of the best real Mexican food around!
