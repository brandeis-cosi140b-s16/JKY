This was one of the places that when I first moved to Phoenix opened some doors for me.  It is still a favorite today!  

Coming from the Midwest I had no idea how good food from south of the border could really be.  Nor did I have any idea that all food Mexican food was not represented at Taco Bell.  I know.  Enter a new co-worker's invitation to Chuy's for after work cocktails and grub.  Wow!!

Other than opening my eyes, after living here several years I have even more appreciation for the level of value and taste Chuy's pulls off in the Valley.  Mesquite broiled anything is a no-brainer here.  All are scrumdidlyumptious in the form of tacos, skewers, plates, etc.  I also dig their take on Baja-style sides like slaw and whole beans, no lard.

I have heard they breakfast but have yet to get to it.  If they have dessert I know nothing about it, which is strange given my fixation on the stuff.

The beach shack theme can take a little getting used to as it fast casual, including the alcohol.  Oh, and they have margaritas.  Forget the one-offs.  Find a friend and split a pitcher!  The pitchers are smoking deals and strong.  There may have been an incident with a friend under a table at this location due to non-belief in the strength of their margaritas... I may have not been much help in this situation given I was sure the bathroom kept moving.


That aside they have great food specials, a zoo-like Happy Hour, a free chips and salsa set-up and good prices on beer.  I recommend studying the layout before your first drink, bringing an appetite and having an exit strategy.
