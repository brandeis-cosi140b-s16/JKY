I am not gonna lie this place is way awesome. I was totally surprised when m wife and I discovered it. We love chipotle and Cafe Rio but this place's salads beat any of those! Plus they dont charge extra for every little thing, not even guacamole! The people are just a fast and very nive and it is never packed. Go for sure! We had a great experience. Best thing about the salads, get the pesto lime sauce and sweet potato chips on it, to die for!
