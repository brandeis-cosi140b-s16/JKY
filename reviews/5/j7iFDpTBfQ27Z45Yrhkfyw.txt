Love this place! The food is fresh and delicious, service is fast and friendly, and prices are low. Inside is small, clean, and cheerful, and there's an outside table that seat six or eight. You get free chips and four kinds of salsa with every meal. We've had the tacos (chicken, alpastor, chorizo, and carnitas), burritos (choriza, chicken, and alpastor) and huaraches (vegetarian and chicken) -- all fantastic. Extra points for being right around the corner from our house -- good fresh food within easy walking distance!
