The best part about this restaurant is that everything is fresh, fresh, fresh! The tortas are loaded with delicious meats and fresh tomatoes, avocados, peppers, and other great veggies. My favorite were the roasted pepper vampiros, if you like it a little spicy, and the bionico, a cup full of wonderful fresh fruit topped with sweet milk, honey, nuts, granola and coconut. Prices were very reasonable and no one will leave here hungry!
