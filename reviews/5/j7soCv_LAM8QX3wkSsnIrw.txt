I am with everyone on this. What this place lacks in nice atmosphere (it is a little dive cafe with a few booths & a couple of tables) they make up for in great food & cheap prices. 
I came during lunch & had the Korean beef (bulgogi) burrito & it was large, to start, but full of flavor. For a burrito that size, it was more than worth the 4.99 price. They also included chips, salsa, & guacamole at no additional charge! 
Your drink options are from the fridge so no refill on fountain but not missed. I would definitely come back again & again to try the other menu items.
