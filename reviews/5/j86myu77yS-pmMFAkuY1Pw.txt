Wow! I was really blown away by this place! We had never eaten here and are new to the area so we came in thinking it was more of a Qdoba place (I was wearing sweat shorts!). I apologize to everyone who had to witness me in my grubbies. I ordered the Chambord margarita (awesome) and we started with the trio appetizer. Boy was that queso good! I had the shrimp and guacamole bites (good), hubby had the green chili pork enchiladas (excellent), son had the street tacos (good) and daughter had the mushroom enchiladas (excellent). Yes, I know my kids have excellent taste. We will definitely be back and I promise we'll be a little more pleasing to the eye.
