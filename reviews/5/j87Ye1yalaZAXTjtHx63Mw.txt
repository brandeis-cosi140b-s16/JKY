I was hesitant to try this place, but it was so busy. And I was with my Pescatarian friend. Prices were not too bad.  The food was excellent. I got a shrimp burrito and a shrimp taco combo. One of them had a little spicy jalapeno chopped up in it, but not too bad.  I would recommend this to anyone.

We were hesitant to use the restroom, but it wasn't bad at all.  

The place is small, cozy.  As mentioned, very busy.  We went on 2nd Friday (Mesa downtown monthly event).
