I stopped by here on a lovely Saturday afternoon. I've been craving food from a truck after months of watching the food network. Taco Motorizado did not disappoint.

Fair warning before you go: Cash only, no seating available.

A tweet from Champaign Taste sent me in this direction and I had a steak torta. It was loaded with steak, veggies, and cheese. It was messy and fantastic. Easily the best torta I've had. The steak was in small bits and was great; some Mexican restaurants have chewy steak in their food, this was the opposite.

I'm nervous putting this review up in fear the lines will stretch from the parking lot to the intersection of Prospect and Bradley, but I really want this place to stay open.
