We have been searching for great mexican food in Arizona for the last two years. This place hit the spot!! It was honestly some of the best we have ever had and would go back soon. My husband had the Ranchero burrito which I would highly recommend and I had steak fajitas (amazing!!!!). Miguel, the cook brought the food out personally and takes pride in the freshness, combinations of tastes and presentation of his food. He uses his own special seasoning for the fajita meet which really made it stand out above others. I HIGHLY recommend this place!! Hope you enjoy!
