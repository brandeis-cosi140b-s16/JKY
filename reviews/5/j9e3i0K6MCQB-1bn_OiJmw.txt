Most authentic mexican in Madison.  Amazing food.  The tamales Mexicanos are homemade and filled with chicken and jalape√±o.  The chorizo tacos were the best tacos we've eaten...ever!  Their guacamole is super fresh.  When we ordered a soda, it came in a can.  It definitely wasn't enough to quench my thirst, especially with the spicy tamales.  A couple people were eating the menudo.  I haven't been able to pull the trigger on that yet but, if I was going to try it, this would be the place.  Maybe I'll get the courage next time.
