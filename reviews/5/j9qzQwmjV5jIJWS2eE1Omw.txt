Speedy, friendly service, rarely messes up my order, even if it is complicated, which it usually is. 

Late night staff get swamped regularly, but handle it well. Great vegetarian and vegan options. 

(I feel I need to say that my five stars is versus other fast food restaurants, but for the money it definitely still holds its own. )
