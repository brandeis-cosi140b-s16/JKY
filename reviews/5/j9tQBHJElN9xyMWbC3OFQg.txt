One of my current favorite places. Dont be scared of the neighborhood, never had issues. And the druve is definately worth it. We have tried discada, picadillo, barbacoa, winnies(dint get it it really isnt good) and my favorite addiction: lengua en salsa verde(beef tongue in green salsa). Its pretty spicy but so good and the tongue is always perfectly cooked. I love their red salsa, its super spicy but amazingly good. They have a little salsa bar with red and green salsa, lemons, roasted serranos and those yellow chilis, and fresh raw green serranos. Prices are fair avg $4. The lengua is $6.75 but totally worth it(and if you last checked lengua aint cheap at the supermarket). The tortillas are freshly made and they add beans and choice of meat. Barbacoa is the only one they put cilantro and onion if you like. Weekends they have barbacoa tacos and combination plates(not sure why only weekends) this is when their barbacoa seems to be fresher and better. Give this place a try its totally worth it and try the barbacoa or lengua, safest choices if you are unsure.
