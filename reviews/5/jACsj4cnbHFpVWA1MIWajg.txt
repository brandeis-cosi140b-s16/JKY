The tacos are scrumptious indeed.  I was also quite keen on their selection of sauces- everything from the pico de gallo to the salsa verde was smashing.

But don't pass up the grocery itself! Their produce selection is cheap as chips (particularly in comparison to IGA); I purchased a mango, 4 limes, a grapefruit, a sack of onions, 3 avocados, and a tomato for approximately 10 dollars. Next time I pop in, I fully intend to sample some of their pastries- I do have a soft spot for conchas.
