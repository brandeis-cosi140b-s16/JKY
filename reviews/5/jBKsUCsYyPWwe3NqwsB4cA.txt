I am SO glad to find this! A guy from Mexico I dated took me here, and I've wanted to get back but could not remember the name. You know , if you're like me- I'm always looking & looking at little hole-in-the-wall Mexican places wondering:  gem? food poisoning? 6 :00 news "outing"? This is in the gem category. Be fearless, be confident. go eat there.
