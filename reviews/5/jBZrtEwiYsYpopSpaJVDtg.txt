This location is awesome! I made an order on the chipotle app and when I showed up it wasn't quite ready. They gave me a free drink while I waited and as they rushed to make my order, they gave 2 vouchers for free meals because I had to "wait". Johnny the manager is doing a wonderful job with his staff.
