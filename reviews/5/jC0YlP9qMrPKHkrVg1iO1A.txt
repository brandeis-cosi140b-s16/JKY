Tried to get in here several times and couldn't. Now I see why. It's excellent. I had the salad carbon with marinated steak. My wife had the machada burrito and mh daughter had the black bean tostada. We all loved it. Plenty of food as well. Good atmosphere and service.  A new favorite.  You won't be disappointed unless you can't get in.
