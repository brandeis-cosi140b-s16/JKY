Their fired grilled chicken is AMAZING! Along with their mild sauce! Love this place!! It's my favorite fast casual Mexican restaurant... I even like it more than chipotle... Crazy right? .....I have ordered somethings from Cafe Rio that I'll never order again... So if you have given this place a try & didn't like it... Try something different! Promise you'll became an addict like me! Ha!
