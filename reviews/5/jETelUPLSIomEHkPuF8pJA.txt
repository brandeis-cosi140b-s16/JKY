Taco de Adobada (spicy pork). Enough said. Hands down the best tacos. Better than King Taco/El Taurino. I hate that I have to miss these tacos... The one past San Diego is almost a 2 hour drive for me, but I'm always down for the drive! 

Description: order first! Pay after! There are different lines for different tacos. Choose wisely! I just get in the Adobada line and order a ton of spicy pork. 

First, 2 corn tortillas are dipped in the meat oil and is placed on the pan grill to sizzzzle. Omg!!!! Sounds fattening, but oh so good! The worker cuts slices of the flavorful and tender meat onto your tortilla- if you're lucky, you'll receive the crispier parts of the meat - texture is perfect and soooo good (you'll get what I mean when you order)! The worker will ask if you want everything (cilantro, onion, guacamole) - SAY EVERYTHING! Sometimes, if the worker is in a nice mood, he'll give you pineapple slices that is on top of the rotating meat! Dang, they don't skimp on the meat.

Too far? Just drive. :D 

Tips: ask for grilled green onions and jalepenos. Sooooo good! Don't forget your radish (sliced or whole) and limes at the cart!
