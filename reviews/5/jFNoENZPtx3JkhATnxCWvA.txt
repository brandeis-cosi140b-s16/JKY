Every time I am in San Diego or Las Vegas I have to make a stop here! They have the most delicious tacos I've ever had in my life. It is not easy getting your tacos here as the lines are absolutely insane. We stood in line today for 1 hour just to order....but well worth it! 

If you come you should: get the Adabada tacos. They are the only ones I've ever gotten and they are amazing! Each taco is $2.00. Best $2.00 ever spent. You will NOT be disappointed.
