We came with the kids because of all the reviews. First we had the most friendly and helpful servers, right away ready to explain what are their best dishes. We had the fish taco, the carnitas Mexicana taco and sopes with steak. Yes, it took a few minutes and worth every second because you could tell it was all fresh and homemade. Seriously, so incredibly good. Loved the easy casual atmosphere, and that you can order just a taco or 2 and don't have to commit to some big pricey "combination dinner" garbage! This is real fantastic Mexican and we can't wait to go back!!!
