We came up to this restaurant on our way to the Grand Canyon. Mini vacay with my family. Wow!! My first thought was... Love the decor!! Everything on the menu looks super good... We ordered fish tacos, ceviche tostadas, grilled fish with the specialty "marisa's sauce". Let me just say...omg!! Everything was DELICIOUS!!! After speaking with the owner, Marisa, great lady!! she mentioned she just open her restaurant a few months ago. Go try her dishes, I recommend it
