Back again in less then a week. they didn't disapoint.  Blame the heat outside or something but all I've been craving these past couple weeks are bbq and Mexican food. I just love eating at this place. It's probably the effort they did with dressing this place up mosaic tiles on the wall and tables, fixtures, flat screen tv on the wall, roofing on the walls, AC turned up. only complaint is that some of the seats are wooden benches and are soar after a while of seating. 

a lot of their items are also cheaper than roberto's or Maria's. both times I've spent about $5-6 for some food and drink. usually close to $8-9 other places. I usually always judge these places on their best Nacho dishes, almost a buck less, which I plan to get next time maybe by the end of this week.

my favorite Mexican restaurant. don't know if they serve alcohol but if they do I'd come here at nights too.
