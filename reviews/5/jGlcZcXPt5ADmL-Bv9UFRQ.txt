I love this place. By business partner (Beth) and I go for lunch a couple of times per week. This restaurant is always clean, and the staff is super, super nice. Don't forget to ask for the homemade hot sauce.

The decor is vibrant and inviting. They have a stage for entertainment, although I haven't seen any advertisement announcing any bands, etc, but just being in the restaurant makes you feel good.

I do hope that they can generate more business. I want to see them succeed. They really do have great food, and I love the little re-fried bean tortilla bowl that its served in. I have even thought about producing a video for them in exchange for food...its really that good.
