I love rubios's! It is by far my favorite spot to get quick burrito. Their food is really yummy! This rubio's will serve your taste buds with mouth-watering goodness. The staff is extremely friendly and always delivers prompt service, making an even better experience! I also appreciate how clean everything looks inside this rubio's because the rest of the AMC 30 parking lot looks like a dump! (I've often seen the staff diligently working towards picking up any mess they see and keeping a sharp appearance.) I  will visit this rubio's above any of the others because the environment it excellent!
