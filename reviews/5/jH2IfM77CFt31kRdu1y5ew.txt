I enjoyed the food and atmosphere from the first time I visited.  I have been going back for a few years now, and I am never disappointed.  However, every place has a drawback, and I would say the only thing I can complain about is the chips.  They serve chips and a really great salsa as a starter when you first sit down.  While the salsa is excellent, the chips they give you are almost stale tasting.  Not a big deal considering every other item I have tried, from the fish tacos, burritos, and most recently my girl had the steak fajitas and they were tremendous.  

Awsome service, friendly place, great specials, amazing food, whats up with the chips?
