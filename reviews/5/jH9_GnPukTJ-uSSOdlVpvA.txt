We have been going to Azteca for years now. Any chance we get to go to Phoenix (we live in chandler) we jump on it. We have referred so many of our friends and clients to Azteca- they all love it too.
There green chili and homemade tortillas are the best we've ever experienced.
All the food is fresh and very tasty.
The staff is so authentic and genuine in their care and service. The decor' is quite comfortable.
We love you Becky and staff.
