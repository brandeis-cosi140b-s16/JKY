This place is legit! Chilequiles like my mom makes them! Add chorizo! Great service from Ivette and a kick ass Bloody Mary. This place is decorated in such a way that makes you feel welcome and your eyes are always busy looking at the art that is placed there. All the staff there make you feel like family which is unusual for such a hipster haunt. Love it!! Everything I've ever had there has been excellent and beautifully plated.
