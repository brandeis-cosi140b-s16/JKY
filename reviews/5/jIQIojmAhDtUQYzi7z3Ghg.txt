We went to Fremont Street and we were starving! We walked in to the first available eatery and it happend to be one of the greatest food experiences of our lives! We had the Chinese cuisine: the server was hilarious and was very friendly and outgoing. The food itself was more than enough to keep me coming back! Very large portions and every morsel was a tantalizing delight. We loved it and highly recommend.  Hopefully the tacos and pizza will be as good as the Chinese food for the next time we come to Vegas! 
P.s. No veggies in Vegas!
