My husband and I stumbled on this place after we went to a Mesa museum. We were hungry and everything was closed because it was a Sunday. This great taco truck uses fresh ingredients! I got a carnita taco and it was so tasty and very cheap. Great tortilla and the pork was awesome. I highly recommend!
