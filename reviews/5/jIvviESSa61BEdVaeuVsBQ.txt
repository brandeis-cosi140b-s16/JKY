I loved the Adobada Pork Chop! Always ask your waiter what their fave dish is, everywhere you go. We did that here and ended up with the best meal of our lives. The pork chop is served with a sauce over it and I can't remember what it was, but I would drink it if it came in a glass. I dipped the side of spinach in it and altogether the flavors worked well. A little pricey, but well worth it!
