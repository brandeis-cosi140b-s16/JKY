What to eat.... Anything! It's all delicious. Before a show, get a burrito. I have had all of them. You can't go wrong. After a show, get nachos! They are killer. In fact, I'm going to get them after Twin Sister this week. I recommend getting to a show early to get a bite to eat and to get a good spot inside. It seems that most people arrive later to shows.

What to drink... Honey Badger! So delicious and does the trick. Honey bourbon and ginger beer. YUM. 

What to see.. Any show is amazing in the ballroom... So far I have seen; CSS, tUnE yArDs, Starfucker, and Poolside. I have tickets for Twin Sister and Young the Giant. Shows are reasonable. The most I have paid for a show was $26 and the least was $5.

You can also just visit without seeing a show. It's so fun to hang out in the lounge to eat and drink. Most of the time, you can still hear the show if you are sitting inside. 

*be aware... shows actually start an hour or two after doors open. You may have to wait.
