i have been there three times  or four times this month and i get the (cali ) surf & turf burritos with ( fries inside the burrito ) .  these burritos are 8.99 each that not a cheep burrito by a long shot, but its one  of the best thing i ever eaten ever and that's
saying a lot and they are worth every cent. if try to eat only half of this thing the other half will be calling you from the fridge in less than an hour later,
it's made with savory steak &  tender gulf shrimp and there a sauce with fries inside. they should be on food network the best
thing i ever ate!!!!!!!!!!!!. i buy three when i go so that we can all have our own.
