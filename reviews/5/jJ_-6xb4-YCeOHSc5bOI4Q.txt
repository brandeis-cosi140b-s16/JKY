We have wanted to check this place out for a weeks now. So mad we didn't come sooner. Great menu for our family of three. Awesome prices and the food was amazing. Chips weren't overly like most places. They were fresh and warm! Alexa the manager came over to our table and introduced herself to us and thanked us for coming in. That goes along way with me. The entire staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Thank you for coming to the University area. We will be back for sure!
