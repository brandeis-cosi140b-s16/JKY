I always am on the look out for some great Mexican food and honestly, I dont find many places that would "wow" me.  

My find is over..  My girlfriend suggested we go here after going through a list of 5 or so places.  She wanted Mexican, but we wanted to change from the usual places.  Valle Luna came up and we hurried over.  We walked in to find a slew of people waiting to be seated.  They said it would be about a 20min wait.  Not too bad. My girlfriend asked if they had any spots in the bar and we headed that way.

it felt like a Mexican sports bar!  ...the bar side did.  We found a nice booth with a few TV's around and within a few minutes, a waitress came over to take our order.  

Im huge on chips n salsa and one thing I love is when they bring out hot sauce along with the salsa.  If hot sauce is there, I rarely touch the salsa.  They had it!!  I love and hate chips at the same time.  You can easily fill up on chips before your main dish comes out.  I tried to stop, but I just keep snacking.. Yummm.!

I ordered a shredded beef chimichanga and when they brought it out, it looked and smelled amazing.  Covered with sour cream, lettuce and a side of re-fried beans and Spanish rice.  I went to town.  It was one of the best chimichangas Ive had. 

I found my mexican restaurant!!

We came back later in the week for lunch..  loved it again!
