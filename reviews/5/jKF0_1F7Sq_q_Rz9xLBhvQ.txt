That burrito though! So amazing in my tummy give me more! I will definitely be back for another well prepared bacon, egg, cheese, and potato burrito. Better than the rest....you won't be disappointed and you may even have some left over. I saw on the drive thru window that they now offer a "King size" burrito or something to that affect which is crazy considering the size of the regular one. 
Anyway, it's delicious, very well seasoned, tasty tortilla, two thumbs up!
