I love this place. Finally good mexican food. The guacamole patron was outstanding.  They made it exactly how I like it. My husband had a  traditional non alcoholic drink "Horchata" witch was to die for. I had a home made sangria and loved it. Not too sweet, that was just perfect.  Food was good I  dont like too spicy so they made it just right . Its about time they have vallet parking because the first time I was there it was had to find parking. I would definitely be back .
