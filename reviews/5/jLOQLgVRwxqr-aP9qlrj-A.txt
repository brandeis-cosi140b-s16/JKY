Super!  When you team Chef Kelly Fletcher with Sommelier David M Johnson you know you're going to experience magic. Achiote Salmon was a great flavor festival in my mouth.  We also tried the braised short rib which as good as we have ever had. Love the creativity of the food and the large (and well priced) wine list. Check it out!!
