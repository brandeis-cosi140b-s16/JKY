mmmm street tacos!!!!

We came here to buy some groceries to make chicken tortilla soup and some quesadillas.  They have a good selection and all the produce looks pretty fresh.  Considering how small the space is, they sure did pack in a lot of inventory!!

They take credit card, there's a reasonable amount of street parking, they carry all the standard supplies, the prices are reasonable, and did I mention the STREET TACOS :D!

Seriously, the street tacos are yummmmy!!  They're definitely bigger portions than the typical street tacos, but I' won't complain :)  They didn't have my go-to Al Pastor meat, but their carnitas were really good!

Definitely going to be making more trips to Las Palmas!
