My two girlfriends started working at Braddahs so my boyfriend and I decided to try it out. The feel of the place is fun and lively. It's very enjoyable to eat in.

We tried the kalua nachos and huli huli chicken burrito. The meat was so delicious, it was almost like eating Hawaii home cooked food. Makes me "mmm" with every bite. The prices are very good too. Christiane & Chynna provided excellent service. They greeted and conversed with us as well as customers really well. Very good aloha from them and the food.
