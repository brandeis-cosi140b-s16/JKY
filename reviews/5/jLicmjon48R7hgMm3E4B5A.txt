Best authentic Mexican food in Phoenix that I have ever had! They have an amazing salsa bar with flavors I never could have thought to be salsas. I have the mahi burro and it was awesome. Everything made from scratch down to the tortillas. It's in a kind of "rough" location, but don't let that stop you from this place!
