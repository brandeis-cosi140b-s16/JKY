Went here last night to grab drinks with a friend and had a blast.  The place was pretty empty in the downstairs bar so the bartender was at our service.  I didn't catch his name, but he has a shaved head and makes the best drinks!  The gin gimlet was perfect, not too strong or too sweet.  The dirty Stoli martini was even better....oh how I love a good martini!  Then he took the reigns with our drinks after that.  My friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle.  Both were sweet but delicious!  And I had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini.  Don't judge me on the appletini!  I just wanted a green drink!  They were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for $5 a plate.  They were huge bites for only $5 a piece and I loved the sauces that came with it.  I'm coming back for sure, but only if the bartender is there!  I love the drinks!  Put anything in a martini glass and I'm there!
