I am in love with their red sangria. So delicious!
A tip if you don't have a reservation, if you arrive a few minutes before opening and wait in line, you can almost always get a seat at the bar and the bartenders are awesome.
The food is fantastic. I'm in love with the street corn. The description sounds a little scary (mayo in corn?!?) but it is delicious. 
We are also fans of their queso fundido. Super creamy, just the right amount of spice, and the warm tortillas are awesome. We could easily have made a meal of just the corn and queso. 
The tacos are fantastic as well, we've tried carnitas, pollo asado, and baja and all have been fantastic. They also run specials that change nightly.
The vibe here is dark and a little loud. It can be a bit difficult to see your feed or talk to your dining companions, not somewhere I would go for s romantic night out. But the music is normally awesome, and they have a few seats outside if you want to check those out.
