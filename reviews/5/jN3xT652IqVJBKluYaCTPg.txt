This is the best fast food you can get in the hood. I live in the Garfield, and used to frequent Salsitas on 16th & Roosevelt,  but over the past year the quality is lacking.

The bf and I were super stoked to find this place! They're open late, and the food is ALWAYS fresh.

Literally this is the only fast food place I willingly order rice, it's never old and hard (EW) 

The best part is the excellent customer service.  This place is a total dive so it was unexpected.

Anyways,  embrace the window riddled with bullet holes,  the 50 cent fee for paying with card,  and the gnarly location where multiple shootings/stabbings have taken place. All that matters is the food is consistently good.
