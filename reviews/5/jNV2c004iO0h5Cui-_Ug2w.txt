The food here is great! Huge portions and great quality. Not the usual AZ Mexican restaurant. I will definitely be making this a regular stop. Our server Emily is fantastic. She's very attentive and went out of her way to make sure everything was perfect. Next time I'm going to save some room for their delicious looking desserts.
