5 stars are for their breakfast burrito. Only $2-3 bucks, and I'll usually get them through the drive thru. It is greasy and cheesy with ham sometimes bacon.  They may use 3 eggs, not too sure.  You will be stuffed after this burrito--I usually have to share with a co-worker.  I come here just for the breakfast burrito but too bad they stop serving it after 10 or maybe it's 11.  It makes me feel greasy-maybe not the best way to start a day but a great way to fill a craving.
