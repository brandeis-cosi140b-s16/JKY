Going to the Strip makes me wish I had more than one stomach. I'm not a Pittsburgher; I visit because my boyfriend has family here and on our trips I get fed pretty well. That said, I've recently started making sure that some of the limited real estate in my stomach gets dedicated to eating in the Strip, with the biggest parcel of space going to La Palapa. Admittedly, I have a soft spot for Mexican food, perhaps because although I live in Kentucky now, I grew up in Southern California. Let me say that I'm not grading on a curve based on what may or may not be available in the region. La Palapa is good, period.

You'll find the stall in the Public Market under the thatched roof that is the business's namesake. On each visit I've been served by the same very friendly man (likely the owner?). I get whatever tamales are available and they've always been great. They're corn husk tamales (as opposed to banana leaf). I challenge you to pick a favorite between the red and the green sauces. The beans and rice should not be missed. I'm normally more of a pinto bean girl but these black beans are seriously great. I hope to eventually try the empanadas but again, just one stomach, so we'll see if I ever make it that far.

In the event that a tourist is reading this, the address that is currently listed on the Yelp page is the South Side location. This review is specifically for the location in The Strip, which is in the Public Market on 2401 Penn Avenue.
