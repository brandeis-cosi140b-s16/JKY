I'll be honest, when my husband pulled into the parking lot of "this great place he read about on Yelp", I was extremely skeptical.  It looks like just a little hole in the wall restaurant from the outside. I decided to play it safe and order the Paradise CHZ with smoked mozzarella, my rather picky children both got the kids cheeseburger meal, and my husband ordered the Country Fried burger.  Despite the place being pretty busy, we didn't have to wait very long for our food to be delivered to our table.  They did forgot one of the kids meals however they whipped it up for us in no time at all.  

Let me just say, my burger was AMAZING.  I truthfully don't think I've ever had a better burger.  Even my kids who tend to only like macaroni and cheese or chicken fingers love their burgers.  The french fries were delicious too.  Nice and crispy just the way I like.  Not soggy, not burnt; they were cooked perfectly.

The milkshakes...oh the milkshakes.  SO delicious.  None of that fake strawberry syrup junk, real strawberries!  While we did order a chocolate shake as well, I can't tell you if it was as good as the strawberry shake simply because my kids and husband drank it all before I got a taste, lol.

If I could give this place bonus points I would.  Why?  Because they have to-go boxes set out on the counter so you don't even have to ask.
