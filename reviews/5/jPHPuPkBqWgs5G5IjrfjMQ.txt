This is the original Phoenix Fusion.. with Chinese and Mexican with a tad of Jamaican in there. I usually get one of their specialty meats on a bowl of Jerk Chicken Rice... they have just enough options that you can mix and match that it will keep you coming back to try more. Most of the meals include a homemade snicker-doodle. That cookie alone will bring you back through the door. With that said I cant write anymore I'm out to go get me some of that DELICIOUS CHINO BANDIDO!!!!
