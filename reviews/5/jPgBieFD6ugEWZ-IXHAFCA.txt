This is the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas! My mom is Hispanic and I grew up on her home made enchiladas and the ones I had here were even better than hers! I told all my friends to go. It's a little hidden in the shopping center but I hope business picks up for them soon! I'll definitely go back :)
