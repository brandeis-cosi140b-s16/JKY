I travel to Mexico quite a bit and the food in Mexico isn't at all the same as most Mexican food here in the States.  There are a few and I mean very few places in phoenix where you can get Tacos like they serve on the streets in Mexico.  Juan Jaime's is as close as I have found although they use a slightly larger tortilla than most street Taco vendors in the homeland.  This place is great for lunch and we get in and out fairly quick.  At night it is also good and sometimes gets a nice bar crowd.  It has a great atmosphere as well!  I like it Mucho!
