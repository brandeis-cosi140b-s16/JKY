Due to the shatty location of this place, I will only go during broad daylight. Besides that, this place is the freaking best mexican restaurant I have been to. Ever.  It is the Kreme on my Krispy!

This place is a breath of fresh air in a city full of chain restaurants and does NOT have a dissappointing item on its menu.  

See you there!
