Updating my previous review of Paco's Tacos due to an interesting development..

As I indicated originally they did not have a real hot sauce option.  Stop the presses!  They have a Ghost Chili sauce now that is.. dare I say.. sweet?!?  Seriously it tastes like dried ghost chilis, reconstituted with vinegar and mixed with honey - there is probably more to it than that but it doesn't matter - all you need to know is this stuff packs some heat.  Seriously, go light on it if you are not used to very spicy food.

Also the carnitas have become my new favorite, I'm quite certain they are some of the best in town.  Don't take my word for it though, try 'em.
