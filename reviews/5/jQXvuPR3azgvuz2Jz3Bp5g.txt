We may have found our new quick Mexican food place. I personally like this place far better than Roberto's. 

The menu comes they basic Mexican food groups and the portions are larger than I expected. 

Hubby had the shredded beef chimichanga and I had the carne asada nachos. We both ordered ours with some changes (no cheese inside the chimichanga and sour cream and avocado sauce on the side for his and mine). 

We visited the salsa bar while waiting for our food and we ended up trying all of the salsas. I also loaded up on limes and jalapenos. 

Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. And it was delicious. We ended up sharing my nachos and we still didn't finish all of them. 

We're definitely coming back to try other stuff on the menu...can't wait!
