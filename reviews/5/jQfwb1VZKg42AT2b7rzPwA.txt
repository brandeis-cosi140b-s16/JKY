Definitely a family staple.I'm not sure what some of the negative reviews are about. It's family owned/operated and has been around for YEARS.
It has never once smelled of anything but food when I walked in (and smoking is not allowed indoors in Phoenix- hasn't been for YEARS). The restaurant is well lit as is the parking lot.
They keep the chips and salsa coming - FOR FREE.
Their food is homemade, not canned. Their salsas are fresh and flavorful, though none have a real kick.
The only thing I have tried and didn't like were the fajitas. They were definitely not the same kind of fajitas you would get at a more Americanized Mexican restaurant. I've never tasted any weird touches or after tastes in their food. It tastes as authentic as anyone in my family has made or anything I had even in Mexico.
