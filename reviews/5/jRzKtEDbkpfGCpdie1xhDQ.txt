I lived in Phoenix for about 7 months during 2011 and the one-time meal I had here was one of the culinary highlights.

Found it by Yelping and was not disappointed. Not the most affordable meal by any stretch. More like LA/NY prices but definitely worth it.

Visited around 5pm on a weekday and the place was dark. It's supposed to be dark, I was told. I ordered the steak and shrimp tacos and they were excellent. From the moment my face started to melt (was sitting at the bar near the grill) to the moment I saw the cheese melt on the plate, I was hooked the whole way...and then I ate the whole thing in 4 minutes. Fully Yelp-driven, that was my one and only visit.


I can't wait to go back.
