We finally ventured out to try this new place today, and were pleasantly surprised by the addition to our neighborhood! We both had the Cubano torta, which consisted of a nice thin black forest ham, carnitas style pulled pork, melty Swiss cheese, thin fresh pickles, and a habanero mustard on a fresh hoagie roll done panini style. I loved it! I added more yellow mustard to mine, but the fella enjoyed his dressed as is. Both came with chips and salsa, I ordered a side of delicious fresh guacamole with mine. We also shared a side of onion rings which were beer battered and perfectly fried. I had a Pi√±a agua fresca which was not too sweet as well.
The decor is nice, with almost a touch of posh, and the seating areas are expansive. There are tables out on Third Street, little booth/bistro tables on one end, and armchairs with small tables on the other. We sat in a comfy booth with just enough room for our plates, and remarked on the way out how we should have set up outside. Also did not sample the extensive beer selection or coffee and gelato offering. Next visit it's affogatos on the stoop, y'all!
