Had the steak fajitas here to go on a late night when. The town is very dead so I was not expecting anything great. When I saw the price it seemed expensive, $20.95, but it was well worth it. Some of the best fajitas I have ever had. Came with a nice freshly chopped salsa, lettuce, cheese, rice and beans. The best part was the steak from the fajita excellent quality meat.
