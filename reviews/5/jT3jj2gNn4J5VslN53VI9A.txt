So good to get the word out about the fantastic sauces...

could be used as great cocktails by themselves...do not miss...

flew in from the east coast and my sister brought to me for breakfast and I shared with the wife...wow, it blew away the competition with fresh cover thang over burro, like a crepe? 
 I could read the paper thru it!!!  Nevah expected that from a modest shop by a gas station even in Highway 66 country. 
I was pleasantly filled 'till nightfall...
