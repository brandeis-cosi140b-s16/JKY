When I feel like great mexican food, this place is as good as it gets, and I'm not even mexican (I'm central american).


Whether its weekend or weekday for lunch, La Merced NEVER disappoints me.  Today I had a Chicken Mole plate and it was DELISH!  My second favorite dish here, during lunch rush, is 4 street tacos (2 lengua and 2 asada).  

The drinks are amazing too.  You can have an Horchata or a fruit drink that is blended right there while you wait.  I have a friend that always has to have the Strawberry water (without cream).  

The prices are decent, and the staff is always very friendly.  Some days I get an extra treat, and get to watch the Barcelona football match on TV.  

Today there was a gentleman playing guitar during lunch hour (on a weekend), and he played a Man√° song for my cousin and I.  I had a great lunch, watching soccer, listening to great music, and enjoying a great Mole.  

Keep up the work you guys.  For anyone not familiar with non-northern mexican food, this place has Mexico City Style mexican food...I would definitely recommend it.  Who knows, someday you may be qualified to try the Torta Gigante.  Which I've only had once because it is a huge deal.
