My West Valley go to place for fast Mexican food. The winners here are the hashbrown burrito, carne asada fries, and cali chicken burrito. 

Top choice:  California Chicken Burrito. There's something about the crunchy fries mixing with the savory chicken, cheese, sour cream, and love that oozes amazing! 

Overall, the food quality is fresh, consistent, and delicious with a great value for the price you pay. 

Exemplary customer service. The staff is always smiling, always joking, and always helpful. 

Hungover? They serve SCRUMPTIOUS menudo on Saturday and Sunday morning. Better get there fast otherwise it will be gone by 10 AM.
