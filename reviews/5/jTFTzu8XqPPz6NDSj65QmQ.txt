This is actually a new business with a new name and owner.  I don't know how it was before, but their elotes are just awesome, and the chamoyadas are ABSOLUTELY out of this world (just ask for them w/out peanuts).  There is a sitting area if you want to eat in, as they serve all sort of antojitos.  If you want AUTHENTIC Mexican flavor, this is your kind of place.
