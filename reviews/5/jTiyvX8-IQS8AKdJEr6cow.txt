We hired Taqueria Guadalajara for a grad party yesterday. I read the reviews before hiring them but was a little nervous because reservation was made online rather than person to person. I did call Friday to confirm and the gentleman I spoke with knew exactly who I was and the time of my event. The mother- daughter pair (Blancas) arrived  on time and ready to go! The set up was incredible and the food was fabulous. THeir salsa and condiment bar was the best I have seen- so many salsas and vegies. The ladies were friendly and professional and our 50 guests were all impressed. We have many family functions and parties at our house and I would say that this was in the top three for parties. Couldn't have asked for anything more. I will look for a reason to use them again because it was so good.
