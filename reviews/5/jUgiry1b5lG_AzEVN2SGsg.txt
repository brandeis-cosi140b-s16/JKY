If you have never tried Filiberto's and are looking for good Mexican food, I recommend giving these guys a chance. They have many items to choose from on their menu and if you aren't sure of something, their staff will explain an item to you and tell you in very good descriptions what it is or entails. They have really good salsas, but be warned....their Tomatillo salsa (green sauce) is hot and has some kick to it! 

If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend their Flan and also their Tres Leches Cake. Both of these desserts are delicious and offer just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy even the finickiest of eaters. 

My favourite meal is their Enchilada plate and it's enough of a meal that I usually eat half for dinner and the rest for lunch the following day. It is just filling enough for me. If you want an appetizer-type of item, I recommend the Rolled Tacos with your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and in choices of 3 or 5.

If you like Horchata, then you are most likely to love theirs. It is just perfect!
