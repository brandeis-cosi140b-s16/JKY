This place is really good!! It exceeded my expectation as far as what I heard. I really love little family owned joints like this just because I feel as though the workers care a little more about the food and over all its a more homey feel. No commercial franchise nonsense. The tacos i had were amazing, i had a bite of my friends red chile burrito... amazing. The salsa was awesome. I can't wait to go back :)
