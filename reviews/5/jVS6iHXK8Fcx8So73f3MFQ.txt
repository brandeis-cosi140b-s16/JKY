I have visited Las Lupitas no less than 5 times since I discovered it a couple of months back (Thanks Yelp peeps!) - just good legit Mexican. My standard run is Las Lupitas for a pound each of  barbacoa (best one IMO), carnitas, chicken, and tortillas and a half a pound of queso fresco (the verde salsa at the counter is also a "go to"). Consistently good and friendly staff.  For an authentic experience stop right down the road at compare foods grocery and pick up some onions, cilantro, fresh peppers, avocado, and some cerveza and limes and you will have all you need for a great meal with friends, plus some likely leftovers.
