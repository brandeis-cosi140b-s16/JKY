Found La Comida by accident wandering around Saturday afternoon on Fremont with the hubby walking our mutt. patio seating was pet friendly. prickly pear and blood orange margaritas are dangerous!! we had 2 each before we knew what was happening. food was spectacular. service was prompt and pleasant. excellent atmosphere. not your typical Mexican food. we will definitely be back.
