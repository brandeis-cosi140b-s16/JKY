This is one of my favorite Mexican fast food restaurants. It's clean and cool in the summer. It's neal the theater and my house. You can alway ask for more meat without extra charge. Of course, they will charge you if you ask two spoun more. :-)

The parking space is not as big as the store and it's crowed over the weekend.
