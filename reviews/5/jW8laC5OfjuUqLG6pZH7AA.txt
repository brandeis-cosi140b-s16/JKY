The Taco Bros are a great addition to the downtown Madison area. I love Mexican food (and tacos in general), so I've come to sample quite a few restaurants in the area! When we walked in, the chef/worker for the night took our orders. He was in the middle of preparing another meal, but memorized two orders quickly to be next in line. In less than 10 minutes, he had delivered food to the other table and created an entire meal for us too! 
We ordered 3 tacos each, so we both got a side of rice and beans. Furthermore, each taco comes with chips. I had asked to buy queso, but he threw it in for free. All the meanwhile, he was incredibly friendly and provided the best service. Definitely tip your worker there! They provide AMAZING food and in a timely fashion. I know Taco Bros will definitely trump Qdoba or another restaurant in the future.
