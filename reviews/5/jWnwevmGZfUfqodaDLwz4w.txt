I had never eaten at the steel cactus, not for any specific reason, but I was out with my girls, and wanted to stop for drinks. It was a slow Monday night, but our server James made it such a fun experience! The entire restaurant was just a fun environment to enjoy some delicious drinks with your friends, but I would definitely request James as my server when I go back in to ensure the best time possible. I highly recommend it. Also the avocados were sliced to perfection.
