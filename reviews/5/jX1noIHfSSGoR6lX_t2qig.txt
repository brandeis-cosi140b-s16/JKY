I would walk 500 miles to get these delicious tacos, okay okay maybe drive 500 miles. The serving size is generous with fresh ingredients. The green sauce is amazing! They are prepared on 100% corn tortillas, this is important since I am gluten-free (Celiac). The prices are very reasonable too. This family owned business has the best tacos I have had in a very long time.
