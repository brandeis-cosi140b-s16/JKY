This place is awesome!  Clean and colorful, with excellent service, and the place was full on a Labor Day afternoon.   We had the shrimp with the green sauce and fish tacos.  Super tasty.  Ice cold Negro Modela on tap, 24 oz for $5 is unbeatable!   Wish the bar area was bigger but overall this place rocks.
