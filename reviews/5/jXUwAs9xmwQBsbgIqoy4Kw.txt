This was my second time eating here and I had to yelp it. First the service is genuinely warm and welcoming, like you're part of the family. You're greeted right away usually by the owner Frank himself. You can tell he takes pride in his restaurant and it really shows in the food. Amazing mexican food! This time around I had the Chile Verde burrito. The pork was tender and flavor packed. Not greasy or fatty like at some places, just the perfect balance. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for some great authentic mexican cooking! Also they are now open on Saturday's.
