Came here and wasn't sure what to expect. I was VERY pleasantly surprised!!  I loved how the staff gave you samples, explained how the ordering system worked, and were super friendly.
I had the BBQ pork, the jade chicken, pork fried rice, & refried beans. I really enjoyed the chicken, though the pork wasn't as good as I thought. I mixed the rice & beans together- super yummy! 
My favorite part of the meal by far was the snickerdoodles. They're thick, warm, & the perfect texture. It's a random addition, but a good one!
I ended getting additional cookies. They're so yummy!

Definitely will be coming back!!
