Swung by yesterday with the GF to see what all the fuss was about & we were very happy that we did! The staff was very friendly & answered all the questions we had. Every dish they pulled out for guests looked amazing! My GF ordered the Chimichanga & she loved it. There was even a couple sitting by us that asked what that was & they decided to order it! 

Sodas are canned or bottled so if you're used to having 5 drinks at a restaurant (like me) you're gonna end up spending more on sodas than your entree! I recommend this place to anyone wanting to get away from the strip & just relax & enjoy a meal. You can tell there's a lot of pride in this family owned restaurant & we will definitely go back when we are in town!
