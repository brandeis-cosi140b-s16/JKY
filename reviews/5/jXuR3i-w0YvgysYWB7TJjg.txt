Great overall experience! As soon as we got in our server was very attentive and very professional. Even though it seemed pretty busy, he never bent under pressure. The food was superb! I love the home made tortilla chips and salsa, very original. I also ordered the Carlos Cartinas dinner, and it was awesome! I'm very pleased with the overall experience, so I give it a rocking 5 stars! Cheers to Carlos O'Brien restaurant the Best Irish/ Mexican Cuisine in the valley!
