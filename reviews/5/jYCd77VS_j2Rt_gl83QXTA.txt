This place is the business! best MEXICAN  restaurant on the east side!!! although i don't ever dine in (just because it so small, and a place like this you wanna take your time and savor every bite!.....that great!....and i don't want people giving me the evil over  over a table). Its so worth it. I recommend the Hurache and Alambres but everything on the menu is great thats just my personal FAVORITE.
