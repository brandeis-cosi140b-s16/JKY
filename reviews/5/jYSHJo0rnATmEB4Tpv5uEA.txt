YUM. Seriously. YUM!!!! Everything is delicious. The chicken is spicy- - just the way I like it. (A little too much for my kiddos so they stick to other choices.)  Staff is usually wonderful (I have had the occasional experience with a less-than-fabulous staff member - but, I figure, we are all human).

The food is delicious and made right in front of you.  I read previous reviews and in my experience, when any one item is on the verge of running out, the server is quick to request more from the kitchen staff (who have always been busy at their station).  I've never had to wait for more than a few seconds for any item to be replenished.

The addition of a kid's menu to Chipotle is the best idea since sliced bread. My kids, who would never dream of eating beans of any type, readily eat them when ordering the "taco kit" - it's 2 tortillas (soft or crunchy) + ANY 3 items... we usually get pinto beans, cheese and their AWESOME guacamole + drink + tiny bag of chips.  Kids are happy, parents are happy.. WIN WIN!

This location has offered margaritas for awhile now on their menu but in reality is still waiting for liquor license to be processed.  So they are not actually available yet.

The indoor and outdoor dining areas as well as the restrooms have always been clean.  Highest rating for Chipotle on every point!
