Cafe Rio greater than Chipotle

That's really all you need to know right? In the battle for the best burrito place in Vegas Cafe Rio is the big cheese- and that's because they actually have QUESO. Creamy, delicious, liquid cheese will fix just about any problem a restaurant has. Here is a short guide to Cafe Rio

1. Get a burrito- yes they have other things, the other things are not as good as the burrito.

2. Sauce spicyness +1 - the sauces are all extremely mild so whatever level of spice you would usually get you probably want to kick it up a notch

3. Enchilada style- this is where they douse your burrito in sauce and cheese before toasting it. Essential. 

4. Acceptable meats in order: pork, steak... thats it. They have shrimp and chicken but they are nowhere near as good so best to avoid

5. Chips and Queso- this ties the meal together. The chips are actually pretty decent and while the queso isn't white (the holy grail of cheese dips is white queso with jalapenos) it is still by far the best option in town. 


A negative reviewer laments that they put guac outside the burrito... well if you ask them to put it inside they do, not sure Cafe Rio should be punished for people not knowing how to order food.
