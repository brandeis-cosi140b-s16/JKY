Five stars because I just had the best tacos (of this type) in my entire life at this place!

Yes, this is a fast food environment, yes they serve the food on paper plates, yes you bus your own table etc. etc. Who cares? Does everything have to be Durant's? The fact is, they do Mexican basics better than just about anyone. 

I had shredded beef tacos and a single chicken soft taco. Both were the best in their class I have had in my life--including those I've had on trips to Mexico. The hard shell is done in a similar style to what you would find at Filiberto's The soft taco, well, is was a soft taco, but made with Carolina's famous tortillas. Both were a perfect combination of spice, meat, and cheese, with the usual lettuce thrown on as an after thought. The salsa you get out of the little pumps by the soda fountain was also very good. 

Housed in an old Fazoli's or Pizza Hut or something, the atmosphere and appearance is similar to one of the newer Filiberto's, but the food sets it apart from the rest. 

Oh, and it is cheap. 

Love it!
