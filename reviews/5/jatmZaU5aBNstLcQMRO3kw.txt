Will it creep you out if I tell you that I think about Mariscos Sinaloa every day? I swear that I wake up wanting their shrimp cocktail. This place is outstanding. The food is amazing. I love their fresh, vibrant seafood cocktails which can include shrimp, octopus, oysters, scallops, you name it. My husband swears by the smoked marlin taco, which is cheesy, smokey and divine. We both crave the crab stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon. The shrimp in their homemade cream and mushroom sauce is decadent and so delicious. The servers are kind and wonderful and always ready to suggest their favorites. As a sauce freak, this place is heaven for me. Six kinds of hot sauce on the table, plus four squeeze bottles of sauces for your entree for your dipping and mixing pleasure. The oysters are fresh and delicious. The beer is cold and served in icy glasses with salt and lime. Buckets of 5 full size beers for 10 bucks. Oh, and everything is affordably priced? Yes, the banda music is at full volume but you won't even notice it between swigs of your michelada and the jumbo succulent shrimp stuffed into a pepper then wrapped in bacon and dipped into a creamy chipotle sauce. Okay, I'm leaving right now. See you there!
