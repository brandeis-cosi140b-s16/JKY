11/28/2014 Decided to check out this new restaurant that had just opened in my neighborhood and was pleasantly surprised by the wait staff that was extremely attentive. 

I was Pleasantly surprised when ordering a pitcher of beer with chips/salsa our waiter consistently came back and refilled glass's from our pitcher, really nice touch! Didn't have any food on this visit so I will update the next time I stop in. So far so good.
