THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN! 

Mi Pueblo has been my favorite Mexican food for years! Forget the chains and the greasy taco places. Mi Pueblo is authentic and fresh tasting. They don't use lard yet their food still tastes so traditional.

It is NOT fancy inside. You order at the counter and help yourself to their delicious hot chips and their zippy fresh salsa. The family that owns the place is so nice. They never mess up an order even complicated ones. 

The food is incredible. My husbands favorites include the fish tacos, twin chimis, and the green chili pork. I love the chili relleno, the enchiladas, and the bean tostada. Try them for breakfast too! Huge plates of egg dishes, potatoes, beans and tortillas. Perfect hangover remedy! And I think they serve menudo too!

Everything is reasonably priced. You spend half as much as if you would going to Valle Luna or Macayos and the food is 10x better. We have ordered their party trays before for football parties and for our wedding rehearsal dinner. For under 40 bucks you can get a gigantic tray full of mini tacos, chimis, and quesadillas. They are supposed to feed 8-10 but they are big enough to feed more than that!
Mmmmm...
