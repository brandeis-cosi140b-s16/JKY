Pretty damn good I must say, their beans are crazy, outa this world, so the bean n cheese burro's are worthy of a drive for me. The Barbacoa? Amazing...Asada? a little bland but quality beef so its pretty good, its all grilled on a charcoal (?) bbq rt off to the right, under the exhaust hoods...The salsas are some of the better I have had, but not hot enough..LOL...Overall a high quality, VERY consistent product, I urge everyone to give it a try if your in the neighborhood. BTW, the location is a little tricky for 1st timers, its on 59th about half a block north of Camelback. Its a lg strip mall and its rt next to the auto parts store...
