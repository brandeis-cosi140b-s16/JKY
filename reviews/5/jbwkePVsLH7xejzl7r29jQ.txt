flavorful, gourmet, worth-your-money Spanish/Mexican food! 5/5

I was blown away by the wonderful, delicious meal from La Hacienda last weekend. We started the meal with platter of fried cheese and spinach salad. They were good! For entree, I got a huge plate of sucking pig with thick, creamy sauce on the side. J got a steak. Both of our entree was just delicious! Of course, we each ordered a glass of La Hacienda margarita. They are to die-for! Thick, sour, sweet, lemon-ish margarita. For dessert, we had a glass of banana, creamy rice pudding topped with caramel... great grand finale for a great dinner.
