Came here for lunch with co-workers and we were ALL very pleased with both the food and service! Happy to find a Mexican restaurant with a good rice/beans situation. Our server was great. Very nice and prompt with food,drinks and bill. I know this place has been around for a while, wish I would've checked it out sooner now.
