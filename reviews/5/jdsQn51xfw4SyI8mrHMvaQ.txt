DELICIOUS Mexican Food! I was there the day they opened and had the seafood soup-7 Mares and I LOVED it. 

I have been back quite a few times and every dish I have had, I have nothing but Good things to say and one word says it all-DELICIOUS. 

The fresh guacamole dip is a perfect appetizer with the chips and yummy salsa.  

If you are a soup lover like me don't forget your Tortilla soup before your main entree ;) DELICIOUS! Perfect little cup of a tasty soup.

Friendly Staff, and Reasonable Prices. Can't wait to have the Menudo Dish...my next victom :)
