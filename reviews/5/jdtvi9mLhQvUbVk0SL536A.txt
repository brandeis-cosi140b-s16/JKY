First off the place has a home style vibe. Outside has a little patio with heaters for when it's cold. The prices are super cheap and worth it. Bean dip is awesome with the chips. Service was good and fast. I got the #11 which was cheese enchiladas with a tamale and my gf got the #1 which was these cheese enchilada a hard taco. Both were good. I would def come back
