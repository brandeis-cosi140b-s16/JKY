i try and go to the mom and pop place every time i take the 25 min drive from west phoenix area, and i must say they have never disappointed me.   We like them so much we have include their food in or holiday party for the past 5+ years. 

Today i picked up our holiday order, and Lisa is allways a charm, keep up the good work, and food.

We need more places like this.
