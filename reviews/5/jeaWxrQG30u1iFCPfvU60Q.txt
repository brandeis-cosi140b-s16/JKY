Salud!!!  To the chef who brings you to her home the flavors of generations come shining through!!!!!  My third visit from New York and each time this is what is great about Phoenix....wish you would open your New York branch or at the very least share the recipe for the mole....don't miss El Bario Cafe a real treat
