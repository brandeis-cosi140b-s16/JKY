I've been to this Rubio's several times and never had a bad experience. This time I tried the pan seared shrimp enchilada combo. It was delicious. Usually I have the 2 fish taco especial plate. So far I've only had seafood entrees and they've all been great. The staff is always very friendly. I just wish they were open later.
