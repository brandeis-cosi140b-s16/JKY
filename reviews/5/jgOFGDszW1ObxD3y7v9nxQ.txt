GREAT PLACE!! I have eaten at this hole-in-the-wall more times then I would like to admit (I work near by) and I have tried everything on the menu and would definitely say it is all excellent. The combos/fusions are crazy but, somehow they work!

Try it - you will like it! 

My only negative is that depending on the cook, sometimes the portions run small and for example the pollo diablo - sometimes its perfectly hot & spicey other times it is sooo freakin hot you'll cry twice - In & Out!!! Mind you, that is one of my favorite dishes - however, lately it just seems to vary day by day....
