Adobada was delicious, great depth of flavor in the tender saucy pork. Asada was nice too but it's hard to beat the adobada. Great salsa bar with several salsas, onion, cilantro, and lime wedges. American-taco fans have the option of crunchy shells with lettuce and cheese, but I opted for soft corn tortillas and added my own onion and cilantro at the salsa bar. Free chips and a 30-cent side of guac filled out the meal. Fresh, cheap, delicious.
