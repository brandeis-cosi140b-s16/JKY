I work in the area and we order Mi Pueblo at least once a week. I always get the shrimp tacos. They are so good! The tartar sause it comes with is so awesome. Great portions also. I've had the ceviche which surprisingly tasted like my mom makes and I've never trusted a place with making ceviche but this one is great! Another favorite around here is the Mi Pueblo Chicken salad. It's simple but the avocado dressing is mouth watering good. Their fresh chunky salsa is my favorite. Always fresh with just a little kick to it. The spicy green salsa is also very good but caution because it can be SPICY! The chips that come with for dipping are also delicious. Rice are great, black beans great, refried beans great, carne asada great also. Have not tried the enchilada style though. There's not one down side that I can think of and recommend this place to anyone. Wish I could try everything on the menu but it's hard to steer away from the Shrimp Tacos because they are the best I've had anywhere
