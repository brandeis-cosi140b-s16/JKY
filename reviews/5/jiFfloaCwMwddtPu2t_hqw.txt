My very favorite go to Mexican restaraunt. Have lived in the valley since 1988 and hands down from the friendly staff, delicious iced tea, salsa and chili rellenos to write home about this place is frickin fantastic!!! Don't let the trailer appearance scare you off, be brave you can do it! Your bravery will be well rewarded!
