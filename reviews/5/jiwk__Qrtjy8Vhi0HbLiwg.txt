WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE??!?!

I'm from a state where REAL tacos like this doesn't exist. Taco Bell?? SCREW THAT!!

This place is amazing!! Cow tongue taco?? Spicy pork taco?? Cow stomach taco?? Regular beef taco?? AMAZZING!!! but don't try the cow brain taco....yeah..it's not that great. But all the other stuff, AAAMAAZING!!!!!!!!!

And so cheap!! Only $2 per taco?? That's insane! I'm so excited thinking about this place, I wanna go back.

I WILL GO BACK!!
