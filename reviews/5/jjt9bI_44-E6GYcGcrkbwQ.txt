Cafe Carumba is absolutely one of my favorite places for breakfast. besides a great location, and those awesome brown comfy chairs we always snag, the food is out of this world. I love their veggie omelet and their french toast. Always so good and i think very reasonable in price, considering the area.

I went their for lunch once and they have the best sweet potato fries. I would recommend it for either meal. Amazing.
