Man this place is shiznit! I've been coming to this place since it first opened. The food has always been on point, fresh and very authentic overall. There are menu items you won't really find at other typical Mexican restaurants like tacos ahogados or avotacos. The staff and owners are friendly which makes me feel comfortable coming back as a customer. Although I dislike its location, it gives me a reason to even go to the mall, but it would be great if this restaurant opened other locations. As far as the food goes you can't go wrong. From the typical street tacos to the homemade rice and beans, this place is great to satisfy your Mexican food cravings. And if you're hungover, you can't go wrong with chilaquiles.
