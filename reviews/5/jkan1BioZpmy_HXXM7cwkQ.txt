If you don't try the Navajo Taco you'll never know what you missed!  I'm not a lover of Mexican food, but I've never had a lunch I didn't like at Indian Village. When volunteering for the local chamber of commerce, I always recommended this place and several folks came back to thank me for a memorable meal at a very inexpensive price.  Don't let the lack of ambiance fool you, the food is the reason this place is great.
