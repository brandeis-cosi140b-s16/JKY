My fiance and I visited this place for our first time and we were very impressed.  Upon our arrival, it appeared very busy; however, we were seated rather quickly. We waited maybe about 10 minutes to place our drink order, which was a little longer than what we expected, but when the waitress approached us, she first apologized and thanked us for our patience, of course we understood. Overall, customer service was on point. The entire staff was phenomenal and the food was delicious, as well as the live music!!!  It reminded us of Ports O' Call in San Pedro. We had such a great experience that we are going back with a big group of friends tomorrow to celebrate my finances birthday. It's a must visit.
