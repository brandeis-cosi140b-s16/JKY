Cheap drive through Mexican, and it is delicious. Me and my buddy got a 2 chicken taco combo and tostadas and a chicken chimichanga meal, then since I am a fat kid at heat decided that we should eat it all in the car.. Probably not the best idea since some of it spilled.. Regardless amazingly delicious food at a super cheap price that can't be beat. Oh and they make it all fresh and are very nice at the drive through window. Although the one downside is that the chimichanga was a tiny bit soggy on the bottom; but regardless all the other items are great, but the best is crispy shell tacos. Best part of the whole meal? The bill was $20.00!!
