I went to the Mission last week with my family and here's how our visit was:

Our waitress was Amazing! I wish I could remember her name so I could give her a shout out. She knew the menu completely and was very informative on how things were prepared and provided great suggestions on what to order which were helpful since it was hard to read the menus in the dimly lit restaurant. Our table was constantly being checked on by other employees checking on drinks and chip refills. 

I ordered a traditional mojito and my mom got the Cadillac blood orange margarita. Both were delicious and you can definitely taste the fresh ingredients used. We ordered the table side guacamole and pork shoulder tacos which were incredible and was perfect for sharing. For our main courses we ordered the green chili duck confit which was packed with various flavors and textures. The mole kinda overpowered the dish with a strong nutmeg taste but was still a great dish. My husband ordered the chorizo porchetta with white bean purée and it was fork tender and melted in your mouth, the purée was unbelievable. My mom and stepdad ordered the driver scallops and you could smell their plates from across the room. Regardless of the strong odor they said it was a very delicious plate. Our server kindly packed up our leftovers and suggested dessert options. 

Overall it was a great dinner. The restaurant was packed by the time we left and the close tables made it difficult to squeeze out of without giving the table next to you a face full of butt. 

We will definitely be back for another visit and look forward to trying different options on the menu. Thank You for providing a delicious Mexican meal that isn't just slathered in sauce and melted cheese!
