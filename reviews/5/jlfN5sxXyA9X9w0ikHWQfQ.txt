First time - and will not be our last!!!!  Great fun vibe - felt like I was on vacation!  The food was fantastic and the service was great as well.  I understand its under new ownership - I hadn't been here before but the tacos I had were fresh, the homemade chips were perfect - overall great, casual, fun place to grab a quick bite to eat!
