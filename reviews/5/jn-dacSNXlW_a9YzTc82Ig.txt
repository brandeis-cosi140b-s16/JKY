I adore the atmosphere, food staff and prices here.  I go about once a week and the owners and waiters are like friends now.  They are the nicest, most hard working people and it really shows in the resturaunt.  

The food is consistantly amazing.  I never really cared for enchiladas, quesadillas or tamales until I had El Penasco's.  There hasn't been a dish that I have tried there that I haven't loved.

Maybe the best part of the experience is the fresh tortillas and original green, mild salsa.  It comes with chips and red salsa too, but the tortillas and green salsa are amazing.  Above and beyond what can be found in other resturaunts.  

They have wonderful service with friendly, effective waiters and chefs, fantastic food and very reasonable prices.  Words cannot say how highly I recommend El Penasco.
