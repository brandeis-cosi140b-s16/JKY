I go to this place for the molcajetes omg they are so delicious. I get the seafood one with tilapia and shrimp cooked in various ways. Recently I began ordering the marlin taco as well and that's delicious too. They have the fanta drinks in the glass bottle which adds to the experience. Every time I have come from there was only 1 or 2 waitresses which seemed to be more than enough. I always feel well taken care of. I'm sure this restaurant has a lot to offer but the molcajetes are so good I don't think I'll be able to explore more of the menu
