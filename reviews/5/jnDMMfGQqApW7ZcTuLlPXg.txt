I've been here quite a few times and always had a great experience. I tacos are a la carte, so you can pick and choose which ones you want. They have a few tacos that are vegetarian, and they're really good. They have a happy hour where some of the tacos are $2. The average price per taco is between $2.50-$3.50 each. I typically eat a lot and get full off of 3-4 tacos. The beers are pretty cheap ($3.00ish) for happy hour as well. They have a wide variety of beers as well. Service is great and the staff is friendly.
