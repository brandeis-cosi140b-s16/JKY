I can't believe this gem has no reviews.  I stopped by America's Taco Shop the other night expecting something similar to what I get at El Rinconcito.  No comparison whatsoever.  The carne asada tacos here are far superior and much for sizeable.  Sure the place isn't nearly as fancy, but the food is excellent.  The owners are friendly but you will likely need to brush up on your Spanish before you go.  I love this place.
