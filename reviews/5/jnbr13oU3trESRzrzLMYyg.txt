I have enjoyed going to Cuco's every time I've been here. They waitress is always personable and smiling. The food is very fast, I usually have a basket of warm chips within a minute or two of sitting down. 

The food is always good. I've never had a bad experience. That is what usually taints an experience for me so I never want to go back, like Habanero's right down the street. But that has never happened with Cuco's Mexican. It tasted authentic and good.
