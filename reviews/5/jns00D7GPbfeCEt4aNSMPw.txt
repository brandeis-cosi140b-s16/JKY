As others have mentioned, this is a great place to get your New Mexico food experience.  We had been to Los Dos Molinos several times on the way back from Dbacks games but this was closer and wanted to try.  Turns out the owners are related.  Great cooking must run in this family because this was an awesome meal. Started with their tasty and not greasy chips with 3 sauces from mild to spicy, all great.   I had the Carnitas which can best be described as a Pork Osso Bucco.  A deliciously slow cooked Pork Shank covered in a flavorful New Mexico style Enchilada sauce served with your choice of black or pinto beans ( I got the black which are vegetarian and delicious ) as well as whole creamy potatoes and rice.  Also comes with a perfectly cooked sopapillas which were great with the honey the waitress brought us.  My wife had the Blue Corn Enchilladas made with the Adovada Pork on the named Blue tortilla with the rice and beans and a little cheese but not drowning in it.  She loved it.  Excellent presentations for both plates.  Excellent service complete with a welcome from the manager.  A definite repeat for us.
